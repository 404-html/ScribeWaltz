1
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:07.140
So let me start out by putting what I think is a relatively controversial

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.000
proposition on the table.
And that's the,

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.180
this investment management business when stripped down to its bare essentials is

4
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:21.420
really quite simple.
Now,
why do I say that?

5
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.380
I think if we took the group here today and divided you up into smaller groups

6
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:30.630
of four or five or six,

7
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.590
and ask you to talk about what's really important in managing a portfolio that

8
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.080
has a very long time horizon,

9
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.310
I think that almost all the groups would come to very similar conclusions if

10
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:50.460
you're investing with a long time horizon,

11
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.170
having an equity bias makes sense.
Stocks go up in the long run.

12
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.890
Uh,
Bob Shiller,
his friend Jeremy Siegel,

13
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.220
wrote a book that has the very simple title stocks for the long run.

14
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.270
Well,
the book is assigned.
You all know it.

15
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.640
But the other thing that I think would come out of the discussions is it

16
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:16.190
diversification is important.
I mean,
anybody who's read a basic finance tab.

17
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.650
As a matter of fact,
I think anybody who thinks about investments in a,

18
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:20.910
in a common sense,

19
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.270
fashion knows that diversification is a,
uh,

20
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.270
an important fundamental tenet of a portfolio management.

21
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.530
As a matter of fact,
Harry Harry Markowitz,
uh,

22
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.300
called diversification of free lunch,
right?

23
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:38.640
We spend all our time and intro intro ECON,

24
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.250
figuring out there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.960
but Markowitz tells us that diversification as a free lunch for any given level

26
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:49.290
of return,
you can reduce the risk for any given level of risk.

27
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:51.750
You can increase the return.
Sounds pretty good.

28
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.810
So that's pretty simple,
right?

29
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440
To tenants and equity bias for portfolios with a longtime horizon and

30
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.110
diversification.
Uh,

31
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.440
Bob mentioned in his introduction that I showed up at Yale in 1985 after

32
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:13.821
everyone spent six years on Wall Street and I was totally unencumbered by any

33
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.780
portfolio management experience.
So I thought that was pretty neat.

34
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:23.730
Here I was back at Yale with a billion dollar portfolio.

35
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:25.260
It seemed like a lot of money at the time.

36
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.690
No portfolio management experience.
What do I do?
Well,

37
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.380
one of the things that I think is a sensible thing to do in life has look around

38
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.640
at what others are doing.

39
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.910
So I looked at what colleges and universities had done in terms of asset

40
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:45.234
allocation.

41
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.570
Turns out that 50% of endowment assets in the mid 1980s were invested in common

42
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:53.814
stocks.

43
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.750
40% of endowment assets were in US bonds and and US cash and 10% in a smattering

44
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:03.460
of alternatives.

45
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.570
<v 1>Okay,</v>

46
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.560
<v 0>well I looked at that and I thought this doesn't really make a lot of sense.</v>

47
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.300
You have half of your assets in one single asset class,

48
00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:15.560
US common stocks,

49
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.520
you've got another 40% of your assets in us bonds and and cash.

50
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.820
So 90% of your portfolio is in domestic marketable securities and only 10%

51
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.240
invested in things like real estate or venture capital or private equity,

52
00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:37.030
hardly,
hardly enough to,
to,

53
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.270
to make a difference in terms of the portfolio's returns.

54
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.663
<v 1>So</v>

55
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.320
<v 0>unencumbered by,
I guess the conventional wisdom.</v>

56
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.520
We started out at Yale on a on a path that I think cause as fundamentally the

57
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.400
change the way that institutions manage portfolios.

58
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.690
A few years ago I wrote a book called pioneering portfolio management.

59
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:08.691
The reason you could put an audacious title like pioneering portfolio management

60
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:13.971
on the cover of the book was that we moved away from this traditional model with

61
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:19.461
50% in stocks and 40% in bonds and cash to something that was much more equity

62
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:25.290
oriented and,
and much more diversified.

63
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.160
And so what I'd like to do today is talk to you about how it is that we moved

64
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:36.921
from this old model to what it is that today many institutions call the the Yale

65
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:40.074
model.

66
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.350
And the way that I would like to talk about this journey that we took is by

67
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.860
looking at the tools that we have available to us as investors.

68
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.040
And these tools are the same tools that we have,

69
00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:56.940
whether we're operating as individual investors or institutional investors,

70
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.570
and describe how we employ those tools at Yale and how they let us to the

71
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:05.520
portfolio that we have today.

72
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.420
And those three tools are asset allocation,

73
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.270
market timing and security selection.

74
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.410
The first asset allocation basically deals with which assets you have in your

75
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:24.831
portfolio and in which proportion you hold each of those assets.

76
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.730
The second market timing deals with short term deviations from the longterm

77
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.280
asset allocations that you establish.

78
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.320
And the third security selection speaks to how it as you manage each of your

79
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:45.090
individual asset classes.
Are you going to hold the market portfolio index,

80
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:47.550
your assets,
match the market's results,

81
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:52.551
or are you going to manage each individual asset class actively trying to beat

82
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:57.150
the market and generate risk adjusted excess returns.

83
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.280
So let's start out with the first asset allocation.

84
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.180
I think it's pretty widely known that asset allocation is far and away the most

85
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:13.190
important tool that we have available to us as investors.
As a matter of fact,

86
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.140
it's so widely believed that asset allocation is the most important tool that I

87
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:22.640
think some people have come to the conclusion that it's some sort of law of

88
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:26.150
finance.
That asset allocation is the most important tool,

89
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.100
but it turns out that it's not a financial law.

90
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:33.590
That asset allocation takes center stage.

91
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.980
It really is more a description of how it is that we behave.

92
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.273
<v 2>Okay.</v>

93
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.690
<v 0>Yo actually has a lot more than the billion dollars that we started with in 1985</v>

94
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:47.170
I think the estimate sheet that I got yesterday morning said that we've got

95
00:06:47.171 --> 00:06:49.930
about 22 and a half billion dollars,
so that's,
that's that.

96
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.040
That's been a nice run.

97
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.970
If I went back to my office after speaking with you this morning and took Yale's

98
00:06:57.581 --> 00:07:02.530
22 and a half billion dollars and put all of it into Google stock,

99
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.850
asset allocation would have very little to say about what Yale's returns would

100
00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:08.260
be.
It's a matter of fact,

101
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:12.550
security selection would absolutely dominate the results,

102
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.470
the idiosyncratic behavior of Google stock from the time that we purchase it to

103
00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:20.260
the time that we sell,
it would define Yale's returns

104
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.780
or alternatively,

105
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.940
if I went back to the office and took yells 22 and a half billion dollars and

106
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:31.090
decided that I was going to day trade bond futures,

107
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.170
security selection wouldn't have anything to say about the returns.

108
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.930
Asset allocation wouldn't have anything to say about the returns.

109
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.820
The returns would be attributable solely to my ability to market time,

110
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.620
the bond futures market.

111
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.060
Now I'm not going to do either one of those things.

112
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:51.610
I'm not going to put Yale's entire portfolio in Google sock.

113
00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:55.270
I'm not going to go back and take Yale's entire portfolio in day trade bond

114
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:58.810
futures.
Um,
in part because it would be bad for me personally.

115
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.040
I think I would be fired as soon as people found out what it was that I was

116
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:07.480
doing with the portfolio.
And,
uh,
overwhelmingly more important.

117
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:11.920
It would be bad for the bad for the university.
It's not a rational thing to do.

118
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.060
So what will happen is that Yale will continue to hold a relatively well

119
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:26.401
diversified portfolio is defined by the range of asset classes in which it

120
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.330
invests.
And when you look at each of those individual asset classes,

121
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.350
domestic equities,
foreign equities,
bonds,
real assets,

122
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.560
absolute return and,
and,
and private equity,

123
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:41.890
each of those individual asset classes is going to be relatively well

124
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:46.891
diversified in terms of exposures to individual positions or individual

125
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:47.794
securities.

126
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.510
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

127
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.040
<v 0>And because that's true,</v>

128
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.120
then asset allocation ends up being the overwhelmingly important determinant of

129
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:04.650
the university's results because we hold relatively stable,

130
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.290
relatively well diversified portfolios.

131
00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.960
Security selection turns out not to be an important determinant of returns for

132
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:15.330
most investors and market timing.

133
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.380
It turns out not to be an important determinant of returns in the,

134
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.490
and the last man standing is asset allocation and that tends to drive both

135
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:33.210
institutional returns and individual returns.
Roger Ibbotson,
who,

136
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:34.044
uh,

137
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.430
as a colleague of Bob Schiller's and and mine at the School of Management has

138
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:43.431
done a fair amount of work studying the relative importance of these sources of

139
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:44.161
returns.

140
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:48.600
And he's come to the conclusion that over 90% of the variability of returns in

141
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:53.100
institutional portfolios is attributable to asset allocation.

142
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.340
And that's the number that I think most people here cited when they are looking

143
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:01.230
at,
uh,
Roger Ibbotson is work.

144
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:07.130
I think one of the more interesting and even simpler concepts that comes out of

145
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:12.030
his study is that more than a hundred percent of returns are defined by asset

146
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:14.430
allocation.
And how can that be true?

147
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.230
How can asset allocation and be responsible for more than 100% of investment

148
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.600
returns?
Well,

149
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:25.601
it can only be true if security selection and market timing detract from

150
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.110
institutional returns or individual returns in the aggregate and of course if

151
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:35.280
you think about it as a community,

152
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.450
the investment community is going to lose from security selection decisions,

153
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.110
right?
If security selection is a zero sum game,

154
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.981
right?

155
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:54.960
The amount by which the winner wins equals the amount by which the loser losers,

156
00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:00.050
winners and losers being defined by performance after a security selection that

157
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:03.570
has been made well that sounds like a zero sum game,

158
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:08.571
but then if you take into account that you create market impact when you trade

159
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:12.930
that you pay commissions when you trade and you frequently play pay advisors

160
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.580
substantial amounts of money,

161
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:17.940
whether their mutual fund managers are institutional fund managers,

162
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:23.150
there's this leakage from the system that causes the act of results for the

163
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:26.400
community as a whole to be negative.
Absolutely.

164
00:11:26.401 --> 00:11:28.350
The same thing is true on the market timing front.

165
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:32.780
And to the extent that you're making these short term bets against your long

166
00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:33.780
term policy,

167
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:38.781
it requires trading and trading is expensive and it's very expensive when you

168
00:11:39.571 --> 00:11:41.460
take into account not only the direct costs,

169
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:46.440
but also the costs that you pay advisors to help you help you make these

170
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:47.603
decisions.

171
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.320
So it's not surprising that asset allocation explains more than a hundred of

172
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:55.990
returns and that for the community as a whole,

173
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.140
market timing and security selection are costly and lower the,

174
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:06.550
the,
the communities aggregate investment returns and it's a little bit of a,

175
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.960
of a degression.

176
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:13.030
But one of the things that I've witnessed over the past 20 years is that the

177
00:12:13.031 --> 00:12:17.870
leakage of the
leakage from the,

178
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:18.090
the,

179
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.090
the system in terms of the returns that go to the owners of Capitol Weeki just

180
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:27.490
increased enormously.
Uh,
think about the advent of hedge funds.

181
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.350
20 or 25 years ago,
hedge funds were a blip on the radar screen.
Today,

182
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:37.351
they're very important part of the funds management framework.

183
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:43.080
While those hedge funds charge enormously more than what a,

184
00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:47.410
a standard manager of marketable securities charges.

185
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:48.850
Well that leakage,

186
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:53.851
that one and a half or 2% that you pay your hedge fund manager plus the 20% of

187
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:59.491
profits really reduces the amount of return that's available for the owners of,

188
00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:01.780
of capital.

189
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:07.200
So this idea that the difference between the returns that you would get if you

190
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:15.241
took your asset allocation and implemented it passively and the actual results

191
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:18.310
that the active investors get,

192
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:23.140
the gap between those two numbers is becoming larger and larger over time,

193
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.610
generating more and more returns for the provider of investment management

194
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:32.611
services and lower and lower returns for those that are hiring those external

195
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.200
advisors.
But to get back on track,

196
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.270
let's look at the basic

197
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.980
underpinnings to this notion that asset allocation is at the center of the

198
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.300
investor's decision making process.

199
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.960
There were two points that we talked about,

200
00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:01.960
the hypothetical points that the,
the,
the,

201
00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:06.250
that came out of these small group discussions that I,
uh,
suggested.
Uh,

202
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.140
we might think about it at the beginning of this,
uh,
of this talk.

203
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.420
First in terms of equity bias.

204
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.700
Now we're going to go back to Roger Ibbotson at the,
at the school of management.

205
00:14:18.701 --> 00:14:23.701
He did some pathbreaking work in terms of describing capital market's returns

206
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:29.480
over reasonably long periods of,
of time.
Uh,
I,

207
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:31.660
I guess you've already looked at stocks for the long run.

208
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:34.520
You've seen 200 years worth of data.
Uh,

209
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.540
Roger Ibbotson data goes back to 1925 and these are the actual numbers that we

210
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:46.771
used when we first started doing our mean variance optimization and our,

211
00:14:47.521 --> 00:14:52.160
in our simulations trying to come to conclusions about what the appropriate

212
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.340
allocations would be for,
for Yale's portfolio.

213
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.520
And I'm sure you're familiar with the drill.

214
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.520
You put a dollar into various asset classes in this case at the end of 1925 and

215
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.110
hold those asset classes for,
in this case,
81 years.

216
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:13.580
The numbers go through the end of 2006 and she put a dollar in treasury bills.

217
00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:17.150
You end up with a 19 multiple,
that sounds pretty good.

218
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:19.490
You get 19 times your money over 81 years.

219
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.560
But then if you take into account that inflation consumes a multiple of 11 and

220
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:29.000
you're an institution like Yale that consumes only after inflation returns,

221
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:33.650
putting your money into treasury bills really didn't get you very much.
Well.

222
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.520
Suppose you step out in the risk spectrum and put a dollar into the bond market

223
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:42.050
over that 81 year period,
you would have gotten a multiple of 72 well,

224
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:47.051
now we're talking some real after inflation returns that can be consumed,

225
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:53.060
but when you move from lending money to the government,

226
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:58.130
either short term with bills or longer term with bonds to investing in the

227
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:02.930
equity market,
there's a stunning difference in terms of the returns.

228
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.610
Just by putting money into a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks,

229
00:16:07.611 --> 00:16:11.300
you would've gotten 3077 times your money

230
00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:16.590
if he would've stepped further out the risk spectrum you and put your money into

231
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.330
a portfolio of small stocks,

232
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:22.530
you would have gotten 15,922 times your money.

233
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:29.180
So ownership was stocks absolutely crushes buying bonds almost 16,000 times your

234
00:16:32.851 --> 00:16:37.440
money or more than 3000 times your money in the stock market as opposed to 72

235
00:16:37.441 --> 00:16:42.441
times your money or 19 times your money in the bond market or the bill market.

236
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.280
It almost makes you wonder whether this diversification thing makes any sense.

237
00:16:49.531 --> 00:16:50.550
I mean,
why would you do that?

238
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:55.551
Why would you put any of your assets and in bonds if stocks are going to give

239
00:16:55.591 --> 00:16:58.670
you 16,000 times your money?
I mean that the,
the,
the,

240
00:16:58.671 --> 00:17:02.730
that bond multiple of 72 is just a drag on returns.
What's the point?

241
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.350
This question,

242
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:11.710
particularly in the late 1980s was very important to me personally because we

243
00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:14.460
were trying to put together,
uh,

244
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.320
a sensible portfolio for Yale and if that's sensible portfolio.

245
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.170
<v 2>Okay.</v>

246
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.880
<v 0>Just involved identifying the high risk asset class and putting all your assets</v>

247
00:17:24.881 --> 00:17:26.890
into,
let's say small stocks.

248
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.940
It wouldn't take the investment committee very long to figure out that they

249
00:17:30.941 --> 00:17:34.540
didn't need to pay me to do that.
They could do that on their own.

250
00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:35.860
And if they didn't need to pay me,

251
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.270
then I wouldn't have any income to like put food on the table for my wife and

252
00:17:40.271 --> 00:17:41.104
children.

253
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.570
So there had to be more to it than just identifying the high risk asset class

254
00:17:46.571 --> 00:17:50.040
and putting your assets and letting it rip.

255
00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:56.220
So I went back and took a closer look at Roger Ibbotson is data.

256
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.850
And there are lots of examples that will illustrate this point,

257
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:04.851
but the most dramatic occurs around the crash in October of 1929 for every

258
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:08.880
dollar that you had in small stocks at the peak of the market,

259
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:12.780
by the end of 1929 you lost 54% of your money.

260
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.360
By the end of 1930 you've lost another 38% of your money.

261
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.890
By the end of 1931 he lost another 50% and by the end of,

262
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:26.873
or by,

263
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.940
by June of 1932 he lost another 32% so for every dollar that you had at the

264
00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:37.920
peak,
the trough,
you had 10 cents left.

265
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.330
And at some point when your dollars,
we're turning into dimes,

266
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.590
you'd say,
forget this,
this is ridiculous.

267
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.800
It doesn't make any sense for me to own these risky small cap stocks and you

268
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:57.981
would sell your small stocks and put your money where either in treasury bonds

269
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:01.620
or treasury bills.
And of course,

270
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:06.621
that's what the overwhelming portion of the investment community did in the

271
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:11.460
1930s and in the 1940s.
And in the 1950s.

272
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.250
As long as there was a,

273
00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:18.251
a memory of the searing experience that people had in the equity markets around

274
00:19:19.501 --> 00:19:22.470
the time of the,
uh,
of the great crash,

275
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.140
people reacted to it by saying,
avoid this risky asset.

276
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.140
It doesn't make any sense for a fiduciary or for an individual to own these

277
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.970
risky things called stocks.
As a matter of fact,

278
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.440
I was looking at some of the contemporary,
uh,

279
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.810
literature,
the popular literature,

280
00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:46.250
and there was an article in the Saturday evening post,
uh,

281
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.650
that basically said you shouldn't call stock securities.

282
00:19:49.651 --> 00:19:51.240
That was a ridiculous thing to call them.

283
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:55.110
They should be called insecurities because they were so risky.

284
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.020
But of course this attitude came at exactly the wrong time,
right?

285
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:06.021
Because if you put a dollar into small stocks in June in 1932,

286
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:09.810
by the end of 2006,
you would have had 150,

287
00:20:09.811 --> 00:20:11.310
9,000 times your money.

288
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.970
So just at the point of maximum opportunity,

289
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.930
people were at the point of maximum bearishness about the equity markets.

290
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.560
So the takeaways are the neck whati bias is an absolutely sensible underpinning

291
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.760
for investors with long time horizons.
But that diversification is important.

292
00:20:32.761 --> 00:20:37.761
You have to limit your exposure to risky asset classes to a level that allows

293
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:44.151
you to sustain those positions even in the face of terribly adverse market

294
00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:50.650
conditions.
So let's move to the second point,

295
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:56.590
market timing.
And actually have a,
a quotation here.

296
00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.280
A few months ago,
uh,
some former students of mine,

297
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:04.150
former colleagues of mine gave this very nice party at the Yale Club.

298
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.920
And I used to teach a big lecture class,
uh,

299
00:21:08.921 --> 00:21:10.300
when I first got to Yale and the,

300
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:15.670
in the late 1980s and my last lecture always involve taking Keynes,

301
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:18.910
his general theory and quoting from it.

302
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:23.911
I think Keynes is one of the most wonderful writers about issues surrounding,

303
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:26.920
uh,
investment management.

304
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.920
And this particular copy was a pretty dogeared as a matter of fact,
uh,

305
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.780
it was a paperback copy and I think it was in about eight or 10 different
pieces.

306
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.290
And the people that threw this party remembered that.

307
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.000
And so they gave me at this celebration,

308
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.630
it made me wonder if they were trying to tell me that I should retire.

309
00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:49.150
I don't know.
It felt like a retirement party.

310
00:21:49.151 --> 00:21:52.960
I feel like I'm way too young to retire.
Um,
but,
uh,
as a,
as a gift,

311
00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:57.520
they gave me a first edition of Kansas general theory and I was coming back to

312
00:21:57.521 --> 00:22:01.270
new haven on the,
uh,
on the train afterwards.
And I came across this quote,

313
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.670
uh,
Keynes wrote that the idea of wholesale shifts is for various reasons

314
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:09.310
impracticable and indeed undesirable.

315
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.650
Most of those who attempt to sell too late and by too late and do both too often

316
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.610
and Korean heavy expenses and developing too unsettled and speculative,

317
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:22.600
a state of mind.
And he's absolutely right.
Um,

318
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.620
I wrote my first book,

319
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:30.250
I already talked about that pioneering portfolio management that deals with the

320
00:22:30.251 --> 00:22:34.960
challenges that face institutional investors.
Subsequently,

321
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:39.961
I wrote a book called unconventional success that deals with individual

322
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:43.330
investors and then unconventional success.

323
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:48.750
I did a study of individual behavior in their mutual fund purchases and sales

324
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.890
around the collapse of the Internet bubble in March of 2000 and what I did is I

325
00:22:56.561 --> 00:23:01.561
took the 10 best performing Internet funds and looked at the returns from 1997

326
00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:06.751
to 2002 and this is I think a surprising starting point.

327
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.460
If you look at the 10 best

328
00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:16.020
performing Internet funds from 97 to 2002 the time weighted return is one and a

329
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.240
half percent per year positive.

330
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.530
So the funds went way up and then they went way down.

331
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.860
But it's positive one and a half percent per year or time waited.

332
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:29.740
That's the number that you see in the prospectus or the number that you see in

333
00:23:29.741 --> 00:23:33.550
the advertisements.
So you say,
well,
what's the big deal?
No harm,
no foul.

334
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.560
Well,
there's another way to look at returns.

335
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.930
Those are the dollar weighted returns and the dollar weighted returns actually

336
00:23:40.931 --> 00:23:45.931
do a better job of describing the experience of the group of investors that

337
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:49.160
participated in these funds.
Dollar weighted,

338
00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:52.870
obviously it takes into account when the cash flows come in and,

339
00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.940
and when they go out and when you do the dollar weighted returns,

340
00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:03.161
you find out that there was 13 point $7 billion invested in these funds and the

341
00:24:07.221 --> 00:24:12.221
investors lost 9.9 billion out of the 13.7 that they committed.

342
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:20.411
So the 72% of the money that was invested in these funds was lost.

343
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:27.530
And because of the way that we deal with taxes and mutual funds,

344
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.490
you can get a tax bill for gains that were realized by the investment manager,

345
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.860
uh,
turning over the portfolio,
even though you might not have hold the,

346
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.880
held the shares during the period when the games were realized.

347
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.630
And so in addition to losing nine point $9 billion,
uh,

348
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.660
there are capital gains distributions at three point $3 billion,

349
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:50.990
representing about 24% of the money that was invested.
So,
uh,

350
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.340
adding insult to injury,

351
00:24:52.341 --> 00:24:57.341
you lost 72% of the money and then you got a tax bill for 24% of the amount that

352
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:00.410
had been put in.
Not a,
not a very happy experience.

353
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.110
After I wrote the book,

354
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.920
Morningstar did a much more comprehensive study of every single one of the

355
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.600
equity categories that they follow.
There were 17 categories of equity,

356
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:18.410
mutual funds,
and they compared the dollar weighted to the,
to,

357
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.090
to the time weighted returns.

358
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.750
And in every one of those 17 categories,

359
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.700
the dollar weighted returns were less than the time weighted returns.

360
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.350
Well,
how does that,

361
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:35.350
how does that happen on the same way that these investors in the Internet tech

362
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:40.931
funds lost their money they bought after the funds had gone up and they sold

363
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.560
after they'd gone down.
And when you buy high and sell low,

364
00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:50.360
it's really hard to generate returns even if you do it with great enthusiasm and

365
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:51.194
in great volume.

366
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:57.610
So the Morningstar study is incredibly damning in terms of the market timing

367
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.410
abilities of individual investors.

368
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.910
Systematically investors are buying after things have gone up selling after

369
00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:08.900
they've gone down.

370
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.200
And the problem is most severe in those funds that show the greatest volatility,

371
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.180
the gap in what Morningstar calls the conservative allocation fund is three

372
00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:24.290
tenths of a percent per year.
Now that's not a huge number,

373
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:29.650
but obviously when you're hoping to beat the market by a point or two losing by

374
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:32.920
three tenths of a percent per year because of your market timing,
uh,

375
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:37.190
inability is a bad thing.
But if you look at the tech fund category,

376
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.730
the difference between the dollar weighted and the time weighted returns,

377
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:44.640
this is over a 10 year period is 13.4% per annum.

378
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.010
That's stunning compound that 13.4% over 10 years.

379
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.460
And there's just an enormous gap between those mutual fund numbers that are in

380
00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:57.390
the prospectus and in the advertisement,

381
00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:02.391
the time weighted returns and the dollar weighted returns that talk about the

382
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.060
actual experience of the investment community.

383
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:12.180
So I'm not just going to pick on individual investors,

384
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:15.890
they're going to pick on in institutional investors too.
And we,

385
00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:20.850
one of the studies that I did for my first book,
pioneering portfolio management,

386
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:26.180
looked at the behavior of endowments and foundations around the crash in

387
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:30.710
October,
1987.
And I,
uh,

388
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.880
used to talk about the crash in October,
1987 without explaining what it was.

389
00:27:35.881 --> 00:27:39.360
And I do still teach,
uh,
a seminar

390
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.470
in the economics department and in the fall,

391
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.210
and I started talking about what happened in October 87.

392
00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:50.220
And I looked around the room and,
uh,

393
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.250
I realized that I think the students were three or four years old in 1987 and

394
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.690
weren't yet reading the Wall Street Journal.

395
00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.400
So just to give you a little bit of context,

396
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:06.120
the crash was really an extraordinary event.

397
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.740
According to my calculations.
It was a 25 standard deviation event.

398
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:16.710
One standard deviation happens,
one w one draw out of three,

399
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.480
two standard deviations,
one out of 23 standard deviations,
one out of a hundred.

400
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:23.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

401
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.620
<v 0>An eight standard deviation event happens once out of every 6 trillion trials</v>

402
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.140
can't come up with a number to describe the 25 standard deviation event.

403
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.490
It's just too large a number,
I think,

404
00:28:39.491 --> 00:28:43.930
for any of us to,
to really comprehend so and so.
In essence,

405
00:28:43.931 --> 00:28:48.190
this collapse in stock prices,
the one day collapse in stock prices,

406
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.690
I think in the u s the prices,
depending on which index you were looking at,

407
00:28:53.691 --> 00:28:58.100
were down 2120 2% in a single day.
And interestingly,

408
00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.700
uh,
most major markets around the world,

409
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.370
we're off by a similar magnitude.

410
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:09.560
This one day collapse and stock prices was a virtual impossibility.

411
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:11.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

412
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.330
<v 0>But of course,
this was just a change in stock prices.</v>

413
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.750
It wasn't related to any fundamental change in the economy or any fundamental

414
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:25.880
change in,
in corporate prospects.
It was just a financial event.

415
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.550
So if stock prices went down,
and by the way,

416
00:29:31.551 --> 00:29:34.250
bond prices went up,
right?
I mean,
when people were selling stocks,

417
00:29:34.251 --> 00:29:36.470
money had to go somewhere.
What went into the bond market?

418
00:29:36.471 --> 00:29:40.550
There was a huge rally in treasury bonds on October 19th,
1987.

419
00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.520
So stocks were cheaper and bonds were more expensive.

420
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.650
Well,
what do you do?
Why you buy what's cheap,
right?

421
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:55.030
And sell what's expensive.
But what did endowments and foundations do?
Well,

422
00:29:55.031 --> 00:30:00.031
if you look at the annual reports of their asset allocation in June of 1987

423
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.840
their equity allocation was higher than it had been for 15 years,
right?

424
00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:10.510
The seventies were a terrible time to invest in stocks.

425
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:16.720
A bull market had started in 1982 we were five years into this bull market.

426
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.080
People were getting excited about the fact that stocks were going up in equity

427
00:30:20.081 --> 00:30:24.520
allocations were at a 15 year high.
Of course,

428
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.600
money had to come from somewhere.
So bond allocations where it a 15 year low.

429
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:34.810
Fast forward to June 30th,
1988

430
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.360
and stock allocations had dropped and not only had they dropped,

431
00:30:40.361 --> 00:30:45.361
they dropped by more than the decline in stock prices associated with this

432
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.500
collapse in October 19th,

433
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:55.500
1987 and bond allocations had increased by more than could be explained by the

434
00:30:56.201 --> 00:30:59.140
increase in bond prices over the course of the year.

435
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.620
And so the only conclusion that you could draw is these supposedly sophisticated

436
00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:09.631
institutional investors sold stocks and November and December and January

437
00:31:11.651 --> 00:31:15.520
because they were fearful and they bought bonds

438
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.780
and not Tobar in November and December.

439
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.590
Maybe because they were fearful or maybe because they were greedy,

440
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:27.010
but the emotion ruled the decisions,

441
00:31:27.011 --> 00:31:32.011
not rational economic calculus and the costs were huge,

442
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.510
not just the immediate costs in terms of the move from,

443
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.310
from from stocks to bonds,
but it,
it,

444
00:31:40.311 --> 00:31:45.311
it took these institutions until 1993 a full six years to get their bond

445
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:50.521
allocation back down to where it had been prior to the crash in October,

446
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.780
1987 and this is in the context of one of the greatest bull markets ever.
I mean,

447
00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:59.820
you certainly have to measure the bull market from 1982 to 2000 and some people

448
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:03.880
would say that 2000 was just a blip.
And,
and,
and,

449
00:32:03.881 --> 00:32:05.050
and we're still in this bull market,

450
00:32:05.051 --> 00:32:10.051
but regardless of how you measure it for a full half a dozen years in the midst

451
00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:12.100
of this bull market,

452
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:17.020
colleges and universities were over allocated to fixed income relative to where

453
00:32:17.021 --> 00:32:19.240
they'd been in June of 1987

454
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:26.620
so the take away is to avoid market timing.
The

455
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.300
underlying driving force behind market timing decisions seems to be emotional

456
00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.940
fear,
greed,
chasing,
buying something after it's gone up.

457
00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:46.780
Disappointment and sales after something's declined as opposed to rationally

458
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.480
stepping up when something appears relatively attractive and overweighting and

459
00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:56.810
then leaning against the wind by selling something that's performed well.

460
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.560
Final source of returns,
security selection,

461
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:06.290
we've already talked about how security selection is a zero sum game,
right?

462
00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:10.490
The only way that somebody can overweight Ford Motor Company in the market has

463
00:33:10.491 --> 00:33:14.630
to have somebody have a counter position where they're underweight Ford Motor

464
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:17.660
Company and only one of those is going to be right as measured by subsequent

465
00:33:17.661 --> 00:33:18.140
performance.

466
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.080
And the amount by which the winner wins equals the amount by which the loser

467
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:24.050
loses.
But it costs a lot to play the game as matter of fact,

468
00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:26.270
it costs and increasing amount to play the game.

469
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:30.390
When you look at the fees that are paid to,
uh,

470
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.290
investment managers and hedge funds.

471
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:38.060
And so after taking into account the market impact and the commissions and the

472
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:41.750
fees,
this zero sum game becomes a negative sum game.

473
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:43.550
And when you look at the

474
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:49.550
returns for institutions,
you,

475
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:52.550
you see exactly what it is that,
that you'd expect.

476
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:57.551
Here is 10 years worth of data from the Frank Russell Corporation.

477
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:59.330
Um,

478
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:04.330
the benchmark Wilshire 5,000 for the 10 years ended June 30th,

479
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.850
2005 return,
9.9% per year.

480
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:13.630
And then the average return for the actively managed Equity Fund was 9.6% per

481
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:21.200
year.
So we're back to that 30 basis points.
Well,
okay,

482
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.420
so maybe on average institutions lose 30 basis point,

483
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:30.650
but it's kind of like Lake Wobegon,
right?

484
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.710
Where we all believe that we're better than average.

485
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:38.620
So yeah,
we're,
we're,
we're gonna overcome that 30 basis points.
That's not that,

486
00:34:38.621 --> 00:34:39.860
that's not such a big hurdle,

487
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:45.490
but there's a very important phenomenon that you need to take into account when

488
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:51.791
you look at these histories of returns that are generated by active managers.

489
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.420
And this is true whether you look at a universe of mutual fund managers that we

490
00:34:56.421 --> 00:35:00.470
might have available to us as individuals or whether it's institutional data

491
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.960
such as those that I just cited.

492
00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.200
And that concept is survivorship bias.

493
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.680
The only numbers that appear for the trailing 10 years,

494
00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:17.450
our numbers that are associated with firms that are still in business.
Right.

495
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:23.860
And there were probably a number of firms that over that 10 year period went out

496
00:35:25.971 --> 00:35:29.540
of business.
Now,
which firms do you think went out of business,

497
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.210
not the ones that are producing great results?
Right?

498
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.470
And the problem is even more severe when you're looking at mutual funds because

499
00:35:36.471 --> 00:35:39.780
there's kind of the game that mutual fund management companies play.

500
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:41.910
If they have an underperforming fund,

501
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.020
sometimes they allow it to die a dignified death.

502
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:47.600
Although that doesn't happen very often,

503
00:35:47.601 --> 00:35:51.120
that what they usually do is they take the underperforming fund and they merge

504
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:55.140
it with one that has a better track record and all of a sudden the

505
00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:58.530
underperforming funds record disappears.

506
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:03.330
And the assets are in a fund that has a,

507
00:36:03.331 --> 00:36:07.050
a better record,
a record that you can actually market.

508
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.930
And then when we look at the statistics,

509
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:14.850
all we see are a lot of assets in the fund that performed well and the

510
00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:17.910
underperforming fund that was merged out of existence isn't there anymore.

511
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:24.330
So how important is the survivorship bias?
If you look at the,
uh,

512
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.400
Frank Russell data and they and I just cited 10 year returns ending June 30th,

513
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.970
2005.
So that period started in 1996.
Well,

514
00:36:35.971 --> 00:36:40.971
in 1996 there were 307 managers that reported returns.

515
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.870
And by the time 2005 rolled around,

516
00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.640
there are only 177 managers that reported returns.

517
00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:52.590
So 130 managers disappeared.

518
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.310
Now more than 130 managers failed because in addition to survivorship bias,

519
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:00.660
there's something called backfill bias.

520
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:06.260
And that's when a new manager appears subsequent to the beginning of the 10 year

521
00:37:06.361 --> 00:37:07.194
period.

522
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:12.270
They'll put not only the new numbers in,

523
00:37:12.271 --> 00:37:17.271
but they'll take the history of the new manager and put that history into the

524
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.200
end of the database.
And which direction is that going to move the numbers?

525
00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:23.251
Well,

526
00:37:23.251 --> 00:37:26.910
that's going to inflate the numbers too because the only managers that kind of

527
00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:31.060
raised their hand and say,
Hey,
I've got this interesting new approach to,

528
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:35.790
to managing a domestic equities or whatever the asset class is.

529
00:37:35.791 --> 00:37:38.100
So the ones that have succeeded,
right?
So,

530
00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:43.101
so you've got survivorship bias taking out bad records and then you got backfill

531
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.960
bias adding good records,

532
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:51.170
and they both cause the universe of active management returns to appear to be

533
00:37:52.471 --> 00:37:57.471
better than the reality because there's a lot of in there that doesn't have

534
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:04.560
anything to do with the average experience of,
uh,
in this case,

535
00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:08.970
an institutional investor.
And sometimes the numbers can be pretty dramatic.

536
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:09.300
I mean,

537
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.440
2000 was a year of great flux in the markets because that's when the Internet

538
00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:18.420
bubble burst.
And if you looked at the domestic equity return,

539
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:23.421
the average return that was posted in 2000 it was minus 3.1% but then if you

540
00:38:25.591 --> 00:38:30.591
fast forward to 2005 and look at the average return that was posted for 2000 it

541
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:37.161
was positive 1.2% so the combination of survivorship bias and backfill bias for

542
00:38:37.691 --> 00:38:41.850
that one year made 4.3 percentage points difference,
right?

543
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.880
As reported contemporaneously in 2000 the number was minus 3.1 but if you look

544
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:52.630
at the number reported for 2005 years later,

545
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.500
because bad records of disappeared in good records had been added,

546
00:38:56.650 --> 00:39:01.650
all of a sudden the average experience for that year went up to 1.2% so this is

547
00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:06.661
incredibly important because when you look at this number that we started out

548
00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:08.171
with saying,
oh,

549
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:13.150
the benchmark was 9.9 but net of fees,

550
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:18.151
the managers on average only lost 30 basis points or three tenths of a percent

551
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:20.350
you'd say,
well that's a game.
I don't mind plain.

552
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.410
But then if you adjust for survivorship bias,

553
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:30.310
you end up concluding that the deficit wasn't three tenths of a percent,

554
00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:33.790
but the the deficit was actually two full percentage points.

555
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.520
And in a world where if you can win by a percentage point or two relative to the

556
00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:40.354
market,

557
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:45.450
to have the average B minus two full percentage points is pretty daunting.

558
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:53.430
So that's the kind of issue with survivorship bias and backfill bias in the

559
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:58.660
relatively established asset class of domestic equities,

560
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.770
the problem is even more severe.

561
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:07.850
When you look at something that's relatively new,
like the hedge fund world.
Now,

562
00:40:07.851 --> 00:40:09.040
why is that?
Well,

563
00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.100
if hedge funds first became mainstream maybe 15 years ago,

564
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.300
then what are you looking at in terms of history?

565
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:24.040
The only history that you would have had 15 years ago would have been those

566
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:26.950
funds that produce great returns,
right?

567
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.460
So it's all identified after the fact,

568
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.830
at least in the domestic equity world,

569
00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:37.060
you've got a pretty stable base that you were looking at 10 years ago.

570
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:43.080
So the survivorship bias and the backfill bias would be much,

571
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:49.150
much more of a problem in the in the hedge fund world.
Burt Malka Hill,

572
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.870
who wrote a book called a random walk down Wall Street,

573
00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:56.210
which if it's not on your reading list,
you,
you,
you,
you,

574
00:40:56.211 --> 00:41:01.211
you ought to pick up and take a look at because it's really fun to read.

575
00:41:01.991 --> 00:41:04.450
But it's also extremely insightful.

576
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.220
Took a look at survivorship bias and backfill bias in,
in the hedge fund world.

577
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
And he looked at a group of hedge funds that numbered 331 in 1996 and by 2004

578
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:24.580
eight years later,
75% of them had disappeared.

579
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:30.220
So looking at this particular group,

580
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:35.250
he estimated survivorship bias to be 4.4% per year and backfill bias to be 7.3%

581
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:41.060
per year.
So we're talking about a,

582
00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:46.061
a group of funds that in aggregate probably produced somewhere in the low teens

583
00:41:47.211 --> 00:41:52.211
returns and he's got 11.7% per year combined survivorship bias and backfill

584
00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:57.350
bias.
Roger,

585
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.140
Roger Ibbotson took a look at a larger group of funds,

586
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.860
3,500 funds over a 10 year period and found survivorship bias at 2.9% per year

587
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.190
and backfill bias at 4.6% per year.

588
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:15.910
So huge amounts of institutional funds and individual funds are going into this

589
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:18.020
hedge fund world.

590
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:24.040
You look at the returns that are reported for hedge funds in aggregate of

591
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:25.430
generally 12,
13,

592
00:42:25.431 --> 00:42:29.240
14% per year for the last five or 10 years.

593
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:35.330
And in the case of Burt molecules data more than 11% per year.

594
00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:38.390
In the case of Roger Ibbotson is data,
um,

595
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:43.480
between seven and 8% per year of those returns can be explained either by

596
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:47.330
backfill bias or survivorship bias.

597
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:49.850
If you subtract those numbers from the reported numbers,

598
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.300
the returns that the investors who are actually investing in the funds that are

599
00:42:56.481 --> 00:43:01.340
defined as part of the universe at the time are low,

600
00:43:01.341 --> 00:43:02.840
maybe mid single digits,

601
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:08.380
far less than people would expect for the amount of risk that they're taking to

602
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:15.350
be exposed to this particular group of active managers.

603
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.700
The final point that I want to make with respect to security selection actually

604
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:25.190
is a little bit different.
It has to do with the,

605
00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.570
with the degree of opportunity and this is once you've decided that you're going

606
00:43:29.571 --> 00:43:34.520
to be an active manager and try and pursue market beat beating strategies,

607
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.080
how do you decide where it is that you want to spend your time and energy?
Now?

608
00:43:39.081 --> 00:43:41.870
I think it's logical that if you're going to try and beat the markets,

609
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:44.390
you'd want to beat the markets where the opportunity was greatest.

610
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:45.650
Where's the opportunity greatest,

611
00:43:45.651 --> 00:43:49.520
the opportunities greatest where assets are at least efficiently priced.

612
00:43:49.521 --> 00:43:52.640
How do you figure out where things are at least sufficiently priced?
Well,

613
00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.640
unfortunately,
um,

614
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:59.330
financial economists don't have any direct measures of market efficiency,

615
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:05.180
but I think there's a story that you can tell about

616
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:11.330
groups of active manager returns that will help point you toward those asset

617
00:44:11.331 --> 00:44:15.920
classes that are least efficiently priced.
If,
uh,

618
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:20.950
if an asset class has constituents that are efficiently priced and it's very

619
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:24.830
hard to generate excess returns,

620
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.210
it's of if things were perfectly efficiently priced,

621
00:44:28.211 --> 00:44:30.620
it wouldn't be any opportunity to generate excess returns.

622
00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:33.300
And if you make active bets,
if you make bets against the market,

623
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.720
then whether you win or lose has to do with Loc.

624
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.160
So how are managers going to behave in an asset class where things are

625
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:44.190
efficiently priced?
Well,
they're not going to make big bets,
right?

626
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:46.650
But if they do make big bets,

627
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:49.290
maybe they get lucky once and there were twice or three times,

628
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.650
but ultimately they're luck's gonna run out and when they're luck runs out,

629
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:55.920
they'll post bad results and get fired.
Well,
how do you stay in business?

630
00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.580
You stay in business by looking a lot like the market.

631
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:07.020
So what market might be efficiently priced?
Well,

632
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:12.050
the bond markets in general and the high credit quality bonds in particular are

633
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:18.390
probably easiest to value,
right?
It's all about math,
right?
The,

634
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:20.760
in a government bond,
you don't have to worry about

635
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.730
the fault.
Uh,

636
00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.130
generally you don't have to worry about optionality or call provisions.

637
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.503
And so it's math.

638
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:35.610
You're given coupon payments every six months and then when the bond matures you

639
00:45:35.971 --> 00:45:36.840
get your money back.

640
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:41.400
So there's not a lot of room and the government bond market or other high

641
00:45:41.401 --> 00:45:45.270
quality bond markets to generate excess returns.

642
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.660
How about the other end of the spectrum?
Well,

643
00:45:48.661 --> 00:45:53.661
the other end of the spectrum is a market that is very hard to define.

644
00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:54.960
As matter of fact,

645
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.960
there might not even be a benchmark against which you can measure results and

646
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.600
you'd think about the venture capital world,
right?
I mean,

647
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:08.250
how do you hug the market in the venture capital world?

648
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:10.680
You can't,
it's very addicting.
Idiosyncratic.

649
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.500
If you're doing early stage venture investing,

650
00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:18.501
you're backing entrepreneurs and ideas and they're operating out of their

651
00:46:19.051 --> 00:46:20.290
garage.
I mean the,
the,
the,

652
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:25.300
this romantic notion of what goes on in Silicon Valley actually still holds true

653
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:30.180
in a lot of cases.
But there's absolutely no way as a venture capital investor,

654
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.060
you could index the venture capital market.

655
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:39.260
So if you look at the behavior of groups of active managers and the dispersion

656
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:41.731
of returns,

657
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:46.731
I think it gives you some idea of what the efficiency is with which assets in

658
00:46:48.301 --> 00:46:53.250
these individual asset classes are priced.
And just as I foreshadowed,

659
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.300
if you look at the difference between the first and third core tile in the bond

660
00:46:57.301 --> 00:46:58.134
market,

661
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.930
these are active returns over a 10 year period.
Again,

662
00:47:03.931 --> 00:47:06.660
ending June 30th,
2005 and the fixed income market,

663
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:10.200
the difference between first and third core tile is a half a percent per annum.

664
00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:15.990
That's an incredibly tight distribution of returns,

665
00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.041
right?

666
00:47:17.041 --> 00:47:22.041
Half of the returns are within a spread of a half a percent.

667
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.710
And then as you move out to the equity markets where it's harder to price things

668
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:33.550
as efficiently,
large cap stocks,
there's two full percentage points.
First,

669
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:35.050
the third courthouse,

670
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.570
small cap stocks are tougher to price than large cap stocks.

671
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:42.430
So there's a 4.7 percentage point differential.
First to third quartile,

672
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.660
the hedge fund world,
uh,
7.1% first.

673
00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:51.340
The third core tile real estate,
9.3% per annum.

674
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:55.580
Leverage buyouts,
13.7% per annum.

675
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:59.260
This is over a 10 year periods and now we're starting to talk some pretty

676
00:47:59.261 --> 00:48:02.680
significant dispersion and of course in the venture capital world,

677
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.260
the least efficiently priced of all,

678
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:10.740
there's a 43.2 percentage point differential between the top core tile in the

679
00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:11.704
bottom core tile.

680
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:17.620
So if I'm going to be active in terms of managing my portfolio,

681
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.240
should I spend my time and energy trying to beat the bond market where even if

682
00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:25.120
you can find somebody who's going to be a first core tile manager,

683
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:29.320
there's almost no difference between the first core tile returned in the third

684
00:48:29.321 --> 00:48:30.030
core tile return.

685
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:34.510
Or should I spend my time and energy trying to find a top core tile bond man,

686
00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.210
top core tile real estate manager or buyout manager or venture capital manager?

687
00:48:40.211 --> 00:48:42.070
I think the,
the,
the,
the answer is pretty obvious.

688
00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:47.071
You want to spend your time and energy pursuing the most inefficiently priced

689
00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:52.510
asset classes because there's an enormous reward for identifying the top core

690
00:48:52.511 --> 00:48:57.511
tile venture capitalists and almost no reward for being in the top core tile of

691
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:01.060
a high quality bond universe.

692
00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.060
So the overall conclusions are that with respect to asset allocation,

693
00:49:07.090 --> 00:49:12.090
you want to create an equity oriented diversified portfolio with regard to

694
00:49:12.791 --> 00:49:14.860
market timing.
You don't want to do it.

695
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.550
And with respect to security selection,

696
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:24.270
you want to consider your skills and you want to consider the efficiency of

697
00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:28.990
markets when you're making your decisions as to whether or not to pursue passive

698
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:31.090
management or active management.

699
00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.270
So where did this lead us in terms of of Yale's portfolio,

700
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:43.510
our current portfolio has 11% allocated to domestic equities,

701
00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.260
15% to foreign equities,
and 4% to bonds.

702
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:52.570
So traditional marketable securities account for 30% of assets.

703
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.030
The absolute return portfolio,

704
00:49:55.031 --> 00:50:00.031
which is a group of hedge funds that strive to produce fundamentally

705
00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:01.570
uncorrelated returns.

706
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:06.460
Accounts for 23% of assets are real assets portfolio,

707
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:07.870
which includes timber,

708
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:13.170
oil and gas and real estate amounts to 28% of the portfolio and private equity,

709
00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:19.750
which includes venture capital in leverage buyouts is 19% of assets.

710
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:24.670
So 70% of the portfolio is in absolute return.

711
00:50:24.671 --> 00:50:27.830
Real assets,
private equity alternatives,
broadly defined.

712
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:33.710
And if you take this portfolio and

713
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:40.450
apply the tests that we articulated at the outset of the lecture today,

714
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:47.750
Equity Orientation and diversification,
the portfolio is clearly equity oriented.

715
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:53.230
A 96% of assets are invested in some type of vehicle that we would expect to

716
00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:59.390
generate equity like returns over a reasonably long periods of time.

717
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:01.580
In terms of diversification,

718
00:51:01.581 --> 00:51:06.581
there are half a dozen asset classes with weights that range between 4% and 28%

719
00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:09.750
and so if you just came down and,

720
00:51:09.751 --> 00:51:14.751
and took a look at that and compared it to 50% in domestic stocks and 40% in

721
00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:21.080
domestic bonds and cash and 10% in a smattering alternatives,

722
00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:23.900
you'd say that this is really a much,

723
00:51:23.901 --> 00:51:28.550
much better a diversified portfolio.
Then the one with which we started

724
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:35.470
and the results of they been okay over the past 20 years,

725
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:41.360
we've generated a 15.6% per annum return.

726
00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:47.240
But that headline number obviously has a lot to do with the equity orientation

727
00:51:47.241 --> 00:51:48.320
of the portfolio,

728
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:53.780
but doesn't describe the importance of the diversification.

729
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:59.590
We've had no down years since 1987 and 1987 that was the,

730
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:05.210
uh,
uh,
the crash in October that I,
that I talked about earlier.

731
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:10.730
And in that year we were early on in terms of diversifying the portfolio.

732
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:15.150
Right.
We'd only been,
um,
working on that program for,

733
00:52:15.151 --> 00:52:16.250
for two years.

734
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:21.020
And even so the negative return was less than 1%.
So it was a,

735
00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:22.460
it was a modest negative return.

736
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.810
Probably a more important test of the portfolio was what happened around the

737
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:31.811
collapse of the Internet bubble in 2000 and in 2000 and the year ended June

738
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.750
30th,

739
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:40.750
2001 and 2002 returns for institutional investors were on average,

740
00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.160
uh,
negative in both of those years.

741
00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:50.930
And actually in every year since 1987,
yellow has had positive returns.

742
00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.320
So the,
the equity orientation drove the returns,

743
00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:59.321
but the diversification allowed us to deliver those returns in a stable fashion,

744
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:06.610
which is incredibly important for an institution like Yale that requires a

745
00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:11.000
steady supply of funds to finance it's operations.

746
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:13.580
When I started in 1985,

747
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:17.150
the distribution to the operating budget was 45 million.

748
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:22.460
That represented 10% of revenues and that was the lowest level.

749
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.330
Um,
for the century,

750
00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.930
the entire 20th century,
10% of a,
of revenues,

751
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.600
the amount that we're

752
00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:39.930
spending for the year ended June 30 2008,
it's 843 million.

753
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:45.650
That represents 37% of revenues and we're projecting expenditures for the

754
00:53:47.701 --> 00:53:50.250
following year of 1,000,000,100 and 50 million,

755
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:53.220
which will be about 45% of revenues.

756
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:59.630
So the results have been really quite extraordinary.

757
00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:04.740
My favorite way to measure the results is actually to compare what Yale achieved

758
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:11.090
with what we would have had if we would have just experienced average returns

759
00:54:12.391 --> 00:54:14.340
over the,
over the past 20 years.

760
00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:18.810
And the difference between the average return for colleges and universities and

761
00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:23.811
Yale's returns has added 14 point $4 billion to the university's coffers.

762
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:29.540
And whether you measure it in terms of dollars value added or in terms of,

763
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:30.400
uh,

764
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.400
returns yell has the best record among colleges and universities for the,

765
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:36.960
for the past two decades.

766
00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:38.663
<v 1>MMM.</v>

767
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:43.650
<v 0>So with that,
I'd be happy to take any questions that you might have.</v>

768
00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:02.950
The question is,
if a group of Gailey's started a hedge fund,

769
00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.780
what would they have to do to convince me to,
uh,
invest in them?

770
00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:13.810
One of the things that we've done over the years has been open minded about

771
00:55:13.961 --> 00:55:18.961
backing groups that don't have a traditional investment credentials.

772
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:19.540
If you,

773
00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:24.430
if you went to a corporate pension plan or a state pension manager,

774
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.180
they'd have a very bureaucratic process,

775
00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.690
probably a 50 or a hundred page questionnaire that you had to fill out.

776
00:55:31.691 --> 00:55:34.080
You'd have to deal with a consultancy,

777
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:38.260
you'd have to have 10 years or five years worth of audited performance

778
00:55:38.261 --> 00:55:41.410
statistics.
We tend to think that that's not the

779
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:48.150
richest a pond within a w w w w w within which we,

780
00:55:50.981 --> 00:55:52.990
we,
we,
we should fish.
We,

781
00:55:52.991 --> 00:55:57.991
we think that the more interesting investment opportunities are kind of outside

782
00:55:59.051 --> 00:55:59.661
of the,
the,
the,

783
00:55:59.661 --> 00:56:04.661
the mainstream with more entrepreneurial firms and ones that might have less,

784
00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:07.960
less traditional backgrounds.
That said,

785
00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:14.280
we just don't take flyers on people that we think have interesting resumes.

786
00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:19.471
We want to have a demonstrated ability to operate in the markets that the,

787
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:21.520
uh,

788
00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:26.520
investment management firm is suggesting that we back them.

789
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.640
And I would say part of what we look at

790
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:35.080
our hard quantitative factors,

791
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:39.050
but probably more important than the,
than the numbers are the,
the,

792
00:56:39.051 --> 00:56:43.140
the soft qualitative attributes.
Eh,

793
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:49.420
it's almost like what you look for in a boy scout or girl scout right?

794
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:51.250
You want people of high integrity,

795
00:56:52.030 --> 00:56:56.230
you don't want people of unimpeachable character.

796
00:56:56.231 --> 00:57:00.760
You want people that are,
are smart,
incredibly hard working.

797
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.100
And in the investment world,

798
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:07.480
you want somebody who's really obsessed with the markets.
I mean,

799
00:57:07.481 --> 00:57:10.540
somebody is somebody who,
uh,

800
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:15.990
doesn't define winning by getting as rich as they possibly can because if that's

801
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:20.110
there,
if that's their goal,

802
00:57:20.111 --> 00:57:23.650
they're all sorts of things that they can do to get rich that don't have

803
00:57:23.651 --> 00:57:27.250
anything to do with generating investment returns.
We want people who are,

804
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:30.460
are maniacally focused on beating the markets,

805
00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.850
generating superior investment returns.
And that's a,

806
00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:38.610
that's an incredibly important distinction because,
uh,
think about it.
If I,

807
00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.110
if,
if you,
what you want to do is get rich,

808
00:57:41.111 --> 00:57:45.370
he can put together a reasonable investment record and then raise staggering

809
00:57:45.371 --> 00:57:49.150
amounts of money,
size of the enemy of performance,
right?

810
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:53.950
So that staggering amount of money then impairs the fund manager's ability to

811
00:57:53.951 --> 00:57:56.830
continue generating excellent returns,

812
00:57:56.831 --> 00:58:00.940
but they can stay in business and collect the fees that they get for having this

813
00:58:00.941 --> 00:58:01.774
huge pile of money.

814
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:07.920
The type of manager we're looking for is somebody who strives to generate

815
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.000
excellent returns and they'll frequently,
uh,

816
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:17.610
raise modest amounts of money and close to new investors.

817
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:19.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

818
00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.920
<v 0>Measuring their success by beating the market,</v>

819
00:58:21.921 --> 00:58:26.150
not by generating huge flows of,
of fees for themselves.

820
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.530
So it's a combination of,
uh,

821
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:33.540
of looking at kind of objective attributes and a subjective characteristics and,

822
00:58:33.921 --> 00:58:38.120
and,
and finding people who ultimately will be good,
good partners for the,

823
00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.080
for the university.

824
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

825
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:52.900
<v 0>Yeah.
The,
the,
the question is how we've dealt with a decline in,
in,
in,</v>

826
00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:57.960
in housing prices and we don't have really much of any direct exposure to,

827
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:05.260
uh,
home builders or to the housing industry.

828
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:09.850
Most of our real estate exposure is institutional,

829
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:14.850
uh,
acquisitions of office buildings,
uh,

830
00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:19.010
largely in major markets,
central business district.

831
00:59:19.011 --> 00:59:21.100
So you'd find a,

832
00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:25.940
with interests in office buildings in New York,
Washington,
DC,

833
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:29.420
Chicago,
San Francisco,
Los Angeles,

834
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:34.220
some in secondary markets as well,
but,
um,
predominantly and,

835
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:39.080
um,
large metropolitan downtown areas.
There's also some,

836
00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:43.760
um,
hotel investments,
retail properties,
um,

837
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:49.130
smattering of industrial properties.
Not a lot of,
uh,
exposure to,
um,

838
00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.310
individual houses.

839
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:55.940
The only way that we would get that occasionally it would be through some sort

840
00:59:55.941 --> 00:59:58.850
of lot financing,
uh,
activities.

841
00:59:58.851 --> 01:00:02.490
But that's not something that I've generally liked.
I,

842
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:06.830
I don't think the housing industry in general is a good place to be because of

843
01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:10.610
it's,
um,
sometimes violence cyclicality.

844
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:14.280
We did have,
um,
uh,

845
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:19.060
a large short position,
um,

846
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.500
in subprime mortgage back securities,

847
01:00:21.501 --> 01:00:26.501
which is paid off enormously for the university and really helped protect assets

848
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:31.430
in the past nine months or,
or a year and a,

849
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:34.610
yeah,
I think that the,
that generally speaking and,

850
01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:38.900
and Bob Shiller can speak to this a lot with a lot more authority than I can.

851
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:44.410
This bubble was not something that showed a surprise people and I thought the

852
01:00:44.481 --> 01:00:48.680
university positioned itself well to take advantage of this.

853
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:54.050
I'm really not surprising a collapse in housing prices.

854
01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:00.830
Isn't that market timing?
I mean it all depends on uh,

855
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:06.110
uh,
your perspective.
Um,

856
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:11.770
I think market timing as I've defined it has to do with short term deviations

857
01:01:16.251 --> 01:01:18.290
from,
from your longterm policy targets.

858
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:23.150
So I mentioned that our domestic equity target was 11%.

859
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.780
If I came to the office,
uh,
yeah,

860
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.190
next week and decided domestic stocks were too high,

861
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:33.880
I want to move that target down to 8% in,

862
01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:37.160
in the way that I've described market timing.
That would be a market timing move.

863
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:42.370
And we're very careful not to do that.
We,
we,

864
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:46.580
we established these,
uh,
targets.
We review them once a year.

865
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.120
We don't make changes in many years.
They're there,

866
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.890
they're quite stable.
And,
um,
when we do move them,

867
01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:56.420
we don't move them by a lot.

868
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:01.580
But that doesn't mean that we don't manage the,
the,
the portfolio actively.

869
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:06.350
So if we see areas that are particularly interesting,

870
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:10.720
uh,
we're more than happy to deploy capital,
uh,

871
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:16.150
to take advantage of what we think are cheap assets or expensive assets.

872
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.320
Uh,
we made a big bet against,
um,

873
01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:24.720
Internet stocks in 1999 and in 2000 that was very profitable for the university.

874
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.370
Um,
as I mentioned,
there was a,
a big bet,
um,

875
01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:34.490
that credit spreads both in mortgages and in corporates were way too narrow in

876
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:39.540
the past couple of years and that we thought that

877
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.920
if they were priced rationally,
those spreads would widen.

878
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:46.110
And we put ourselves in a position to profit from that.

879
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:50.170
And today we're looking at opportunities in,
in,
um,

880
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.140
distress securities.

881
01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:57.650
A lot of these loans that were made in 2005 and 2006 and early in 2007 were made

882
01:02:59.551 --> 01:03:01.290
at a very,
very narrow spreads.

883
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:04.110
And there are opportunities out there to buy bank loans,

884
01:03:04.111 --> 01:03:07.150
which are at the very top of the capital structure,
uh,

885
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:12.180
that we believe will be money,
good for prices in the,

886
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.600
in the 80s.
Right.
And if it turns out that their money good,

887
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:19.470
you get your interest and you get a,
you know,

888
01:03:19.471 --> 01:03:22.800
a dollar for every 85 cents that you've invested in a,

889
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:27.780
in a few years.
So if Marco topper offer us opportunities,

890
01:03:27.781 --> 01:03:32.100
we're more than happy to,
to,
to,
to take advantage of them.
Um,

891
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.330
so we,
we,
we will make a valuation.

892
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:44.700
Bats W W W we'll look at things.
Sectors say they're cheap or expensive and,
and,

893
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:45.900
and exploit the opportunity.

894
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:50.310
But at least in terms of how I defined market timing,

895
01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:55.110
it wouldn't be included in that.
Um,
it wouldn't be included in that definition.

896
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.353
<v 1>Okay.</v>

897
01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:14.590
<v 0>Uh,
the,
the,
the first question is,
um,
what's the,</v>

898
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:18.360
the Beta of the yell portfolio.
And that's not,

899
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:20.880
that's not a way that we really think about it,

900
01:04:20.881 --> 01:04:25.881
but I do believe that the risk level of the university's portfolio is really

901
01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.040
quite low in statistical terms,

902
01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:33.540
much lower than the risk level that you'd have if you had a traditional,
uh,

903
01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.150
portfolio dominated by marketable securities.

904
01:04:36.151 --> 01:04:41.040
And the reason it's slow is that we do have,
what I think is,

905
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:44.280
is superior diversification and,
and that,

906
01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:47.070
that really lowers the university's risk.

907
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:48.930
A lot of people look at Yale's portfolio and say,
oh,

908
01:04:48.931 --> 01:04:53.931
it's risky because you've got venture capital and you've got timber and you have

909
01:04:54.661 --> 01:04:58.110
all these things that,
that,
that,
that you might believe are individually risky.

910
01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:01.590
But part of the magic of diversification is if you've got things that are

911
01:05:01.591 --> 01:05:05.880
individually risky but they're not well correlated one to another,

912
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.160
the overall portfolio risk level is quite low.

913
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.790
So I believe that we have quite a low risk,
uh,

914
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:14.670
portfolio.
Uh,

915
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:19.671
the second part of the question dealt with the changes in our exposure to a

916
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:25.880
foreign assets and that's an area that we've been very interested in.
Our,

917
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.960
our foreign exposure is not limited to the marketable security exposure,

918
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:34.210
which I cited as being 15% of the fund,

919
01:05:34.211 --> 01:05:36.970
but there's foreign exposure in real estate.

920
01:05:36.971 --> 01:05:38.530
There's foreign exposure and leverage buyouts.

921
01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:42.710
There's foreign exposure in venture capital.
Uh,
it's,
uh,
something that,

922
01:05:42.711 --> 01:05:44.160
that permeates the,

923
01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:49.250
the portfolio and I think provides really interesting investment opportunities

924
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:53.170
because a lot of the foreign markets are or less efficiently priced than those

925
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:56.530
that you find.
And um,
the,
the,
the,

926
01:05:56.531 --> 01:06:00.560
the u s and I think the,
uh,
uh,

927
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:06.250
fact that our foreign investments are generally denominated in currencies other

928
01:06:06.251 --> 01:06:11.251
than the dollar is also attractive to a good diversifying a tool for the

929
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:12.184
university.

930
01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:22.943
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

931
01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:30.110
<v 0>The question was whether we were looking to take more short positions as the</v>

932
01:06:31.171 --> 01:06:34.650
economy appears to be moving into recession.
And,
and,

933
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:39.710
and I guess the second part of the question was how do you remain bullish in

934
01:06:40.051 --> 01:06:43.610
this,
in this kind of environment?
And I think the,
the,

935
01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:48.620
the best answer to that is a quote from one of my contemporaries.

936
01:06:48.751 --> 01:06:51.870
So I think it's one of the,
one of the best investment managers out there,

937
01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:57.270
a guy named Seth Klarman who,
um,
works at,
uh,
a fund in Boston called Bob Post.

938
01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:02.930
And Seth said that what he does his worries top down and invest bottom up.

939
01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.130
So I read the Wall Street Journal every morning and I worry about the credit

940
01:07:08.131 --> 01:07:11.820
crisis and I worry about credit cards and I worry about auto loans and I worry

941
01:07:11.821 --> 01:07:16.080
about corporate loans and I worry about the solvency of the banking system.

942
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:20.370
And then I go to work and I try and find the best opportunities that I possibly

943
01:07:20.371 --> 01:07:23.340
can.
So,
uh,
you,
you,
you,
you,

944
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.370
the worrying top down helps because you,

945
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:31.080
you don't want to put yourself in a position where,
um,

946
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:36.560
you're going to get hurt by some adverse macro sectoral circumstance,

947
01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:46.340
but there's no way that you can take,

948
01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.580
you know,
22 and a half billion dollars and

949
01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.890
be in the markets when they're attractive and out of the markets when they're

950
01:07:55.891 --> 01:07:59.820
not attractive.
So you'd just say,
okay,
fine.
This is the,
the,
the,

951
01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:03.390
the macro circumstance that we're dealing with and we're going to do absolutely

952
01:08:03.391 --> 01:08:04.740
the best job we can.

953
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:10.130
Identifying individual specific bottom up opportunities to deploy the funds.

954
01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.420
<v 1>How can you,
um,</v>

955
01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.310
that says [inaudible] the bottom without hedging that lie?

956
01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:39.590
What is the client?

957
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:45.350
<v 0>Well,
I think one of the question,
the question is how,</v>

958
01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.370
how can you successfully invest in a,

959
01:08:50.371 --> 01:08:51.870
in a market where,

960
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.860
I guess what people say is you might catch a falling knife,
right?

961
01:08:55.861 --> 01:08:58.530
You buy something that's down 30%,

962
01:08:58.531 --> 01:09:01.710
but it's got another 50% to,
to go.

963
01:09:01.711 --> 01:09:05.280
And I think it just has to do with w w with time horizon,

964
01:09:05.281 --> 01:09:07.820
particularly if you have a value orientation,
uh,

965
01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:12.830
you tend to buy things early and if you bought them with a good sound

966
01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:18.830
fundamental investment case and prices are down from where you made your

967
01:09:19.771 --> 01:09:21.240
purchase,
uh,

968
01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:26.270
have enough dry powder so that you can purchase some more at the now lower

969
01:09:27.151 --> 01:09:29.670
price,
but have enough confidence in your,

970
01:09:29.671 --> 01:09:34.360
in your thesis to be able to hold the position through the decline and,

971
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:39.060
and wait for the markets to recognize the value that,
that you identified.

972
01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.000
Uh,

973
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I think one of the most pervasive problems in the financial markets is

974
01:09:47.641 --> 01:09:50.880
investment with too short a time horizon.
I mean,

975
01:09:51.090 --> 01:09:55.200
the fact that people look at quarterly returns of mutual funds is incredibly

976
01:09:55.201 --> 01:09:56.520
dysfunctional.
I mean,

977
01:09:56.521 --> 01:10:00.660
there's no way that you can expect somebody quarter in and quarter out our month

978
01:10:00.661 --> 01:10:03.480
in and month out to produce superior returns.

979
01:10:03.481 --> 01:10:08.481
There just aren't pricing anomalies that are significant that are going to

980
01:10:08.941 --> 01:10:13.941
resolve themselves in a matter of months or weeks.

981
01:10:14.221 --> 01:10:17.250
And,
and so it's a silly game to play.

982
01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:20.760
So by extending your time horizon two,

983
01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.610
three years or four years or five years,

984
01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:28.110
it opens up a whole host of investment opportunities that aren't available to

985
01:10:28.111 --> 01:10:32.220
people that are playing this silly short term game.
And so it,

986
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:37.360
it's not a big deal to buy something at a price that you think is a attractive,

987
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:44.730
have a go down 20 or 30 or 40% that ought to be almost a positive thing because

988
01:10:44.731 --> 01:10:47.580
you get a chance to add to the position that even lower prices,

989
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:52.890
as long as you're ultimately right,
that sometime in the three or five,

990
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:54.420
four or five year time horizon,

991
01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:59.421
you have your investment thesis proves out and you're ultimately able to exit

992
01:10:59.551 --> 01:11:00.660
the position at a profit.

993
01:11:07.150 --> 01:11:07.983
<v 1>Okay.</v>

994
01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:12.390
<v 0>Oh,
the,
the,
the questions about housing indexes.
I'll do,</v>

995
01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:14.100
I'll defer those to Bob Schiller.

996
01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:17.460
I couldn't answer a question like that in front of him.

997
01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.290
Great.
Thank you very much.
