1
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.000
Well,
I have the pleasure of introducing to you today,

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.770
Stephen Schwarzman,
who has kindly agreed to lecturer class.

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.130
Uh,
Mr Schwartzman,
uh,

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.970
graduated from Yale in 1969.

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
He was at Davenport College.
Do we have any Davenport people here?

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.840
And a few,
not,
not a lot.
Uh,

7
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.910
he graduated then from a Harvard Business School in 1972.

8
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.530
Uh,
he worked at Lehman Brothers,
um,
as,

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.980
I don't think it was his first job or one of his first jobs,
uh,

10
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:45.650
and became managing director at Lehman Brothers at age 31.
Uh,

11
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.660
and he became head of their global mergers and acquisitions team in 1985.

12
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.210
Uh,
Mr Schwartzman,
uh,

13
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.990
with Peter Peterson founded the Blackstone group,

14
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.700
which has become the lead manager of alternative assets.

15
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.770
Uh,
in some sense what he does and what,
uh,
David Swensen does,

16
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:11.640
whom we had heard from earlier this semester is similar.

17
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.670
They're both looking at unusual and different investment assets.

18
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.530
Uh,
and they are both very successful.
And doing this,

19
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.410
uh,
Mr Schwartzman's firm has,
uh,

20
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.510
had a return on private equity investments of 23% a year,

21
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.940
uh,
for the last,
on average for the last 20 years.
Uh,

22
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.510
this is,
uh,
a little bit in excess of David Swenson,

23
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.580
but I think we have to put them both as a remarkable,
uh,

24
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.620
investors in the real estate group at Blackstone,

25
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.920
they've had 30% a year for the last 15% for the last 15 years.

26
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.080
And this is after fees.
Uh,
so,
um,
uh,

27
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.310
Blackstone group has been very much in the news recently.

28
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.780
It just came out,
um,
that,
uh,
they are,
uh,

29
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.790
apparently they're going to be buying a 12 point $5 billion of leveraged loans

30
00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:19.080
from Citi Group,
uh,
at,
at a steep discount.

31
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.920
Uh,
and so currently they've seen a profit opportunity there,

32
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.140
or they're supporting our economy from the ravages of the subprime crisis.

33
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.370
Also,
in the news,

34
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:34.371
China has announced that it plans to buy $3 billion stake in Blackstone group,

35
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.720
uh,
as,
uh,
it's first a effort to diversify.

36
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:44.130
It's a one point $2 trillion of foreign exchange reserves.

37
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.340
So the Blackstone group was picked by the Chinese government as the most fitting

38
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.360
place for it to put.
Some of it's a reserves.
So with that,
I will,

39
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.200
uh,
leave it to Mr Schwarzman who will speak,
uh,
for a while.

40
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.320
<v 1>Thank you very much for coming out on a,
what's a bit of a dreary,</v>

41
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.240
uh,
slightly rainy morning,
uh,
when I was in a,

42
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.800
an undergraduate,
uh,
we wouldn't have gotten much of an attendance.

43
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.040
People would've been sleeping in.
Uh,
so,
uh,
it's,

44
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:22.600
it's awful nice of you to be here.
Uh,
there,
there,

45
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:25.230
there are some dramatic differences,
uh,

46
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.810
from when I was an undergraduate and you are a,

47
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.900
one of the first differences is that this course wouldn't have existed because

48
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:38.270
no one had an interest in finance.
Uh,
uh,

49
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.140
at that time I wasn't a particularly interesting,
uh,
uh,

50
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.670
time,
uh,
in the,
in the 1960s,
uh,

51
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.880
the securities markets a actually we're,
we're,
we're regulated,
uh,
you know,

52
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:56.470
commissions were fixed on the New York Stock Exchange.

53
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.380
So it was very difficult to find some way to compete.

54
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:04.360
It was sort of a rig system,
if you will.
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
you know,

55
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.230
it wasn't,
wasn't open.
Uh,
and,
uh,
and,

56
00:04:08.231 --> 00:04:13.120
and so there was very little to no interest,
uh,
really,

57
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.560
uh,
in,
uh,
uh,
finance,
uh,
uh,
you know,
there,
there,
there,

58
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:22.480
there really wasn't,
uh,
a,
uh,
uh,
an som,
uh,

59
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.070
uh,
school of Management,
uh,
uh,
at Yale,
uh,

60
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.250
at that point,
uh,
uh,
business,
uh,

61
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:34.060
generally was utterly unfashionable.
Uh,

62
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:39.000
we were in the midst of the Vietnam War.
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

63
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.720
business was a sort of linked to the perception of that war because they

64
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:47.590
supplied,
you know,
certain types of,
uh,
uh,
you know,

65
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:49.910
a warm materials and,
and that was the,

66
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.680
the most unfashionable thing that you could be involved with.

67
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.910
So there was a very antibusiness,
uh,
uh,

68
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.430
non-existent finance orientation,
uh,
at,

69
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:07.170
at the school.
And obviously that's changed in the society,
uh,
uh,

70
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.040
generally with,
uh,
enormous,
uh,
uh,
differences.
And,

71
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:14.530
and as a result of when I grew up,
uh,

72
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:18.610
I didn't even take an economics course at Yale.
I,

73
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.910
I frankly wasn't much good with math.
Uh,
I,

74
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.880
I stopped in the 11th grade and,
um,
you know,
I,
I,

75
00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:27.640
I think calculus was,

76
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.060
was for me that was way too much of a reach.

77
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.540
So I'm more in the add,
subtract,
multiply,

78
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:37.750
and divide kind of a category a which,

79
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.610
which worked and still does,
uh,
you know,
uh,
quite well,

80
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.200
uh,
for me.
And,
uh,
when,
when,
when I graduated,
um,

81
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.330
I was lucky enough to get a job at,
uh,
at a,
uh,

82
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.140
a firm that had just gone public.

83
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:56.980
It was the first New York Stock Exchange firm that had just gone public.

84
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.600
It was called Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,

85
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.970
Bill Donaldson actually founded the School of Management,
uh,
uh,

86
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.950
after he left.
Uh,
Dlj,
uh,
and,

87
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.620
and that was because this is a financial markets course that,

88
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.210
that was quite interesting for me because I,
I didn't even know what,

89
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.900
what common stock was,
uh,
when,
when I graduated,
uh,

90
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.150
hopefully you will have learned more in this course.
And,
and I,
I went to deal,

91
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.770
Jack couldn't read a financial statement,

92
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:30.830
which is like going to a foreign country,
not being able to speak a language.

93
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:32.840
It was sort of hopeless.
Uh,
but,

94
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.370
but one of the interesting experiences I had a about which,

95
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:41.370
which really now that I'm a little bit older and can look backwards,
uh,
on,

96
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.900
on financial markets,
uh,
it was,

97
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:48.150
was my first visit to accompany and Dlj basically is,

98
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.720
was one of the first large institutional stock managers,
uh,
uh,

99
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.720
of a pension fund assets and so forth.
And,
um,
um,

100
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.390
I was allowed to go and interview,
uh,
a,
uh,
uh,

101
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.490
a company I'd never interviewed a company executive.

102
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:09.290
And I read their annual report and I went up to see this,
uh,
gentlemen,

103
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.070
uh,
and,
um,
uh,
and,
uh,
I,

104
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.300
I sat there and I figured out all the things I'd want to know so that,

105
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.340
so that I could figure out whether I should buy his stock or invest in his

106
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.540
company.

107
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.540
And I went through my list of questions and he wouldn't answer most of them.

108
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.230
And,
uh,
I,
I,

109
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.020
I found it a very frustrating experience.
And I,

110
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:42.150
I went back to the office and by the time I got back to the office,
uh,

111
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.790
Dick Jenrette,
who was president of the firm,

112
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:48.350
had gotten in and rage phone call from this,
uh,
executive and,
um,

113
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.250
uh,
and called me into his office and he said,
Geez,

114
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.790
you guys made this man very angry.
I said,
well,
how could I do that?

115
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.320
I was just asking questions.
Uh,
and he wasn't answering them.

116
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:02.960
So I just like ask the question again.
Uh,
you know,

117
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:06.620
I couldn't quite understand why he wasn't answering me.
He said,
well,

118
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:10.280
you were asking him things that he's not allowed to answer.
I said,

119
00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:14.420
what do you mean?
He said,
well,
you were asking him for inside information.
I said,

120
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.920
well,
I don't know what insight information is.

121
00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:19.370
I'm just asking the question that I need to know to know the answer,

122
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:22.940
whether to buy the stock or not.
Uh,
and he said,
well,
Steve,

123
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:27.200
there are all these rules of what you can answer it,
ask somebody.

124
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:30.220
And then if he tells you that he has to tell everybody in the world,
and,

125
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:35.150
and you know,
that's just too cumbersome.
And so,
uh,
you know,

126
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.660
uh,
uh,
that's why he didn't answer.
I said,
well,
if he didn't answer,

127
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.390
how in the world can you figure out what to do?
Uh,
and I said,
I,

128
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.020
I'm not that smart.
I need to have all relevant data and,

129
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.900
and he's the person who has it,
so why won't he give it to me?

130
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.890
And it became pretty clear that I was doing the wrong thing for a living.
Uh,
and,

131
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.360
uh,
uh,
in effect,

132
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:02.361
that's the dilemma for people who want to buy a liquid securities.

133
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:07.140
And I decided very quickly this was a bad business.
Uh,
uh,

134
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.170
certainly a bad one for me that I couldn't figure out how I could win that game.

135
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.600
Uh,
you know,
when somebody wouldn't fully share openly everything they knew,

136
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.530
uh,
and,
um,
uh,
I guess if you were like,

137
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:26.640
assume or with a good fashion sense,
uh,
you know,
uh,
that,

138
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:29.910
that that's how you manage liquid securities and beat other people.

139
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.750
It's not just what,
you know,
it's,
it's,

140
00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:35.790
it's a question of whether the rest of the world will buy into what you know and

141
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.780
drive that security up.
And so I,
uh,

142
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.110
basically retreated a and went to Harvard business school where I figured maybe

143
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:46.960
somebody will tell me how this game really works in a way that,
uh,

144
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:51.660
I can prosper in it.
Uh,
and,
uh,
that was a good experience for me.

145
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.830
Um,
uh,
and,
um,

146
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.960
they basically taught you and your undergraduate,

147
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:00.510
so you don't know what they're teaching you at a school like that.

148
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:04.080
So I can explain it actually pretty clearly.
It's,
it's,
it's,

149
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.940
it's basically they're teaching you that everything you do with the company has

150
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:13.360
something,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
else to do with that company.
So,

151
00:10:13.361 --> 00:10:17.850
so that it's an integrated system.
So,
so,
so that,
uh,
if you,

152
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.140
um,
are trying to develop a product for sale,

153
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.120
it would be good to know whether somebody wants it.
Right.
Uh,
so,
so,

154
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.340
you know,
what happens actually in the real world,
uh,

155
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.270
is that sometimes people just get an interesting idea and they'll produce a

156
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:37.290
product and nobody would want it.
And if you,
if you,
uh,
uh,

157
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.590
integrate all the different kinds of knowledge in,

158
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:43.200
in the company so that you're doing intelligent things,

159
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:46.800
and I know this appears very elementary,
you'll have a better company.

160
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.180
That's sort of what they were teaching.

161
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.370
And after they taught that for like two or three months,
I sorta got it,
uh,

162
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:57.840
and thought about dropping out of school because it got a little repetitive.
Um,

163
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.860
frankly,
uh,
but I was convinced,
uh,
uh,
by,

164
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:06.480
by my friend Dick Jenrette who also thought about dropping out of Harvard

165
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.400
Business School,
uh,
uh,
in December,
it gets very cold in Boston,
uh,

166
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.670
and really miserable.

167
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.150
And he was going to drop out and go and get a phd in economics.

168
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:19.170
I was going to drop out and go back to the real world.
And you know,
he,

169
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.720
he said that his staying on was a good thing and I should stay on.
And,

170
00:11:23.721 --> 00:11:26.000
and so,
uh,
I did,
uh,

171
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.040
what I've sort of done for a career is trying to solve that problem of my

172
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:35.460
initial meeting,
uh,
where,
uh,
people will,

173
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.560
uh,
I want people to tell me what's really going on so I can figure out,
you know,

174
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:44.820
whether what they're saying makes sense or doesn't make sense.
Uh,
and,

175
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:48.630
and you can do that,
uh,
in,
in the private equity business,

176
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:52.230
which was sort of our largest business.
Uh,

177
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.610
and you could do that in the real estate business because you're,

178
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.530
you're allowed to get all that inside information if you're trying to buy a

179
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:03.760
company with our rules and also the rules of other companies,
countries,

180
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.440
if you sign a

181
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:12.420
confidentiality agreement that you won't use that information for any purpose

182
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:14.920
other than buying the company and putting a price on it.

183
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:19.921
And then the shareholders get a chance to vote on whether they want the price

184
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:23.740
that you give them.
Uh,
and,
and so,
uh,
you know,

185
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:25.270
to me that was that,

186
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.840
that was like an answer to my conundrum of how can I,

187
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:33.790
how can we get all the information and then figure out what to do with it,

188
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:36.930
including improving the company.
Uh,
I'm,

189
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.950
I'm sure you know something about private equity.
Uh,

190
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.400
if you read the general newspapers,
I'll tell you basically what it is.
We're,

191
00:12:43.401 --> 00:12:48.230
all we do is we,
we,
uh,
uh,
we,
we buy companies.
Uh,
and,

192
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.190
and that's the simplest thing we do.
We do a lot of other things.

193
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:54.880
But let's start with,
you know,
we buy companies,
uh,

194
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.730
we borrow money to buy those companies.
Uh,
historically,
uh,

195
00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.900
it's been about a $3 of debt for every $1 of equity.

196
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.640
We then improve those,
uh,
companies,
uh,
you know,

197
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:14.440
through a whole variety of,
uh,
you know,
sort of managerial actions.

198
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.310
Uh,
and then those companies grow with the general economy.

199
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:23.140
And let's say if they just grow at the regular rate of all companies,
uh,
then,
uh,

200
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.590
uh,
if you're leveraged three,
two,
one,
you're going to earn a much better return.

201
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.600
Uh,
if you take a company and can accelerate its growth,

202
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.950
so it's growing faster because you've improved it and you have three to one

203
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:40.810
leverage,
you'll,
you'll get a way better return than,

204
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.700
than any normal,
uh,
stock market,
uh,
kind of return.
Uh,

205
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:50.650
and,
and that sort of the model,
uh,
of what we do in that business.
Uh,
uh,

206
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.370
as Professor Sheila was saying,
uh,
we've,
we've compounded,
uh,

207
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.500
after fees at 23%,
uh,
but before fees,
uh,

208
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.800
because we,
we charge a 20%,
uh,

209
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.600
part of the profits of the deal goes back to the general partner,
which is us.
Uh,

210
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.520
we,
we,
we've actually earned around 31%.
Uh,
uh,
which,
uh,

211
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:12.881
you know,

212
00:14:12.881 --> 00:14:17.540
from you being in a course like this you'd see is that's really pretty high.
Uh,

213
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.260
you know,
compared to a stock market average over a period,

214
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.960
which would be around the 11th.
And,
and in real estate.
Um,

215
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.400
W W we do the same kind of thing.
Uh,
but,

216
00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:31.990
but real estate is an easier business,
uh,
because buildings don't talk,

217
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.010
uh,
uh,
managements of companies talk a,

218
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:40.000
and you have to figure out what they're saying.
Companies are very complex.

219
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:45.400
Uh,
you know,
you have interesting competition.
You have global competition.

220
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.510
Uh,
it's,
it's a complicated,
uh,
uh,
asset class.
Real,

221
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.820
real estate is very simple.
I mean,
you know,
there,
there's,
uh,
you know,

222
00:14:52.821 --> 00:14:57.140
building stone talk.
Uh,
and so you,
you can't get misled by a building.

223
00:14:57.141 --> 00:14:58.280
They can't tell you something.

224
00:14:58.281 --> 00:15:01.640
They don't have a belief system and it's just there.
It's on the corner,

225
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:04.430
it's in the middle of the block.
Uh,
uh,
and,

226
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.990
and there are other buildings that either getting built or planned,
uh,
and,

227
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:12.920
and you can figure out what the supply demand is for real estate in a much

228
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:17.720
easier way.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,
uh,
because of that,
uh,

229
00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.650
our,
our returns in real estate have been a better cause.

230
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:24.680
It's an easier asset class.
Uh,
and,
and we,

231
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:29.480
we've earned after fees 30% a year since we started,

232
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.210
uh,
and before fees close to 40%.

233
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.530
So this alternative asset class,
if,

234
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.330
if handled right,
is,
is really a much better way,

235
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:44.840
uh,
of,
of earning money,
uh,
for,

236
00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:49.610
for investors as well as the general partner.
Let's not forget us,

237
00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:54.350
uh,
that then a regular financial markets,
uh,

238
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.330
investing,
uh,
and,
uh,
you know,
that world,
uh,

239
00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:02.030
it has been started very small.
Uh,

240
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:07.060
when we started at institutions had less than 1% of their assets.

241
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:13.970
It was like in fantastical,
uh,
in,
uh,
in the private equity side of the business.

242
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.060
Uh,
it's now up to about four and a half percent.
Uh,

243
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:20.840
and the returns are so much higher.
You'd wonder why,
uh,

244
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.840
people don't give us all their money,
uh,
on,

245
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.760
on an asset allocation basis.
And I,

246
00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:30.050
I actually still wonder why they don't,
uh,

247
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.060
since we put most of our money in that and we keep making more and more,

248
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.870
uh,
and outperforming and,
you know,
it just takes the rest of the world,

249
00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:42.210
apparently the equivalent of your lifetime,
uh,

250
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:47.060
to sort of figure out exactly what they should be doing.

251
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.000
And,
and,
and,
you know,
I think the projections are that,

252
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.980
that this should be growing at a a lot faster,
uh,
rate,
uh,

253
00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:58.640
you know,
going into the future.
Uh,
and,
and,
and,
uh,

254
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.550
some institutions like Yale have,
uh,
uh,
private equity with,
around,

255
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.780
and I guess it's around 16,
17%.
It was up to 18,
uh,

256
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:08.900
of their portfolio.

257
00:17:08.901 --> 00:17:13.410
And that's one of the reasons why Dave Swenson has done a much better,
uh,

258
00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:18.410
than a regular money managers,
uh,
turning to a different subject.

259
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.120
It's a financial markets course.

260
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.450
And I thought it would be useful to talk to you a little bit about what's really

261
00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:28.000
going out in the real world,
even though this course is,
is,

262
00:17:28.001 --> 00:17:32.000
is being,
uh,
uh,
recorded,
uh,
you know,

263
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.630
and whatever you say about the,
the,
the current moment,

264
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.600
it turns out to be right or wrong,
but it's just a current moment.

265
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:43.280
It's such a fascinating one.
Uh,
and,
and you all are,
I guess,

266
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:47.180
somewhere between
18 and 21 years old,

267
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:50.580
probably 19 and 19 and 21.
So,

268
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:55.570
so you don't have the perspective to understand how really,
uh,

269
00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.570
uh,
interesting and dangerous.
Uh,
this current environment,
uh,
is,

270
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:05.040
uh,
what,
what's happened,
uh,
uh,
is,
is,
is that,

271
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.440
um,
through,
uh,
an abnormal,

272
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.240
uh,
in issuance of something called subprime securities.

273
00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:20.950
Nobody in this audience,
certainly people watching,
uh,
you know,
uh,

274
00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.970
probably own a house.
Um,
uh,
and,

275
00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.770
and what happened is that in the late nineties,
the government,

276
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.390
uh,
in Washington,
uh,
we passed the law to encourage more,

277
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.120
uh,
uh,
uh,

278
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.360
low income people being able to buy houses and resulted,
uh,

279
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.940
along with other factors in an explosion of,

280
00:18:42.941 --> 00:18:47.370
of these types of loans in terms of,
of loans.

281
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:50.040
And Professor Shiller can correct me if I'm slightly off on this,

282
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.700
but in the year 2002 of the total mortgage mortgage loans that were originated,

283
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:02.450
a four,
four,
four houses,
uh,
probably around two to 3% of them have more subprime.

284
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.960
Uh,
um,

285
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:09.120
and these are for people who don't have enough money to really pay normal

286
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:13.470
principal or interest and,
and,
and expect,
uh,
their,

287
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.190
their mortgage to be current,
to not go into default.

288
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.650
And by 2006,

289
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.970
this had exploded a to 30% of,

290
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.870
of all the mortgages that were issued that year.
When you go to two,

291
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:31.140
from two to 3% to 30%,
this is,

292
00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:35.790
this is an almost out of body experience,
uh,
and,

293
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.770
and,
um,
to,
to entice these people to take these loans.

294
00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.900
Uh,
they,
they actually,
um,
uh,

295
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.590
would tell somebody in the olden days when,

296
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.530
when I was your age to buy a house,

297
00:19:49.531 --> 00:19:53.760
you had to put up like 25% of the cost of the house.
Uh,
you know,

298
00:19:53.761 --> 00:19:54.780
sometimes you,

299
00:19:54.781 --> 00:19:58.830
you'd have to put up a 20% of the cost of the house and you can borrow 80,

300
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.840
uh,
the subprime loans.
Sometimes you,

301
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.870
you only had to put up 3% of the cost of the house.
Sometimes you,

302
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:11.430
you didn't even have to put up anything.
Uh,
that makes it really affordable.

303
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.580
Uh,
and,
and then,
uh,

304
00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:18.360
you didn't have to pay any interest for,
for two or three years.

305
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:23.000
So you put up nothing and you paid nothing.
So this led to,
um,

306
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.600
you know,
a stampede of people who wanted this.

307
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:32.130
And what's happening now,
uh,
is,
is that,
uh,
uh,

308
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.640
the mortgage,
the interest,
which no one,
uh,

309
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.750
a lot of these mortgages didn't have to pay.
Now two to three years later,

310
00:20:39.751 --> 00:20:40.620
you have to pay it.

311
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.790
And a lot of the people who didn't have the resources can't pay the mortgages.

312
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:49.180
Those mortgages are defaulting.
Uh,
the,
the,
the,

313
00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.930
the issue that created all the problems in the financial system that you're

314
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:57.740
reading about in the front page is that these mortgages were pooled in,
in,

315
00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.240
in,
in,
in,
in,
in a new security.
You know,

316
00:21:01.241 --> 00:21:05.740
imagine just sort of a jar where somebody threw out a few thousand of these

317
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:10.240
mortgages and then put the lid on it.
Um,
and,
and so,

318
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.890
um,
they,
they,
they,
they had these new securities and what they did is they said,

319
00:21:14.891 --> 00:21:15.724
well,

320
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.870
the first 83% of them must be really safe because mortgage is basically hardly

321
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:26.410
ever default.
And they rated those,
the rating agencies,

322
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:32.170
which tell people how secure something is a rated this as a triple a security.

323
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.110
And the world of finance,
when you tell somebody that that is security is,

324
00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.040
is AAA.
They get rated all the way from triple A's down to triple C's.

325
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.370
And triple c means something's about to blow up a.

326
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:49.240
And AAA means there's no possible chance you're ever going to lose your money.

327
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:54.910
And so,
because 83% of this jar was rated,

328
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.710
uh,
you know,

329
00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.710
AAA people bought this all over the world as if it was a security that could

330
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:08.230
never,
ever,
ever default.
And as you can see,
um,

331
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.830
you know,
these were basically mortgages made to,
to,

332
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.550
to low income people who weren't even paying,
in some cases interest on it.

333
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.170
And the chance that these were going to default was really sky high.
Uh,

334
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.260
historians will go back and figure out why anybody would believe that these

335
00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:29.200
things could be AAA.
Uh,
but,
but,

336
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:33.130
but they did and they were bought everywhere.
So th this,
these,

337
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:37.060
these securities became like American SARS.
Uh,
you know,

338
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.890
they were exported throughout the world creating enormous problems,
uh,

339
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.100
for individual institutions.
Uh,
you know,

340
00:22:45.101 --> 00:22:48.040
around the world and in the United States,
they,

341
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:53.041
they've created what will be hundreds of billions of dollars of losses for the

342
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:57.910
financial institutions.
And,
uh,
uh,
as part of Sarbanes Oxley,

343
00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:02.380
which was a law passed,
uh,
uh,
you know,
after Enron and some other things,

344
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:07.270
we've developed accounting procedures with something called a very technical

345
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:11.320
called fas,
a one 57,
which is called fair value accounting,

346
00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.650
which means you,
before these defaults even happen,

347
00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.220
the fact that other people think they're going to happen results in the

348
00:23:18.221 --> 00:23:23.221
securities being worth less than you have to take a loss based on that expected

349
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.430
value.
So the financial institutions,

350
00:23:27.431 --> 00:23:30.880
we're losing all this money without the defaults even happening or people

351
00:23:30.881 --> 00:23:35.590
knowing how that it would be a,
and as a result of that,
those large losses,

352
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.540
um,
the financial market started losing confidence in some of the financial

353
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:44.740
institutions and different asset classes in those,
uh,

354
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:49.910
financial institutions.
Principally,
banks started trading in a really bad way.

355
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:54.470
People thought they were gonna,
you know,
be forced to sell some of those.
Uh,

356
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:59.471
and we had a variety of different asset classes are ranging from municipal

357
00:24:00.051 --> 00:24:04.820
bonds.
Um,
uh,
uh,
basically,
uh,
uh,
you know,

358
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:07.850
changing their value.
People said,
I don't want these anymore.

359
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.580
There were hedge funds that own those on leverage.
So,

360
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.370
so there were a margin calls which forced those securities to be sold,

361
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:20.990
which made them worse,
worth even less,
uh,
that got the banks even more nervous,

362
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.430
nervous,
uh,

363
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.460
that resulted in higher rated securities being sold that were also on leverage.

364
00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:28.581
Uh,

365
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:33.581
and what you had was like panic selling of securities rolling through every

366
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:40.841
element of the financial system as people desperately tried to get out of stuff

367
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.690
before we become worth less.
And,

368
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.070
and this type of rapid,
uh,
uh,

369
00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.540
leveraging resulted in,

370
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:54.770
in a downward valuations for all these securities.

371
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.700
A lot of hedge funds going,
um,
uh,
bankrupt.

372
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.730
Anyone with leverage by borrowing more than five to one to carry some very

373
00:25:04.671 --> 00:25:09.530
secure real securities.
Uh,
not,
not subprime,
but government oriented securities.

374
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.490
Um,
uh,
you know,
the,
those institutions got into trouble.

375
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.880
And what we've had is,
is basically melt in the financial markets where,

376
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.420
uh,
the banks have been so severely impacted,
uh,

377
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:26.960
that they have stopped lending to certain whole asset classes.
Uh,
you know,

378
00:25:26.961 --> 00:25:30.660
particularly leverage lending,
which we're involved with,
uh,

379
00:25:30.661 --> 00:25:35.570
as well as other areas.
Uh,
the costs of credit have gone up,
you know,

380
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:40.400
sort of,
um,
uh,
three,
three,
3%,
4%,

381
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.320
which doesn't sound like much to you,

382
00:25:42.321 --> 00:25:45.680
but it actually in the overall system is a lot.

383
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.370
And what that's resulted in is a financial crisis.

384
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.230
It's resulted in,
um,
uh,

385
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.270
the Federal Reserve who's the ultimate protector of the system.

386
00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.900
Very quickly lowering interest rates,

387
00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.510
agreeing to lend huge amounts of money,
uh,

388
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.860
to the banking system because banks are now now not even lending money to each

389
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:13.430
other.
They're,
they're sufficiently scared about what's going on.
Uh,

390
00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.500
and the Federal Reserve is saying,
well,

391
00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:20.180
everybody can come to me a and I'll lend you all money,
uh,
to keep you liquid.

392
00:26:20.181 --> 00:26:22.790
So this whole system doesn't stop.
Uh,

393
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.130
now as it impacts regular people is,

394
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:30.730
is when the financial institutions go into a crisis like this,
uh,

395
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.310
and stop lending or reduce their lending of money.

396
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.200
There's less money for regular people to borrow to go about their lives.
Uh,

397
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.860
and,
and you know,
in businesses to get,
and as that starts happening,
uh,

398
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.700
an economy will slow down,
uh,
and,
and,

399
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.390
and go into a recession.
Uh,
and,

400
00:26:50.391 --> 00:26:53.400
and that's what's happening,
uh,
in the United States.

401
00:26:53.401 --> 00:26:56.210
So for those of you who are graduating this year,
uh,

402
00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.380
your prospect of getting a job will be less than the people who graduated last

403
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.880
year.
Uh,

404
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.080
and the people who graduated the year before had a much better deal than the

405
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:11.700
ones that were graduating,
uh,
last year.
Uh,
and,
and this is a,
uh,

406
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:16.590
a problem that's pretty pervasive one,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

407
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:17.001
and,

408
00:27:17.001 --> 00:27:21.690
and it will probably take longer to get out of this recession than other ones,

409
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.520
uh,
that,
that,
uh,
that we've had.
Uh,
and the implications of,
you know,

410
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:30.330
financial markets,
which may sound like just sort of a,
a,

411
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:33.370
a dry academic course.
Uh,

412
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.010
this will also affect the outcome of presidential elections among other things.

413
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:42.090
Uh,
because you'll see that from what the presidential candidates started talking

414
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:46.410
about nine months ago,
which is a lot of foreign policy,

415
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:49.980
a war in Iraq.
What should we be doing about a variety of those issues?

416
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.580
You'll see that by the time this election,
uh,
uh,

417
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:58.410
occurs that the focus will be,
uh,
much more,
uh,

418
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:02.390
and perhaps dominantly so,
uh,
on the economy,
uh,

419
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:07.380
on people defaulting and being thrown out of their houses,
uh,
on,
uh,

420
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.030
you know,
what's happening to the economy.

421
00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:14.031
Generally it's going to hit other things such as a trade and,

422
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.860
uh,
you know,
uh,
the country being more populist,
uh,

423
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.560
more protectionist.
Uh,

424
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:26.150
which also has negative implications,
uh,
because,
uh,

425
00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.900
the United States right now is the largest debtor nation in the world.
Uh,

426
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.890
10 years ago we were the largest creditor.
And when you're the largest debtor,

427
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.400
that means you have to borrow money all the time from people in the outside

428
00:28:38.401 --> 00:28:42.760
world.
And if we become more protectionist and,
and,

429
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.080
and outsiders,
uh,
basically say,
look,

430
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:49.200
these Americans are starting to like not have an open world.

431
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.860
And I'm worried that maybe I won't be able to get my money back,
or,
you know,

432
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:57.720
they don't really want me to be part of their,
their world.
Uh,
then,

433
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.050
then there's the potential that they will invest less with us,
which again,

434
00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:04.320
we'll raise our cost of borrowing in financial markets,

435
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:06.690
whether they're for treasuries or other types of things,

436
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.770
which will have the effect of,
again,
slowing,
uh,

437
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.690
our economy.
So you,

438
00:29:13.691 --> 00:29:18.390
you all are about to enter the world in a very,
very,

439
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.800
very interesting time.
Uh,
and,
uh,

440
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:26.880
the problems with our financial institutions,
uh,
are perhaps,
uh,
the,

441
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:31.430
uh,
the greatest,
uh,
that we've had,
uh,
since,
uh,
the,

442
00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:36.150
the 1930s in the era of the Great Depression,
which is when my dad,

443
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:41.050
uh,
was,
uh,
uh,
was,
uh,
sort of a young man.
Uh,
and,

444
00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:46.190
and he grew up,
uh,
in the 1930s.
And anyone who did,
uh,
um,

445
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:47.103
you know,
would,

446
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.170
would tell you that was just a disastrous economic time because those financial

447
00:29:53.171 --> 00:29:56.680
institutions,
as opposed to struggling the way ours are,

448
00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.090
and ours will ultimately be fine.
Uh,

449
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:06.210
those financial institutions collapsed because they didn't have the kind of,

450
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:12.040
uh,
uh,
uh,
sort of safeguards that the system has,
uh,

451
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.820
uh,
basically,
uh,
put into our system.
Currently,

452
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:20.821
we learned from the 1930s how to avoid a complete collapse of the financial

453
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:28.030
institutions.
Uh,
but this is a trying time for these,

454
00:30:28.031 --> 00:30:30.820
um,
uh,
for the system.
Uh,
and,
uh,

455
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:34.810
the Federal Reserve is doing a really excellent job at,
at,

456
00:30:34.811 --> 00:30:36.130
at sort of guaranteeing it.

457
00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:40.770
And if you read about the recent bear Stearns a crisis,
uh,
uh,

458
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.960
which was front page of,
uh,
uh,

459
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:47.630
literally every newspaper in the world,
um,
where the,

460
00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.650
the Federal Reserve,
uh,

461
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:55.090
stepped in and basically provided sufficient guarantees and credit support.

462
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:59.980
So this one institution wouldn't,
wouldn't go bankrupt.
Uh,
and,
and there were,

463
00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.540
uh,
it's a brokerage firm.

464
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:06.190
Brokerage firms are not regulated by the Federal Reserve and they don't have

465
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:10.710
access to the borrowings of the Federal Reserve.
To protect them,
uh,
which,
uh,

466
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:16.060
uh,
is,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,
there it's sort of outside the system.

467
00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.980
And the reason why the Federal Reserve went and did that,
uh,
is that,

468
00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.780
that the large brokerage firms,

469
00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.540
which don't have the same kind of regulation or the same kind of ultimate
lender,

470
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.440
uh,

471
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.390
literally have trillions and trillions of dollars of,

472
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.290
uh,
of,
of,
of uh,

473
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.960
counterparty risk,
uh,
you know,

474
00:31:40.961 --> 00:31:44.370
sort of guarantees that they've given that they'll do something.
Uh,

475
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:49.090
and if they go bankrupt,
they can't do it.
And that leaves the system vulnerable,

476
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.340
uh,
to,
uh,
uh,

477
00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:56.410
people expecting performance on things like credit default swaps and things that

478
00:31:56.411 --> 00:32:00.070
are too technical to actually explain to you at the moment.
Uh,
but they,

479
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:04.210
there are so many trillions of dollars of those obligations that if they get

480
00:32:04.211 --> 00:32:07.600
into trouble,
this isn't just like a subprime mortgage.

481
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:12.730
These are in the trillions.
Uh,
and you know,
um,
uh,
and,

482
00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:15.500
and just credit to fault swaps or,
uh,

483
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:20.670
about $45 trillion and the sub prime mortgage losses will only be a few hundred

484
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:25.120
billion dollars.
So the Fed was basically going in and say,

485
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.810
we can't take this risk to our overall system.

486
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.310
And that's one reason why the stock market has gotten better because the

487
00:32:33.311 --> 00:32:37.630
prospect of a collapse of the system has been really reduced.
Uh,

488
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:42.350
I wasn't trying to depress you on a,
uh,
early,
uh,
morning.
Uh,

489
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.850
the American system is enormously resilient.
Uh,
and,
uh,

490
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:51.150
you know,
there will be,
uh,
solutions that happen over time,
uh,

491
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:55.880
that will deal with this.
Uh,
but the impact of financial markets,

492
00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:00.380
which is your course,
I'm just a visitor,
uh,
is,

493
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:04.850
is really,
uh,
uh,
driving,
you know,

494
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.710
the whole overall economy and is affecting the global economy.
Uh,

495
00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.160
uh,
the countries in Asia,
you know,
China,

496
00:33:13.161 --> 00:33:16.160
India in particular as large ones,
uh,

497
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:21.080
W W we'll obviously sustain lower growth rates as a result of this,
uh,

498
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:26.090
financial markets problem here in the United States.
Uh,
you're seeing,
uh,
the UK,

499
00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.340
uh,
having already a slowed down,
uh,
and,
and,

500
00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:32.080
and this will probably,
uh,

501
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:37.150
as it has historically rolled into continental Europe and resulted in the whole

502
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:41.900
world,
uh,
you know,
growing slower,
higher unemployment,

503
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.480
uh,
and people being adversely affected.

504
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:49.870
So how financial markets work and how they're impacted and what would have

505
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:52.350
happened if,
um,

506
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:56.120
the subprime mortgages wouldn't have been allowed to have been made from a

507
00:33:56.121 --> 00:34:00.260
regulatory point of view.
And what would have happened if they were,

508
00:34:00.261 --> 00:34:05.210
instead of being rated AAA,
they would have been rated,
uh,
uh,
you know,

509
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:09.890
sort of,
uh,
uh,
single be hardly anybody would have bought them.
Uh,

510
00:34:09.891 --> 00:34:14.810
and that would have controlled the expansion and the a risk to the financial

511
00:34:14.811 --> 00:34:19.220
system.
Uh,
you know,
historians will look back on it and real people,

512
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.630
and not that historians aren't,
but real practitioners,
we'll,

513
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:26.690
we'll try and solve this problem,
uh,
by,

514
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.020
by having different types of regulation,
uh,
so,

515
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:34.880
so that you can't get into this kind of risk posture.
So in any case,
uh,

516
00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:39.440
what,
why don't we,
uh,
you know,
take some questions.
That's a,
that's an opening.

517
00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:43.340
Uh,
and we can talk about anything you'd like to

518
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.410
<v 2>dare to be great.
Yes.</v>

519
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.310
<v 1>I,
the question was,
can,
can,</v>

520
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:14.370
can I take you through a good deal and a bad deal in I s I assume private equity

521
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:20.100
or,
uh,
you know,
uh,
you know,
to show you how this works.
Um,

522
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.220
uh,
well,
um,
uh,
a good deal.
Um,

523
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:29.690
those are always more fun by the way.
Uh,
a good deal.
Uh,
it was really a,

524
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:34.630
our first deal,
uh,
uh,
it was a company called us steel corporation,

525
00:35:34.631 --> 00:35:36.520
which is sort of a big one.
Uh,

526
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.290
was attacked by a corporate raider named Carl Icahn,

527
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:45.120
who I think you have some familiarity with.
Uh,
and uh,

528
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:49.650
being a prior speaker and a,
the corporation didn't want to be taken over.

529
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.840
And so they were trying to marshal cash,
uh,
to fight him off.

530
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.550
And the way they chose to fight him off was,
was,
was by buying their own stock,

531
00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.110
uh,
at a higher price to give their shareholders the equivalent of a really big

532
00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:06.690
dividend,
but doing it by buying their stock,

533
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:10.620
which gave them capital gains treatment.
So they needed to get a bunch of money.

534
00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:14.550
So the way they thought about getting some money was to sell one of their big

535
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:19.410
assets.
And the asset they chose to sell was,

536
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:24.390
um,
um,
uh,
their,
their railroads and,
and,
and barge lines,

537
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:27.420
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
you know,
uh,

538
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:31.680
or boats on the Great Lakes and to make steel,
uh,

539
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.910
for those of you who've never done it,
um,
uh,
uh,
it's,
it's a,

540
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.050
it's a lot like cooking.
You need,
you know,
a variety of different ingredients,
uh,

541
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:41.070
and,
uh,
you know,

542
00:36:41.071 --> 00:36:44.820
the ingredients instead of just being carried into your house in a,
in a,

543
00:36:44.821 --> 00:36:46.290
in a shopping bag,

544
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.940
come in on a railroad because their iron ore and coke and all these really heavy

545
00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:54.570
things.
Uh,
and,
uh,
in,
I guess around,
uh,

546
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:56.220
1880 1890,

547
00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.350
a fella named Andrew Carnegie who owned a US steel,

548
00:37:01.351 --> 00:37:03.960
it was then called Carnegie Steel,
built all these railroads.

549
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.340
So to bring this stuff in.
Uh,
and so,
so us steel,
you know,

550
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.500
wanting to sell it,
uh,

551
00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:14.790
and they didn't want to lose control of it because they felt if that was a

552
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:19.791
lifeline artery into their steel plants were brought in 100% of the raw

553
00:37:19.801 --> 00:37:24.690
materials to make steel and took out about 85,
90% of the finished product,

554
00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:27.290
because steel is like really heavy,
right?
So,
you know,

555
00:37:27.291 --> 00:37:29.910
you just can't carry it out and put it on a truck,

556
00:37:29.911 --> 00:37:32.520
necessarily goes out by railroad.
Also,

557
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:37.680
that because this was an artery that went right into the company.
Uh,
and,
and if,

558
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.340
if we started overcharging,
uh,
for,
for the railroad,

559
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.130
they were worried that we would bankrupt the steel companies.

560
00:37:44.131 --> 00:37:45.690
We'd Siphon off all the profit.

561
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:51.140
So we did a partnership deal where we own 51% of the railroads in effect a,

562
00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:56.040
they own 49.
Uh,
and,
um,
uh,
we,
uh,

563
00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:01.320
show you how excessive finance can get a,
we,
it was a,

564
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:05.880
I believe that the deal was a somewhere around,
uh,
you know,
600,

565
00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:09.690
$1 million,
$700 million in 1980.

566
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:15.280
Uh,
88,
89.
So that's a lot more money today.
Uh,
and,
uh,

567
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:20.760
uh,
we,
we,
we borrowed,
uh,
uh,
almost,

568
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.280
uh,
you know,
all the money.
Um,
you know,

569
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:27.660
I think we put up like 15 or $20 million.
Uh,
and,
uh,

570
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.890
so,
so,
so the leverage was,
was huge.
Uh,

571
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.440
the business wasn't particularly a growth business.
It was pretty stable.

572
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.330
We bought it in the middle of a strike.

573
00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:41.680
So part of the art of what we did was guessing whether us steel would come back

574
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:46.600
to the same production level,
uh,
that they were before.
Uh,
and you know,

575
00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:50.770
our guest slash analysis was correct.
Uh,

576
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:55.771
and every year the profits from that company would be worth more than the amount

577
00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:00.910
of money that we invested,
uh,
in the equity.

578
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.130
And so we ended up making,
uh,
uh,

579
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.390
24 times our money in that deal,
uh,
in,
uh,

580
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.280
12 years.
So in our world,

581
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:16.720
and not the academic world,
if you make 24 times your money in 12 years,

582
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:21.640
this is regarded as a success.
Uh,
uh,
and,

583
00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:26.010
um,
so,
so,
so you know,
that,
that,
that was a good one.
Um,

584
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.770
uh,
now a bad one,
uh,
uh,

585
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:34.420
shows you about,
you know,
a little bit about the,
you know,

586
00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:38.050
the volatility and,
and danger of,

587
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:43.390
of sort of the currency markets.
We,
uh,
in in 19,
uh,

588
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.100
I guess it was a 98,
uh,

589
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:53.080
bought,
um,
um,
it might've been 97 and 98 bought,

590
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.030
uh,
uh,
you know,
control of the second biggest cellular phone company,

591
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.680
uh,
in,
um,
uh,
Argentina.
Uh,
which,
uh,

592
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.380
was an interesting place to be.
You know,
I'm sure you all have one of these.

593
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.460
If you don't have something more elegant,
uh,
you know,
some other,
you know,

594
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:13.840
sort of personal device,
you know,
like one of these that can,
you know,

595
00:40:13.841 --> 00:40:17.100
get email or it can,
you know,
you can talk on it.
You know,
I,

596
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:22.420
you can almost set it up as a disco.
You can do almost anything with it.

597
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:27.190
Uh,
that,
that,
um,
we,
we bought this company,
uh,
for,
uh,

598
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.000
eight times,
uh,
uh,
cashflow,

599
00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:33.910
which is not real high for a company that's growing very rapidly in,

600
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.600
in what was called in emerging markets,
uh,
country.
Uh,

601
00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:42.560
this particular country had its currency index to the dollar.
Uh,

602
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:47.010
so it was almost like,
uh,
investing in,
in,
in,
in,

603
00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:49.390
in the United States because what can go wrong,

604
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.710
a rapidly growing country invested,
uh,
in dollars.

605
00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:58.750
We borrowed dollars to buy this company.
Uh,
because in Argentina,

606
00:40:58.751 --> 00:41:01.210
you couldn't borrow money for a long time.
One of the,

607
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.410
one of the great things about the United States financial markets is that you

608
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:08.990
can borrow debt for long periods of time.
Uh,
and,
uh,

609
00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:12.040
this looked to be a very low risk,
uh,
uh,

610
00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.790
rapidly growing situation where we were hopeful we were going to make four to

611
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:20.560
five times their money.
Uh,
there was only one problem,
uh,
that,

612
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:25.540
uh,
Argentina,
the country collapsed.
Uh,
and,

613
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:30.360
uh,
I mean,
literally collapsed.
Uh,
you know,
the,

614
00:41:30.361 --> 00:41:31.960
the,
the linkage,

615
00:41:31.961 --> 00:41:36.700
which is called the peg to the dollar turned out to be a most unfortunate,
uh,

616
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:40.070
uh,
thing.
Uh,
and,
uh,
the emerging markets.

617
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:43.880
This is when you started with the Russian financial crisis and this crisis,

618
00:41:43.881 --> 00:41:45.830
and you had an Asian financial crisis.

619
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:50.600
It rolled through the whole world with currencies rapidly changing their values.

620
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.330
Um,
uh,
all kinds of,
uh,
uh,
countries at risk of,
of,

621
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:56.740
of collapse.
Uh,

622
00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:01.770
it got to Argentina and the whole whole economy pulverized.

623
00:42:02.331 --> 00:42:05.000
It was like a depression.
And they,

624
00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.680
they got off of their linkage to the dollar.
Uh,

625
00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.250
their currency became close to worth nothing.
Uh,

626
00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:16.790
and then we had to pay our debt back in dollars with earnings in Argentina,

627
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:20.630
which were like worth nothing.
And we lost every,
uh,

628
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:25.520
every cent,
every,
every dollar we invested in,
in that,

629
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:30.080
uh,
investment.
Uh,
and,
and even as we were going bankrupt,

630
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:33.710
it was still a good company.
So,
you know,
in finance,

631
00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:39.230
bad things can happen to nice people.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,

632
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.470
you know,
even when you think things through,
you can have some really,
uh,

633
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:48.500
you know,
uh,
bad,
uh,
uh,
bad,
bad outcomes.
Um,

634
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.490
you know,
we,
we,
we've had,
uh,
obviously if you have very high returns,

635
00:42:52.491 --> 00:42:57.380
you have wonderful stories.
Uh,
many more wonderful,
uh,
you know,

636
00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.460
uh,
uh,
stories than,
than bad ones.
We,

637
00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:04.380
we bought a chemical company called Celanese,
um,

638
00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.760
in about 2003 right after the recession was lifting.

639
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.310
It was a,
uh,
a company in Germany,

640
00:43:13.311 --> 00:43:16.880
but it had only 10% of its activities in Germany.

641
00:43:16.881 --> 00:43:19.280
It had about 60% of them in the United States.

642
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:24.650
So it was really a US company masquerading as a German company.

643
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.260
Uh,
and,
um,

644
00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:31.010
the price earnings multiples of German chemical companies were very low.

645
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:35.750
The price earnings companies of,
um,
American companies were much higher.

646
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.580
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
so,
so,
so,
you know,
not,

647
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:44.440
not being entirely dimwitted.
Uh,
what,
what,
what we did was,

648
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:46.610
was we changed the location of the company,

649
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:51.040
the headquarters from Germany to the United States.
They also were,

650
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.960
for some reason that we didn't completely understand,

651
00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:59.240
had three headquarters operations going to in the United States.
One in Germany.

652
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.540
We closed two of those three.

653
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:07.990
We invested a lot more money in a expansion as we were coming out of a

654
00:44:08.451 --> 00:44:12.960
recession.
Uh,
we,
we leveraged the company pretty highly.
Uh,
and,

655
00:44:12.961 --> 00:44:17.960
and we made,
uh,
I guess it was about six times our money,
uh,
in,
uh,

656
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:21.770
two years,
uh,
owning Celanese,
uh,
which is,
uh,

657
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.640
on the New York Stock Exchange now.
And it's a,
it's a lovely company,

658
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:30.380
Wonderful Company.
Um,
uh,
and,
and there are many stories,

659
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:35.040
uh,
uh,
of,
of,
of that type,
uh,
where we,
uh,

660
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.750
invest more money,
move things around,
uh,
borrow a lot of money,

661
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:43.140
catch fundamentals as they're going up.
Uh,
and it's,

662
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:48.360
the good stories are really,
uh,
a lot of fun.
Um,
you know,

663
00:44:48.361 --> 00:44:52.700
we enjoy those.
Uh,
and,
and,
and so to our,
uh,
uh,

664
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.020
investors.
So those are,

665
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:59.880
I gave you two winners and one loser instead of one on one.
Uh,

666
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:04.620
because,
uh,
in our real estate business,
we've probably,

667
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.810
uh,
just to give you perspective,
we,

668
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:12.770
we've only lost money on two situations,
uh,
in,
in,

669
00:45:12.771 --> 00:45:15.690
in our history,
uh,
uh,

670
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:18.960
out of about 160 investments.
So,

671
00:45:18.961 --> 00:45:23.610
so the number of good stories to bad stories,
I mean,
this isn't like Las Vegas,

672
00:45:23.611 --> 00:45:27.090
you know,
where you ended up as a net loser or it's a lot luck.

673
00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:32.250
Every time you do one of these things,
you,
you have,
uh,
a team of people,

674
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.680
uh,
working on it,
uh,

675
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:39.330
some of whom are sort of in there,
uh,
you know,

676
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:44.190
sort of early forties,
um,
you know,
who are usually partners.
Uh,
and then,
you know,

677
00:45:44.191 --> 00:45:48.140
each one of the firms like ours scales down in some kind of hierarchy.
Uh,

678
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.850
you know,

679
00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.560
where you have managing directors and vice presidents and associates and

680
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.810
analysts,
uh,
the folks like yourself,
uh,

681
00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:00.060
tend to get hired at firms like ours is analysts.
Uh,
and,

682
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:04.680
and which means you,
you,
you do,
you know,
statistical work.
And,
uh,

683
00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:09.180
uh,
I guess they're called now models,
uh,
you know,
on,
uh,

684
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.140
on computer,

685
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:15.060
which give us an idea that if any of the variables affecting these deals change,

686
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:20.220
how will it affect the overall earnings of the company or cashflow of the

687
00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:24.690
company or our ability to service the debt of that company.
Uh,

688
00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:26.340
and,
um,
uh,

689
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:30.720
and then we can figure out from doing that what price we'd want to pay for the

690
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:34.510
company.
Uh,
how much debt we can safely put on it,
uh,

691
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.630
so that the business doesn't get in trouble.
Uh,
and now,
you know,
the,

692
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.250
this analyst program,
the firms like ours have,

693
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.910
and people all over Wall Street have a,
is,

694
00:46:44.911 --> 00:46:49.560
is like a huge industry for people your age.
Uh,
and,

695
00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:53.930
um,
this didn't exist,
uh,
when I,
uh,

696
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:58.560
was,
was in college.
And I'm actually not that old compared to you.
I,

697
00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:03.210
I sorta think I'm almost the same age,
a little older.
Uh,
but,
uh,

698
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:08.160
uh,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's amazing having people like yourselves.
I mean,

699
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:11.340
in two years you could be in my conference room,
uh,
you know,

700
00:47:11.341 --> 00:47:15.810
with the other rest of the team talking about,
uh,
uh,
a live deal and,
you know,

701
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.330
putting in your 2 cents,
uh,
you know,
of perception,
uh,
you know,
with the,

702
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.130
you think something's a little more risky.
What we do at our firm.

703
00:47:23.131 --> 00:47:24.810
Whenever we're considering something,

704
00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:27.750
we always go around the table and ask everybody.
So,
you know,

705
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:28.800
we're not trying to intimidate,

706
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.510
but we figure that if somebody your age has been working on something and knows

707
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:38.620
the numbers,
you know,
uh,
uh,
sort of cold,
you'll,
you'll have some views.
Uh,

708
00:47:38.621 --> 00:47:42.650
and it's always fun,
uh,
particularly for me to ask,
uh,

709
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.190
because that's how you start the process of learning.

710
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.550
Finance is a business that is an apprentice business.

711
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:52.720
It's sort of like going back to the Middle Ages,
right,

712
00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.960
where they had guilds and you'd learn your business by apprenticing with

713
00:47:58.301 --> 00:48:02.260
somebody else who's already done it.
Uh,
uh,
you know,

714
00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:06.580
there's a base level of knowledge that you have to have in finance before you

715
00:48:06.581 --> 00:48:07.630
can be creative.

716
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:12.220
And the only way you get that is by working with other people who've already

717
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:13.960
done it and are doing it.

718
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:19.380
And people take enormous care when working with folks like yourself.

719
00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:23.220
Uh,
you know,
in terms of making sure you get the right answer,

720
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:27.640
not what I'd say,
which is different in the real world as,

721
00:48:27.641 --> 00:48:31.780
as a visitor from the real world,
uh,
to you in the academic world,

722
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:34.840
one of the real differences is in the real world,

723
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.350
there is only one grade for every project,

724
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.330
which is the equivalent of a course.
And that is an,
a,
uh,

725
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.290
an eight grade.

726
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:49.030
And the definition of an ae isn't the same as in academics and academics.

727
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:52.450
You can get an a and I don't know what Yale's current grading curve is.

728
00:48:52.451 --> 00:48:56.650
Now you can get an a,
sometimes with a 90,
you can get an a with a 92,

729
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.370
you can get an a with 93.
And you know,
that's sort of pretty good.

730
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.820
That's an a in our world in a is a hundred.

731
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.800
This is what's shocking to me because I wasn't a 100 kind of person.

732
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:16.330
Uh,
and my first project that I did,
I,
um,

733
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:20.320
just to give you an idea of the real,
uh,
uh,

734
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:25.500
need for excellence and perfection in what we do,
uh,
is,
um,

735
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.890
uh,
I was assigned to a project,
I worked on it really hard.

736
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.380
I wrote something up that was like a term paper,

737
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.850
which normally you only get to do one a year in the real world,
you know,

738
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:39.240
you get to do them every two to three weeks.
Uh,

739
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.280
and I submitted this thing to a gentleman named Herman Kahn who was a partner at

740
00:49:46.241 --> 00:49:48.620
Lehman brothers and older partner.
Uh,
uh,

741
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:53.230
at the time when I was doing it and I sent it down to him and he was waiting for

742
00:49:53.231 --> 00:49:56.400
this project.
Uh,
and um,
I,

743
00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:01.090
I got a phone call about three hours later and it sort of went like this,

744
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.033
uh,

745
00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:06.060
<v 3>that says Harmon kind calling,</v>

746
00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.760
is this Steve Schwarzman?

747
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.300
<v 1>I said,
yes,
it is Mister Kahn.</v>

748
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:14.190
<v 3>He said,
I got your paper.</v>

749
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:19.410
There's a typo on page 43,
Bang.

750
00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.210
<v 1>And that is the only thing I ever heard from Herman Kahn,</v>

751
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:29.130
a slammed phone because a comma was in the wrong place,

752
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:32.960
uh,
on this piece of work.

753
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.400
And I had really struggled.
Uh,

754
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.480
and that's all I got an angry man and a slam phone.

755
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.250
And I basically said,
what kind of crazy world am I in?

756
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:51.710
What is this about?

757
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:57.310
And what I learned is that any piece of work that you did that wasn't completely

758
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:59.563
correct,

759
00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.060
you got a version of Herman Kahn in your face.
Okay.

760
00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.460
And different people did it different ways,

761
00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.940
but this was a radically different world.

762
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:15.340
The real world in finance than I was used to.
I was a,

763
00:51:15.341 --> 00:51:19.250
a major here in something that doesn't exist,
I'm sure anymore.
Uh,

764
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:23.070
a creature of the 1960s called culture behavior.
Uh,

765
00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:27.960
and what we did is we had an interdisciplinary major,
uh,
with we in,

766
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:31.580
in,
in,
in psychology,
sociology,
uh,

767
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:34.580
biology and anthropology.
In other words,

768
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.200
we studied how people thought and why they thought that way.

769
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:42.080
I thought that was a pretty neat thing to be doing.

770
00:51:42.081 --> 00:51:45.740
And we had professors from each of those disciplines.

771
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:50.930
We had two seminars a week.
We had eight students in the major,

772
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:55.350
and we had four,
uh,
professors working with us all the time.
Uh,

773
00:51:55.390 --> 00:52:00.050
so I was used to a little softer,
more lovable world,
uh,
then,
uh,

774
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:04.610
finance.
Uh,
and,
and,
and so finance for me was shocking,

775
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:09.900
uh,
that,
that people would have to have everything correct all the time.
And,

776
00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:14.810
and it,
at your level,
what you'll be doing,
uh,
uh,
you know,
that's,

777
00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:18.890
um,
that's sort of what it is.
I mean,
there's,
there's no alternative.

778
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:22.820
People are Nice.
They'll help you get there,
but,
but there's no,

779
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.880
absolutely no flexibility in terms of getting perfect scores.

780
00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:33.610
Uh,
and once you do that,
I'm giving you a little career advice here,
uh,

781
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:38.640
that you do that for about two years or three years.
And,
and,
and,
and,

782
00:52:38.641 --> 00:52:42.890
and then after that,
you can start being more creative and,
uh,
and,

783
00:52:42.891 --> 00:52:47.000
and finance can be really creative,
interesting problem solving,
uh,

784
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:52.220
a business where,
you know,
it's,
it's global.
It's fun.
Uh,
I mean,

785
00:52:52.221 --> 00:52:56.660
in my last two weeks,
uh,
w where have I been?
Uh,
let's see,

786
00:52:57.350 --> 00:53:01.730
uh,
certainly a new haven now.
Uh,
I was in,

787
00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:06.620
uh,
Bahrain,
Kuwait,
Saudi Arabia,

788
00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:12.080
Abu Dhabi,
Dubai,
Cambodia,

789
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:16.010
um,
um,
Korea,

790
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.680
Ireland,
and Germany.

791
00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.760
It's actually really interesting.

792
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:28.680
And you meet people all over the world.
Uh,

793
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:33.120
you get to see how they think about issues,

794
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:38.130
how their financial systems and their economies work.
Uh,

795
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.550
during that trip,
you know,
I,
I met heads of countries,

796
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:46.030
I had head of financial institutions.
Uh,

797
00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:48.720
you're trying to figure out,
you know,

798
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:51.720
really the most complex stuff in the world,

799
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:56.660
which is how all these systems work and how they interact and,
and,

800
00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:00.310
and ultimately what you will do,
uh,

801
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.600
in an individual situation based upon this immense flow of knowledge and data

802
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:12.180
and,
and,
and cultural,
uh,
differences.

803
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.380
Uh,
and,
you know,
I,
I Miss China and India in this trip,
uh,

804
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.470
but we get them on other trips and,

805
00:54:18.471 --> 00:54:23.471
and it's really a finance done appropriately is a wonderful lifetime learning,

806
00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:30.720
uh,
ever changing,
exciting,
uh,
kind of,
uh,
uh,

807
00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.360
business.
It's,
it's,
it's not like,
you know,

808
00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.840
sort of selling socks to a department store.
Uh,

809
00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:41.790
this is really a fascinating,
uh,
business.

810
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.530
It never stays the same.

811
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:47.700
You have so many different people in so many different countries,

812
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.880
making so many different kinds of decisions that you as one decision maker in

813
00:54:53.191 --> 00:54:57.180
that enormously complicated matrix,
you know,

814
00:54:57.181 --> 00:54:59.910
the chance that you're going to get it right,
uh,

815
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:04.230
is only because you're absorbing as much information as you can from every place

816
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:08.700
and trying to thread the needle to make a correct decision.
So it's a lot of fun.

817
00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:12.720
So any of you who go from this course into,
uh,
you know,

818
00:55:12.721 --> 00:55:17.310
being a practitioner,
uh,
which is sort of what I am and the real world,

819
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.020
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's,

820
00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:22.230
it happens to have historically been quite financially rewarding,

821
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:24.310
which I guess is like,
uh,
you know,
I,

822
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:28.340
I think I used to think that was a really good thing.
Uh,
uh,
you know,

823
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:32.760
wait until the u s is like reevaluating exactly what it thinks about success.

824
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.840
Uh,
but,
but it's,
it's basically a good thing.
Uh,

825
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:39.600
and it's fascinating and I would encourage you,

826
00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:43.200
if you have an interest in it to,
uh,
uh,
to pursue it.

827
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.750
Yes.
Can you speak up a little?

828
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:51.383
Yes.

829
00:55:57.090 --> 00:55:57.923
<v 2>Wow.</v>

830
00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:07.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

831
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:12.340
It was a question about carried interest being taxed at a lower rate.

832
00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:17.250
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,
next question is,
uh,
what,

833
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:21.350
what asset class do we think is going to have a really high returns over the

834
00:56:21.351 --> 00:56:26.140
next five years on the carried question.
Um,
uh,
you know,
this is something that,

835
00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:31.140
uh,
you know,
has been pretty well,
uh,
um,
you know,

836
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:34.570
sort of surface,
uh,
you know,
um,
there,

837
00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:39.590
there are a bunch of arguments from different sides of the political spectrum,

838
00:56:40.940 --> 00:56:43.120
uh,
on this.
Um,
you know,

839
00:56:43.121 --> 00:56:47.590
folks like ourselves who have had a carried interest,

840
00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:52.300
a taxed at capital gains rates since the 1930s.

841
00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.460
Uh,
um,
you know,

842
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:57.400
we're sort of wondering where the whole discussion is coming from.
A,

843
00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:02.380
in other words,
this,
this has been going on for longer than I've been alive.

844
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:07.530
Uh,
that,
that,
um,
you know,
this has been a capital gains treatment,
uh,

845
00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:11.800
uh,
item.
Uh,
the way,
uh,
uh,

846
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:16.890
carried interest works is we get a 20% a share of the profits of any investment,

847
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.450
uh,
over,
uh,
some type of a hurdle rate,

848
00:57:22.451 --> 00:57:27.290
which is a minimum return.
Uh,
in our case,
usually it's around 8%,
uh,

849
00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:31.300
to,
uh,
uh,
to get this,
uh,
uh,

850
00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:35.020
a carried interest.
Um,
uh,
you know,

851
00:57:35.021 --> 00:57:39.190
we have to invest significant monies,
uh,
you know,
in,

852
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:43.330
in our funds,
um,
which is totally unlike normal compensation.

853
00:57:43.331 --> 00:57:46.720
Most people to get,
you know,
sort of,
you know,

854
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:50.470
some people in the government want to characterize this as normal compensation,

855
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:55.480
ordinary income.
Uh,
people get ordinary income just work and they get it.

856
00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.010
They normally don't invest millions of dollars for the opportunity to get their

857
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:04.960
salary.
Uh,
uh,
we also,
uh,
have to,
uh,

858
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:05.341
if,

859
00:58:05.341 --> 00:58:10.210
if we don't make a certain minimum return and we've gotten some of this carried

860
00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:11.980
interest by the time a whole funds over,

861
00:58:11.981 --> 00:58:15.160
we have to pay the carried interest back.
Um,

862
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:20.200
most people who own an ordinary income don't pay back there,

863
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:24.670
uh,
income,
uh,
after they've gotten it.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,

864
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:30.100
uh,
in,
in,
uh,
a carried interest basically comes out of,
you know,

865
00:58:30.101 --> 00:58:34.750
splitting the profits from a partnership where,
um,
uh,

866
00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.840
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
uh,

867
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:42.900
sort of quite normal for a working partner to get more of a deal than just a

868
00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:48.670
passive,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

869
00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:53.410
investor,
uh,
in,
you know,
whether it's somebody just in a,
in a,

870
00:58:53.411 --> 00:58:56.790
in a family,
somebody works in the business,
um,
you know,

871
00:58:56.830 --> 00:59:00.760
and somebody else in the family puts up the money to buy part of the business.

872
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.870
Usually the person working in the business gets more.
Uh,
so we,

873
00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:09.070
we sort of look at this,
uh,
as a,
as sort of a,
um,

874
00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:14.550
an issue that's now in the political world.
Uh,
and,
uh,
you know,

875
00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:18.670
it will be solved in that world.
We don't,
we don't have much of a say,
uh,
in that.

876
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.630
Uh,
uh,
but I,
I would that the,
the sort of,
um,

877
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:29.140
a characterization of this as being something,
uh,
uh,

878
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:33.180
as,
as a,
uh,
uh,
you know,
sort of,
uh,
you know,

879
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:36.890
sort of an odd thing.
Uh,
it's,
it's,

880
00:59:36.891 --> 00:59:40.430
it's really been going on for eight years.

881
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:45.490
So I don't quite understand exactly why it's officially odd now.

882
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:50.840
And it hasn't been for,
you know,
all that time period.
A second.

883
00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:54.960
The second part of that question is,
uh,
W I,

884
00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:58.070
I'll ask it a different way than it was a asked,

885
00:59:58.071 --> 01:00:03.071
which is what's going to be the best performing asset class over the next five

886
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:07.520
years.
Uh,
or I think that was more or less what you were asking.

887
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:11.480
Um,
and,
um,
I,
you know,
it's,
it's,

888
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:16.430
it's always hard to tell exactly,
uh,
what,
what that will be.
Uh,

889
01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.420
but,
but typically,
you know,
you have to have a view of the world.
And I,

890
01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:22.940
I think our view of the world is that,
you know,

891
01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:27.590
the economies of the developed countries or are going to get hurt,

892
01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:28.341
uh,

893
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:33.200
over the next year or so ought to drive down asset values,

894
01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.830
variety of types.
Uh,
and that,
uh,
there,

895
01:00:37.831 --> 01:00:42.650
there should be a great opportunity,
uh,
out about,
uh,

896
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.011
you know,

897
01:00:43.011 --> 01:00:47.840
as sort of a year to start buying companies and other types of assets,

898
01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:53.060
uh,
at,
at what should prove to be a bottom.
Uh,
and then,
um,
uh,

899
01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:57.290
if you can leverage those assets as the economy keeps getting better,

900
01:00:57.770 --> 01:01:02.750
you'll make a really great returns.
The last time,
uh,
this,
this,

901
01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:07.760
uh,
set of circumstances presented themselves was 2002,
uh,

902
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:11.790
after the recession in 2001,
uh,
uh,

903
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:15.920
which went into 2002.
And we were the biggest purchaser of,

904
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:20.240
uh,
of,
uh,
uh,
companies in the world,
uh,

905
01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:24.290
in 2003 in 2004.
And as a result of that,

906
01:01:24.291 --> 01:01:28.490
the fund that we use to buy those companies,
uh,
earned,
uh,

907
01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:33.040
about 51%,
uh,
after fees.
Um,
uh,

908
01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:37.000
which,
uh,
um,
for those who keep score of these things is,

909
01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.530
is really quite extraordinary.

910
01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:44.531
And we think that kind of cycle is going to repeat itself.

911
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:47.600
So,
so we would think that that,
you know,

912
01:01:47.601 --> 01:01:52.010
the private equity business and you know,
you,
you're seeing now,
uh,

913
01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:56.750
we've just involved with the deal that professor Shiller mentioned.
Uh,
uh,

914
01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.220
you know,
it was in the newspaper this week I guess,
uh,
where,
um,
you know,

915
01:02:01.221 --> 01:02:04.560
we were buying assets,
uh,
from a,

916
01:02:04.561 --> 01:02:08.870
a Citibank loans at discounts and,
you know,
uh,

917
01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:14.210
there'll be opportunities in the debt area over the next year or so.

918
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.780
Uh,
that,
that also ought to be a very good,

919
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.813
yes.

920
01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.120
<v 4>How'd you deal with failures</v>

921
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.460
and how do you make that private equity mobile?

922
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.780
<v 1>Uh,
the question is how do,
how do,
how do we deal with failure?</v>

923
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.260
Like I like our Argentinian,
uh,

924
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:40.360
investment in the second part of that was,

925
01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:48.830
and how do we think private equity will evolve in the future?
Uh,
how,

926
01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:53.880
how do we deal with failure?
I really hate failure.
I mean,

927
01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:57.210
it's,
it's deep.
It's visceral.

928
01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.040
I really can't stand it.
Uh,
and,
uh,

929
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.920
because I feel so passionately about that.
The,
the,
the,

930
01:03:06.921 --> 01:03:11.340
the people who work at our firm,
uh,

931
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:14.160
all of whom I've been involved hiring,

932
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:19.740
understand how I feel about failure.
Uh,
and so,

933
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.130
so we don't have a lot of people around who like failing either one,

934
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:25.110
because they don't want to disappoint me.
But two,

935
01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:29.850
because I don't hire people who don't feel the same,

936
01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.270
right?
So this is like a passion not to fail.

937
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:38.580
So when we fail,
it's a major,
major,

938
01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:43.590
major event.
Okay?
It's just not a normal thing.

939
01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:46.890
And what we do when we fail,

940
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:52.190
so we spend enormous time thinking through what did we do wrong?

941
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:57.930
What should we have seen our,
our processes?
Uh,
good.

942
01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.190
Uh,

943
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:03.930
did we miss identify a variable that got us,

944
01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:09.330
uh,
or did we identify it and didn't,
didn't,

945
01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.710
uh,
evaluate how bad that can be.
We've got that wrong.

946
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.610
Or did we just simply have bad luck where they were like three or four bad

947
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:22.080
things that can happen?
And they all happened like in,
uh,
uh,
in,
in,

948
01:04:22.081 --> 01:04:26.880
in a very rapid period of time.
And,
uh,
you know,
failure is a,

949
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.910
how you manage failure is very important.

950
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.400
And some people manage failure by making,

951
01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:37.140
pretend it didn't happen and they just go about their jobs and people don't pay

952
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:40.560
attention.
Well we lost money on that one.
I don't believe in that.
I,

953
01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.450
I like to learn.

954
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:47.570
Sometimes you learn more from your failures than you do from your successes.
And,

955
01:04:47.571 --> 01:04:48.341
and we,
we,

956
01:04:48.341 --> 01:04:52.830
we actually changed the way we made decisions at the whole firm after a very

957
01:04:52.831 --> 01:04:56.820
early failure that we had had and changed our whole investment process.

958
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:01.860
And that one failure created most of our successes.
Right?

959
01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:06.060
So failure when you make a lot of decisions,

960
01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.720
I used to think we could make no mistakes.
Uh,

961
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:11.930
and that's what I always try and do.
Uh,

962
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.800
but if you're very active in making decisions,
you,

963
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:23.370
I think about this stuff so much that we probably get about a 90

964
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:32.500
to 93% of our decisions.
Correct.
Um,

965
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:37.180
maybe a tiny bit higher,
but that means we failed a lot.
Right?

966
01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.430
So to the 7% failure,

967
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:43.030
sometimes we get 95% right?

968
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:47.290
But we're still making 5% failure,
you know,
across the firm.

969
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:51.340
And so we're always struggling to improve.

970
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:56.080
And get that down to almost like nothing.

971
01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.420
Uh,
and,
and so,
you know,
failure is a really important element,

972
01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.070
uh,
in learning.
It's like bad dating,
right?
You date somebody,

973
01:06:06.071 --> 01:06:10.690
it doesn't work out.
That's the way,
by the way,
most dating is.

974
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.770
It doesn't work out,
uh,
works out for a while,
then it doesn't work out.
And,

975
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.460
and so all of you would probably think about,

976
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.780
what did I learn from this?
Why,
why did I get involved with this person?

977
01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:28.240
Was this a good thing on balance or not a good thing?
Uh,
you know,

978
01:06:28.241 --> 01:06:32.620
am I gonna repeat this mistake in the future?
What did I learn?
Right?

979
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:37.300
And that's what we all do in our own lives,
and we do it in our commercial life,

980
01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:42.130
uh,
as well.
Second part of that question was the evolution.
Uh,
on private equity.

981
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:47.790
Private equity is an enduring asset class because it basically makes really

982
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:53.230
great returns.
Uh,
it attracts very talented people.
Uh,

983
01:06:53.231 --> 01:06:58.050
it reallocates capital around the globe.
Uh,
it goes where there's,
um,

984
01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.260
uh,
um,
Opportunity,
uh,
and,

985
01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:06.570
and it improves companies by investing more capital in these,
uh,

986
01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.590
businesses.
Uh,
and so there's a,
there's a,
there's an enduring place,

987
01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.920
uh,
for private equity.
Uh,

988
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.680
right now there's a capital crunch and there's not much money available to bar

989
01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:22.430
except on smaller deals.
Uh,
that circumstance happened,
uh,
uh,

990
01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:25.300
briefly in 2002,
it happened.
1990,

991
01:07:25.301 --> 01:07:29.900
91 half in 1987 happened.
1982 happen.

992
01:07:29.901 --> 01:07:33.970
1975.
So it happens.
Uh,

993
01:07:33.971 --> 01:07:37.480
and when it happens,
everybody always says,
oh my goodness,

994
01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:39.630
this business is going away and so forth.

995
01:07:39.631 --> 01:07:44.260
And that never ends up occurring because capital always comes back.
Uh,

996
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:45.730
the evolution of the business.

997
01:07:45.731 --> 01:07:50.731
We'll have a few super bracket kind of firms like ourselves who keep attracting

998
01:07:52.301 --> 01:07:55.510
more and more capital,
who are investing globally,

999
01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:59.090
who have people all over the world.
Uh,
and,
and,

1000
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:04.090
and the future for these kinds of businesses I think is,
uh,
is,
is,
is pretty good.

1001
01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.070
Um,
quite good.
And,
uh,
um,
uh,

1002
01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:13.360
you know,
you have smaller firms that are in individual countries.
Uh,

1003
01:08:13.450 --> 01:08:18.410
sometimes a segmented,
uh,
by,
um,
uh,
area of concentration.

1004
01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.680
You know,
you'll have a healthcare,
you know,
group,
uh,
uh,

1005
01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:25.910
and some of those businesses will do well.
Some were wither.
Uh,

1006
01:08:25.911 --> 01:08:30.690
you have smaller firms that do smaller kinds of deals.
There's always a place,
uh,

1007
01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:35.150
for,
for that.
Uh,
so,
so I think that,
um,
uh,

1008
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:39.920
private equity tends to grow and step functions,
uh,
you know,
uh,
as,

1009
01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:44.840
as a function of how much money institutions have to put in the class.
Uh,

1010
01:08:44.841 --> 01:08:49.640
when,
uh,
stock markets go down and institutions generally have less money,

1011
01:08:49.641 --> 01:08:53.240
they put less money in the class,
uh,
when the markets get better,

1012
01:08:53.241 --> 01:08:56.180
they put more money.
So it's not a straight line of growth.

1013
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:59.540
It's a little wavy like that.
And I think that will continue.

1014
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:06.500
I think
what I think we're done.
