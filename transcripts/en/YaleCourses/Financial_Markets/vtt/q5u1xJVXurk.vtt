1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.630
Before I begin,
I wanted to,
um,

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.770
say something about our speaker on Wednesday.
Uh,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.080
Andrew Red Leaf.
Uh,
first of all,
uh,

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.410
he had accepted our invitation to go to lunch with some of you.
So,

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.490
um,
I want to arrange an event,
uh,

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.070
actually at one of the colleges,
a cafeteria and I haven't figured out,

7
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:28.820
maybe one of you has a suggestion.
Uh,

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.980
especially if we can get a,

9
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.330
see what college he was here that we did it in his college cause he graduated

10
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:39.450
from Iu.
Um,
I forgotten which one that was.

11
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.370
It had a nice room upstairs.
Uh,

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.450
so maybe I'll try to get that one again cause he said he doesn't particularly

13
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:51.840
care.
Maybe I should take them to another one
maybe.
Yeah,

14
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.820
if you can suggest the college,
uh,
which has a nice room for,

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.160
and then it will be both.
I'll come and readily full come.
Uh,

16
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.060
and uh,
uh,
so that's,
that's this Wednesday.

17
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.620
And uh,

18
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.550
so what I'm going to do is email you the details.

19
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.580
If you could email me if you're interested in coming and so we can have a good

20
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:24.600
size group and a discussion.
Okay.
Uh,

21
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.420
so I just wanted to say a little bit about red leaf.
Uh,
he,
uh,

22
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.340
founded white box advisers,
uh,
in 2000,

23
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.670
so that's eight years ago,
uh,

24
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.760
and is now up to 1.8 billion assets under management.

25
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.500
So,
uh,

26
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.560
assets under management is how much money he's drawn in from investors.

27
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.300
So he's doing quite well.
Uh,
and,
uh,

28
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.430
he has some celebrity status among hedge fund managers.

29
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.350
Uh,
normally I put on the website,
um,

30
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.920
for that verb March 5th,
under our class syllabus,

31
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.960
a New York Times article about him entitled curiosity has its merits.

32
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.600
Uh,
I guess it struck the author of that article that,
uh,

33
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.280
uh,
red leaf is just a very guy who was very curious about a lot of things.

34
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.680
He wants to know how things work and why things are happening.
Uh,
and,
uh,

35
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.330
that might be a natural impulse and some people have that more than others.

36
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.720
It's probably a good impulse to have if you're going into investment,

37
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.760
but of course he turns it into a productive purpose.
Uh,

38
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.280
and so there were a couple of examples from that article.
One is that,
uh,

39
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.440
there's a literature in finance about options and stock price performance,

40
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.930
uh,
which goes back 10 years.

41
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.980
That shows that something is not quite right with the way companies issue

42
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.950
options.
Uh,
so let me,
let me remind you what happens.

43
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.130
What's happening increasingly is that employees are top executive employees,

44
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.420
at least in companies,

45
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.050
are rewarded as part of their compensation with options on the value of the

46
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:24.430
stock of the company they work for.
So you work for Xyz Corporation,

47
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.420
the share is trading at $10 a share.

48
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.310
They would give you at the money or out of the money options,

49
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:37.570
say options to buy the stock at $11 a share.
All right?

50
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.150
That's $1 more than it costs now in the market.

51
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.650
So those options are worthless unless the price of the stock goes up.

52
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.150
And so that's supposed to incentivize you as a manager to get the stock price
up,

53
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.050
uh,
and then you make money if the price of the stock rises above,

54
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.100
in that case $11 a share.
So that all that is fine.

55
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:01.210
It sounds good that managers should be given options because it will incentivize

56
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.360
them to work for the benefit of the corporation.

57
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.790
The problem is that's been revealed in finance literature is that,

58
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.793
uh,

59
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.080
there's an uncanny tendency for the stock price to go up after the company

60
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:22.090
awards,
large quantities of options to its executives.

61
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.390
That sounds suspicious.
I mean,
you could say,

62
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:28.910
well that means the options are really working well because it really motivated

63
00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:32.230
the managers and they did something and made the company worth more.

64
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.080
But if it suddenly goes up right after their issue,

65
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.090
you kind of suspect that something is something is screwy here.

66
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.140
And so there's,

67
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.140
there's been a number of articles that documented that stock prices tend to jump

68
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.190
shortly after options,
our issue to managers.
And so,

69
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.024
um,

70
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.500
the immediate suspicion that this raise and think it's more than a suspicion is

71
00:04:56.501 --> 00:05:01.300
that companies will time announcement of good news until after they issue the

72
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.800
options right there.

73
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.520
The managers of the companies that are kind of a group helping each other,
right?

74
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.620
Let's,
let's award options to each other.
Uh,
and then after we award them,

75
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:14.980
we'll announce the good news and the stock price will go up and you guys will

76
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:19.000
get money.
Okay.
There's a tax incentive to do that.

77
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.290
If they awarded a options that were in the money,

78
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:27.470
that means already exercisable at profit,
uh,

79
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.680
then they would be subject to a tax liability immediately.
Uh,

80
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.770
so they don't want to do that.

81
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:37.150
So they want to issue them out of the money and then announced the news that

82
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:41.500
brings them into money.
Uh,
and so that's been proven that companies do that.

83
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.430
More recently,
there was a,
and I was just reading about this in the,

84
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.860
in the times there was an article,
um,
by,
uh,

85
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.390
Eric Lee that,
uh,

86
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.890
showed that it's not just announcement of news that does it.

87
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.560
It's also that companies must be backdating options because Alicia,

88
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.780
that some of the price jumps that occur after the options are issued couldn't

89
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:12.680
possibly have been manipulated by the company's news announcements.

90
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.890
It must've been that they somehow knew on the issuance date that the stock price

91
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:22.190
was going to go up,
but he said they couldn't possibly know that,
uh,

92
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.840
in these general circumstances.

93
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.200
So Lee concluded that companies were fraudulent Lee backdating options.

94
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.040
He concluded this on the basis of a statistical test.
You see what I'm saying?

95
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.900
If stock price option,

96
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:40.430
if stock options tend to be issued as announced by the company later,

97
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.270
uh,
on just before stock prices go up,

98
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.890
there's no way that that can be right because nobody can know exactly when the

99
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:50.300
stock price is going to go up.

100
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.370
So they must have been lying about the date that they issued the options.
Okay.

101
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.840
So that you understand that issue about backdating it was,

102
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.230
this article by Eric Lee was uh,
uh,

103
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:07.220
something of a scandal and it led them to regulatory authorities,
uh,

104
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.323
to,
uh,

105
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.830
his name is Eric Lee regulatory authorities.

106
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:18.950
Then realize that some things,
there's some fraud going on.
Not most corporations,

107
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.260
I think Leah identified a small number,

108
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:25.420
but definitely some of them that were lying about the day,

109
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.510
you know what I'm saying?

110
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.510
They would announce a in December that we issued back in August these options to

111
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:35.150
our executives.
Funny thing,
the uh,
uh,

112
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.620
stock price sword right between August and December when they announced it.

113
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.540
So the regulatory authorities are start,
we're starting to look into this.

114
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.600
That's fraud to backdate options.
So what does Andrew Red Leaf does?

115
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.800
He decided to do his own study parallel to Eric leaves and much more pervasive.

116
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.980
So he was going after himself,

117
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.310
finding out all the companies that we're backdating options,

118
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.810
trying to beat the SEC and the regulatory authorities to the conclusion.

119
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.350
And then what'd he do?
He shorted the stocks or whatever the benefit.

120
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.010
Once they're investigated their stock prices and their bond prices are going to

121
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:15.230
fall.
So he,
he did the,

122
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.570
he found out who they were using similar methods to Lee's and uh,

123
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.680
and profited from it.
Is that a good thing?
Well,
that's the way Wall Street works,

124
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.600
or at least a 10.
Some people say markets are efficient and every,

125
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.970
the stock price is incorporate all information.
Well,

126
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.860
I don't think they are efficient.
And this is an example of readily,
for example,

127
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.020
you know,
in a sense a efficient markets would require that everybody,

128
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.690
every analyst rushes out and completes Eric [inaudible] study.
Uh,

129
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.900
but they don't,
I dunno,
it's just,
there isn't enough,
uh,
initiative in the,

130
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.090
in the world.
Not many people do it.

131
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.300
So red leaf was able to figure out who was going to get hit for the backdating

132
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.250
scandal before,
uh,
before other people did.

133
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.020
And then that was an advantage.

134
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.320
I'll give another example of red leafs success.
General Motors,

135
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.431
uh,
as you know,

136
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:16.431
as an auto producer in the United States and it hasn't been doing well,

137
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.010
uh,
as you may have heard,
uh,
as,

138
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.620
as the general auto industry in this country,
it's,

139
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.630
it's suffering under competition from abroad.
Uh,

140
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.360
and so Andrew Red Leaf bought General Motors bonds,

141
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.980
which are selling at a discount because people worry that General Motors won't

142
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:39.960
be able to pay on them.
And then he asked to speak to the General Motors,

143
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:40.794
that management,

144
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.170
and he went there and he made a plea that General Motors should cut its
dividend.

145
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.440
It pays to stockholders,
uh,

146
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.650
which is a reasonable thing to do if they're,
if they're failing,

147
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.120
they should cut their dividend.

148
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.420
But companies are reluctant to do that because it looks bad.

149
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.750
And so they hold off for a long time,
not cutting,

150
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:03.870
but red leaf went in and said,
you should really do it.

151
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.990
And he convinced him apparently,
and they cut their dividend.

152
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.570
Well after that the bond price went up because people saw that as a sign that

153
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:15.910
the company was tightening its belt and you know,

154
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:19.080
doing things right to have money to pay off the bond holders.

155
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.040
So it was self interested.
I suppose he,
maybe you can ask him about this,

156
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.400
but it was also what we call shareholder activism or investor activism that he

157
00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:32.790
was getting involved in changing the way corporations do business.

158
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:37.320
So,
uh,
those are just a couple of examples of,

159
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.000
of red leaf and what he does.
Uh,
so I admire him.

160
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.540
I think he has a,

161
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.100
it's his curiosity and diligence that he finds a investment opportunities.

162
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:55.871
And he's another example that markets are really not efficient or they're

163
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.540
efficient enough that you have to work hard to find opportunities,
but,

164
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.610
but not,
uh,
not perfectly.
Okay.

165
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.600
So today I want to talk about banking.
And,
uh,
this,

166
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:13.050
this ties in somewhat to my previous lecture,

167
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:18.051
which was unreal estate because banks are major real estate lenders and

168
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:20.790
investors in real estate securities.

169
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.120
And we're going through a subprime crisis right now,

170
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.660
which is a banking crisis as well.
Uh,

171
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:32.600
and so I will talk a little bit about,
um,
about what we,
um,

172
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.590
what we discussed last time.
Uh,

173
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.960
but anyway,
I wanted to start out with the most fundamental thing is,

174
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:47.400
um,
what are banks?
Okay.
What does a bank,
uh,

175
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.000
and,
uh,
so,
uh,

176
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.840
historically money lenders of one sort or another go back,
uh,

177
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.130
to who knows how far back thousands of years.

178
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.840
So you might say banks existed in ancient times,
but,
um,

179
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.560
the history of banking often goes back only a matter of hundreds of years.

180
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.560
Uh,
and one of the stories that,
uh,
uh,

181
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.430
is often told is the goldsmith bankers.

182
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:22.690
The story that goes back,
I don't know how many hundred years,

183
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.940
goldsmiths or people who,
uh,
work in gold,

184
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:31.340
they make jewelry and gold,
silver or gold where,
and the,
uh,

185
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.860
whatever coffee urns,
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

186
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.610
they would store a goal and they would have a safe or some sort of safekeeping.

187
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.310
And so a lot of people would,
um,

188
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.030
ask them since they had a safekeeping for gold,

189
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.990
could you put my goal in your safe?
Uh,

190
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.910
and the Goldsmith,
uh,

191
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.630
would accept that as part of an extension of the business as a goldsmith.

192
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.840
Uh,
and,
um,

193
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:07.270
especially if the,
if the goal was in the form of coins and people didn't care,

194
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.760
uh,
whether they got the same coins back,

195
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.980
the Gold Smith then discovered all this gold sitting in my safe,

196
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:20.320
uh,
is just sitting there.
Why don't I learned some of it out?
Okay.

197
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.040
And I can earn interest on the loan and make money.
Uh,

198
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.940
and meanwhile,
when people,
well,

199
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.640
when people come back to ask for their gold,

200
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.410
as long as they're willing to take other gold,
that's apparently what they,

201
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.040
they don't care whether it's the same coins.

202
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.780
I'll have enough still in my safe so that I can pay them off.

203
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:46.490
Okay.
And so it,
it kind of just happened,
uh,
it was,
you know what,

204
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.320
it would happen to anyone who was a goldsmith because it's just the logical

205
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:51.610
extension of the business.

206
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.380
Some customers want to use your safe because safes are hard and expensive to

207
00:13:56.381 --> 00:14:00.250
get,
uh,
and,
and some,
and then you've got all this gold,

208
00:14:00.251 --> 00:14:05.080
so you might as well end it out.
So it started out that way as a,

209
00:14:05.081 --> 00:14:09.610
what we call fractional reserves.
And that is

210
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.140
the goldsmith only had a fraction of the gold that was in,

211
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.400
uh,
owed by,
by the Goldsmith.
So,
uh,

212
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.050
the goldsmith might also write notes,
uh,

213
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.360
promising so much gold and not promising a,

214
00:14:31.361 --> 00:14:35.650
the return of any particular item of gold.
And so the golden was signed,

215
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.850
his name on it saying,
I promise to give so many ounces of gold.

216
00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.290
And in some cases they were there notes.

217
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.660
That means that the goldsmith would pay it to the bearer and other cases they

218
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:54.410
would have the name of the person on them,

219
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.050
but bearer notes became very important.

220
00:14:57.051 --> 00:14:59.750
So the Goldsmith in your town writes out a note saying,

221
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:04.380
I will pay to the bearer of this note.
So much gold.
Uh,

222
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.970
and then the bearer,
it'd be anyone,
uh,

223
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.630
that you still have to hide the note for from theft,

224
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.510
but at least you don't have to hide a whole bunch of gold from theft.

225
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:20.290
And so that's how paper money got started as bearer notes because if you had

226
00:15:20.931 --> 00:15:24.830
gold with the Goldsmith,
you could,
uh,
spend the note,

227
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.730
at least within the town that you live in are where the goldsmith was known and

228
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:30.860
had a reputation.
Uh,

229
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:35.861
and so that's the whole idea of how banking got started.

230
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.770
Um,
so,
uh,

231
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.650
on how paper money he got started in,
at least in the West,
uh,

232
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.610
there's a different history in China.
Uh,
so,
okay.

233
00:15:49.611 --> 00:15:52.850
So there are different kinds of banks.
Uh,

234
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:55.580
today I'm going to jump to modern times.

235
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.340
And the most important time is called

236
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.140
<v 1>commercial bank.
Okay.</v>

237
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:05.400
And

238
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.600
<v 0>a commercial bank,</v>

239
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.800
like a Goldsmith banker accepts deposits.

240
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:11.790
It's critical.

241
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.610
That means you can put money in the bank,
uh,

242
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.180
and it makes loans.
Okay.
Very simple.

243
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:24.993
<v 1>Uh,</v>

244
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.190
<v 0>and so the,</v>

245
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:31.140
it pays interest on the deposit and it collects interest on the loans and it

246
00:16:31.141 --> 00:16:33.000
charges a higher interest on the loan,

247
00:16:33.001 --> 00:16:36.480
then they pay on the deposit and the differences there,
profit.

248
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.980
And that's how they make money.
Uh,
so that's,
uh,

249
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.170
and uh,
in addition to commercial banks,

250
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.620
um,
we,
uh,

251
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.310
well I'm not going to talk about investment banks here in this.

252
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.380
That's another lecture.

253
00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.540
Investment banks are very different in that a pure investment bank does not

254
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:04.110
accept deposits.
Uh,
and it doesn't make loans.

255
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.250
It's an underwriter for securities.
So,
uh,

256
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:10.440
I'm not talking about investment banks in this.

257
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.540
I'm talking about commercial banks,

258
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:18.170
which accept deposits from depositors and traditionally commercial banks,

259
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.360
uh,
did not deal with the general public.
Uh,

260
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.550
they were for wealthy people and business people.

261
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And the traditional commercial bank would accept deposits from businesses and

262
00:17:32.041 --> 00:17:36.930
make loans to businesses.
Uh,
and that's the,
uh,
but the other,

263
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:37.893
uh,

264
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.920
kinds of depositary institution that have developed are called thrifts.

265
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.090
Uh,
and it really started from a movement,
um,

266
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.040
uh,
in the United Kingdom.
That's the way I do the history.

267
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:57.630
It may have some other version if you look further.
But in the United Kingdom,

268
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.900
there was a movement,
uh,
in the early 19th century to fat set up,
uh,

269
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.050
saving banks,
which were for,

270
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.170
uh,
this was an effort to democratize finances.

271
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:16.190
I would put it for ordinary people to have the opportunity to make small

272
00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:21.570
deposits.
It used to be that people would hide money in their house and it would

273
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:24.780
frequently get stolen and it didn't earn any interest.

274
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.480
And so saving there was a savings bank movement,

275
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.780
which spread from the u s from the UK to the US in the 19th century.

276
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.500
Uh,
and it was a philanthropic movement.
Uh,
in other words,

277
00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:42.501
wealthy people in an effort to alleviate tenurey would create a savings bank.

278
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.050
So,
for example,
here in new haven,

279
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:49.680
we had one created called the new haven saving bank,
uh,

280
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.590
which lasted for over a hundred years and it was taken over.

281
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:58.410
It's now called alliance bank.
It's no longer a saving back.
Uh,

282
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.270
but,
uh,
a lot of these savings banks tend to be very old institutions that,
um,

283
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.060
um,
that go back to the 19th century.
And,

284
00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:09.983
uh,

285
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.490
another example is the saving and loan

286
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.400
association.
Uh,

287
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.080
this is also,
you know,
I keep thinking how British we are.

288
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:28.590
This is New England and this is the United States,
a former British colony.

289
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.250
A lot of things that we do here have their origins in Britain.

290
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.700
This also came from a UK movement called the Building Society Movement,

291
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.900
uh,
which spread to the u s so [inaudible] savings and loans are the same as

292
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:46.510
building societies.
Uh,
but the idea is,
uh,

293
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.410
the original idea and the,
the,

294
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.480
and also the general idea today is that these are banks set up for a small

295
00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:59.631
savers in order that they can buy a house so that that savings and loans

296
00:19:59.701 --> 00:20:04.701
traditionally have made most of their loans in the form of home mortgages.

297
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.300
So the idea,
it was a lot of people can't afford to have a house.

298
00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:14.730
It's all get together and pool our money and then we'll in a building society or

299
00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:20.721
saving and Loan Association and then we'll loan will loan out to some of us to

300
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:24.420
buy the house,
uh,
and it will help,
uh,

301
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.070
rather than all trying to do it individually.
Uh,

302
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.890
and then there's also something called credit unions.

303
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.270
Credit unions are they,

304
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:42.390
I think they came out of kind of the cooperative movement.

305
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.260
There's a lot of social movements that have some idealism behind them.

306
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:51.530
I think maybe the same movement that created the Yale Cooperative Society in the

307
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:55.480
late 18th century,
the 19th century,
uh,

308
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.610
also spurred credit union.

309
00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:02.980
A credit union is a kind of club of people who belong to some organization or

310
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:07.540
live in one town or are somehow connected,
uh,

311
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.780
which is the boast to,
uh,

312
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.070
accept deposits and make loans to the members,
uh,

313
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.800
for things including home mortgages,

314
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:21.220
but going broader than that into automobile loans.

315
00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.850
But it wouldn't have been automobile loans when these are created,
I dunno,

316
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.480
something loans,
um,
et cetera.

317
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.680
So it's like a saving and loan association,

318
00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.840
except that credit unions are created by some entity,

319
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:35.890
some club or group,

320
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:40.540
and they're not open to the whole public savings and loan associations by the

321
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:44.740
way,
no longer exclusively limit themselves to mortgage lending,

322
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.760
either that they do home improvement lending and uh,
and uh,

323
00:21:48.761 --> 00:21:53.410
auto loans and the like as well.
Okay.

324
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.440
So I wanted to give you some idea of the size of these.

325
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.960
So I have data on the total assets of these classes of bank in the United

326
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.590
States,
uh,
as of,
uh,

327
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.230
2007 third corner.
That's my date.

328
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:15.820
Uh,
so,
uh,

329
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.100
commercial banks had put it down here.

330
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.130
Uh,
10,000,

331
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:28.570
872 billion in assets,
or that's 10,

332
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:33.810
10 point $8 trillion of assets at the end of 2007,

333
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.830
about 20% of that is actually foreign.
Uh,

334
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.890
we've had a lot of big foreign commercial banks come in to the u s uh,

335
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.710
it's not as big as in some other countries.
If you go down to Mexico,

336
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.990
their main commercial banks are almost entirely foreign today.

337
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.800
But in the U S it's stands at,
uh,
uh,
well,

338
00:22:56.801 --> 00:22:59.950
I know the domestic figure of commercial banks,

339
00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:05.200
the assets of domestic commercial banks is seven,

340
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.150
nine,
eight,
7 billion.
So it's about $8 trillion.

341
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.010
Uh,
that's,

342
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:15.820
that's domestic banks.

343
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.270
So,
uh,
those are the big ones.
Uh,
but if you look at,
um,
uh,

344
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.460
now I have these two lump together,
uh,
I don't have them separately.

345
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.810
Um,
in 2007,
three,

346
00:23:34.811 --> 00:23:39.130
they were one,
eight,
six,

347
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:43.690
8 billion.
That's almost $2 trillion.

348
00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:47.540
So they're much smaller,
uh,
savings,
banks and savings and loans.

349
00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:50.190
Then the commercial banks,
and,
uh,

350
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.620
the credit unions are even smaller,
uh,

351
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.940
748 $1 billion.

352
00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:03.380
So it's less than 1 trillion in credit unions.
So when we speak of banks,

353
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.810
it is overwhelmingly commercial banks that matter.
Uh,
but,

354
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.880
um,
there's another way to rate these rank.

355
00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:17.300
These is by numbers,
a number of banks,

356
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.430
and that gives you a very different look.

357
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:24.380
If you look at number of organizations that do this business,

358
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:29.660
it comes completely reversed.
And it's credit unions that are the most important.

359
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:34.570
Uh,
and where do I have that here?
Oh,
yeah.
Um,

360
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.250
I don't have the latest data.
This is from 1998,

361
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.670
but there were 11,000 credit unions.

362
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:45.530
That's the number of credit unions in the United States in 1998.
Uh,

363
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:48.020
and there were only 9,000 commercial banks.

364
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.620
That's the number of banks.
Um,
and of the savings institutions,

365
00:24:54.621 --> 00:24:56.540
there was only 1,500.

366
00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.270
It's probably going down further because a lot of these old savings banks are

367
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:07.220
being,
are being converted into commercial banks.
Uh,

368
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.170
so,
uh,
you may have a false impression of the importance of credit union.

369
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:14.500
You hear about credit unions a lot,
uh,

370
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.680
because they're in your neighborhood and they're advertising for small

371
00:25:18.681 --> 00:25:20.480
depositors.
So they're in your face.

372
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.520
But the commercial banks are actually much more important.

373
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.650
Okay.
So,
uh,

374
00:25:29.651 --> 00:25:34.651
I wanted to clarify just what it is that banks do and they're in a first thing

375
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:42.050
to understand is that I start out by telling you the story of the Goldsmith

376
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.430
banker.
And I like to tell that story because it sounds obvious,
right,

377
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.600
that if you were a goldsmith,
uh,
hundreds of years ago,

378
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.790
you would have probably become a banker.

379
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.920
It would just be the natural thing to do,
right?

380
00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:00.880
So banks are natural and fractional reserve banking is a natural thing to do.

381
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:06.290
Hence,
it exists in every country of the world.
It's everywhere.

382
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.420
Uh,
and so it's not,
uh,
uh,

383
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.480
it's not something we can live without.
It must be fundamental reasons for it.

384
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:18.500
And I wanted to go over some of the fundamental reasons

385
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.620
why we have,

386
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:30.510
why we have banks.
Uh,
and I've got three main reasons there.

387
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.780
Uh,
adverse selection,

388
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:37.700
moral hazard and liquidity.
Uh,

389
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:42.740
so,
uh,
in other words,
the bank offers solutions to all three problems.

390
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.260
Adverse selection.

391
00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.990
<v 1>I'll define this in a minute.</v>

392
00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.770
Moral hazard in lending

393
00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.060
and liquidity.
Okay.
So,

394
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.320
<v 0>uh,</v>

395
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:09.320
and this goes beyond the simple Goldsmith banker story that I was a motivating

396
00:27:09.671 --> 00:27:13.750
initially.
So what am I,
what do I mean by adverse selection?

397
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.100
The adverse selection problem when you,
when it comes to Bowers,

398
00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:21.320
people who are trying to borrow money,
uh,

399
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.990
is that if you become a lender a or let's say if you,

400
00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.760
that's how about becoming a lender.

401
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.560
Suppose you are interested in investing in debt of companies.

402
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:34.920
<v 2>Uh,</v>

403
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.320
<v 0>then you as a investor sub are,
are,</v>

404
00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.220
are subject to the problem that you might end up with.

405
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:49.230
The worst stuff.
If you don't watch out,
suppose you,
you know,

406
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:53.850
you,
you are a naive investor and you say,
okay,
I'm going to invest in companies,

407
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.980
uh,
paper,
which is a,
their promises to pay their IOUs.

408
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:01.620
But the problem is I,

409
00:28:01.621 --> 00:28:05.640
being a naive investor could get stuck with the bad stuff.

410
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:11.100
The people who are in the know know who's trustworthy,
uh,
as a,

411
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.030
as a bower and who has a good prospect of paying it back.

412
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.070
But if I go in there ignorantly,
uh,

413
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:22.500
I'm going to get stuck with the worst stuff that's adverse selection that you

414
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:26.600
worry that uh,
someone is going to a,
is not going to get,

415
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.240
you can't judge it well yourself.
And so the fat,
the fat,

416
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:35.270
your ability or inability to judge the ability of a company to pay is,

417
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.860
is very,
uh,
uh,
makes it very difficult for you to invest.

418
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:46.830
<v 2>Uh,
so,
uh,
the,</v>

419
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:47.703
uh,

420
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.090
<v 0>this leads us to,
uh,
uh,</v>

421
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.710
what's called relationship thanking.
Virtually all banking relationship banking.

422
00:28:58.711 --> 00:29:02.190
But the core of banking is relationship banking.

423
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:09.370
Banks are institutions that exist within the community and they are live among

424
00:29:11.871 --> 00:29:16.340
the business people in the community and have an ongoing relationship with him.

425
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:20.480
In fact,
that is essential to banking and

426
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.430
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

427
00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.080
<v 0>and,
and it's,
it's kind of part of the,</v>

428
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.660
the almost call it the definition of a bank.

429
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.300
A bankers play golf a lot.

430
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:36.100
That's because a business people like to play golf and you have to keep your

431
00:29:36.101 --> 00:29:37.990
finger on the pulse of the community.

432
00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.760
Playing golf with the local businessmen is a very thing to do if you're a
banker,

433
00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.870
right?
Because you'll hear the gossip.
It'll all be off the cuff.

434
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.740
Things that no one would want to tell you because they wouldn't want to be on

435
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:54.640
record of having called you up and told you that such and such a company is in

436
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:58.720
trouble,
that they're doing something that I think is looks a little funny to me.

437
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.790
You can't call up the banker and say that,
but if you're playing golf,

438
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.600
it comes out perfectly naturally.
Right.
Are you,

439
00:30:07.601 --> 00:30:11.950
you joined the Yale Club in New York like that and you sit around and talk with

440
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:15.440
people.
Uh,
I remember reading a,
uh,

441
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.080
I like to browse and Manuel books.

442
00:30:17.081 --> 00:30:21.430
I was reading a 19th century book about how to be a banker and the book dress

443
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:23.920
that you've just got to be available.
You know,

444
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:27.670
you're sitting there behind your glass window and someone comes in and wants to

445
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:32.500
chat.
You should be available.
Uh,
[inaudible] what banking is,

446
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:34.750
you're kind of in this but you in a different thing.

447
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:36.940
You're not a regular businessmen and running a business,

448
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:41.050
you're a lender to the businesses.
But as a result,

449
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.000
people invest in banks,

450
00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.770
stock the stock of banks because they understand that these people have a

451
00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:52.510
longterm relationship with business and they are immune from the adverse

452
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:56.140
selection.
You can't stick your bad paper to the,

453
00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:00.710
to the banker who knows everybody in the town,
you know,

454
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.560
he'll figure it out.
And that's the,
um,

455
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.960
and so that's the problem that's solved by bankers.

456
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.190
The other thing is moral hazard,
uh,

457
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:16.780
and this is that companies,
once they borrow money from anybody,

458
00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:21.730
a bank or anyone else,
they have an obligation which is fixed in dollar terms,

459
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.650
right?
Uh,

460
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:28.750
they have an incentive to take big risks because,

461
00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.500
um,
uh,
think of it this way.

462
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:38.080
Suppose here a company that has just borrowed $1 million,
okay?

463
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.180
And now,
hey,
it's looking a little bit for carious here that,
uh,

464
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.650
our business might go under.
So you have an incentive to say,

465
00:31:47.651 --> 00:31:51.250
cause you're the equity holder,
you have an incentive to say,
hey,

466
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:55.720
why don't I just take some big gamble here and not tell anybody.

467
00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:00.070
I'll just take the remaining money and we'll put it in some lottery bet.
Uh,

468
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:00.880
and you know,

469
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.260
one in three chance I'll have $3 million and if it fails,

470
00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:09.670
hey those guys will lose out because you know,
I'm,

471
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.730
I'm going to lose anyway.
I might as well,
if I don't do anything,

472
00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:13.511
I'm going to lose anyway.

473
00:32:13.511 --> 00:32:15.970
I'm just going to be paying back my debts and go bankrupt.

474
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.320
So I'll take a big gamble and then at least I have a one in three chance of

475
00:32:20.321 --> 00:32:23.310
making money.
You see that isn't that compelling?
How are coming?

476
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.940
It doesn't you want to do.
Um,
and so,
uh,

477
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.740
businesses of course can't actually invest in the lottery that would be contrary

478
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:35.350
to the terms of their loan,
but they can do similar things.

479
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:40.280
They can do big gamble type business ventures.
Okay.
Uh,

480
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.690
and so again,
that is a problem that lenders have,
that the,

481
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:45.740
that the,
uh,

482
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:50.870
the company that's borrowing the money has this unfortunate incentive at least

483
00:32:50.871 --> 00:32:53.480
at certain times to take excessive risks.

484
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.260
Because the debtors we'll end up varying the losses and not the debt.

485
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:00.820
The creditors who lent the money will end up,
uh,

486
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.810
we'll end up bearing the losses.

487
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.760
So this is another reason why we want real relationship banking.

488
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:12.260
It's exactly what you find out about when you're playing golf with the other

489
00:33:12.261 --> 00:33:13.660
bankers.
Uh,

490
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.010
and so you're on the phone with this guy all the time and,
uh,

491
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.260
you sniff something out,
uh,
you can,
uh,

492
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:26.140
maybe stop it and so you're watching over the company.
Um,

493
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:30.290
okay.
And,
and the third thing is,
um,

494
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:34.970
is liquidity.
And that is,
uh,

495
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.500
maybe this is,
goes back to the,
I didn't mention it,

496
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:42.680
but it would apply to the old Goldsmith banker story as well.

497
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.030
Liquidity is that banks land long,

498
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.510
uh,
uh,
and borrow short.

499
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.420
But short term,
I mean,
uh,

500
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.730
most of the people who want to borrow money from the banks,

501
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.430
let's talk about businesses were accepting business loans.

502
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.490
They don't want to pay the extra money tomorrow.

503
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.980
If you're borrowing money for a business,

504
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:14.570
you might want to open a store and you want to stock your merchandise.
Uh,

505
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:18.800
and you know,
your business won't prosper for a couple of years,
uh,

506
00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:23.030
or you might be building a factory and you can't pay the money back right away.

507
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:27.290
You need,
you need the loan for years.
But,
uh,

508
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:30.080
investors don't want to tie up their money for years.

509
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.620
So what banks offer a is liquidity and the ability to borrow short even though

510
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:41.360
the loans that are made are long term.
And how do banks do it?

511
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:46.040
They do it with fractional reserves.
They trust to the fact that,

512
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.390
uh,
that the bank,
uh,
uh,

513
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:54.890
that the depositors won't all come on the same day,
just like a Goldsmith banker.

514
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.810
He leaves only enough gold in the safe to cover the kind of withdrawals that are

515
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:04.640
normally accepted.
And so,
uh,
in that case,
the,

516
00:35:04.641 --> 00:35:08.690
the bank can pay interest to depositors and even though the,

517
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:13.750
the deposits are short term and the deposit or can get the money at any time,

518
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:19.060
the deposit is earning interest of a level that can only be made using a on long

519
00:35:19.061 --> 00:35:23.990
term loans.
People can't pay,
can't pay,

520
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.560
they can't pay a high interest if they don't have it as a long term loan.

521
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.700
Now incidentally,

522
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.880
often banks loans to corporations are short term technically.

523
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.200
So the corporation,

524
00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:41.360
it's the bank is both lending short and borrowing short.
Uh,

525
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.820
but in fact they are in practice long term because you have a relationship with

526
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:49.770
your banker.
Okay.

527
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.900
And you play golf with your banker and your banker understands that you have a

528
00:35:54.901 --> 00:35:56.070
business.
It is your friend.

529
00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:00.080
Let's hope your banker understands that your business,
uh,

530
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:03.200
can't pay the money back.
And uh,

531
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:07.850
that the bank has a reputation in the community of helping business people.
Uh,

532
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.730
and so they won't ask for the money even though it's short term loan that they

533
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:15.500
made to the bank won't ask for it back right away.
Uh,

534
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.850
unless you start misbehaving.

535
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:22.470
And so I see it becomes an arm twisting thing because of this risk of moral

536
00:36:22.471 --> 00:36:23.304
hazard.

537
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:28.290
The bank has a threat to take the money back and they are going to find out

538
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:33.140
quickly if you are as a company are behaving wrong.
And so,
uh,
so,

539
00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.800
so it works out under normal circumstances very well.

540
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.500
So it goes beyond all of these.

541
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:43.590
The companies get advice from the banker as well.

542
00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.550
The banker knows everybody in the community and on your playing golf with the

543
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:50.160
banker,
it may go beyond just

544
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.490
collecting information.
The banker might have positive suggestions,
uh,
you know,

545
00:36:56.491 --> 00:36:59.410
you should really do business with so and so,
uh,

546
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:02.610
who has a natural matchup with you.
Uh,

547
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.080
and so bankers require a lot of,
uh,
uh,

548
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.450
prestige and status in their communities.
Uh,

549
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:15.410
and so this is happening all over,
all over the world.
Uh,

550
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:20.280
now banking as a,
uh,

551
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:25.470
it's important to know that banking is bigger,
uh,

552
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:28.290
in developing countries

553
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.020
and an LDL say LDCs less developed countries than in developed countries.

554
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:37.200
Uh,
and that is,

555
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:42.090
it tends to be bigger and that is because less developed countries have less

556
00:37:42.091 --> 00:37:46.110
developed securities regulation and laws and traditions.

557
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.090
So that,
uh,

558
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:53.150
there it often has to be that the only way you can raise money for a business is

559
00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:57.330
through a bank.
In the more advanced countries,

560
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.680
there is more trust in the securities markets.

561
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.910
And so we don't need this relationship banking as much.

562
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:11.730
Um,
but if it's still,
it still becomes very important,
uh,

563
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:16.070
to,
um,
uh,
a lot of things.
Now,
uh,

564
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:21.330
I wanted to mention in this context because I'm emphasizing how,

565
00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:26.280
uh,
banks solve,
help solve the adverse selection and moral hazard problem.

566
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:31.730
I wanted to mention briefly here also the rating agencies which,
uh,

567
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.470
have some fulfill some of these functions and I don't have a,

568
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:39.940
a separate lecture on these.
Uh,

569
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.680
the first rating agency,
uh,
in the world,

570
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.490
uh,
was created by Mr. John Moody

571
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.990
in the u s in 1909.
Uh,

572
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.650
and he was dealing also with the moral hazard and adverse selection problem,

573
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.160
but he had a neat idea.
Um,

574
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.700
and that was a,

575
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:10.710
to give letter grades to securities that represented credit worthiness.

576
00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.160
So the highest grade was a,

577
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.260
uh,
and that was the best grade you could get.
There's no eight pluses.

578
00:39:23.261 --> 00:39:25.330
It sounds a little bit like college,
but not quite.

579
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.240
And then if you weren't quite a,
you were Aa a,

580
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.610
and if you weren't quite a,
you were a,
uh,

581
00:39:33.611 --> 00:39:37.450
and then you can become Ba,
uh,
uh,
all the way down,

582
00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:41.890
I guess to see or beyond that,
then you're failing.
It's just almost like college.

583
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.170
Great.
Uh,
and the idea was that the,

584
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.700
so he set up Moody's Rating Agency and,

585
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:54.820
and the job of Moody's was to give letter grades to securities.
Uh,

586
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.700
and,
uh,
it was a little bit like a bank,
uh,

587
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.090
but it was different because he didn't actually make the loans.
Um,

588
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:08.210
there was another Henry Poor,
uh,

589
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:13.120
set up pores in 1916 on a similar model,

590
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:18.480
and they later merged with standard statistics to become a standard and Poor's s

591
00:40:20.461 --> 00:40:25.420
and p.
And those are the two biggest rating agencies in the U s today.

592
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:29.580
And they're extremely powerful organizations,
um,

593
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.980
because they,
uh,

594
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:38.060
and standard and Poor's also does letter grades a slightly different system,

595
00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.050
but almost the same.
And then there's Fitch is the third,

596
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.510
which is smaller than these two.
Um,

597
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.640
so this is an interesting question.

598
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.180
Do they solve the moral hazard,

599
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:55.800
an adverse selection problem as well as banks do?
Uh,

600
00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:00.930
well there's similar to banks and they have a relationship with the investment

601
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:03.160
community and they,
uh,

602
00:41:03.161 --> 00:41:08.020
they try to stay on top of everything that's happening.
Uh,
and,

603
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:13.000
uh,
they become forces of nature in the u s economy in the sense that,

604
00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.310
uh,
people accept these letter grades with a great authority,

605
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:21.910
uh,
and,
uh,

606
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:25.060
recently,
however,

607
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.710
there is a bit of a scandal regarding these rating agencies because,

608
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.773
uh,

609
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:35.880
they gave AAA ratings to some subprime securities and other words,

610
00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:42.310
securities that were themselves backed by subprime loans.

611
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:48.200
And so this is the subprime scandal showing up.
Uh,

612
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.890
and the,
the question is,
uh,

613
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.360
how can these raging rating agencies,
uh,

614
00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:01.120
manage the current distrust that's developed because they,

615
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.100
uh,
one important thing,

616
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:08.260
John Moody was a very crusty,
um,

617
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:12.410
strong willed man,
uh,
who wrote a couple of books.

618
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:18.310
And in these books he talked about his moral commitment to honest rating of,

619
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:24.050
of securities.
Uh,
and people trusted him and they trusted his organization.
Well,

620
00:42:24.051 --> 00:42:29.030
they still do massively,
although a little bit less than they used to.
Uh,

621
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.950
and uh,
but something Moody's died in the 19th,

622
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:38.530
John Moody died in the 1950s,
but after he died,
uh,

623
00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:43.070
Moody's and Standard and poor did something that moody would not have approved

624
00:42:43.071 --> 00:42:47.990
of is they started accepting fees from the people they rate.
Uh,

625
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:51.380
and so some people think that if you,
you shouldn't do that.

626
00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:55.690
If you're like a professor shouldn't be paid by the students at this,

627
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:59.900
not directly.
Maybe you're paying me indirectly,
but you know,

628
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:03.500
I shouldn't be collecting money from you.
And then awarding grades,

629
00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.130
that wouldn't be right.
But that's what he started to happen to.

630
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:11.870
Some people think that the rating agencies have allowed a kind of moral hazard,

631
00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:14.780
uh,
uh,
to creep into their organization.

632
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.000
So they have been working on improving their methods and they're trying to,
uh,

633
00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:24.050
create divisions within their organizations that prevent the moral hazard from

634
00:43:24.051 --> 00:43:27.450
happening.
I think that going forward,
uh,

635
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.720
both the rating agencies and the banks will be,
uh,

636
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:36.630
very important,
uh,
in our society.
And so,
uh,

637
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.200
the history of financial innovation is always that the,
uh,

638
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:47.710
organizations adapt to crises and the subprime crisis is harming both the

639
00:43:47.871 --> 00:43:52.670
banking sector and the rating agencies at the present time because it's assist

640
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:57.650
situation of stress that that stresses their,
uh,

641
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:02.280
their organizations.
And,
uh,
uh,

642
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:05.720
but I think that it will be a time of a correction.

643
00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:11.880
Um,
I mentioned fractional reserves,
uh,
and I,

644
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.120
um,
uh,

645
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:20.120
the fact that banks whole only a part of their,
uh,

646
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.020
liabilities as reserves,

647
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:28.460
like the Goldsmith banker only holding part of the gold,
uh,
is a problem.

648
00:44:28.461 --> 00:44:32.760
The question is how much reserves should a hold.
Uh,

649
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:36.420
and bank failures occur when there's not enough gold in the vault.

650
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:40.740
And then people start asking for the goal and the Goldsmith banker doesn't have

651
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:45.330
it to give out.
The Basel Accord was in,
uh,

652
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:50.150
1988,
and you can read about this in detail in,
um,

653
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.830
for Bozi had,
uh,
uh,

654
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.570
was an international convention that,
uh,
uh,

655
00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:03.840
gave what they call risk based capital requirements,
uh,

656
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:08.080
and recommended risk based capital requirements,
uh,

657
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.680
to bank regulators around the world.

658
00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.070
What we have is we have a problem that,

659
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:24.470
that there can be a systemic problem to fractional reserve banking if there's

660
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.400
ever a run on the banking system.
If,

661
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.060
if banks get in trouble and they can't pay out,

662
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:34.380
if one bank gets in trouble and can't pay out on it's the deposits,

663
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:38.850
then that can bring the whole system down because it can cause a panic among

664
00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:42.420
investors,
among depositors in banks,

665
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:43.950
and create a run on the bank.

666
00:45:43.951 --> 00:45:47.760
And this has happened so many times in history that governments around the world

667
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.860
now regulate banks and tell them that they have to hold a minimum amount of

668
00:45:52.861 --> 00:45:54.310
reserves,
uh,

669
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:59.390
and have a minimum amount of capital and capital is the money that they have to

670
00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:02.390
pay out,
should there be a,
um,

671
00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:08.160
it's assets that they can quickly liquefy and payout if should there be a run on

672
00:46:08.161 --> 00:46:08.994
the bank.

673
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:14.120
So Basel 1988 was an effort to make sophisticated risk management requirements

674
00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:17.740
for banks,
uh,
that,

675
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:22.800
that relied on more modern as of 1988,
uh,

676
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.280
financial theory.
So,
um,
and the,
the,

677
00:46:27.281 --> 00:46:32.050
the u s adopted the Basel,
uh,
uh,

678
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:36.630
requirements in 1989 and they're still enforced today.

679
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:40.050
So the,
um,
the,
the agreement,

680
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.660
but incidentally this was a international convention.

681
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.180
No country had the follow these risks,

682
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:50.070
but generally countries have followed them because they want to be part of the

683
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:53.850
international community and you want to use the standards that were recommended.

684
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.010
So it's a little bit like the nic,

685
00:46:56.011 --> 00:47:01.011
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners recommends laws to the local

686
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:04.830
insurance regulators in the 50 United States.

687
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.040
This is a supernatural national version of this.

688
00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:12.150
This is in Swiss Basel as a city in Switzerland where the bank for international

689
00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:12.990
settlements is,

690
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:18.410
it's an international effort to recommend regulations for countries all over the

691
00:47:18.451 --> 00:47:21.420
world.
Uh,
and so in the Basel one,

692
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:25.800
there were tier one capital requirements.
Uh,

693
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:31.120
and,
uh,
when I say they define tier one capital,
uh,
as,

694
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.940
uh,
capital in a certain form,

695
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:36.880
it stockholders' equity plus preferred stock.

696
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.420
And then there's tier two capital.
Uh,

697
00:47:41.421 --> 00:47:45.720
and then they have a formula.
This is defined in for those,

698
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:50.750
they have a formula that defines how much tier one and tier two capital event

699
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:56.220
has to hold.
Uh,
and the,
the amount depends on,

700
00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:00.060
uh,
the risk class of their investments.

701
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:05.490
So they defined for credit risk categories,
uh,
and,
uh,

702
00:48:06.090 --> 00:48:07.900
uh,
they,
they,
uh,

703
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:13.130
they defined a formula involving the amount of assets in each of the categories.

704
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:15.200
Uh,

705
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:19.830
and then there's a formula that dictates how much tier one capital and how much

706
00:48:19.831 --> 00:48:21.540
tier two capital they have to hold.

707
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:27.710
This system has worked well for 20 years now,

708
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.670
uh,
but it is being superseded by another Basel Convention.

709
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.830
Uh,
Basel two,
which has been going on for some years now.

710
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:43.190
So this is Basel one that I just telling you about and now they've come up with

711
00:48:44.011 --> 00:48:48.120
a new,
uh,
version,
uh,

712
00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:49.920
Basel two.

713
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.213
<v 2>Okay.</v>

714
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:59.870
<v 0>Uh,
and Basel two is more sophisticated.
It recognizes that,</v>

715
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:03.460
um,
uh,
that the,
the,
um,

716
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.420
the risks that a bank face are very complex,
uh,

717
00:49:08.421 --> 00:49:12.830
and that they are not summarize by just the classes,
uh,
of,
uh,

718
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:17.690
borrowers that were defined in Basel one.
Uh,
and it took them years.

719
00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:22.580
I won't get into details on Basel two,
but it,
uh,
it,
uh,

720
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.450
won't get into it.

721
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.580
It tries to deal more sophisticatedly with,
uh,
uh,

722
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:35.060
the complexity that we have in modern finance when there's a lot of unusual

723
00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:38.090
derivative securities that have,
um,
uh,

724
00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.580
difficult to understand properties.

725
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.450
I think there may have to have a Basel three before too long because everything

726
00:49:44.451 --> 00:49:47.870
gets more and more complex in the world.
To some extent.

727
00:49:47.871 --> 00:49:52.400
The subprime crisis is a,
is a failure of Basel two,

728
00:49:52.401 --> 00:49:55.460
which is not even fully born yet.
Uh,

729
00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.350
it won't come in fully enforced in the u s until 2009.

730
00:50:00.351 --> 00:50:04.820
It's already starting to have its impact in other countries.

731
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:06.740
It's already been been adopted.

732
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.790
<v 2>Uh,
so,
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,</v>

733
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:19.300
<v 0>so I wanted to talk a little bit about problems and then I conclude I have</v>

734
00:50:19.301 --> 00:50:22.870
various,
there's been lots of banking problems in the world,
uh,

735
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.790
and uh,
uh,
which I,
um,

736
00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:31.780
let me just mention some,
uh,
uh,

737
00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:35.520
I don't know what order I should go in here.
Uh,

738
00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:41.230
let me just talk a little bit.
Historically the,
uh,
uh,

739
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:45.320
s and l crisis in the United States,

740
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.330
1980s.
What happened?

741
00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:55.220
Their savings and loan associations,
we're making bad loans,

742
00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:00.530
uh,
especially in Texas,
but in lots of other states as well.
Uh,

743
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:05.240
and,
uh,
the,
um,
uh,
this was,

744
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.280
uh,
when Ronald Reagan was president

745
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.860
Reagan was a big believer in free markets.
Uh,

746
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:14.880
we had a law that actually passed,
uh,

747
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:19.920
it's called the depositary institutions deregulation and monetary control act of

748
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:25.280
1980.
It's actually before Reagan.

749
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:30.630
That's depositary institutions deregulation and Monetary Control Act.

750
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:36.520
What that did is it eliminated,
uh,
uh,

751
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.260
ceilings on interest rates on deposits.

752
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:43.220
It allowed banks to pay high interest rates.

753
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.780
It used to be that the government didn't let banks pay more than a certain

754
00:51:47.781 --> 00:51:50.550
amount on their deposits.
Uh,

755
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:53.950
and that helped protect banks because then they,
they didn't,
uh,

756
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:56.160
they didn't have to compete,
uh,

757
00:51:56.270 --> 00:52:00.260
to pay high interest rates and then be incentivized to make risky loans to try

758
00:52:00.261 --> 00:52:03.140
to make money with those high interest rates.

759
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:08.150
Once they freed up interest rates,
interest rates on deposits started,
sorry.

760
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:12.110
And Bank started taking greater risks,
particularly savings and loans.

761
00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:17.140
Now the government insurers deposits,
as you know,
through the FDA,

762
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.620
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
and for savings and loans,

763
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:24.740
they had an organization called the FSL IC,

764
00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.610
which is now defunct because of this crisis,

765
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.310
federal savings and loan insurance corporation.

766
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:35.690
And it was insuring deposits of savings and loans.
Uh,

767
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.800
they should have been watching under Reagan because if you let them pay high

768
00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:40.634
interest rates,

769
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.660
you better watch out that they don't make risky loans if you're insuring them.

770
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.000
But the FSL I see,
uh,
wasn't,
uh,

771
00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.530
it was sleeping at the switch.
Uh,

772
00:52:51.531 --> 00:52:55.070
and so it allowed banks in the United States,

773
00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:58.550
it was primarily savings and loans.

774
00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:02.520
Who did this to make bad loans,
uh,

775
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:06.110
and they were playing this moral hazard game.
The whole moral hazard crept in.

776
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:11.450
And,
uh,
because they said,
hey,
we can bow at a high rate.

777
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:15.410
Let's make some risky loans,
and if it succeeds,
we make money.

778
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.650
If the thing blows up,
well then the government will pay.
And so they had an,
uh,

779
00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:24.320
an unfortunate incentive to make bad loans.
Uh,

780
00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:28.590
this thing collapsed in the 1980s,
uh,

781
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.010
and it costs the u s government through the FSL.

782
00:53:32.011 --> 00:53:36.540
I see about 150 billion hours.
Uh,
it also,

783
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:40.560
the collapse of this was part of the reason for a general economic collapse.

784
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:45.561
We saw a collapse in real estate prices after 1990 and a recession in 1991.

785
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:49.530
So it was the big story,
uh,
of,
um,

786
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:55.510
of the,
uh,
1980s,
uh,

787
00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:01.050
I just going to mention some other stories that are important to just to

788
00:54:01.051 --> 00:54:05.910
illustrate the fragility of the banking system,
the Mexican crisis,

789
00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.880
uh,
under President Salinas.
Um,

790
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:18.530
what happened was Selena's was a Harvard educated economist came in to modernize

791
00:54:20.761 --> 00:54:24.840
Mexico,
uh,
and he wanted to prioritize things.
Uh,

792
00:54:24.841 --> 00:54:28.260
and so he privatized a lot of the banks.
Uh,

793
00:54:28.261 --> 00:54:33.240
and then the banks went on a lending spree,
uh,
and uh,
in Mexico,

794
00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:37.440
uh,
and,
uh,
loans,

795
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:45.420
bank loans rose from 10% of GDP of Mexican GDP

796
00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:49.620
<v 3>in 1988,</v>

797
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.380
<v 0>uh,
uh,
two 40%</v>

798
00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:57.880
by 1994.

799
00:54:58.570 --> 00:55:03.130
That's a huge increase in bank loans in Mexico.
What was happening,

800
00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:06.440
it was again,
something was amiss that you did,

801
00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:11.450
you had the government deregulated and not watching a lot of these people in the

802
00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:13.540
Mexican banks thought,
well,

803
00:55:13.541 --> 00:55:16.240
surely there'll be a bailout if something bad happens,

804
00:55:16.241 --> 00:55:19.570
the government will pay for it.
So let's go,
let's run with it.

805
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:24.280
And they ran with a lot of loans that turned out bad.
As a result,

806
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:26.590
there was a huge banking crisis.

807
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:31.180
And I mentioned before that Mexico doesn't have much in the way of domestic

808
00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:32.014
banks anymore.

809
00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:37.380
They basically all failed and were taken over by foreign banks after the Mexican

810
00:55:37.691 --> 00:55:41.890
crisis.
So that's a sign of how things can go amiss.

811
00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.300
Um,

812
00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:47.890
the Asian crisis in 1997,

813
00:55:47.891 --> 00:55:52.060
1998,
uh,
it's,
it's,
uh,

814
00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:01.140
97,
98.
Uh,

815
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:06.100
it actually is a complex phenomenon and not involving only banks,

816
00:56:06.101 --> 00:56:10.380
but,
um,
uh,
there,
there was a,
uh,
in the,

817
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:15.190
in the mid 1990s,
Korea,
uh,
Taiwan,

818
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.460
Thailand,
Philippines,
other countries,

819
00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:21.580
we're receiving a lot of international capital,
uh,

820
00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:25.570
and from international banks.
And,
uh,

821
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:30.400
there was a sudden change of heart and people wanted to withdraw their foreign

822
00:56:30.401 --> 00:56:34.000
investors wanting to withdraw their money.
Uh,
and once it,

823
00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:37.030
once the rumor got started that Asia was in trouble,

824
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:40.930
these people started withdrawing our money faster and faster,

825
00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:45.190
and it caused failures of,
of domestic banks in,
um,

826
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:48.490
in these countries.
Uh,

827
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.580
there's also the Argentine crisis,

828
00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:55.990
<v 2>uh,
of,
um,</v>

829
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:01.540
2000,
2002,

830
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:05.760
<v 0>uh,
once again,
it's comp,
I won't get into all the details of this,</v>

831
00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.220
but it ended up with a run on the Argentine banks.

832
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:14.100
And,
uh,
uh,
again,

833
00:57:14.101 --> 00:57:18.660
there was a loss of confidence in the time of an eye of a economic crisis.

834
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.950
Uh,
and people wanted to withdraw their money from the banks.

835
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:27.870
And the government,
uh,
was panicked because it begs,

836
00:57:27.871 --> 00:57:30.000
didn't have enough money to give it to them.

837
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.780
And so the government shut down the bank accounts,
uh,

838
00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:37.110
and it led to a riding in the streets.

839
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:41.250
People were very upset that they had left their money in the bank and the

840
00:57:41.251 --> 00:57:44.270
government was just saying,
you can't have it.
Um,

841
00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:48.840
and it caused a huge economic crisis as well.

842
00:57:48.841 --> 00:57:52.440
The unemployment rate rose to 18%.
Uh,

843
00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:57.830
there was a five changes of government in Argentina in a short time.

844
00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.840
Uh,
fortunately,

845
00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:05.600
Argentina has survived this crisis pretty well,
but,
uh,

846
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:09.750
it's coming back rapidly,
but there was a severe crisis.

847
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:11.341
Uh,

848
00:58:11.341 --> 00:58:16.341
and so that again highlights the importance of having a good bank regulation.

849
00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:18.571
Now finally,

850
00:58:18.571 --> 00:58:22.670
I wanted to talk about the current situation in what's called the subprime

851
00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:24.320
crisis.
Uh,

852
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:28.950
and let me talk about the u s first,
uh,

853
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:33.300
in the u s now I'm talking about just the last few years and it's something

854
00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:37.840
that's continuing today.
And also it's international as well.
Um,

855
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:42.420
they're developed in the u s in recent years,

856
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.270
something called the shadow banking system.

857
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:56.150
And these are organizations that act like banks but are not called banks,

858
00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:02.140
uh,
because they are not technically a bank.
So they escape regulation.

859
00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.560
Typically they issue instead of deposits something called abs asset backed

860
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.100
securities,
uh,

861
00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:16.960
well asset back securities,
particularly commercial paper,

862
00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:24.590
which are short term obligations of the organization,

863
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:29.540
uh,
and they invest in,
uh,

864
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.040
in something longterm notably subprime loans.

865
00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:39.653
<v 3>Okay.</v>

866
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:43.160
<v 0>And so they're operating like banks,
but they're not regulated as banks,
so they,</v>

867
00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.420
Basel two doesn't apply to them and so they can do what they want.

868
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:48.441
Uh,

869
00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:53.270
and unfortunately what we've seen recently is it kind of a bank run on the,

870
00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:58.760
on the asset vast asset backed commercial paper banks have been creating

871
00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:02.180
something called structured investment vehicles,

872
01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.020
uh,
in recent years.

873
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:10.950
And what these are,
are,
uh,
I like companies,

874
01:00:10.951 --> 01:00:15.120
but they typically don't have any employees.
Siv.

875
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.180
Siv is a,
uh,

876
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:23.270
is a company that was sword that invest in assets and they issue something like

877
01:00:23.671 --> 01:00:26.460
asset backed commercial paper.
Uh,

878
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:31.700
but it's not a real company because it only exists as an organization sponsored

879
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:36.240
by some bank.
And so the bank has a sieve on its,

880
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:40.680
on its books,
but the sieve is not part of the bank,

881
01:00:40.681 --> 01:00:45.150
so it's not subject to the bank capital requirements.
Uh,
and,

882
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:48.750
uh,
but,
but then,
you know,
you might say,
well,

883
01:00:48.751 --> 01:00:51.240
who would buy the paper of a sieve?
Well,

884
01:00:51.241 --> 01:00:55.290
the only people who would buy it are people who trust the bank that supports it.

885
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.700
And so in effect,

886
01:00:56.701 --> 01:01:01.200
the bank is promising to bail out the sieve if it should get in trouble.

887
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:03.570
Uh,
and so it really is,

888
01:01:03.571 --> 01:01:08.040
it really ought to be on the bank's balance sheet and ought to be regulated by

889
01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:12.030
the bank regulators.
But there was a failure to do that.
Uh,

890
01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:16.590
and so that is the,
um,
the problem that we are in currently.

891
01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.170
So I wanted to talk about some very recent problems,
uh,
to illustrate that.

892
01:01:22.171 --> 01:01:26.910
It's always a challenge to keep banks.
Banks are extremely useful,

893
01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:28.590
uh,
entities,

894
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:33.510
but there's sort of a fundamental flaw that has to be constantly dealt with,

895
01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:39.020
namely that tendency of them to fail when they're lending long and borrowing

896
01:01:40.081 --> 01:01:40.471
short.

897
01:01:40.471 --> 01:01:44.340
And so there's always a risk that investors will suddenly want their money bank

898
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.470
back.
So,
um,

899
01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.230
I wanted to just talk about some recent examples.
Northern Iraq,

900
01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.820
which was a building society in the United Kingdom,

901
01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:01.110
had a a sudden bank run,
uh,

902
01:02:01.111 --> 01:02:04.830
in September,
2007,

903
01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.160
uh,
this is,
uh,
the northern rock.
Why was it,

904
01:02:11.161 --> 01:02:15.000
what was happening in northern rock was a British building society that was

905
01:02:15.001 --> 01:02:19.980
investing in subprime paper in the u s and,
uh,

906
01:02:19.981 --> 01:02:23.550
it was having trouble and then word got out that it was having trouble and the

907
01:02:23.551 --> 01:02:27.510
rumors started spreading in the UK.
Northern rock is going to fail.

908
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.840
And so people started rushing to pull all their money out of northern rock in

909
01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:35.250
September of 2007.

910
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.560
This was the first bank run in the UK since 1866.

911
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:45.010
Uh,
this was a tremendous embarrassment to the Bank of England.
Uh,

912
01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:49.020
and Mervyn King,
it was a very good governor of the Bank of England,

913
01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:51.640
but apparently it took him by surprise.
Uh,

914
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:55.080
they thought bank runs were a thing of the past.
The,
in fact,

915
01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:59.190
the United Kingdom has been an international model for preventing of bank runs

916
01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.350
because the Bank of England would always lend to a bank that was in trouble in

917
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:07.170
order to keep them out of the problem.

918
01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:12.300
And so the US Federal Reserve system was really a copy of the Bank of England

919
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.171
thinking that,
well,

920
01:03:13.171 --> 01:03:16.080
the Bank of England managed to prevent bank runs for all these years.

921
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.700
Let's create the Fed,
uh,
which we'll talk about again later.
Um,

922
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:25.560
and so they thought they had the system,
uh,
solves,
uh,

923
01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:29.040
but then they had a bank run last year.
Uh,

924
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.700
and so you talk to these people who were standing in front of the bag.

925
01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:36.820
First question you'd ask them,
aren't deposits insured in the UK?

926
01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.620
Like they are in the u s well sure enough,
they were,

927
01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:44.440
the UK had copied the u s idea.
I guess it caught,

928
01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.440
I don't know where the original,
I think it probably,

929
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:49.080
is it UK copying the u s in this case,

930
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:54.810
but they didn't cover it well enough because they had a limit on the insurance

931
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:59.180
of 3000 pounds for full insurance.
Uh,

932
01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:04.190
and then they had 90% of the deposits of to a 75,000.

933
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:08.101
Okay.

934
01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:11.640
And so you got these people who are lining up in front of the bank and ask them,

935
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:16.530
isn't there deposit insurance?
And they knew perfectly well.
They said yes,

936
01:04:16.531 --> 01:04:20.460
but only up to 3000 pounds.
I don't want to lose 10% of my money.

937
01:04:20.461 --> 01:04:22.440
I've got 50,000 pounds in the bank.

938
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:26.910
So it was kind of a bad design for deposit insurance.

939
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.650
So they fixed it.
But you know,

940
01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:34.740
still northern rock is in such trouble that in February of Oh eight,

941
01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:37.990
let's last month the,
uh,

942
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.510
British government nationalized northern rock.
It's in a terrible mess.

943
01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:47.660
This puts the British government in a embarrassing situation of owning a failing

944
01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.900
a mortgage lender.
Uh,

945
01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.480
and so they've got to now be the government collecting on all these mortgages.

946
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.590
Uh,
it's a mess.
Uh,
but,
uh,

947
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:03.450
it shows that little details about how the deposit insurance run are important.

948
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.650
A lot of talk about Germany,
uh,
in,
uh,

949
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:11.760
August or actually it was a little bit earlier.
What was it?

950
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:15.893
July?

951
01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:21.540
There's a bank in Germany called I K v

952
01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:30.160
industry.
This is hard to write.
Three Bonk,

953
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:35.350
that's one word,
age,
uh,
that,

954
01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:40.240
uh,
invested heavily in US subprime paper.
Okay.

955
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.550
And the,
and the,

956
01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:46.930
the value of the paper collapsed and the bank became insolvent.

957
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:53.040
It was doing it through a sieve and it's a prob the Rhineland

958
01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:01.600
investment vehicle.
So,
you know,

959
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:06.310
this is not just the u s this thing is heavily international problems.

960
01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:11.020
This was a German bank doing exactly the same thing.
Uh,
and,

961
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.390
uh,
it,
uh,
it was,
uh,

962
01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:18.010
became insolvent and the German government had to come to his rescue.

963
01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:22.180
It turns out that 38% of this bank was owned by the German government.

964
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:24.640
And so it was kind of their problem,
right?

965
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:27.580
They weren't watching what was going on adequately.

966
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:32.620
And so there was a bailout and the bailout,
uh,

967
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.470
I don't have the exact number here.
It was a huge number of euros.

968
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.270
Uh,
and so it,
it,

969
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:45.300
it kind of was a wakeup call in Germany because they were watching with

970
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:48.160
amusement,
the subprime crisis in the United States.

971
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.670
And here it was causing losses to the German government.

972
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.740
I think it was intensive.
Billions of euros is huge.
And this wasn't the only one.

973
01:06:56.741 --> 01:07:01.690
There was another German bank called Zach Oxen,
uh,

974
01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:07.040
essay,
c,
h.
S.
E.
N.
L.
V.
Uh,

975
01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.690
which,
uh,
failed at the same time,
I guess the two together,

976
01:07:10.691 --> 01:07:15.010
I think it was 26 billion euro.
Um,

977
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.270
the,
to this Zach's [inaudible] lb and I,

978
01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:24.300
kb was a bailout of 26 billion euro.

979
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:28.990
Uh,
and that's a huge scandal in Europe,

980
01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:33.910
which is still unfolding and it drives from the u s subprime crisis.

981
01:07:33.911 --> 01:07:38.620
So what was happening is these banks were not being watched carefully enough

982
01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:38.880
there.

983
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:43.360
Their capital requirements were not enough for the kind of assets they were.

984
01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:44.683
Um,

985
01:07:45.370 --> 01:07:48.880
they were investing in a part of the problem is that the rating agencies were

986
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:53.290
rating their securities that they were investing in as triple a in many cases.

987
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:56.650
So there was a big goof up.
The rating agencies weren't,

988
01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.110
weren't cutting the ratings as they should,

989
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.730
and these European banks were just kind of naively trusting,

990
01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.730
uh,
and it just didn't get figured out.

991
01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:12.030
Now it hit France to BNP Paribas is a major French bank.

992
01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.540
Uh,
and it had,
uh,
a couple of

993
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:23.540
several funds,
power,
dynamic bnb,
uh,

994
01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.440
uh,
power about abs for Europe or,

995
01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:32.930
and BNP power of us abs Urania.
Uh,
and,

996
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:36.920
uh,
these things collapsed.
I believe the,
uh,

997
01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:39.260
the three funds lost,
uh,

998
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:44.160
this is where I have done 2 trillion euros.
I'd have to check that.

999
01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.580
That sounds high,
but it wasn't the point.
It was,

1000
01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:51.740
it was the same scandal that we saw in the US,
UK,

1001
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.940
Germany,
and now France.
And it was the same source.

1002
01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.120
It was the u s housing crisis that was causing a contagion around the world,

1003
01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:02.720
uh,

1004
01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.720
from one country to another because the banks in the countries had invested in

1005
01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:14.240
risky securities that they hadn't taken proper account of the risk and they

1006
01:09:14.241 --> 01:09:19.020
didn't have enough reserves.
The same thing affected us banks,
uh,

1007
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:24.100
uh,
as well,
uh,
in,
um,
uh,

1008
01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:28.040
it was bear Stearns,
uh,

1009
01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.540
whose headquarters is right next to grand central station.

1010
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:37.210
If you go into New York
and they had a couple of,
um,

1011
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:41.840
uh,
funds,
one was called high grade.
I like to write this down,

1012
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:46.190
high grade,
uh,
structured credit

1013
01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.350
and another one was called enhanced leverage fund.

1014
01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.940
These names sound safe,
high grade enhanced,

1015
01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.200
but they both collapsed,
uh,

1016
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:05.120
and became a leveraged fund.

1017
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:10.210
They became almost worthless because they were investing in subprime that,

1018
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:14.990
uh,
and uh,
uh,
and the,
and the,

1019
01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.190
and the value of the deck collapsed.
And uh,
so these collapsed as well.

1020
01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:27.060
Well,
these are just some examples.
I think we're in a very interesting time,
uh,

1021
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.600
for banking and for the economy as a whole.

1022
01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:34.430
What we've seen is a testing of the system,
uh,
that,

1023
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:39.380
uh,
we have regulatory requirements that banks have enough capital.
But,

1024
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.650
uh,

1025
01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:44.650
this regulation is challenging because it's being stressed right now.

1026
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.850
A lot of people get complacent during normal times and they assume that normal

1027
01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:52.520
times will go on forever.
They can't imagine.

1028
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:56.330
They don't have the power of imagination to think of what the next crisis will

1029
01:10:56.331 --> 01:11:00.590
be like.
So it catches them by surprise.
But we'll figure this all out.

1030
01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:05.000
And banks,
as I say,
are with us,
uh,
to stay,

1031
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:09.230
we just have to improve our regulation and disclosure requirements.

1032
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:14.100
So that banks can,
can be prevented from taking unnecessary.
All right.

1033
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:18.120
So I hope you all come to hear red leaf on Wednesday,

1034
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.670
and I look forward to having lunch with some of you.

1035
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:25.340
I don't think I can get either icon.
Both the icon and she worked,
uh,

1036
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:29.850
Schwarzman are,
uh,
are coming to give a lecture in April,

1037
01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:31.770
but I don't think either of them will stay for lunch.

1038
01:11:31.771 --> 01:11:34.350
So this is our only a luncheon event.
