1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.860
Before I begin,
I just wanted to say that I was very,
uh,

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.710
I found,
uh,
last,
uh,

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.480
periods lecture with a David Swensen.
Very interesting.
Also,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.830
I liked being serenaded by new blue.
She's the first experience for me.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.370
Um,
but uh,
it's,
and um,

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.780
he gave a,
I thought a very interesting talk cause I've heard him talk before,

7
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.340
but it's always interesting.
Um,
he,
he,

8
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.230
he really emphasized diversification.
Um,
but you know,

9
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.800
I don't know what you were thinking.

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.270
We got a 28% portfolio return last year.

11
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:45.750
There's something else going on besides diversification.
Right?

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.510
Diversification means you get the average return.
Um,

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.890
and I was glad that you asked questions at the answer of your questions seem to

14
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.900
draw out other things that he doesn't plan to talk about.
Uh,

15
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.540
like what he really did to make money.
And so,
um,

16
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.540
one thing was that he said that they shorted the Internet stocks in the late

17
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:11.541
1990s as a brilliant market timing device that I think enlightened people

18
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:17.100
thought that those prices were getting high.
Uh,

19
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130
and also made some play on credit spreads a and now on a real estate.

20
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:27.750
He said,
so,
uh,
how does he do it?
Uh,
again,

21
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.420
uh,
it's my theory that there's no,

22
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.360
you can't entirely be taught,
but,
uh,

23
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.370
partly though I think that he does it and as do other a good portfolio managers

24
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.780
by just keeping a very broad base of knowledge and listening to people and

25
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.920
collecting information and watching the big trends and thinking about them.

26
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.590
Uh,
so one of I think a Swenson's best talents is his,

27
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.830
is a good listener and he incorporates a basic facts and acts on them.

28
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.070
So you might have,
it would be incorrect,

29
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:13.071
I think in listening to what he said to conclude that he just says diversify,

30
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.320
uh,
because he's obviously done something very different from that.

31
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.680
So,
um,
by the way,

32
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:27.681
I have another speaker who told me that he would like to talk to our class and I

33
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:32.370
hope we can work it out.
Uh,
his name is Carl Icahn who is,

34
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.020
uh,
one of the biggest Wall Street,
uh,
uh,

35
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.060
powerful and enlightened people on Wall Street who can also maybe tell us

36
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:46.980
something about how he makes money or how he makes it a better world.

37
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.040
Uh,
but the problem is that he has,
uh,
you know,

38
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:54.270
these people have very tight schedules and he's involved in various takeovers

39
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:58.670
and things right now.
So,
um,
he said,
um,

40
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.610
he could do,

41
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.630
if we could arrange to meet after 3:00 PM.

42
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.570
Um,
so,
uh,
I'm going to,

43
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.130
is that like on a Monday or a Wednesday,
perhaps out of 3:00 PM,

44
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.470
uh,
or,
or later,
he said it might even,
uh,

45
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.460
his assistant said it might even be 7:00 PM.

46
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.740
So that's the way he works.
I don't think he gets up at 9:00 AM apparently.
Um,

47
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.110
so,
um,
uh,
I take that that's all right with you that you can come to a special,

48
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.520
uh,
section of this class,
but we have to see if we can arrange that.

49
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.530
Uh,
and you know,
again,

50
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.510
I don't guarantee that it will happen because the reality is someone who is

51
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:44.110
involved in as many things as he is,
it's going to be something.

52
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.380
Um,
but we do have a Stephen Schwarzman Carme,
um,

53
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.840
February 22nd,
and,
uh,
um,
and we have,
uh,

54
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.500
Andrea red leaf coming March 5th.
So,
uh,

55
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.000
we have a really strong set of outside speakers,

56
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.780
uh,
this year.
And again,

57
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.870
the midterm exam is Monday.
Uh,

58
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.950
sorry that I missed stated that last week.
Uh,

59
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.880
but you've already seen last year was midterm and it's gonna look a lot like

60
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:23.260
that.
Um,
uh,
okay.

61
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.120
So,
uh,
so we're talking today about interest rates,

62
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.990
uh,
and uh,
uh,
bonds.

63
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.890
Interest rates are an old,
old thing.

64
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.030
They go back to ancient times.
Um,
but,
uh,

65
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.980
I'm going to talk about some of our modern institutions and I'm going to talk

66
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:49.570
first about discount bonds.
This is a little bit more of a technical lecture,
um,

67
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.550
but,
um,
I find it just as interesting myself as a,

68
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.180
but what we're talking about,
discount bonds,
uh,

69
00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:03.070
and then a coupon carrying bonds.
Uh,
and then,

70
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.750
uh,
talk about the term structure of interest rates.
Uh,

71
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.390
and uh,
why,
why we have interest rates.
Uh,

72
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.500
I think that's my blackberry

73
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.563
<v 1>VP.</v>

74
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.340
<v 0>I'm trying not to live in,
to electronic,
uh,
were,
uh,</v>

75
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.100
that's the way it is these days.

76
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.550
Okay.
Uh,
this is beef.
It's giving you,
it's last,

77
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.420
last gas.
Uh,
and then,
uh,

78
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.290
finally talk about inflation index bonds.
So,
uh,

79
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.350
okay.
Uh,
the first,
uh,
thing is,
um,
is a,

80
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.510
uh,
a discount bond.
It's the most simple,

81
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.030
simple,
uh,

82
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.880
or often called a bill.

83
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.090
<v 1>Okay?</v>

84
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.500
<v 0>A discount bond,
uh,
does not pay interest.</v>

85
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.890
It's sold at a discount,
okay?

86
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.970
So you have the principal,
uh,

87
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.770
which is the amount owed,
uh,
which is,

88
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.320
let's say it's $100,
uh,

89
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.870
and that will be paid to you at some date in the future.

90
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.740
It's specified in the contract,
uh,
and,
uh,

91
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.550
uh,
nothing.
You'd just get $100,

92
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.400
but you get effectively,

93
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:41.480
you get interest from this because it's sold at a discount.

94
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.140
So the price that you pay is equal to 100 minus the discount.

95
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.230
All right?

96
00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:00.230
So you wouldn't buy this bond at par because at power,

97
00:07:00.751 --> 00:07:04.470
meaning at $100,
because then you wouldn't get any interest on it.

98
00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:08.220
So you buy it at a discount,
uh,
and,
uh,

99
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.640
and that,
uh,
and that,
uh,
the,

100
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.510
the return you get is of course,
a hundred minus.
Oh,
uh,
yeah,

101
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.360
the return you get is the discount.
Okay.

102
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.960
So the u s government is a big issuer of discount bonds and they're called

103
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.630
treasury bills.
So I have them up on the screen here.

104
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:41.270
This is from a US government website called how a Treasury treasurydirect.gov

105
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.810
and you can get on and access it at any time.
Um,

106
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.900
and it is showing since the u s government issues these bonds,
it's,

107
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.350
it's showing its data on these bonds.

108
00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.690
The bonds are auctioned off on regular date.

109
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.450
Uh,
and uh,
you cannot participate in the auction.

110
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.810
I assume you can't,
you'd have to be an authorized participant,

111
00:08:09.811 --> 00:08:14.430
but if you become an institution,
you can get authorized to trade in the,

112
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.810
in the auction.
So these are the dates.
The latest auction,

113
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.380
uh,
was,
uh,
February 14,
uh,

114
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.380
I guess that was yesterday,
right?
Uh,
and the,

115
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.550
the term means it was a 60 day,
a treasury bill.

116
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.330
That means it pays a not a $100.
Uh,

117
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.550
it would start at $10,000 a treasury bills.
Yep.
Yep.

118
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.760
Maybe you have to realize there's a distinction between savings bonds and

119
00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:48.600
tertiary rebuild.
Treasury bills are for serious investors,

120
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.000
and so they don't come small denominations.

121
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.310
The U s government also issues small denomination that,
uh,

122
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.420
two individuals to help them called savings bonds.

123
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.640
Um,
but,
uh,
we aren't talking about those.
Uh,

124
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.350
so,
um,
at the,
uh,

125
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.450
February 14th auction,
uh,

126
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.980
treasury bills were 60 day treasury bills were sold,
uh,
and the,

127
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.890
the auction prices given.
Well,
here's the price of the bill.

128
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.690
Uh,
the issue date was,
uh,
today,
uh,

129
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.240
February 15,
uh,

130
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
and they mature in what should be exactly 60 days in April 15.

131
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.380
Um,
so,
uh,

132
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.660
if you want to buy one,
you would pay this price.

133
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.500
This number CUSIP number is a number which identifies any security.

134
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.280
It's like you have a social security number or other ID number,
which positively,

135
00:09:57.281 --> 00:10:01.050
and there might be another person with the same name as you,
God forbid,

136
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.730
but you at least have your own number,
which is guaranteed to be identical,
uh,

137
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.660
unique to you.

138
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.940
So every security has an identical CUSIP which identifies it.

139
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.033
Um,

140
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.880
so I want to just to start by explaining the numbers here.

141
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.060
Um,
how did they get,

142
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.190
how do these numbers inter relate?
Uh,
okay.
Uh,

143
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.280
okay.
Well,
um,

144
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.370
this,
uh,
the discount rate is w is sort of the entry.

145
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.280
You notice there's two different interest rates here and you might be confused

146
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:47.700
by them.
The discount rate,
uh,

147
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.850
that is shown a is the number that you plug in to a formula to get the price.

148
00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:58.281
What really matters to you as an investor is how much you have to pay today to

149
00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:02.640
get $100,
uh,
in,
in 60 days.
Okay.

150
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:08.100
Uh,
so how do we get the price,
uh,
from the discount rate?

151
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.650
Uh,
well,
there's an a formula that's been used,
um,
by,
uh,

152
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.710
by,
um,
bond traders for hundreds of years.

153
00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.500
Uh,
and it,
it's a traditional expression,

154
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.640
which goes from the discount rate to the price.

155
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:32.160
And in this case,
price is 99.58.

156
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.700
And what does that equal?
It equals 2.51.

157
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.770
That's the discount rate that you see up there,

158
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.420
but 2.51 um,

159
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.470
times 60 divided by 360.

160
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:58.280
Okay.
Uh,

161
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:02.780
as you know,
there's the thing,
maturity is 60 days and as you know,

162
00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:07.430
there are about 360 days in a year.
And so,
uh,

163
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.360
by tradition they divide by 360,

164
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.050
not 365.
Um,

165
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.200
and so you understand that,
uh,

166
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.540
dealers tend to have treasury bills tend to quote discounts a,

167
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.670
that's a way it's like a language and a language of finance.
Okay.
And so,

168
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:30.560
uh,
what,
what they,

169
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:35.590
everybody knows is that the discount is converted into a price according to this

170
00:12:36.951 --> 00:12:41.090
formula.
And so,
um,
uh,

171
00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.740
you might ask what,
is this an approximate formula?
No,
it's an exact formula.

172
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.840
Uh,
but then you say,
well,
why didn't they divide by 365?
Because we,

173
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.370
I know there's 365 days in a year.
Okay.
Uh,
well,

174
00:12:55.371 --> 00:12:59.750
the answer is this goes way back.
It's an old tradition.

175
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.980
And they used to have to do this by hand.
They had to divide by hand.

176
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.720
And so they didn't like the number 365,
so they thought,

177
00:13:08.721 --> 00:13:10.640
let's just round it to 360.

178
00:13:10.641 --> 00:13:12.710
And as long as everybody knows that's what we're doing,

179
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.230
what difference does it make?
Right?
Okay.
So that's what you're supposed to know.

180
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:23.000
So if you're the other quotes you a discount rate of 2.51%,

181
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.350
you know how to convert that into the price and that's all that mattered.

182
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.210
All that really matters is the price you have to pay.
Um,

183
00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:37.100
now they also have something up here called the investment rate.

184
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.800
Yes.

185
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.633
<v 1>Oh,
sorry.</v>

186
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.760
<v 0>Oh,
I'm sorry.
Brad,
you,
Oh</v>

187
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.940
yeah,
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.850
That's the difference between one and 99.5.
Yes.
Thank you.

189
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:03.210
Uh,
uh,
between 199.58.

190
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:18.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

191
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:28.160
<v 0>Are you okay now?
Sorry,
I made,
uh Huh.
Okay.</v>

192
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.170
Now the thing is to convert that into what is this other,
this,

193
00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.720
that was another interest rate up there called the investment rate.
Uh,

194
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:38.480
well that's the,

195
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.100
that's supposed to be your percentage return on an annualized basis.
Remember,

196
00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:45.740
this thing only runs for 60 days and you could cook,

197
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.200
compute your 60 day return.

198
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:52.160
But people like to compare annual.
That's again,

199
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.580
a tradition that we have and there's nothing special about annual.

200
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.160
That's the time it takes the earth to go around the sun,

201
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.470
but it doesn't have any relevance to finance.
But,
uh,

202
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:06.470
we are just accustomed to using that.
So,
uh,
uh,
we,

203
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.460
what we're going to do,
however,
is KP kind of another problem.

204
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.380
And that is,
um,
you might think that,

205
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.730
uh,
uh,
this quantity here is,

206
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.440
is my,
uh,
return.
Um,

207
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:29.720
but you have to actually divided by the price,

208
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:33.430
which is less than a hundred to get a return.
Uh,

209
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.590
you're not putting in $100 to this investment.

210
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:41.830
You're putting in $99.58 for the investment and you're getting out the

211
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:45.900
difference between 199.58.
Uh,

212
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.320
and so that is not,
uh,
uh,
uh,

213
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:55.910
your return is actually higher than 2.51% on an annualized basis.

214
00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:01.340
So what we do,
our show you how they got their number,

215
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.363
um,

216
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.260
2.5629999999999997 a,

217
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.620
which is the,
uh,

218
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:17.621
the number you see under a investment rate is equal to one all over 0.9,

219
00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.580
nine five,

220
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:27.670
eight minus one corrected for the number of days in a year.

221
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.330
Um,
and how do we do that correction?
Uh,

222
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:38.470
when I first tried this,
I thought fine,
I'll,

223
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.040
I'll multiply by 365 over 60,

224
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.850
but I forgot this is a leap year and so times 366,

225
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.680
Oliver 60.
So that's how you go from,

226
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.750
um,
the discount yield,

227
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.410
the discount rate to the investment rate.

228
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.500
They understand why we had to do this.
Uh,

229
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.640
the investment rate is telling you how much money you're really making on an

230
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:14.420
annualized basis.
And so it's very simple.

231
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.280
I put in a 0.99,
five,

232
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:21.380
eight for every dollar I got out.

233
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.630
So my appreciation of my money is one over 0.9,
nine five,
eight,
right?

234
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.650
Subtract that by $1,
which is what I put in.

235
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.820
And that's how much money I made as,
as a fraction of a dollar.
Right?

236
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.770
All I have to do then is correct that for the number of days in a year.

237
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.250
And so that's,
that's what I did.

238
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.650
That's how we go from the discount rate to the investment rate.

239
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.060
Now you might ask,
well,
if we did 360 here,

240
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.070
why don't we just do the 360 over here?
Well,

241
00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:59.150
it's one of the mysteries of Wall Street.
Uh,
they'd like to,

242
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.840
when their computer in the investment,
you know,

243
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:04.870
they want to be completely honest and not use any rules of thumb.
Uh,

244
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:09.120
so you have to understand that it's 360 here because that's just a convention

245
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:12.420
and everybody knows that that's just the way we quote prices.

246
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.750
Rather than say a 99 and 58 cents,

247
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:19.080
we just quote the 2.51 and everybody knows how to convert.

248
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.320
But when you ask for the investment rate,
you want to know the truth.

249
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:25.950
How much am I really getting?
So they don't monkey around here.
Also,

250
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:27.810
they don't have to actually,
you know,
in the old days,

251
00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:30.090
they didn't actually have to compute the investment rate.

252
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.810
If you were talking to your broker,
if you've got a really old days,

253
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.350
you'd send a boy running over to your broker.
They didn't have telephones.

254
00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:42.420
And I used to have runners and the boy,
we'd go say,
uh,
we're,

255
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:47.280
uh,
we're offering to pay a discount rate of 2.5.
Well,
and that was the formula.

256
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.830
Um,
and then anyone could do these calculations.
They knew what it meant.
Um,

257
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.110
but,
um,
this calculation wasn't done very frequently.

258
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:02.790
That's just if you had one of the satisfaction of knowing how much money you're

259
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:06.440
making.
Okay.
So,
um,

260
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.890
okay,
so I think we pretty much explained,

261
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.740
well there's another thing I wanted to say about treasury bills.
Uh,

262
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:23.610
I used to have up here at page,
I used to take instead of treasury direct,

263
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.660
which is a website I used to get a clipping from the Wall Street Journal that

264
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:31.020
showed much the same information that you see on this chart,

265
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.640
but it showed additional information that you won't find on territory redirect.

266
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.330
It showed bid and asked for dealers.

267
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:44.670
Now you have to understand that treasury has these auctions only on these dates.

268
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.170
On,
uh,
February 14,
they only sold 60 day ones,
nothing else.

269
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.270
And on February 11th,

270
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:55.500
they sold only a 13 week ones and nothing else.

271
00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:00.630
All right.
And so what if you want to buy a treasury bill on some other day,

272
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.860
but you can go to treasury direct as an individual and buy a treasury bill,

273
00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.410
but it may not be the best place to buy.

274
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:12.930
What you normally do is you go to a dealer and the dealer is someone,

275
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:18.350
a professional who participated in the auction and bought these up to accumulate

276
00:20:18.931 --> 00:20:22.560
an inventory to then sell off to you the customer.

277
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.060
So normally you don't deal with treasury direct,
you deal with a dealer.

278
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.260
Okay.
The Wall Street Journal calls around to the dealer,

279
00:20:31.261 --> 00:20:36.180
which has an inventory of all these different maturities and ask them for their

280
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:39.660
bid and asked,
okay.
And a dealer,

281
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:44.130
that's what a dealer does,
is it maintains an inventory of,
in this case,

282
00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:48.880
treasury bills,
uh,
and then it,
it,

283
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:51.340
uh,
stands ready to buy and sell.

284
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.440
So the bid price is the why they don't do it in terms of price and do it in

285
00:20:56.441 --> 00:20:59.000
terms of discount.
So the bid discount,
right,

286
00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:02.710
where there'd be two numbers for each one is the bid,

287
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.750
which is what they'll pay you
for a treasury bill.

288
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:10.180
If you want to sell to them,
uh,

289
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:14.950
and the asked is what you have to pay them through this formula.

290
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:20.380
The formula is,
I could write it this way.
Price

291
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.030
price equals 100 minus this.
Um,

292
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.030
and so,
uh,
normally when you have a dealer,

293
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:35.590
the dealer has a,
when when we talk in terms of price,

294
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.630
the dealer has a asked which is higher than the bid,

295
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.520
right?
If you go to an antique dealer,
maybe are familiar,
we have,

296
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:45.970
or maybe you've done this,

297
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.840
if you bought furniture for some apartment or something,
the,
the,

298
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.860
the dealer will charge a higher price for you to buy the furniture.

299
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:59.560
Then we'll give to you to uh,
to purchase the furniture from you.

300
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.750
And that's how the dealer makes a difference.

301
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:04.390
It's the difference between bid and asked is the,

302
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:09.310
is the profit for the dealer and the bid ask spread is the profit for the
dealer.

303
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.510
So you can see these on the,

304
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.970
you can see the bid and ask on the Wall Street Journal.
Uh,

305
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.270
uh,
and,
uh,

306
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.210
it's interesting to look at it because you note that the bid ask spread,

307
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:25.820
which is the difference between the bid and the ask for a dealer,
uh,

308
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.100
is narrower in the more liquid securities.

309
00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.020
Uh,
and some of the securities that are small and unimportant have a wide bid ask

310
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:38.140
spread.
That means that it's,
it's harder to make a market for it to,

311
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:41.240
the dealer wants to charge more.
Uh,

312
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.770
but this doesn't show this here.
Um,
uh,

313
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.710
unfortunately the Wall Street Journal stopped carrying this.
Um,

314
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.000
and I thought that's an interesting story about what goes on.
Um,

315
00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.090
it's,
uh,
the,

316
00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:01.600
the Wall Street Journal is the most influential financial publication in this

317
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:02.700
country.
Um,

318
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.040
but it has been going through financial difficulties with the Internet age.

319
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.040
Uh,
and in the last five years,

320
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:17.041
the stock in Dow Jones company has fallen by half a.

321
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:20.620
And what's happening?
Well,
I,
I,
there are many factors,

322
00:23:20.621 --> 00:23:23.840
but one important factor is the rise of the Internet,
uh,

323
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:29.310
has competed with people used to buy the Wall Street Journal to get data like

324
00:23:29.831 --> 00:23:31.000
this.
Right?

325
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.170
But you see how I completely bypass the Wall Street Journal and I went to

326
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:39.910
treasury direct,
there's a million websites that give away financial data.
So,

327
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.090
uh,
so the Wall Street Journal,
uh,

328
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.670
was not doing as well.
Uh,
and do you know what happened?
Uh,

329
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.690
finally,
uh,
well I'll give this as a saga.

330
00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:57.310
They reduced the size of the newspaper in uh,

331
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.400
2005.

332
00:23:58.401 --> 00:24:02.780
It used to be a big broad sheet and they made it smaller in 2005 and they start,

333
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:06.550
they keep cutting out.
Data is less and less data in the Wall Street Journal.

334
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.750
It used to be this big thick thing and you would go there every day to look up

335
00:24:10.751 --> 00:24:14.390
price and everything was in there.
But now the web is competing with it.
So,

336
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.410
so there,
there's scaling down the sides of the paper,
uh,

337
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:20.840
and trying to survive.
Um,

338
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.010
and so they created Wall Street Journal Online,

339
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.650
which is a wsj.com.
Uh,

340
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.680
and they were trying to make money off of that,

341
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:33.500
but people weren't willing to pay for it.
You know how it is on the web.

342
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:38.150
You can get so much for free.
Why should I pay for wsj.com?

343
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.480
Uh,
and so that wasn't working well.
And so,
um,

344
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.930
last year,
about one year ago,

345
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.640
they announced Wall Street journal.com is absolutely free and we're going to

346
00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:53.570
give away all the data,
basically all the data that used to be in the newspaper,

347
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:57.590
free to anyone.
Uh,
and I thought that was great.
Uh,

348
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.860
now we can all get the Wall Street Journal without paying for it,

349
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.480
but there's some problem with that.
It's not an economic,
uh,

350
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.220
so this is not be too jubilant.
Uh,

351
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:12.250
what ended up happening is they know that the news that a Rupert Murdoch bought

352
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:15.880
the Wall Street Journal last fall,
uh,

353
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:21.130
and he announced that a Wall Street Journal wsj.com will no longer be free.

354
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.280
And so this is the reality of the,
of the world.
Uh,
I thought it was interesting.

355
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.090
If you look at,
uh,
a Rupert Murdoch,
this is finance at,

356
00:25:33.091 --> 00:25:37.610
this may sound like an aside,
but this is all financing.
Rupert Murdoch,
uh,

357
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.010
you may have heard of him,
uh,

358
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.660
is a huge newspaper baron who buys up newspapers all over the world.

359
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.360
Uh,
and uh,
it's interesting he's been at,

360
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:53.100
but he's continuing what his father did it take to become the biggest publishing

361
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.110
monolith in the world.
It takes maybe a hundred years.

362
00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.460
So his father in Australia started buying up newspapers.
Uh,

363
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:03.500
his father was born in 1886,

364
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.650
and now Rupert Murdoch is continuing.
He's now,

365
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:12.880
Rupert Murdoch is in his seventies,
and he's still buying this papers,

366
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:18.230
but he kind of makes them survive and Newscorp doubled its price.

367
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.220
That's his company doubled in the last,
uh,
in the last five years.

368
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.030
So you can see this is how the,
the unseen root role of Finance,

369
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.430
Wall Street Journal is a venerable newspaper and source of information about

370
00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:33.800
finance.
But it's not making money.

371
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.490
The world is changing and Wall Street Journal is flagging.

372
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.110
So newscorp who's priced doubles when Wall Street Journal's fell in,

373
00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:47.111
half eats advising and Wall Street Journal has gobbled up by the bigger rather

374
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.160
bigger company.
You can see why stock prices matter.
The,
the,
the,

375
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.260
the News Corp's rising stock price was assigned that Rupert Murdoch had some

376
00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:58.730
idea how to,

377
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.000
how to make money and Wall Street Journal was not doing as well.

378
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.570
So it got gobbled up.
Uh,
uh,

379
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.550
the question is what will happen to the Wall Street Journal now?
Um,
uh,

380
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.930
so,
uh,
well they have to make money.
That's the real world.

381
00:27:15.931 --> 00:27:19.230
And so Rupert Murdoch tends to bring papers around.

382
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.680
I'm just going to go a little bit further on.

383
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:26.180
Rupert Murdoch bought the Times of London in 1981 that was 27 years ago.

384
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.280
The Times of London is one of the most venerable newspapers of the world,

385
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:37.730
and it was losing money fast and it might have disappeared if Murdoch hadn't

386
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:42.870
taken over.
Uh,
but Murdoch turned it around and it's still around.

387
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:47.190
They turned it into a tabloid and like it was the most dignified newspaper in

388
00:27:47.191 --> 00:27:48.690
the world.
Uh,

389
00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.980
and he kind of decided that in order to survive they had to get a little bit

390
00:27:52.981 --> 00:27:56.250
more down to Earth.
Uh,
so they reduced the size.

391
00:27:56.251 --> 00:28:00.900
So it looks like one of those like New York Daily News newspapers now,

392
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.570
but it's still a great newspaper.
Uh,
they,

393
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.580
he added celebrity gossip to which the London Times would never do in the past,

394
00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.610
but you've got to do it right.

395
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.970
There's the thing about the real world and finance is very much about the real

396
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:16.170
world.
Uh,

397
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:21.171
and so Murdoch claims he will not alter the editorial content of the Wall Street

398
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.710
Journal.
Uh,
the thing that we see them doing is charging more.
Okay.

399
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.330
But I guess we got to allow that.

400
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.920
So we may feel annoyed that we now have to pay to get on Wall Street Journal

401
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.350
Online.
Uh,
but,
um,

402
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:39.240
but in the long run we want the Wall Street Journal.
And so,
um,

403
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:46.010
and so I guess that we just have to accept that.
So if you weren't a fine,

404
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.220
by the way,
if you want to read the Wall Street Journal online at Yale,

405
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:54.120
you can do it.
No problem.
You go to Abi inform,

406
00:28:54.121 --> 00:28:59.100
which is one of the things at Yale subscribes to on your laptop and it puts you

407
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:01.950
right into the text of the Wall Street Journal.
Uh,

408
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.310
but it doesn't put you in as far as I can tell in the Wall Street Journal
Online.

409
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.760
So,
um,
we have other,
uh,

410
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.690
lots of data sources that Yale subscribes to and there's lots of free data

411
00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:15.900
sources,
but,
uh,
Wall Street Journal is not free.

412
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.840
Anyway.
Um,
I wanted to talk to you understand now about a discount.

413
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.820
It's pretty simple,
right?
Um,
but I just wanted to get the pricing formula.

414
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.570
The critical thing about a discount bond is it pays no interest.

415
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:36.380
Treasury bills in the United States are limited to one year out,

416
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:41.520
but well that's the name of it.
Um,
so,
uh,
we call a,
uh,

417
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:47.850
an instrument of the u s treasury with a maturity less than or up less than or

418
00:29:48.791 --> 00:29:52.020
equal to one year.
We call that a bill.
Um,

419
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.730
and they used to be the only discount bonds issued by the u s government.
Um,

420
00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.270
now they also have longer maturity called treasury strips.
But,
uh,

421
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.050
there,
let me move though to the other.
Uh,

422
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.320
so we have u s government issues,

423
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.460
bills and so that's less than or equal to one year

424
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.820
and they pay no interest.

425
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.050
They also have government issues,
notes,

426
00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:25.030
and that's from one to 10 years.
And bonds,

427
00:30:25.031 --> 00:30:27.220
this is just jargon.

428
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:33.220
These are 10 or more.
Well,

429
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:37.330
actually more than 10.
I'll show you,
uh,
from Treasury direct,

430
00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:41.720
I have notes.
Um,

431
00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.890
this should be greater than 10.
Uh,

432
00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:51.400
these are the,
uh,
recent auctions,
uh,
of the treasury of,

433
00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.020
of,
um,
notes.
Okay.

434
00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:00.100
Now these are different from bill's as I emphasized because they pay interest,

435
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.680
they carry what's called a coupon.
Um,

436
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:09.850
and uh,
and then we have the burns.

437
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.570
Uh,
and then you see there aren't as many of these issues.
We issue a lot of,

438
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.450
there's a lot of auctions of treasury bills,
uh,

439
00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:23.620
and there are comparatively fewer of bonds.
Okay.

440
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.300
Now,
uh,
okay,
so,
uh,

441
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.180
let's talk about a bond.

442
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:36.220
A bond differs from a bill,

443
00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:41.230
uh,
in that it carries what's called a coupon,

444
00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.580
which I want to know by the letter c.
Uh,

445
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.180
and it has a principle which

446
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.980
it pays out at the end of 100.

447
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.260
Okay.
Uh,
of course they would be larger denominations than a hundred,

448
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:10.030
but by tradition we speak of them as if they were a vans that paid,

449
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:12.520
you paid $100 to get.
Okay.

450
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:19.230
Now another Wall Street tradition is that bonds pay prince,

451
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.150
they pay a coupon,

452
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.720
they pay c over to every six months.

453
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.960
So,
uh,
the coupon is at express as an annual amount.

454
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.500
You get half of it every six months.
Um,
and so,

455
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.233
uh,

456
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.140
the reason they call it coupons is that in the old days you used to actually,

457
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:52.190
when you bought a bond,

458
00:32:52.191 --> 00:32:57.191
there'd be a piece of paper and the piece of paper would have attached to it a

459
00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:00.830
lot of little coupons that you would clip.
Uh,
and each one,

460
00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.340
if it was a 20 year bond,
there would be 40 coupons,

461
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:08.000
one for each six month period,
and each one would have a date on it.

462
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.530
And what you used to do is every six months you'd pull out your bonds and you'd

463
00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:14.690
clip the coupons with a pair of scissors.

464
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:20.050
And you'd take them to a bank and they would give you cash for your coupons.

465
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:24.630
Uh,
so we still call them coupons,
but now we don't do it.

466
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.620
We do things electronically.
You don't have to clip coupons anymore,

467
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.540
but if you want to see a bonds as it used to look,
uh,

468
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.730
with their coupons,
uh,

469
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.000
there are a number of them at the International Center for finance down the

470
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:41.780
street here.
Um,
on that way,
uh,

471
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:46.290
with their coupons still attached.
So the A,
they've got a lot of uh,

472
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:51.580
[inaudible] and get ruined her collectors of old bonds and they've got lots of

473
00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:53.110
bonds with their coupons.
Still a,

474
00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:56.860
you know what that means when a frame there on the wall with their coupons still

475
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:57.703
attached,

476
00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:02.480
it means the company went bankrupt and never paid otherwise the coupons would

477
00:34:02.481 --> 00:34:03.314
have been clipped.

478
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:08.620
So it's actually our international center for finance is sort of a museum for

479
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.640
defaulted bond and the ones that are beautiful for framing of the ones that

480
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:16.460
fail.
Um,
so you can see all the coupons.

481
00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.940
Some of them have some of the coupons clipped and then then they stopped.

482
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:23.060
And you know,
there was bad news,
uh,
when they stopped clipping them,

483
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.010
we still call them coupons.

484
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:30.230
So if you have a bond with a,
um,
uh,

485
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.680
interest rate of 4.3,
seven,
5%,

486
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.860
that's not an easy one to divide by two,
but you would,

487
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:41.900
you would get half of that every six months,
uh,
until maturity.

488
00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:47.330
Um,
and so we have to ask then,
uh,
how do we get the,
um,

489
00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:52.190
uh,
how do we get the price in the yield from this?

490
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:53.893
Um,

491
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:58.520
so what we do is we take the interest rate,

492
00:34:58.521 --> 00:35:03.440
which are called R and plug it into a formula,
which I didn't,
uh,

493
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.270
I didn't actually do the arithmetic

494
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.350
<v 2>check,
uh,</v>

495
00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:15.020
check their number,
but the price,
um,

496
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:20.960
okay.
The price is just the,
uh,

497
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:25.350
<v 0>the present value of the coupons,
uh,</v>

498
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.570
at the interest rate are,
so the price of land

499
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:38.040
is present discounted value of and

500
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.690
<v 2>principal
at,</v>

501
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.060
uh,
at right are okay.

502
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.110
<v 0>No,
you have to understand that when you buy a bond,
if you buy it at issue,</v>

503
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:57.120
you get the first coupon in six months,
the second coupon in one year,

504
00:35:57.121 --> 00:36:00.150
the third coupon in 18 months,

505
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.450
and the last coupon you get at the maturity date.

506
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:07.740
So that means what is the stream of payments you get?

507
00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:11.130
See over two and six months,

508
00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:16.850
see over to again and a year see over to again in 18 months.

509
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.020
And that continues until the last date,

510
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.360
the maturity date when you get 100 plus c over to

511
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.753
okay.

512
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:38.240
And so the price is just the present value,
uh,

513
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.450
of the,
of that stream discounted at the interest rate.

514
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.010
Uh,

515
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:49.010
and so the formula can also be written if you expand it out,

516
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.270
<v 2>price is equal to a see over two</v>

517
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.983
times

518
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.590
one over r over to,

519
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.940
um,
which has the,
uh,

520
00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:30.500
what the console formula if this were applied,
uh,

521
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:36.710
to an incident stream minus one over one plus r over to two,

522
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:46.100
the two t power times one over r over too.

523
00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.173
Uh,

524
00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.800
<v 0>I'm making,
let's make sure I've got this right.</v>

525
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:57.670
<v 2>Uh,
plus 100 times one.</v>

526
00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.820
All over one plus r over to to the two t power.

527
00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:07.730
Okay.

528
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.860
<v 0>This should be obvious if I did that right.</v>

529
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:15.000
This should be obvious from what you've learned about in present value formulas.

530
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.823
<v 2>MMM.</v>

531
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:22.300
<v 0>If you had a perpetuity which paid see over to forever,</v>

532
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.760
you already know from the perpetuity formula,

533
00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.620
that's the value of that would be see over two divided by r over to,

534
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:33.820
um,
if our over two is the discount,
right?

535
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.980
But it's not forever because it terminates at after,

536
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.800
uh,
after two t periods,
uh,

537
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.420
of six months interval each so that you,

538
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:51.421
you want to subtract off the value of a perpetuity that,

539
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:55.450
uh,
starts after two t six months intervals.

540
00:38:55.870 --> 00:39:00.870
And so this is the present value of the perpetuity that starts,

541
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:04.750
uh,
after two t six months intervals.

542
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.910
Then you want to add the present value of the principal.
Okay?

543
00:39:09.911 --> 00:39:14.911
And so that's the formula and that's another conventional formula that goes from

544
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.460
interest rate to price of the other security.

545
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:27.150
<v 2>Um,
okay.
Uh,</v>

546
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.600
so,
um,

547
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:35.243
okay.

548
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.370
<v 0>No,
I want it to talk about the term structure of interest rates.</v>

549
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.670
Uh,
and that's my next plot here.
Uh,

550
00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.760
that's the term structure.
As of now on the chart,

551
00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.760
we've identified the prices and yields of

552
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.850
bonds of various maturities.
Uh,
how do the

553
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:14.450
prices and yields look,
uh,
at various points in time.

554
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:17.930
And so I've got here term structure,

555
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.960
well she term structure

556
00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.100
is the applause,

557
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:30.910
a yield to maturity against time to maturity.
Uh,
this is,

558
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:35.350
um,
January of this year before the Fed cut interest rates.

559
00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:38.690
Uh,
and this is the term structure.
I've got a,

560
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.070
the federal funds rate is the shortest interest rate.
It's an overnight rate.

561
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:46.450
It was at 4% at that time.
Uh,

562
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.450
and then,
uh,
there was a sharp drop.

563
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.320
The three month treasury bill rate is shown there.
It was much lower.

564
00:40:53.321 --> 00:40:58.260
It was under 3%.
And then the,
uh,
uh,
the,
the,

565
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:02.590
so the term structure was downward sloping until about two and a half years.

566
00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:03.880
And then it was upward sloping.

567
00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:09.400
The interesting question from the standpoint of economic theory is why did it

568
00:41:09.401 --> 00:41:11.980
have that funny shape?
Uh,

569
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.600
I wanted to compare it with other,
um,
other,
uh,

570
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.640
examples of the term structure,
uh,
recently.
Uh,

571
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.160
this is the term structure.
Just a short while ago,

572
00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.690
December,
2006 very different,
right?

573
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.100
The uh,
federal funds rate was a five and a half.

574
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.380
And then the whole term structure all the way almost thought,
well,

575
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:40.660
there's this funny funny glitch here between uh,

576
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.990
uh,
three months in one year,
but then it just continued to decline.

577
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.330
That's a strong leader,
downward sloping term structure.
Uh,

578
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.590
and this is another example not so long ago.
This is December,
2003.

579
00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.170
Now the term structure was pretty much upward sloping everywhere.
So,

580
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.760
uh,
at that time the Fed had cut the federal funds rate to 1%.

581
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.030
We had very low short rates.
Uh,

582
00:42:08.031 --> 00:42:11.960
and the three month treasury bill rate was about the same at 1%,

583
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:16.820
but going further out,
the term structure just kept rising.

584
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:21.920
It's one of the questions of economics is what determines the term structure.

585
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:27.110
You have to understand that it's determined in the market.
The,
uh,

586
00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.020
the,
the Fed has these auctions,

587
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.830
but it auctions them off at what price the public will.
Hey,

588
00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.440
so the Fed doesn't determine the term structure.

589
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.500
Neither did the dealer is determined the term structure.

590
00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:43.430
The dealers have to buy and sell at prices that are in the market.

591
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.620
It has to stay relevant to the market.

592
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.730
So nobody really knows where these interest rates come from because no one

593
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:54.680
person sets them.
If you're a dealer,
you've got to keep your bid asked at market.

594
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:58.790
Otherwise you'll get only one side of the other,
right?
Uh,

595
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:03.360
you'll be selling too cheaply or you'll be buying two dearly.
Uh,
you got to,

596
00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.101
you've got to do it.

597
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:06.680
So you're right in the middle so that the market is in the middle.

598
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.910
So nobody really sees the reason for that.
It's all a question of theory.

599
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.780
So we have to think a little bit about theory.

600
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.343
So,
um,

601
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.190
the term structure is one of the most interesting things in economics because it

602
00:43:22.191 --> 00:43:24.650
shows the price of time,

603
00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:28.970
<v 2>uh,</v>

604
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:33.160
<v 0>at various maturity.
So in,
in 2003,
uh,</v>

605
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.970
time was almost free,
uh,
out three months.
Uh,
it didn't,

606
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.780
if you,
if you needed more time to get some business done,
you'd have to bow,

607
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.670
but you don't have to pay 1% a year.

608
00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:49.040
That would be like a quarter of 1% to postpone your payment by another year.

609
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.790
So time was really cheap.
Uh,
but uh,

610
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.310
but if you wanted to postpone it over seven years,

611
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:57.590
so time got a lot more expensive.

612
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.680
So why is this and why is the price of time changing?
Uh,

613
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.790
one thing to do is they just asked to go back and ask what really are,

614
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:08.903
um,

615
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.373
<v 2>mmm,</v>

616
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:13.580
<v 0>the reasons for interest.
Uh,</v>

617
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.400
and I wanted to talk about the theory of the interest,

618
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.153
<v 2>uh,</v>

619
00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:26.400
<v 0>as presented by a Professor Irving Fisher.</v>

620
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:33.390
Yeah.
Who is famous having expositive back.

621
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:36.120
And I fell,

622
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:41.180
I imagine he did it at this very blackboard because they said he had his office

623
00:44:41.761 --> 00:44:45.190
in this building.
Uh,
uh,
and,
uh,

624
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.210
he didn't die until 1940s.

625
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:53.260
So he must've been in this building was this room goes back to the 30s.
So,
um,

626
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.210
uh,
he had a diagram which illustrated what,
uh,

627
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.660
is the ultimate cause of interest.
Uh,
and,
uh,

628
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:07.530
it helps us to think about this diagram whenever we try to understand the term

629
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:11.890
structure.
So he did what his diagram.
Uh,

630
00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.030
this is the famous Irving Fisher Diagram,
uh,

631
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:18.953
uh,

632
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:24.020
depicted a world in which there's only one period there is today,

633
00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.030
uh,
on this access and,
uh,
tomorrow,
well,

634
00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:35.950
I shouldn't say tomorrow that suggest one day.

635
00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.580
Next period on this axis,
uh,

636
00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.240
let's say it's one year,
okay?

637
00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.890
And I'm going to actually plot on this axis,
um,

638
00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.660
a person's income this year.

639
00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:53.230
I should say income today on this axis

640
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.850
and on this,
uh,
income next period.

641
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.470
So for each person,

642
00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:12.690
there is a point representing my income today and my income next period.

643
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.690
Let's assume that I know what I'm earning next year.
Okay?

644
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:20.280
There's actually uncertainty about it.
All right?
So if I draw this down,
this,

645
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.230
this point is ti this year,

646
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:27.231
his income down here and this point here is a next year's income.

647
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.470
I,
I,
I'll use Y for income.
This is why today,

648
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:38.490
and this is why next period.
Um,

649
00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:43.390
so I person has a budget constraint.
If the person can borrow and lend,

650
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.870
uh,
at the interest rate,

651
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:55.300
uh,
and the budget constraint is a straight line through this point,

652
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.870
uh,
with a slope of one plus r.

653
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.390
So I'll try to draw this line.

654
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.173
<v 1>Okay?</v>

655
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.440
<v 0>That should be a straight line.</v>

656
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:12.480
It doesn't look that straight cause I was running out of room.
Uh,
but you see it,

657
00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:15.880
that's,
that's a straight line.
Okay.
Uh,

658
00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:21.590
this point here then is the present value of your income,

659
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:26.310
right?
So it's why today

660
00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.720
a plus y next period,

661
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:33.790
however one

662
00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.490
<v 2>are,
okay.</v>

663
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:39.710
<v 0>Now,
what's this point up here?</v>

664
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:44.330
This point up here is the terminal value of my income.

665
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.630
Uh,
and so the or the upper point is,
uh,

666
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:51.920
why today

667
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:58.900
times one Plus r plus y next.

668
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:05.460
Now,
in an ideal world where you can borrow and lend freely,
uh,

669
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:10.250
an individual could choose consumption along any point on this day,

670
00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:14.780
on this line,
right?
I could consume all of my income.

671
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:16.880
If I borrow against my future income,
I could.

672
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:20.720
There's a problem here of starvation.
If I consume it all this year,

673
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.060
I would be starving.
I don't see how I can earn income next year.
Uh,

674
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.710
but in principle,
that's what Irving Fisher said,

675
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:31.970
or I could just not consume anything this year and I could wait until next year

676
00:48:31.971 --> 00:48:34.730
and consume the terminal value.
I would take my income this year,

677
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.440
invested at the interest rate,

678
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:41.710
and it would turn into y today times one plus r and then I get income next year.

679
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:47.030
So I could consume all that so I can consume it any point along that vine as

680
00:48:47.031 --> 00:48:47.864
well.

681
00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:51.410
I could consume that today's income where I could consume here or I consume down

682
00:48:51.411 --> 00:48:56.150
here.
Right?
If I consume less than I income today,
I'm saving,
uh,

683
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:59.600
and my consumption would be lower this year.

684
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.460
Am I doing that right?
No.
If I'm,
if I'm saving this year,

685
00:49:04.461 --> 00:49:08.780
my consumption would be less than my income.
So my consumption might be here,

686
00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:13.370
uh,
and I would then have more next year.
Okay.

687
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.410
That's so each individual reaches a decision.
Each individual has a,

688
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.800
uh,
uh,

689
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.260
an income point and decides how much to consume based on the budget constraint.

690
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.253
Um,

691
00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.880
now the interest rate in Irving Fisher is world has to equate supply and demand

692
00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:39.080
in the market for that.
Each person who wants to,
uh,

693
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.430
to,
to borrow has to be met by somebody else who wants to learn.

694
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:49.340
Uh,
and so the interest rate that we have in society is the compromise.

695
00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.370
It's the interest rate that equates the,

696
00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:56.780
that clears the market for loans.
Uh,
and that interest rate,

697
00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.273
uh,

698
00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:03.670
determines the market interest rate so that nobody can see the interest rate.

699
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:05.810
Why the interest rates at the level it is,

700
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.950
<v 2>um,
uh,</v>

701
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:12.280
<v 0>in the market because nobody can see all of these individuals.</v>

702
00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:16.960
But that's why the interest rate gets determined and is,
uh,
is,
um,

703
00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.920
<v 2>uh Huh.</v>

704
00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:24.540
<v 0>An equilibrium.
Why the interest rate,
uh,
clear as,
uh,</v>

705
00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:26.151
well,
it's,

706
00:50:26.151 --> 00:50:30.770
it's a mysterious because it's a market phenomenon and each person only sees his

707
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:33.890
or her own contribution to the market and not the whole market.

708
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:39.030
Irving Fisher also drew on the curve and production possibility frontier for

709
00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.790
society,
which he made downward curve.
This is production possibility

710
00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:47.613
<v 1>front here.</v>

711
00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:54.590
<v 0>And that is a curve.
You've seen these before and economics that says,
uh,</v>

712
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:58.430
how the production of our society can,
um,

713
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:03.810
can produce different combinations of income this year and next year.

714
00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:07.050
If there were no credit markets society,

715
00:51:07.051 --> 00:51:10.200
everyone would have to be on the production possibility frontier,

716
00:51:10.201 --> 00:51:13.800
there'd be no other choice.
But if we have credit markets,

717
00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:18.980
then people can individually choose to be on off the production reduction

718
00:51:18.991 --> 00:51:23.991
possibility frontier and at a higher level of consumption then otherwise would.

719
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.550
And so you might have some people up here who are saving and other people down

720
00:51:29.551 --> 00:51:33.220
here who are this saving,
uh,

721
00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:36.710
and the production will be operating at the middle.
Uh,

722
00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:41.700
so that is Irvin Fischer's diagram,
uh,
in a nutshell.

723
00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:46.890
But,
uh,
I think it's,
uh,
um,
it's,

724
00:51:46.891 --> 00:51:50.280
uh,
so what,
what does it say about the term structure?

725
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.810
It says that at different horizons,
everything on this diagram is different.

726
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.280
So,
uh,
the production possibilities,

727
00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:02.080
frontier at different horizons is in different places.
The budget constraint,

728
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:05.150
it's going to have different,
a slope to it and,

729
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:09.570
and preferences will be different over this horizon between consumption and
then,

730
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:12.910
and consumption.
Now.
So you,
it,
it doesn't,

731
00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.230
this theory doesn't say a whole lot about what the term structure will look
like,

732
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.300
but it,
uh,
it,
uh,

733
00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:24.060
suggest that it's determined by the interplay of lots of economic factors.

734
00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:29.940
Uh,
so,
all right.
So,

735
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.793
um,

736
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:39.200
I wanted to talk about a couple of other basic concepts in economics of interest

737
00:52:40.201 --> 00:52:43.290
rates.
Uh,
and one of them is the forward rate.

738
00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:49.970
The other one is inflation indexed interest rates.
So,
um,

739
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:53.160
forward rates.

740
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.730
I wrote an article,

741
00:53:00.731 --> 00:53:05.731
I wrote a survey Erica years ago about the term structure of interest rates and

742
00:53:05.951 --> 00:53:10.030
I wanted to find out who was the originator of the term forward rate.

743
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:14.710
Uh,
so I asked my graduate student research assistant to research the whole

744
00:53:14.711 --> 00:53:18.220
literature and find out where did the word forward rate come from.

745
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.610
And my graduate student came back and said,

746
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:26.940
it seems to have been served on Hicks in London and his 1931,

747
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:30.900
1939 book of value in capital.

748
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.150
<v 1>All right.</v>

749
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:42.660
<v 0>But,
um,
I,
this is another aside,
but I think it's motivational.
And,
uh,</v>

750
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.430
so,
uh,
I said,
are you sure that Jr Hixon invented the term forward?
Right?

751
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.780
And he said,
how can I be sure?
Right?
I mean,
I've looked through everything,

752
00:53:50.781 --> 00:53:54.570
I can't find any earlier reference.
Um,
and he said,

753
00:53:54.571 --> 00:53:58.300
I think it's j Hicks.
Um,
then I,

754
00:53:58.301 --> 00:54:00.960
I was talking it over with another graduate student.
He said,
well,

755
00:54:00.961 --> 00:54:05.490
if you want to find out,
why don't you ask Jr Hicks?
And so I said,
wait a minute,

756
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:10.040
is that guy still alive?
And he said,
I think he is.
Uh,

757
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:13.200
so I found out he was living in London,
Lord Hicks,

758
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.620
I guess he got knighted for his contribution.

759
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:21.960
And I wrote him a letter and I said,
basically,
did you invent forward rates?

760
00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:26.040
Yeah,
yeah.
I didn't get any response for like three months.

761
00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:27.690
And then to my surprise,

762
00:54:27.691 --> 00:54:32.691
I got a handwritten letter and kind of a trembling hand vide and I still have

763
00:54:33.751 --> 00:54:38.040
it.
I said that I can put it up on the screen.
It actually,
uh,
and uh,
he said,

764
00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:40.980
my apologies.
Very polite and did a

765
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:48.020
diplomatic,
it's my apologies for not answering your letter,

766
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:52.080
but my health is poor.
And,
uh,
that was a long letter.
He said,

767
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:55.560
I'm trying to remember where I got the idea.
And he said,

768
00:54:55.561 --> 00:55:00.561
I think it probably came from some of our coffee hours at the London School of

769
00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:05.250
Economics in the 1920s.
He said,
we were discussing that.
And he said,

770
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:09.810
I thought it was in a book that my wife and I translated from the Swedish,
uh,

771
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:13.720
in the 1930s.
They said,
I looked and it's not there,
is there?
He said,

772
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:18.690
I guess maybe it is my id.
All right.
So the first person to write it up,
uh,

773
00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.530
and then he died shortly thereafter,
so I got to him Justin time.
Uh,
so I,

774
00:55:23.531 --> 00:55:28.470
I thought I would describe forward rates,
uh,
in terms of the,
uh,

775
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:33.090
coffee hour at the London School of Economics in the 20s.
Okay.

776
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.270
So,
uh,
this is jr Hicks talking.
Uh,

777
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:38.610
so the year is 1925.

778
00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:39.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

779
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:44.210
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,
and we're talking about investing in discount bonds,</v>

780
00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.560
uh,
and we're going to put a hundred pounds.
Okay.
Uh,

781
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:52.010
now suppose,
ah,
okay.

782
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:57.790
The idea that Hicks invented is that there are implicit in the term structure,

783
00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:03.740
there are future interest rates already quoted.

784
00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:07.770
I showed you the term structure.
I showed you a one year,

785
00:56:07.771 --> 00:56:12.290
a treasury bill rate for,
for uh right now.
And uh,

786
00:56:12.350 --> 00:56:13.280
that's not right now,

787
00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.870
but you can see I have a one year and a two year treasury bill rate.

788
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:23.170
The idea of a forward right is that implicit in that term structure is also a

789
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:27.640
quote for the one year rate one year.
Hence,

790
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.400
because if you look at the two year rate,

791
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:33.940
can't you infer back what interest rates are going to be in one year?

792
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:36.860
Because the two year rate is,
um,

793
00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:42.110
you've got the one year rate and the two year,
right?
So between the two,

794
00:56:42.111 --> 00:56:42.741
what's left,

795
00:56:42.741 --> 00:56:46.640
it's the difference between those two somehow reflects what interest rates will

796
00:56:46.641 --> 00:56:49.940
be between one and two.
So what Hicks said,
okay,

797
00:56:49.941 --> 00:56:53.420
this is a coffee hour conversation at the London School of Economics.

798
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:58.690
He said it's right now in 1925 but if you want to invest or borrow a in 1926,

799
00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:06.230
uh,
I can do it for you.
I can lock in the interest rate right now.
Okay?

800
00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:11.030
Okay.
So let's say,
okay,
I expect,

801
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:18.130
suppose I expect to get a hundred pounds in 1926.

802
00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:25.570
Here we are sitting in 1925 and I want to today in 1925 Larkin,

803
00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:31.700
the investment return that I will get when I invest a hundred pounds.

804
00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:36.320
Okay?
Okay.
And so what we want to do,

805
00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:39.320
this is what Hicks discovered.

806
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:44.740
I can do the following transaction to lock in in 1925 the interest rate between

807
00:57:46.251 --> 00:57:48.470
1926 and 27.

808
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:51.290
So here we are sitting in 1925.

809
00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:55.670
I'm going to buy in 25

810
00:57:57.170 --> 00:58:00.650
this amount of two period bonds,
two year bonds,

811
00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:06.440
one plus r two
squared,

812
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:11.690
uh,
over one plus r one.

813
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:17.851
Okay?

814
00:58:17.851 --> 00:58:22.851
These will mature and be worth $100 and 26.

815
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:26.100
I'm going to short

816
00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:32.160
how much I'm going to short,

817
00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:38.370
<v 1>short one,
one period bond.</v>

818
00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:49.060
<v 0>This is the number.
This is the number of bonds I have to buy.</v>

819
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:54.130
Okay.
And so,
uh,
let's analyze this track.
That's all I have to do.

820
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:58.480
And I locked in the interest rate.
Okay.

821
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.940
Are One is the,
the yield and the one period bond,
uh,

822
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:07.210
and r two is the yield and the two period bond.

823
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:12.040
So the price of the two period bond is one,
Oliver,

824
00:59:12.041 --> 00:59:15.610
one plus r two squared.

825
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:20.770
And the price of the one period bond is one over one plus r one.

826
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:26.500
So if I buy this amount of one of two period bonds,

827
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:31.940
how much does it cost me?
It cost me one over one plus r one.

828
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:37.550
And if I short,
uh,
the,
uh,
one period bond,

829
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:41.480
it cancels out.
So I've made no net purchase.

830
00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:43.880
And in 1925,
right,

831
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:49.960
I bought a number of two period bonds such that the value of my purchase exactly

832
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:55.340
equals the proceeds that I get from shorting the one period behind.

833
00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.500
So I've made a zero transact [inaudible] wealth transaction.

834
01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:04.730
It hasn't affected my portfolio,
uh,
my cash position at all.

835
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.580
What happens then in that's in 1925?
So,
uh,

836
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:14.390
there's no cash flow,
no cashflow at all.

837
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:22.240
Okay.
In 26,
what happens?
Well,

838
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:25.430
in 26,
um,
the,
uh,

839
01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.590
I've shorted the one period bond and so,
um,

840
01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:34.450
I have to pay out $1 now,
but that's exactly what I wanted to do.

841
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:39.450
Remember I said I'm doing this because I expect to have,
uh,

842
01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.170
uh,
a hundred pounds.

843
01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:47.120
I said one day I'm going to have to pay out a hundred pounds because this one

844
01:00:47.121 --> 01:00:51.230
period bond worth a hundred pounds principle is coming due.

845
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:54.350
So I have to pay it out.
Uh,
but that's what I wanted to do.

846
01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:58.920
Cause I said I have 100 pounds to invest.
Uh,
nothing happens to the,

847
01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.700
uh,
to the,
uh,

848
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:06.410
to period bond because it just continues to mature.
So in 26,

849
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.710
in 1926,
I've,
hey,

850
01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.480
100 pounds.
Okay.

851
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.650
What happens in 1927?
Now,
uh,

852
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.700
what happens is,
uh,

853
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:27.740
I now get the maturity of this band.
Um,
so,

854
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:32.480
um,
uh,
what I get,
I've,
I've,
I have,

855
01:01:32.481 --> 01:01:36.950
um,
I have purchased this number of,

856
01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.530
so I'm going to get a hundred pounds

857
01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.300
times that month there.
The number of bonds,

858
01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:51.330
one plus r two squared all over one plus r one.

859
01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:54.850
So you can see that by doing this transaction,

860
01:01:55.300 --> 01:02:00.300
I have locked in a return between 26 and 27.

861
01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:03.790
I did it in 25 but I've got the,

862
01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:08.970
I've got it set up so that they will pay a 100 pounds in 26 and I'll get this in

863
01:02:09.671 --> 01:02:14.650
27.
So he calls the forward rate.

864
01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:19.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

865
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:24.900
<v 0>Equals one plus r two squared.</v>

866
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:29.280
Oliver One plus r one.
All right.

867
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:31.650
This is Hicks discovery.
I mean,

868
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:33.510
you might say this should have been obvious to someone,

869
01:02:33.511 --> 01:02:35.910
but it was never been written up well before.

870
01:02:36.450 --> 01:02:38.970
So what Hicks said is that in these terms structures,

871
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:43.140
you don't just have today's interest rate.
This is a map.
Actually,

872
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:46.020
I've just showed the one period they had one period forward,
right?

873
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.100
But you could do it over any combination and you can get forward rates of any

874
01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:54.660
maturity at any future date.
Uh,
and so,
um,

875
01:02:56.550 --> 01:03:01.500
so that it was his insight and it comes back then to Hick's book value and

876
01:03:01.501 --> 01:03:06.500
capital in 1939 he said that we should think that the,

877
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:10.050
the,
the simplest story of the term structure of interest rates,

878
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.030
which he expounded there is that forward rates equal expected future interest

879
01:03:15.031 --> 01:03:15.864
rates.

880
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.240
And so that means that in the simple as that,

881
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.980
that's called the expectations theory of the term structure,

882
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.540
it says that the forward rate,
which you can compute from today's newspaper,

883
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.530
uh,
or from today's website,
uh,

884
01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.140
you can compute the forward rates for all future dates.

885
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:39.180
And what he says is those forward rates are what people think interest rates

886
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:40.470
will be in the future.

887
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:44.670
And that's called the expectations theory of that term instruction forward
rates,

888
01:03:44.671 --> 01:03:49.380
equal expected future spot rate.
So if you're looking at the December,
2003,

889
01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:51.720
what's going on,
it's very clear.

890
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:56.880
And that is the Fed had just cut interest rates to 1%.
It was an unusual,

891
01:03:56.881 --> 01:04:01.860
it was much talked about,
people didn't expect that to hold.
And so the,

892
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.970
so people thought,
well,
it's going to still be down at three,
a 1%,

893
01:04:05.971 --> 01:04:09.530
maybe in three months.
So you can see the,
uh,
uh,

894
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:14.400
the term structure doesn't go up between,
uh,
overnight and three months.

895
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.580
But they are expecting that the Fed has eventually,
and they were right.

896
01:04:17.581 --> 01:04:21.840
Of course in this case,
the Fed is eventually going to raise rates.
So the,

897
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:26.430
the upward sloping term structure means that the foreign rates are at higher

898
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:30.780
levels.
Uh,
and so,
uh,
that's the expectations theory.

899
01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:36.120
Uh,
fine.
Uh,
but he also,
uh,

900
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:40.960
talked about,
um,
another theory in his 1939 book,

901
01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:47.020
uh,
which is,
uh,

902
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:50.180
where's the expectations theory,

903
01:04:55.550 --> 01:05:00.450
but there's also a in liquidity premium theory to get more chalky.

904
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.433
<v 1>Okay.</v>

905
01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:15.560
<v 0>And this is the theory that,
uh,
there's,
uh,</v>

906
01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:19.630
there's risk in longer term bonds and so that,
uh,

907
01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:20.670
there's a,

908
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:25.670
there's a tendency for upward sloping term structure is a tendency

909
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:31.280
for upward slope,
even if expectations are flat.

910
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:39.170
So that according to the expectations theory augmented with a liquidity

911
01:05:40.111 --> 01:05:45.070
preference,
um,
the uh,
uh,

912
01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:49.360
the,
uh,
this,

913
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:54.400
this strongly upward sloping term structure in 2003 would reflect two things.

914
01:05:55.261 --> 01:06:00.261
One is that people expect interest rates to go up and secondly that uh,

915
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:05.610
uh,
interest rates,
uh,
a longer term bonds are riskier.
And so,
uh,

916
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.700
there's also another effect pushing interest rates up.

917
01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:14.210
The last thing I want to talk about is just running out of time here.
I want to,

918
01:06:14.211 --> 01:06:15.590
I mentioned this before,
your

919
01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.540
midterm exam,
which,

920
01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:24.490
which is next Monday and covers everything through this lecture.
Uh,

921
01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:31.650
something about inflation and interest rates.
Uh,
inflation,

922
01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:39.530
we'll call that a PI inflation rate.

923
01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.160
Inflation rate is high.

924
01:06:43.161 --> 01:06:46.640
So right now it's something like 2% or it's a little bit higher last year,

925
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.610
but maybe,
maybe it will be 2% going forward.

926
01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.060
The real interest rate

927
01:06:56.470 --> 01:07:01.470
computed from nominal rates is equal to one plus the nominal rate

928
01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.830
divided by one plus the inflation rate.

929
01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:13.630
So it corrects for inflation.
So if you have an interest rate,

930
01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:15.820
this is approximately equal to

931
01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:21.220
one plus the real interest rate
one.

932
01:07:21.221 --> 01:07:22.960
Plus the real interest rate is equal to one,

933
01:07:22.961 --> 01:07:26.440
plus the nominal interest rate divided by one plus the rate of inflation.

934
01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:28.840
And we would say the real interest rate

935
01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:37.490
equals the nominal rate approximately equals nominal rate

936
01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.050
minus the inflation rate.

937
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:45.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

938
01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.760
<v 0>Uh,
so if we have,
um,
right now,
uh,</v>

939
01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:51.710
if we go back to our current term structure,

940
01:07:51.711 --> 01:07:55.450
well this isn't complete if you're looking at the current term structure was

941
01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:00.080
interesting.
Look how this is.
As of earlier this year,
the,
the,
uh,

942
01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:05.140
the federal funds rate was at around 4% and it has this huge drop in the term

943
01:08:05.421 --> 01:08:08.360
structure and then it starts to be upward sloping.
Why is that?

944
01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.510
That's because on the date that I got this term structure,

945
01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.680
everybody knew the Fed was cutting rates and they got it right.

946
01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:20.570
The Fed was cutting rates to 3%.
They knew it was coming,
but not today.

947
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:25.700
Uh,
so,
um,
uh,
okay.
So,

948
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.770
uh,
right now,
uh,

949
01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:32.800
we have a federal funds rate of about 3% and the inflation rate of around 3%.

950
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:36.530
So right now the real interest rate is close to zero.
Finally,

951
01:08:36.531 --> 01:08:39.920
I just wanted to say that we have also a kind of bond,

952
01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.960
but an indexed bond,
uh,
which is,
uh,

953
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:49.340
an a band who's coupons are indexed to inflation.

954
01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:52.040
And with an index bond,

955
01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:56.120
you don't have to do this calculation to get the real rate.
The,

956
01:08:56.170 --> 01:09:01.170
the yield to maturity and an index bond is already in real terms because the

957
01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:03.710
coupons are indexed to inflation.

958
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:08.190
And my final slide is a flat,

959
01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:12.170
a picture of the first index bond.
Uh,
uh,

960
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:16.040
this is issued by the state of Massachusetts.
I actually own this bond.

961
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:21.041
I bought it for $1,000 on a website because I was interested in index bonds.

962
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.260
I could've,
I could've brought it to class and showed her too.

963
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.800
But this was issued in during the revolutionary war to help finance the war.

964
01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:35.420
And what happened with the u s government or the Massachusetts government had

965
01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:39.530
created high inflation during the war and nobody wanted to lend money to it.

966
01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:43.820
So they create your eight a price index.
It says,

967
01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:48.620
the price index contained,
uh,
uh,
this amount of beef,

968
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.930
this amount of sheeps,
well,
this,
well,

969
01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.470
this amount of the sole leather and this amount of corn,
that was a con,

970
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:59.240
that was the first consumer price index ever use for financial contracts.

971
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:02.360
But we now have something else called the consumer price index.

972
01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:08.170
This bond was paid off in if Massachusetts didn't fail to pay on it,

973
01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:14.180
uh,
in 1784,
I guess.
Uh,

974
01:10:14.181 --> 01:10:18.040
and,
um,
but anyway,
so,
uh,

975
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:21.770
index bonds are about 15% of the u s national,
I'm sorry,

976
01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:26.630
about 8% of the u s national debt,
about 15% of the UK national debt.

977
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:31.250
And they are very important,
but still a minority of all of our corporate,

978
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:36.080
of our fixed incomes.
Okay.
So that concludes this lecture.
And,

979
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:41.300
uh,
I won't be here on Monday,
but we'll have our lecture in this classroom.

980
01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.610
Uh,
uh,
on Monday.
