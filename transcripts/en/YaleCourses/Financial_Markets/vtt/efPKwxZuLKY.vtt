1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.580
Today's lecture is about the portfolio diversification,
uh,

2
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:09.840
and about,
uh,
supporting financial institutions,

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.790
notably mutual funds.
Uh,
and,
uh,

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.540
it's actually a kind of a crusade of mine.
Uh,

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.830
I believe that the world needs more portfolio diversification.

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
And that might sound to you a little bit
odd,

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.020
but I think it's absolutely true that the same kind of cause that Emma Thompson

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.840
goes through,
uh,
which is to help poor people of the world.
Uh,

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.660
it can be advanced through portfolio diversification.
And I,

10
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:43.200
I seriously mean that,

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.440
that there are a lot of human hardships that can be solved by diversifying

12
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:50.520
portfolios.
Uh,

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.550
so what I'm going to talk about today applies not just to comfortable wealthy

14
00:00:55.711 --> 00:01:00.700
people,
but it applies to everyone.
Uh,
and,
uh,

15
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.430
uh,

16
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.320
so it's really about risk when there's a bad outcome for anyone.

17
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
That's the outcome of some random draw.
When people get into real trouble,

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.700
uh,
in,
in their lives,

19
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.590
it's because of a sequence of bad events that push them into an unfortunate

20
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:23.410
position.
Very often financial,
uh,

21
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.570
risk management is part of the thing that prevents that from happening.

22
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.220
Okay.
So,
um,
the first,
uh,

23
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.500
let me go to,
I want to start this lecture with some mathematics.

24
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.390
Uh,
and it's a continuation of the second lecture where I talked about,

25
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.210
um,
the principle of,
of,
uh,
of dispersal of risk.

26
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.720
And I want now to carry that forward into something a little bit more focused on

27
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:58.920
the portfolio problem.
And so I'm going to start this lecture with the big,

28
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.750
a discussion of,
uh,

29
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.670
how one constructs the portfolio and what is the mathematics of it.

30
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.070
And that will lead us into the capital asset pricing model,
uh,

31
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.620
which is the cornerstone of a lot of thinking in finance.
Uh,

32
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.970
and I'm going to go through this rather quickly because there are other courses

33
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.200
yet at,
at Yale that we'll cover this more thoroughly.

34
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.270
Notably,
uh,
John,
John Akopoulos,
econ two 51,

35
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.920
but I think we can get the basic points here.
Uh,

36
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.290
and so let's start with basic idea.

37
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.940
I want to just say it in the simplest possible terms.
Uh,

38
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.480
what is it that we,
first of all,
a portfolio,

39
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:52.920
let's define that a portfolio is the collection of assets that you have,

40
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.210
financial assets,
tangible assets,
what it's your wealth.

41
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.910
The first and fundamental principle is you care only about the total portfolio.

42
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.540
You don't want to be someone like the fishermen who,

43
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.860
who boasts about one big fish that he caught because it's not,

44
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.450
we're talking about livelihoods.
It's all the fish that you caught.

45
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.130
And so there's nothing to be proud of if you had one big success.
Uh,

46
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:25.780
so that's the first very basic principle.
You agree with me on that.

47
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.880
So when we say portfolio management,

48
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:31.900
we mean managing everything that gives you economic benefit.

49
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.603
Okay?

50
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.700
Now underlying our theory is the idea that we measure the outcome of your

51
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:44.971
investment in your portfolio by the mean of the return on the portfolio and the

52
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:49.540
variance of the return on the portfolio.
The return of course,

53
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:53.980
in any given time period is the percentage increase in the portfolio.

54
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.470
Uh,
or it could be a negative number.
It could be a decrease.
Uh,

55
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.380
and the principle is that you want the expected value of the return to be as

56
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.420
high as possible,
given its variance.

57
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.820
And you want the variants of the return on the portfolio to be as low as

58
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:15.910
possible given the return,
right?

59
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.240
Because a high expected return is a good thing.

60
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.720
You know,
you could say,
I think my ex,

61
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.460
my portfolio has an expected return of 12% that would be better than if it had

62
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:30.880
an expected return of 10%.
But on the other hand,

63
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:34.570
you don't want high variance because that's risk.
Uh,

64
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:38.080
and so both of those matter and in fact,

65
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.830
different people might make different choices about how much risk they're

66
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:46.360
willing to bear to get a higher expected return.
But ultimately,

67
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.443
uh,

68
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.360
everyone agrees that's the premise here that for the s if it's,

69
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.370
if you're comparing two portfolios with the same variance,

70
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.890
then you want the one with the higher expected return.

71
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.270
And if you're comparing two portfolios with the same expected return,

72
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.140
you want the one with the lower variance.
All right.
Is that clear?
And,

73
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.800
okay,
so let's talk about,
uh,
I wanted to just give it an a very intuitive term.

74
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:19.801
Suppose we had a lot of different stocks that we could put into a portfolio and

75
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.840
suppose they're all independent of each other.

76
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.460
That means there's no correlation.
We talked about that in lecture too.

77
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.900
There's no correlation between them.
Uh,
and um,

78
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.860
that means that,
uh,
the,
uh,

79
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.740
variance and I want to talk about equally weighted portfolio.
So,
uh,

80
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.370
so we're going to have an independent assets.

81
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.870
Okay.
They could be stocks.
Okay.
Uh,

82
00:05:55.871 --> 00:06:00.871
and each one has a standard deviation of return.

83
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.000
Call that sigma.

84
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.873
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.990
<v 0>And let's suppose that all of them are the same.</v>

86
00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:14.680
They all have the same standard deviation and we're going to call

87
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.100
is the expected

88
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.960
return of these assets.

89
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

90
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.200
<v 0>Then we have something called the square root rule,</v>

91
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.920
which says that the standard deviation of the portfolio

92
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.770
equals the standard deviation of one of the assets divided by the square root of

93
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:50.350
n.
When you read this in the back of my making that big enough,

94
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.130
just he just barely,
okay.

95
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.310
So,
uh,
this is a special case though because I've assumed that the assets are

96
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.720
independent of each other,
which isn't usually the case.

97
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.610
Uh,
so it's like an insurance world where people imagine their ensuring people's

98
00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:13.920
lives and they think that their deaths are all independent.
Uh,

99
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.890
I'm transferring this to the portfolio management problem and you can see it's

100
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.490
the same idea.
All right?
So,
uh,
I've,

101
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:26.491
I've made a very special case that this is the case of equally weighted

102
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.203
<v 1>portfolio.</v>

103
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.020
<v 0>So,
uh,
but it's a very important point.</v>

104
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.260
If you see these very simple math that I'm showing up here,

105
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.170
the return on the portfolio

106
00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.960
is our,

107
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.820
but the standard deviation of the portfolio is sigma over the square root of n.

108
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.540
So the optimal thing to do if you live in a world like this is to get an as

109
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:07.310
large as possible and you can reduce the standard deviation of the portfolio

110
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.580
very much.
And there's no cost in terms of expected return.

111
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.340
So in this simple world,

112
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.690
you'd want to make a Ghana a hundred or a thousand or whatever you could,

113
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.950
and if suppose you could find 10,000 independent assets,

114
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.490
then you could drive the uncertainty about the portfolio of practically to zero,

115
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:30.080
right?
Because the square root of 10,000 is a hundred.

116
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.870
So whatever the standard deviation of the portfolio is,

117
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.890
you would divide it by a hundred and it would become really small.

118
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.420
So if you can find assets that are all have,

119
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.120
that are all independent of each other,

120
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.050
you can reduce the variance of the portfolio very far.
And that's,

121
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.130
that's the basic,

122
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.280
the basic principle of portfolio diversification.
Um,

123
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.910
that's what portfolio managers are supposed to be doing all the time.

124
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.070
Okay.
Uh,

125
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.540
now I want it to be more general than this and talk about the real case in the

126
00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.230
real world.
Uh,

127
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.400
we don't have this problem that assets are independent.

128
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.390
They tend,
the different stocks tend to move up and down together.

129
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.140
And so we don't have the ideal world that I just described,

130
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.580
but to some extent we do.

131
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:28.080
And so we want to think about diversifying in this world.
So,
um,

132
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.930
now I want to talk about,
uh,
farming,

133
00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:40.320
uh,
portfolio,
uh,

134
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.690
where the assets are not independent of each other,

135
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.430
but are correlated with each other.
Okay?
Uh,

136
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.070
and uh,
so what I'm going to do now,

137
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.970
let's start out with the case where now it's going to get a little bit more

138
00:09:54.971 --> 00:09:59.080
complicated.
If we allow,
if we drop the independence assumption,

139
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.020
I'm going to drop more than the independence assumption.

140
00:10:02.021 --> 00:10:06.730
I'm going to assume that the assets don't have the same expected return and they

141
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:11.440
don't have the same expected variance.
Okay?
So I'm going to,

142
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.540
let's do the two asset case.

143
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.010
All right.
And,
uh,
there's,
uh,
n equals two,

144
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.550
but not independent.
Okay.
So,
uh,

145
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.100
not independent

146
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:41.810
or not.
I'm not,
not necessarily independent.
So,
uh,
asset one

147
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.653
<v 1>yeah.</v>

148
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.250
<v 0>Has Expected Return r one?
No,
this is different.</v>

149
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:54.860
I was assuming I'm in it to go that they're all the same.
It has standard,

150
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.920
this is the expectation of the return on asset and one and r two is the

151
00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:07.340
expectation of the return on that.
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.613
Uh,

153
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.020
Sigma one is the standard deviation

154
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:22.650
of the return
on asset one.

155
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.000
And we have the same for asset to,

156
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.650
it has an expected return of our two.
It has a,

157
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.350
a,
a standard deviation of return of sigma too.

158
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.440
And those are the inputs into our analysis.
Okay.
One more thing.

159
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.090
We have,
I said they're not independent,
so we want to,

160
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.080
uh,
we have to talk about the,

161
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:55.283
<v 1>uh,</v>

162
00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.530
<v 0>covariance between the returns.</v>

163
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:04.070
So we're going to have the covariance between r one and r two,

164
00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.330
which you can also call sigma one,
two.

165
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.810
And those are the inputs to our analysis.

166
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:19.250
And so what we want to do now is compute the mean and variance of the portfolio

167
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.070
or the mean and standard deviation.

168
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.690
Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

169
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.553
<v 1>Uh,</v>

170
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.240
<v 0>four different combinations of the portfolio.</v>

171
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.270
And I'm going to generalize from our simple story even more by saying that,
uh,

172
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.340
let's not assume that we have equally weighted.

173
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:43.540
So we're going to put x dollars.

174
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.470
Let's say we have $1 to invest.
We can scale it up and down.
It doesn't matter.

175
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:48.670
But let's say it's $1.

176
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.110
We're going to put x one in asset one

177
00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:00.610
and that leaves behind one minus x one and asset two.

178
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.480
Okay.
Cause we have $1 total.

179
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.040
We're not going to restrict the x one to be a positive number because as you

180
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.780
know and find it or you should know,
you can hold negative quantities of assets.

181
00:13:15.781 --> 00:13:19.270
That's called shorting them.
You can call your broker and say,

182
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.910
I'd like to short stocks number one.

183
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:26.830
And what will the broker will do is borrow the shares on your behalf and sell

184
00:13:26.831 --> 00:13:31.570
them.
And then,
uh,
you,
you own negative shares.
So we're not going to,
uh,

185
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.330
x one can be anything.
Uh,

186
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:38.710
and an ex this,
this is x two

187
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.730
equals one minus x one.

188
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.210
So x one plus x two equals one.

189
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:51.763
<v 1>Okay,</v>

190
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.530
<v 0>now we just want to compute what is the uh,</v>

191
00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.970
mean and variance of the portfolio.

192
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.440
And that's a simple arithmetic,
uh,

193
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:09.480
based on what we talked about before.
So I'm going to erase this.

194
00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:10.314
And,

195
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.533
<v 1>uh,</v>

196
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.820
<v 0>the,
uh,
portfolio,
uh,</v>

197
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.980
mean and variants will depend on x one in a way that if you put,

198
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:29.700
if you made x,
y equal one,
it would be acid one.

199
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.910
And if you made x one equals zero,

200
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.370
then it will be the same as asset to returns.

201
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.380
But in between if some other number,
it'll be some blend of the,

202
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.770
the the mean and variance of the portfolio will be some blend of the mean and

203
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:47.120
variants of the two assets.
So the,
um,

204
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.580
the portfolio expected return

205
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.930
is going to be given by the summation.

206
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.380
I equals one to n x of AI

207
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.630
are survive in this case since n equals two,

208
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:19.870
that's x one r one plus x two are two or that x one r one plus one minus one.

209
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.960
Alright to uh,
uh,

210
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.840
and,

211
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.840
and that that's the expected return on the portfolio and the variance of the

212
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:47.150
portfolio,
uh,
Sigma squared,
uh,

213
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:48.920
this is the portfolio variance.

214
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:55.750
That's the square of the standard deviation is equal to x squared sigma one

215
00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:04.541
squared plus x two squared sigma two squared plus two x one x two sigma one too.

216
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:21.800
And that that's just the formula for the variance of the portfolio,

217
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.400
uh,
as a function of now,

218
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.060
since they have to sum to one,

219
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:34.390
I can write this as x one squared sigma,

220
00:16:34.581 --> 00:16:39.581
one squared plus one minus x squared,

221
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.730
Sigma two squared plus two x one one minus x one sigma one too.

222
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.060
And so that,
uh,
together traces out,
uh,
I,

223
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:56.660
I can choose any value of x one I want.

224
00:16:56.661 --> 00:17:00.200
It can be any number from minus infinity to plus infinity.

225
00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.630
And that shows me then the,
for any value of x one,

226
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:10.610
I can compute,
uh,
what our is and what Sigma Square it is.

227
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.030
And I can then describe the opportunities I have from investing that depend on

228
00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:21.320
these.
So now one thing to do is to solve,

229
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.720
uh,
uh,
ex,
uh,

230
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:32.510
solve the equation for our a four x one.
And I can then,

231
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.730
uh,
we cast the variance in terms of our,

232
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.980
and so that gives us the variance of the portfolio as a function of the expected

233
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:46.750
return of the portfolio.
Okay.
Uh,

234
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.760
and so can we just solve this for,

235
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.380
uh,
let's solve x one for our,
so I've got,
uh,

236
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.770
uh,
this should be excellent.
Then I make a mistake there.

237
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.360
X One hour one.
Um,
so,

238
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:07.243
uh,

239
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:12.350
it says that r minus r two is equal to x one,

240
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.150
our one minus R two.

241
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:24.370
So x one equals r minus r two,

242
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.420
however,
are one minus r two.

243
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.110
And I can substitute this into this equation

244
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.940
and I get the portfolio variance as a function of the portfolio expected returns

245
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.770
are,
and that that's all the basic math that,

246
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.500
that we need.
So if I do that,

247
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.820
I get what's called the frontier for the portfolio.

248
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.770
And I have an example on the screen here,
but it shows other things,

249
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:03.690
but let me just,
uh,
rather than,
um,
uh,

250
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.700
we're going to show it too many things at once.
Let me just draw it for,

251
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:10.050
I'll leave that up for now.
But we're moving to that.
Uh,

252
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.980
what we're doing here is we got pull this down

253
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:22.350
the,
uh,
with two assets.

254
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.753
Uh,

255
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:31.010
if I plot the expected annual return are and this access and I plot the variance

256
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:40.650
of the portfolio on this access,
what we have,

257
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.330
I'm sorry,
the standard deviation of the portfolio,
standard deviation

258
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.500
of the portfolio return,

259
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.770
then it tends to look at what it looks,
something like this.

260
00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:02.920
It's a Hyperbola,
uh,
that,
uh,

261
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.390
uh,
there's a minimum variance portfolio.

262
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:13.110
Minimum variance with the sigma is as small as possible.

263
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.690
Uh,
and there's a,

264
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:22.700
then there's many other possible for folios all at lie along this curve.

265
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.330
And so,
uh,
the,

266
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.690
the curve includes points on it which would represent the initial assets.

267
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.940
So for example,
we might have,
uh,
this is asset one

268
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.400
and we might have something here.
This could be asset to,

269
00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.440
uh,
depending on,
uh,
where the,
uh,

270
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.760
assets expected returns are and the assets,
standard deviations.

271
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.460
You can see that we might be able to do better,
uh,
than,
uh,

272
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.140
have a lower variance than either asset.
Um,

273
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.100
equally weighted case that I gave him a minute ago was one where the two assets

274
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:13.420
had,
we're at the same,
had the same expected return and the same variants,

275
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.150
but this is quite a bit more general.

276
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.280
So that's the expected return efficient portfolio frontier problem.

277
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:22.261
Uh,

278
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:27.261
and I wanted to show an example with real data that I computed and that's what's

279
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:33.190
up on the screen.
Uh,
the pink line takes two assets,

280
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.410
one on stocks and the other is bonds.
Uh,
actually,
um,
you know,
uh,

281
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:43.500
government bonds and I computed the efficient portfolio frontier for uh,

282
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.240
various,
uh,

283
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.600
it's the efficient portfolio frontier using the formula I just gave you.

284
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.990
So that pink line here,

285
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:05.070
this pink line here is the efficient portfolio frontier when we have only stocks

286
00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:09.910
and bonds to invest.
And you can see the different points.

287
00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.920
I've calculated this using data from 1983 until 2006.

288
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:20.020
And I computed all of the inputs to those equations that we just saw.

289
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:25.350
I computed the expected the average return on stocks over that time period.

290
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.950
I computed the average return on bonds over that time period.

291
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.240
These are long term government bonds.
Uh,
and I,
uh,
now these are,

292
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.440
since they're longterm,
they have some uncertainty and variability to them.

293
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.820
And I computed,
uh,

294
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.760
Sigma One Sigma Two r one and r two for those and I plugged it into that
formula,

295
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:50.550
which we just showed.
And that's the curve that I got out.
It shows the,
uh,

296
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:51.310
standard,

297
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:55.120
the standard deviation of the return on the portfolio as a function of the

298
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.700
expected return on the portfolio.

299
00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.150
And so I can achieve any combination.

300
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.830
I can achieve any point on that by choosing a,
a,

301
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:07.390
an allocation of my portfolio.

302
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.930
So at this point right here is on the pink line is,
uh,

303
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.050
a portfolio,
100% bonds.
And so over this time period,

304
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:22.410
that portfolio had an expected return of something like a little over 9% and had

305
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:26.590
a stint at standard deviation of a little over 9%.

306
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.060
Uh,
this is,
uh,

307
00:23:30.061 --> 00:23:34.000
a portfolio which is 100% stocks in that portfolio,

308
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:39.310
uh,
is,
uh,
had a,
had a much higher,
uh,

309
00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:44.260
x average return or expected return,
uh,
13%,

310
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.820
but it also had a much higher standard deviation of return.

311
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.610
It's about 16%.
So you can see that,
uh,

312
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.560
those are the two raw portfolios that can be an investor only in bonds or an

313
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:58.940
investor only in stocks.

314
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:04.340
But I also show on here what some other returns are that are available.

315
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.070
So,
uh,
the minimum variance portfolio is down here.
He said,
that's good.

316
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.100
You got the lowest possible standard deviation of expected return,

317
00:24:13.101 --> 00:24:18.101
and that's 25% stocks and 75% bonds with this sample period.

318
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.960
Uh,
but I can try other portfolios.
This one right here,

319
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:28.490
I'm pointing to a point on the pink line.
That point right there,
50% stocks,

320
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:33.350
50% bonds,
okay.
And,
uh,
you can see,

321
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.340
and if you can also go up here,
you can go beyond 100% stocks.

322
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.700
You can have 150% stocks in your portfolio.

323
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.690
That means you'd have a leverage portfolio.
It would be borrowing.

324
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.060
If you had $1 to invest,

325
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.360
you can borrow 50 cents and invest in a dollar 50 worth of stocks,

326
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.860
right?
That would put you out here.

327
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.500
You would have very much more return,

328
00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:02.650
but you'd have more risk borrowing to buy stocks is going to be risky.

329
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.310
Okay.
You could also pick a point down here,

330
00:25:07.311 --> 00:25:11.390
which is more than a hundred percent bonds.
How would you do that?
Well,

331
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.610
you could short the stock market.

332
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.910
You could short 50 cents worth of stocks and buy a 150 cents worth of bonds and

333
00:25:20.091 --> 00:25:23.660
that would put you down here.
Any one of those things as possible.

334
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:28.150
It's just the simple math that I just showed you.
Okay?
Uh,

335
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.920
do you have any idea what you would like to do it assuming this,

336
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.480
but if you're an investor,
you don't like variance,
right?

337
00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.060
And uh,
uh,
so you probably don't want to pick any point down here,
right?

338
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.490
Because,
uh,
you're,

339
00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:47.330
you're not getting anything by picking a point down there because you could have

340
00:25:47.331 --> 00:25:49.190
a better point by just moving up here.

341
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.820
You'd have a higher expected return with no more variance.

342
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.030
It's getting kind of complicated isn't that this we started out with just the

343
00:25:56.031 --> 00:25:59.750
simple idea that you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket and if you

344
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:03.040
have a lot of independent stocks,
uh,
you would,
uh,

345
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.820
want to just weight them equally.

346
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.120
But now you see there's a lot of possibilities and the outcome of your portfolio

347
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:13.280
choice can be anything along this line.

348
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:18.080
And I was going to tell you what you want to do except to say you would never

349
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:22.340
pick a point below the minimum variance portfolio,
right?

350
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.440
Because if you did that,
you would,
um,

351
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:27.830
you would always be dominated.

352
00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.420
You could always find a portfolio that had higher expected return for the same

353
00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:37.190
standard deviation.
So,
uh,
but beyond that,

354
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:42.020
if you are confined to just stocks and bonds,
it would be a matter of taste.

355
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.800
Where along frontier you would be,
we call it an efficient portfolio frontier.

356
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.150
Uh,
you could,
you could,
it'd be anywhere from here to here,

357
00:26:51.151 --> 00:26:54.590
depending on how much you're afraid of risk.
Uh,

358
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.820
and how much do you want expected return.

359
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.410
Now we can also move to three assets and uh,

360
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:07.420
and in fact any number of assets and the same formula extends to more assets.

361
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.070
And in fact,
I,
uh,
I have it,
uh,

362
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.500
suppose we have three assets and we want to compute the efficient portfolio

363
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:20.820
frontier,
the mean and variants of the portfolio.

364
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:22.733
Okay.

365
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.740
And so what I have up there on the diagram is calculations I made or the

366
00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:31.080
efficient portfolio frontier with three assets.

367
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.940
So now we have n equals three.
Uh,
and in the,

368
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.850
in the chart it's stocks,
bonds and oil.

369
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:43.980
Oil is a very important asset.
And so we want to compute what,
uh,

370
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:49.350
what that,
so we have,
now we have a lots of inputs.

371
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.910
We have others,
but the infants,

372
00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:55.911
they r one r two and r three are the expected returns on the three assets.

373
00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.950
Then we have the standard deviations of the returns and the three assets.

374
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.880
And then we have the covariance between the returns on the three assets and

375
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:12.320
there's three of them,
sigma,
one,
two sigma,

376
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.500
one three and sigma two,
three.
Okay.

377
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.550
Uh,
and uh,

378
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:23.570
that's what we have to know to compute the efficient portfolio frontier with

379
00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:27.450
three assets.
So to make this picture,
I did that.

380
00:28:27.451 --> 00:28:32.100
I computed the returns on the stocks,
bonds and oil,

381
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.383
uh,

382
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:39.020
for every year from 1983 and I computed the expect the average returns,

383
00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:41.400
which I take as the expected returns.

384
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.560
I took the standard deviations and I took the covariance.

385
00:28:45.561 --> 00:28:46.650
And these are all formulas.

386
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.090
I just plugged it into formulas that we did in the second lecture.
Okay.

387
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.690
And so then what is the portfolio expected return?

388
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.430
The portfolio expected return.
We have to choose three things.

389
00:28:59.431 --> 00:29:04.431
Now what x one x two and x three x one is the amount that I put into the first

390
00:29:05.821 --> 00:29:10.800
asset x two is the amount that I put into the second asset.

391
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.700
An extra three is the amount I put into the third asset and I'm going to

392
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:17.850
constrain them to sum to one.
So,
uh,

393
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:24.710
so the return on the portfolio is x one plus x two or two plus x three are

394
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.830
three.
Uh,
and then the variance of the portfolio,

395
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.170
sigma squared is equal to x squared.

396
00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.700
Our Wa,
uh,
stigma,
one

397
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.030
plus x two squared,

398
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.090
I think one,
one squared sigma,

399
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.560
two squared plus x three squared,

400
00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.960
Sigma three squared.

401
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.320
And then we have to take account of all of the covariants terms plus two x one x

402
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:09.010
two sigma,
one two

403
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:15.870
plus two x one x three sigma,

404
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:22.710
one three plus two x two x three sigma,

405
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.280
two three.
Okay,
so is that clear?

406
00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.430
And that's it.

407
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.440
It seems like a logical extension of that formula to three assets and uh,

408
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.680
you can easily see how to extend it to four or more assets,
right?

409
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.570
It's just a logical extension of that.

410
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.100
So what I did in this diagram is I computed the efficient portfolio frontier and

411
00:30:50.431 --> 00:30:54.210
now it's the Blue Line with three assets.
Okay?

412
00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.180
Now,
once you have more than three,
more than two assets,
it might be,

413
00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.310
uh,
uh,

414
00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:06.690
possible to get points inside the frontier.
But I'm talking here,

415
00:31:06.691 --> 00:31:08.310
this is actually the frontier,

416
00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.450
the best possible portfolio consisting of three assets.

417
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:17.550
And you can see that it dominates the pink line,
right?
The,

418
00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:20.610
when you add another asset,
you do better.

419
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.610
When you have three assets you do better than if you just had to.

420
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.040
And that's because there's more diversification possible with three assets.

421
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.910
Then with two.
And uh,

422
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.910
oil bonds and stocks are all independent,
somewhat independent.

423
00:31:35.911 --> 00:31:38.340
They're not perfectly independent,
but there's someone independent.

424
00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.790
And to the extent that they are,
it lowers the variance.

425
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:47.260
Not You should see that the blue line is better than the pink line because for

426
00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.380
any expected return,
the Blue Line is to the left of the pink line,
right?

427
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:56.250
So for example,
at an annual expected return of 12%,

428
00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.910
if I have a portfolio of stocks,
bonds and oil,

429
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.710
I can get a standard deviation of something like 8% on my portfolio.

430
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.450
But if I would find myself just to stocks and bonds,

431
00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:13.170
I would get a much higher standard deviation if following us.

432
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:19.250
So the general principle of portfolio management is you want to include as many

433
00:32:19.261 --> 00:32:22.570
assets as you can.
You want to get it.
Uh,

434
00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.450
if you keep adding assets,

435
00:32:24.451 --> 00:32:29.050
you can do better and better and your portfolio standard deviation.
Uh,

436
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.270
and so,
uh,

437
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.970
you can see some of the points I made along the Blue Line here.
Uh,
this is,

438
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:40.660
um,
let me see.
Do I have,
uh,
oh,

439
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.513
this is,
um,

440
00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:47.190
this is a portfolio which has all oil and stocks and has no bonds.

441
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:51.740
<v 1>Uh,
let's see.
Um,</v>

442
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.940
<v 0>this portfolio,
the minimum variance portfolio is 9% oil,</v>

443
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.060
27% stocks and 64% bonds.

444
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.420
And those are the many choices you can make.

445
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.773
<v 1>MMM.</v>

446
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:09.300
<v 0>And so the first you see the idea here is that,
uh,</v>

447
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.460
in order to manage portfolios,

448
00:33:11.461 --> 00:33:16.420
what we want to do is calculate these statistics,
which,
uh,

449
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:20.100
the,
the expected returns on the various assets,

450
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.570
the standard deviations of the very asset.
And you've got another covariances,

451
00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:29.730
uh,
because that affects the variance of the portfolio.

452
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:34.290
The more they co-vary they move together,
the less they cancel out.

453
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.400
Uh,
uh,
and so the higher the covariances,

454
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.310
the generally the higher you can see from here,

455
00:33:41.311 --> 00:33:45.330
the higher the sigma squared for the portfolio.

456
00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.240
And so,
um,

457
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.873
<v 1>yeah,</v>

458
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.430
<v 0>so is that clear on,
uh,</v>

459
00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.780
it's one more thing that we can do.
I have three assets shown here.

460
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.910
I have stocks,
bonds,
and oil.
Uh,

461
00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.260
but I want also to add one more final asset,
we'll call it the riskless asset,

462
00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.430
uh,
which is,
uh,
the asset.

463
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:17.380
Long term bonds are somewhat uncertain variable because there long term,

464
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.590
but if we have an annual return that we're looking at,

465
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:25.420
we can find a completely riskless asset,
which if with an annual return,

466
00:34:25.421 --> 00:34:29.290
it would be a government bond that matures in one year.
All right?
Now,

467
00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:31.030
assuming that we trust the government,

468
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.270
I think the US government has never defaulted on its debt.

469
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:39.220
We take that as a risk list return.
Okay.
Although it probably has some risks,

470
00:34:39.221 --> 00:34:41.590
but in the way we approximate things in finance,

471
00:34:41.591 --> 00:34:44.920
we take the government as riskless.
And so,
uh,

472
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.450
with the government a expected return,
we want to make that,
uh,

473
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:54.300
that expected return as a fourth asset.
Uh,

474
00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:57.910
if we could call it r four,
but I'll call it our sub f.

475
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:02.980
It's a special assets.
So our sub f is the riskless asset.

476
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

477
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:15.790
<v 0>And so what for it?
Uh,
Sigma sub F equals zero.</v>

478
00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.370
Okay.
It's like a fourth asset,

479
00:35:18.371 --> 00:35:23.371
but we were using a special feature of this asset that it has no risk.

480
00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:28.180
Okay.
Moreover,
uh,
the correlation,

481
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:32.110
the covariance between any of these sigma,

482
00:35:32.111 --> 00:35:35.710
one f equal zero,
et Cetera,

483
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.850
it just doesn't have risk to it.
It has no variability.

484
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:44.510
So if we want to add that asset to the portfolio,
uh,

485
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.580
what it does is it produces an efficient portfolio frontier that is now a

486
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:54.150
straight line and I show that on the diagram.
Uh,

487
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.360
and so the best possible portfolio that you can get would be points along this

488
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:01.800
straight line.
Uh,

489
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:06.790
and that is the final aspect of the efficient,
uh,

490
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.900
portfolio calculations.

491
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.111
Again,

492
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:17.820
I'm not able to give this as much of a discussion as I would like cause I don't

493
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:21.570
want to spend too much time on this in the review sections.

494
00:36:21.571 --> 00:36:25.710
I'm hopeful that you're a ta is,
can elaborate on this more,

495
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.870
but there's a very important principle that finally comes out here,

496
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:36.440
is that you always want to reduce the variance of your portfolio as much as you

497
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:37.434
can.

498
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.640
And so that means that you want to pick ultimately a point on this.
This,

499
00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:47.070
this line is tangent to the efficient portfolio frontier with all the other

500
00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:49.860
assets in it.
Tangent means that it has the same slope,

501
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:54.861
it just touches the f the efficient portfolio frontier for risky assets at one

502
00:36:56.011 --> 00:36:59.070
point.
And the slope of the uh,

503
00:36:59.071 --> 00:37:03.990
efficient portfolio frontier including the riskless asset is a straight line

504
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.340
that goes through the tangency point here.
Uh,

505
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:12.390
and that is the end.
I think that's the end of my mathematics.

506
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:14.683
Uh,

507
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.820
but what I have shown here is how you calculate your portfolio management.

508
00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.880
The way you would go about if you're a portfolio manager is you have to come up

509
00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:32.700
with estimates of the inputs to these formulas.
That means the expected returns,

510
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.250
the standard deviations and the covariances.

511
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.640
You take all the risky assets and you had an analyze them first to get there.

512
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.250
Uh,
you have to do a statistical analysis to get their expected returns,

513
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:52.080
their variances in their covariances.
Once you've got them together,

514
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:57.440
then you can compute the efficient portfolio frontier without the riskless

515
00:37:57.721 --> 00:37:59.670
asset.
And then finally,

516
00:37:59.671 --> 00:38:04.671
the final step is to find what is the tangency line that goes through the

517
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:10.650
riskless rate.
Uh,
it doesn't show it on this chart.

518
00:38:10.651 --> 00:38:14.040
It goes to 5% at a standard deviation of zero.

519
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:15.770
And uh,

520
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:20.810
and then it touches the for a risky asset efficient portfolio frontier at one

521
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:23.790
point.
And then,
uh,

522
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.450
and then from there it goes up above,

523
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:34.050
uh,
in terms of higher expected return for the same variance.

524
00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:37.070
Yeah.
So that's the theory of,

525
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:41.790
of a efficient portfolio calculation.
Um,

526
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:46.480
there's something that,
a fundamental principle,

527
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:51.100
and this is leading us in now to the institutional topic of this course,

528
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.940
is that there's only one tangency portfolio and that portfolio is called the

529
00:39:01.421 --> 00:39:04.100
tangency portfolio.
Uh,

530
00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.940
where a line drawn from the,

531
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.840
from the x axis at the risk list rate is tangent to the efficient portfolio

532
00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:15.110
frontier.
Um,

533
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.360
and so the tangency portfolio

534
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.060
is the portfolio that one should hold.

535
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.900
And the tangency portfolio gives rise to what's called the mutual fund theorem

536
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:47.320
<v 2>in finance,
which says that</v>

537
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:53.390
<v 0>all investors need is a single mutual fund.</v>

538
00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:56.200
Uh,
now I haven't defined mutual fund yet.

539
00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:01.480
A mutual fund is a investment vehicle that allows investors to hold a portfolio.

540
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:10.480
The theory of mutual funds is nobody is supposed to be holding anything other

541
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:16.210
than the idea of theory of mutual fund is holding something other than this

542
00:40:17.661 --> 00:40:18.920
tangency portfolio.

543
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.720
So why don't we set up a company that creates a portfolio like that and

544
00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:26.120
investors can buy into that portfolio.

545
00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:31.850
And so what this,
uh,
if my analysis is right,
namely,

546
00:40:31.851 --> 00:40:36.851
if I've got all of the right estimate of the expected returns on stocks,

547
00:40:36.921 --> 00:40:41.450
bonds and oil and the standard deviations and covariances and I've,

548
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.720
and assuming the interest rate is 5%,
which is what I've assumed here,

549
00:40:44.721 --> 00:40:48.350
that this line,
if you go to zero and hits that 5%,

550
00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.780
it hits the vertical axis at 5% then everyone should be holding the tangency

551
00:40:55.581 --> 00:40:58.370
portfolio.
And what is the tangency portfolio?
In this case,

552
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:02.060
it's a 12% oil,

553
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:05.600
36% stocks and 52% bonds.

554
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.410
Uh,
that's what I got using this sample period.

555
00:41:09.411 --> 00:41:12.560
Some people might disagree with that.
They might not take my estimates.

556
00:41:12.561 --> 00:41:17.000
They might say my sample period was off.
But that's what the theory,

557
00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:22.480
using my data for the sample period that I computed the expected returns and

558
00:41:22.551 --> 00:41:24.650
covariances says one should do.

559
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:29.420
So the theory says everybody should be investing in these proportions,

560
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.280
uh,
and this theory then,
um,

561
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:38.540
it doesn't leave any,
uh,

562
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:44.560
latitude for individual choice except that you can choose which mixture of the

563
00:41:46.791 --> 00:41:50.450
mutual fund and the rest of this asset you want to.

564
00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:55.340
So somebody who is very risk averse could say,

565
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.520
I want to hold only of the riskless asset cause I,

566
00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.610
I just don't like any risk at all.

567
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.550
That person I should have maybe included on the diagram,

568
00:42:04.551 --> 00:42:07.730
but that person can get 5% return with no risk.

569
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.080
Somebody else might say,
well,
I want to just hold this point.

570
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:13.700
I want to hold the tangency portfolio.

571
00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:18.701
That's attractive to me because I could then get a bigger expected return.

572
00:42:18.891 --> 00:42:23.590
I could get almost 12% return per year and I'd sacrifice,

573
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.070
I'd have some standard deviation of like 8% but if that's what I want,

574
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:32.360
uh,
if I have different tastes about risk,
then,

575
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.450
and that's what I want that then that's the optimal thing to do.

576
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:40.520
Other people might say,
well,
you know,
I'm really,
uh,
an adventure.

577
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:44.960
I don't care too much about risk.
I want the much higher return.

578
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.320
Such a person might pick a point up here and that would be a portfolio with a

579
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.790
leveraged portfolio that would be a portfolio where you borrowed at the riskless

580
00:42:55.791 --> 00:43:00.791
rate and you put more than 100% of your money into the tangency portfolio.

581
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:03.950
So what you could do is say,

582
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:08.951
borrow 50 cents on your dollar and put 155 cents into a portfolio,

583
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:15.890
which consisted of 9% oil,
27% stocks in 64% of bonds.

584
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.650
But everyone would do that.

585
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:23.680
No one would ever hold some other portfolio because you can see that this line

586
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.100
is the lowest.
It's as far you want to get to the left as far as possible.

587
00:43:28.101 --> 00:43:30.680
You want to for any given expected return,

588
00:43:30.681 --> 00:43:32.630
you want to minimize the standard deviation.

589
00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:37.490
So it's the leftmost line and that means that everyone will be holding the same

590
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:42.320
portfolio.
Uh,
I don't claim that my analysis is profound in the final answer.

591
00:43:42.321 --> 00:43:46.190
I just took some estimates using my data and again,

592
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:48.800
we could come if someone wanted to argue with this,

593
00:43:48.801 --> 00:43:51.590
they could argue with my estimates of,
of,

594
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.760
of the expected returns of the standard deviations and the covariances.

595
00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.470
But not with this theory.
This theory is very rigorous.
So if you,

596
00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:04.250
if you agree with my estimates,
then you should do this.
As an investor,

597
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:09.580
you should hold only some mixture of this tangency portfolio,

598
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:15.050
which is 9% oil,
27% stocks,
and 64% bonds.

599
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.710
Do you see what we've got here?
I started out with the equally weighted.

600
00:44:18.711 --> 00:44:21.350
I was talking about stocks,
uh,
about uh,

601
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:25.640
and stocks that all have the same variance and are all independent of each
other.

602
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:30.170
But I've dropped that assumption and now I'm going on to assuming that they're

603
00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.610
taking account of their dependence on each other,

604
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:37.020
taking account of their different expected returns and taking account of their

605
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:40.860
different covariances and variances.
So that's what we've got.

606
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.280
This is a famous framework.
It's the kind of this diagram,

607
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.060
I think the most famous diagram in all of financial theory.

608
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:52.820
And so it's,
uh,
it's actually the first theoretical diagram.
Uh,

609
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.230
I did it myself using my data,

610
00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:59.250
but it would always looks more or less like this and be slightly different

611
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:01.500
positions if people use different estimates.

612
00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.600
So I actually showed this diagram.

613
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.230
I went to Norway with my colleague,

614
00:45:09.231 --> 00:45:12.600
actually have a couple more pictures here.
Um,

615
00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:20.020
I was,
that's my colleague run heat.
Well,

616
00:45:20.021 --> 00:45:24.730
me and I showed that we're posing in front of the parliament building in Oslo.

617
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.410
We went to Norway,
did discuss,
uh,
the,
uh,
with the Norwegian government,
uh,

618
00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.580
their portfolio and I,
this is a slide that I showed them.

619
00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:38.350
I showed them the slide that I just showed you,
showing that,
uh,

620
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:43.120
optimal portfolio.
And then I looked at the Norwegian governments,

621
00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.610
uh,
physician.
Uh,

622
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:50.800
the Norwegian government has pension fund assets and the amount of,

623
00:45:51.131 --> 00:45:52.780
as of 2006,

624
00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:58.180
I've just under 2000 to 2 trillion Norwegian kroner.

625
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.980
Uh,
but they also own North Sea oil.

626
00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:06.220
And if you know that it's kind of divided between the UK and Norway,

627
00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:11.500
Norway is a much smaller population than the UK.
So,

628
00:46:11.501 --> 00:46:14.710
and they have a lot of oil up there.
Uh,
and then in the North Sea.

629
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:20.170
So as of then I calculated the value of their oil in the North Sea.

630
00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.030
Okay.
And that's what I got.
It's worth about,
uh,
uh,

631
00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.110
35,
uh,
uh,

632
00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:32.670
3.5 billion Norwegian kroner.
Um,

633
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.650
do you see the difference?
Uh,
in fact,

634
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:40.710
the assets that the Norwegian government owns is about two thirds oil and one

635
00:46:40.811 --> 00:46:45.430
third,
uh,
government pension fund assets.
Uh,

636
00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:50.830
this government pension ficus in dollars,
it's about a 200 billion.
Uh,

637
00:46:50.831 --> 00:46:53.560
and so it's a huge amount of money that they're managing,

638
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:59.100
but I was trying to convince them that they should do something to manage their,

639
00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:00.573
uh,

640
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:05.680
their oil risk because they're way over invested in oil.
Right?

641
00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.920
So where are they on the efficient portfolio frontier?
Uh,

642
00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.080
actually I can activate

643
00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:15.453
this thing.

644
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

645
00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:21.010
<v 0>Uh,
Eh,</v>

646
00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:25.990
they have 64% oil in their portfolio.

647
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:30.520
Uh,
where does that put them?
Well,
it's,
it's really off the diagram.

648
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.870
The furthest point that I recorded,
it was 28% oil that puts them there.

649
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:39.970
So if they,
if you wanted to,
where would it be?
It'd be somewhere over there.

650
00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:45.340
You're off the charts.
And so what the Norwegian government is doing wrong is,

651
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:49.960
uh,
and I,
I,
it was a little bit controversial.
I pointing this out to them.

652
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:52.720
I ended up in the newspaper the next day.

653
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.680
We're having argued they are way off on their,

654
00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.420
on their investment opportunities,
uh,

655
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.970
because oil is such a volatile thing and they've got so much of their assets

656
00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:07.690
tied up in oil.
So I got a good hearing.

657
00:48:07.691 --> 00:48:11.260
We went to the Ministry of Finance and we went to the,
um,
uh,

658
00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:13.930
Noriega's Norges bank,
which is their central bank.

659
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.730
And I think the answer I got from them was,
yes,
you're right.

660
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:23.200
I never got twice like that.
Something like that.
Uh,

661
00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.140
there was,
uh,
a conditional agreement.
Yes,

662
00:48:26.141 --> 00:48:30.820
Norway should manage this oil risk.
Um,
but then,
uh,

663
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.310
there's,
it's politically difficult and that's the problem is that we're not,

664
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.830
we're not able to do our optimal management.

665
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:43.150
Maybe there's a number of structural problems that prevent them from doing that

666
00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:47.380
and they think maybe that,
no,
I think Norway,
we may be moving that way.

667
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:50.940
So we'll,
we'll see in the future.
Uh,

668
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.820
I went to the Bank of Mexico.
I tried to convince the,

669
00:48:54.821 --> 00:48:59.350
I met the president of the Bank of Mexico and it's hard to tell them that Mexico

670
00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:03.190
is too reliant on oil,
too much oil.
They have to get rid of their risk.

671
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.390
And I'm going to the Russian Stabilization Fund and mark,

672
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:10.150
I think I've got an arrangement to meet with them in Moscow and mark.

673
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:14.020
That would be during the semester.
I'll tell you what reaction I,

674
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:18.280
I hope I get from the Russians.
Uh,
but,
uh,
yeah,

675
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:21.910
oil is very important to the Russian economy.
Uh,

676
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:26.040
and are they managing the risk?
Well,
I bet not a,

677
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:30.410
I'm going to do a diagram like this,
uh,
for Russia.
Uh,

678
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:34.050
and the countries that really matter are the ones that,
uh,

679
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.730
the Arabian Gulf countries,

680
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.420
and I was just talking to people at the World Economic Forum about that.

681
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:45.490
Some of those countries are really reliant on oil and so they really have to do,

682
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.720
they really should do a calculation of a efficient portfolio.

683
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:54.220
Frontier is one of the lessons of this course is we have a wonderful theory,

684
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.620
but we don't manage it well.

685
00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:59.680
Mostly and I don't mean to be criticizing foreign countries.

686
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.100
The same criticism applies to the United States as well.

687
00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:04.530
We're in a different position.

688
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:09.250
Where are we on this frontier regarding oil in the United States?
Well,

689
00:50:09.251 --> 00:50:12.220
we don't have much oil relative to the size of our portfolio.

690
00:50:12.221 --> 00:50:16.870
I don't know what present oil reserves in the u s are pretty small.
Uh,

691
00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:21.640
so we're kind of lying somewhere inside maybe on this pink line.

692
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:26.170
So,
uh,
people in the u s don't have the optimal portfolio either.

693
00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:30.640
So I set up a theoretical framework here and,
um,

694
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.390
I wanted to,
uh,
give you,

695
00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:40.460
I mentioned oil because it seems to make it to me so clear what we're talking

696
00:50:40.461 --> 00:50:45.350
about here.
It's a talking about not getting tied up in risk.

697
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:50.240
And so I was talking to someone at the World Economic Forum from an,

698
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.680
um,
an Arabian,
uh,
a Persian Gulf country.

699
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.710
And I said,
uh,
um,
all right,

700
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:02.300
aren't you worried about or worried about reliance on oil?
And he said,

701
00:51:02.301 --> 00:51:05.470
of course we're worried on reliance so much.
Uh,

702
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:10.270
so much of our GDP and of our government revenues are oil related.

703
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:13.250
We've seen the price of oil lately move all over the map,

704
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:16.610
went up to a hundred dollars recently,
and it was just a,

705
00:51:16.611 --> 00:51:19.490
as late as late 1990s,
it was under $20.

706
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.170
And people just don't know where it's going to go.
Uh,
so I think that,

707
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.950
uh,
the,
and,
and these countries are somewhat trying to manage this oil,

708
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.840
but they can't yet get onto the frontier.
And that's assigned to me that,
uh,

709
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.240
that,
um,
uh,
we're not,
uh,

710
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.460
we're not there yet.
And we have a lot more to do in finance.

711
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.193
Uh,

712
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:50.600
so there's one more equation that I wanted to write down and I'm going to not,

713
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:55.520
uh,
uh,
it's,
uh,
uh,
I'm not going to spend a lot of time explaining this,

714
00:51:55.930 --> 00:52:00.410
uh,
because it's,
um,
uh,
it's gonna,

715
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.970
it's gonna take awhile,
but that this is the equation that,
uh,

716
00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:09.130
that relates to the expected return on an asset.
And in the,

717
00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:14.330
it's so called capital asset pricing model and the capital asset pricing model

718
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.320
in finance,
I'm getting charged.
That's a,

719
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.460
okay.
This is the most famous model in finance,

720
00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:37.551
uh,

721
00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:42.350
and it's abbreviated as the cap m not going to do it justice here.

722
00:52:42.351 --> 00:52:46.490
I'm sorry,
but there's so many,
uh,
in,
in ins and outs of this,

723
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:50.870
you should really take a econ two 51 who learned this morning.

724
00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.450
Uh,
but it,
uh,

725
00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:58.050
it was a mile divided by James Tobin here at Yale,
uh,

726
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:03.190
was the original,
uh,
uh,

727
00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:08.520
you've got the original precursors,
but it was more,
uh,
uh,

728
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.830
indented by William Sharpe,
John Lintner,

729
00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.750
Harry Markowitz.

730
00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:22.630
Uh,
and,
uh,
I'll every one of these except the listener.

731
00:53:22.631 --> 00:53:25.710
I think one of the Nobel Prize winner didn't get it,
did he?

732
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:30.240
I think he died too young.
That's the four one of the misfortunes of living.

733
00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.020
Um,
I did that.
I say that right.

734
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:36.750
One of the misfortunes of scholarship,

735
00:53:36.751 --> 00:53:41.180
you have to live long enough to get your accolades.
Uh,

736
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.300
but the capital asset pricing model,
and this is a critical,

737
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:47.520
assumes everyone

738
00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:54.720
is rational

739
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.863
<v 2>and,</v>

740
00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.950
<v 0>and holds the tangency portfolio.</v>

741
00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:14.030
So,
uh,
that is a wild assumption,
but it's fun to make,
uh,

742
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:18.780
uh,
because,
uh,
I know pretty well,

743
00:54:18.781 --> 00:54:21.390
I know very well how that people aren't doing this.
Uh,

744
00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.630
and they have lots of maybe good read.
Maybe it's not because they're irrational,

745
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.060
it's that their political or they're,
um,

746
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.980
they're constrained by tradition or laws or regulations in all sorts of things,

747
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:37.020
but they're not holding the mark tangency portfolio.
But it's a beautiful theory,

748
00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:40.890
uh,
to assume,
see what would happen if they did.

749
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:46.670
That would mean that everybody is holding that same portfolio of risky assets

750
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.100
and nobody is different.
Uh,
they only differ in how,

751
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:55.470
what proportions they hold.
The rescue put the tangency portfolio.

752
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:59.540
Uh,
and sorry,
it implies that the tangency portfolio,

753
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:04.703
<v 2>okay.</v>

754
00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:09.530
<v 0>Has to equal the,
uh,
actual market portfolio.</v>

755
00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:12.640
And that means then

756
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:17.010
it's a very simple invocation of the theory.

757
00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:21.870
In my diagram I said that the tangency portfolio,
all right,

758
00:55:21.871 --> 00:55:24.930
estimated at the tangency portfolio is 9% oil,

759
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:29.580
27% stocks and 64% bonds.
So for all doing that,

760
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:33.030
then that has to be what the outstanding is.
We can,

761
00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.270
if we're all holding the same portfolio,
that has to be the,
the total.

762
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:39.480
So that would mean that 9% of all wealth is stocks.

763
00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:42.900
A 27% of all [inaudible] is oil.

764
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:47.880
27% of our wealth has stock and a 64% of those bonds.

765
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.620
And so,
uh,

766
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:54.750
if you accept my estimates and you accept the capital asset pricing model,

767
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:58.080
that would have to be true.
Uh,
yeah.

768
00:55:58.081 --> 00:56:01.050
I don't want to make too much of my estimates because different people,

769
00:56:01.051 --> 00:56:05.100
but estimate these things in different ways.
Um,
but that's the theory.

770
00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:10.470
The theory says that the Tangency portfolio equals the after my portfolio.

771
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:14.710
And then that gives us the,
uh,
the famous equate.

772
00:56:14.711 --> 00:56:15.960
And I'm not going to derive this,

773
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:20.280
but there is the most famous equation in finance says,

774
00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:22.770
can you read that?
That's our survive.

775
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.440
The expected return on the

776
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
asset is equal to the riskless rate plus something called the Beta for the

777
00:56:33.951 --> 00:56:38.951
[inaudible] asset times the expected return on the market minus the risk list.

778
00:56:40.571 --> 00:56:43.570
Right.
Uh,

779
00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:50.010
now again,
not going to spend much time on this,
but,
uh,
the,

780
00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:54.880
the Beta of the IFE asset is the regression coefficient.

781
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:59.710
When you regress the return on the IFE asset and the return of the market

782
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:04.711
portfolio and our Savannah is the expected return,

783
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.340
um,
the market portfolio.

784
00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:16.523
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:20.290
<v 0>Which is the portfolio of all assets.</v>

786
00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:26.380
The market portfolio is if you took all the stocks and bonds and Arielle and

787
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:29.680
real estate,
anything that's available to invest in,
in the whole world,

788
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.280
put them all together in one portfolio.
Uh,

789
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:36.550
it's the world portfolio,
it's everything.

790
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:42.000
And we compute the expected return on that portfolio.
Uh,
uh,

791
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:44.290
that's our Sebam.
Okay.

792
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.180
And also we need to know how much individual stocks are correlated with what

793
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:53.630
with our Savannah.
We measured that by the regression coefficient.
So,
uh,

794
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:58.690
the Beta of a stock is how much it reacts to movements in the market portfolio.

795
00:57:59.561 --> 00:58:00.880
If Beta equals one,

796
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:05.710
it means that if the market portfolio goes up 10% in value,

797
00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:10.180
then yeah,
this asset also goes up 10% in value.

798
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:15.060
If Beta is two,
it means that if the,
um,
uh,

799
00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:20.090
it's a market goes up 10% in value of the stock tends to go up 20% in value and

800
00:58:21.131 --> 00:58:23.700
so on.
So,
uh,

801
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:28.330
these are the basic theoretical structure is that you answered that they need

802
00:58:28.331 --> 00:58:31.710
for the problem set,
uh,
the first problem set.

803
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:33.550
So the first problem is that I guess you've,

804
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:37.990
you can turn in your first problem set here and,
uh,
before you leave,

805
00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:42.340
because it was due today.
The second problems that is about this model.

806
00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:46.930
And so I realize I've given you some difficult mathematics,
but,
um,

807
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:51.910
it's not that difficult actually,
but I kind of went through it quickly.
Uh,
so,
uh,

808
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:55.680
uh,
w we are setting up,
are you,
um,

809
00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:59.290
you have already gotten email and you've talked to the,

810
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:02.650
about setting up your review session.
So it keeps getting caught here.

811
00:59:04.050 --> 00:59:08.230
Uh,
so I have a few more minutes here.
So,
uh,

812
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:13.800
what I wanted to,
I wanted to talk about,
um,
uh,

813
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:18.780
Jeremy Siegel's book and the equity premium puzzle,
uh,

814
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.980
underlying this analysis.
Uh,
we,

815
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:26.260
we have estimates of the expected returns on

816
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:32.540
assets,
notably the expected returns on stocks and bonds.

817
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.600
Um,
and,
uh,

818
00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:48.200
so,
uh,
Jeremy Siegel in his book,

819
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:52.280
which is a sign for this course,
uh,

820
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.410
it's really emphasizing this capital asset pricing model,

821
00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.760
emphasizing the kind of efficient portfolio frontier calculations that I've
done.

822
01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:06.590
And so what a seagull emphasize the book is really about this.

823
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:11.950
He talks about what is the expected return of stocks and what is the expected

824
01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:15.970
return of bonds and so on.
So,
uh,

825
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:21.010
we're going to call asset one stocks in the US and we're going to call it asset

826
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:26.000
to bonds.
Okay.

827
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.210
And so he estimates for his purposes and he shows you the calculations of the

828
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:33.710
efficient portfolio frontier.

829
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:37.220
But I wanted to just talk a little bit about his estimate.

830
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:40.100
He has data for a very long time period.

831
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:45.670
1802 to 2006.
Uh,

832
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:49.620
okay.
For the u s all right.

833
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.770
Uh,
and um,

834
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:59.120
<v 2>okay.</v>

835
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.500
<v 0>Uh,
over that very long time interval,
um,</v>

836
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:09.370
the expected return,
uh,

837
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:11.140
that,
uh,

838
01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:16.120
we got four a stocks was um,

839
01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.160
uh,
6.8% a year in real terms.

840
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.470
This is real inflation corrected.
Yeah.
Whereas for bonds,

841
01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:31.640
it was a over this whole time periods,

842
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:34.970
2.8% a year real

843
01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:41.330
okay.
And then he also compute sigma one and sigma two and sigma one too.

844
01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:44.930
But I'm not going to talk about that right now.
The real interest.

845
01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.360
And so then he compared to the efficient portfolio frontier,

846
01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:50.000
now he's using a much longer sample than I did.

847
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:54.260
And so he's not going to get this tangency portfolio that I did.

848
01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:59.590
The thing that is very interesting that he finds is the difference 4% between

849
01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:07.810
the historical real return on stocks and the historical real return on bonds.

850
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.200
And so this is called the equity premium.

851
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.690
Actually,
I should take that.
This is really our sub f.
Uh,

852
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.950
he shows all three.
Uh,
our sub F that I'm reporting is the riskless rate.

853
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.310
Uh,
there's also,
if you look at a table one in chapter one,

854
01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:37.311
it shows a Arwan one stocks are too long term bonds.

855
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.010
And these are short term that I'm recording here.

856
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.860
So the equity premium is the,

857
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:52.610
this short term 2.8% is the risk list return historically for a period of a

858
01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:55.140
almost 200 years.

859
01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.240
And this is the return on stocks for a period of almost 200 years.

860
01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:06.050
So stocks have paid 4% more a year over this incredibly long time period than

861
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.960
short term bonds.
Uh,
also they paid much more than long term.
Well,

862
01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:18.560
it's not so different than me.
This,
I don't have the data in front of me.
So,
uh,

863
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:21.640
but let's emphasize the difference between r one and r.

864
01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.640
F it surprises many people that stocks have paid such an enormous premium over,

865
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:33.570
uh,
over the,
uh,
return on short term debt.
Uh,

866
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.400
and so the theme of Siegel's book,
uh,

867
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.000
is,
can we believe this?
I mean,
do you really,

868
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.160
you might wonder,
I aren't people missing something if,
uh,

869
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:50.710
if the excess return is so high of,

870
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.850
of stocks over short term bonds,
uh,

871
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:58.380
why would anyone not just hold a lot of really large number of stocks?

872
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.240
So that's the theme of his book and His book is that his conclusion is that he

873
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.200
largely believes that this is true,
uh,

874
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:11.190
that the returns that we have seen in the u s in the stock market,

875
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:16.650
I have exceeded those of other,
uh,
assets,
uh,
by,

876
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.840
uh,
quite a substantial margin.

877
01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:23.460
And that that means he is calculations are very different than the ones I have

878
01:04:23.461 --> 01:04:26.850
because he has a much longer sample period.
I was using only from eight,

879
01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.370
1983 to the present.
For him,

880
01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:34.740
the optimal portfolio should be very heavily into stocks and this is a

881
01:04:34.741 --> 01:04:38.970
controversial view,
but that is the view that he advances in the book.

882
01:04:38.971 --> 01:04:43.260
And I think it's a very interesting analysis.
Uh,
uh,

883
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:46.470
so what it means then is that the

884
01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.060
optimal portfolio,
it should not be the one I show there,

885
01:04:51.061 --> 01:04:54.960
but she'd be one that's very heavily into stocks.
And,
um,

886
01:04:55.710 --> 01:05:00.060
this is,
um,
uh,
I,
I'm sure I hear us data,

887
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:04.710
but a seagull also argues in the latest edition,

888
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:09.120
uh,
that the equity premium is also high

889
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:15.060
for advanced countries over the whole world.

890
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:19.510
So if you look at his book,
uh,
and again,

891
01:05:19.511 --> 01:05:23.110
in the first chapter he gives a list of countries.

892
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.260
It's based on an analysis that,
uh,

893
01:05:25.690 --> 01:05:29.850
some other that the professor is Dimson Marsh and Stanton,
uh,

894
01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:34.180
used in their book 2002 book.
But,
uh,

895
01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:40.290
they show the expected return on stocks versus bonds or short term debt for

896
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.580
a whole range of countries.

897
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:50.350
And in every one of these countries since 19,
uh,
1901,

898
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:54.090
there has been a very high equity premium.
So,
um,

899
01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.120
I'll let you read Segal and his discussion of this possibility.

900
01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:02.140
But I think that what I want to get now is not necessarily any agreement on

901
01:06:02.141 --> 01:06:06.430
whether you believe that there's such a high excess return for stock.

902
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.690
But I just want you to understand the basic framework.
So the first problem set,

903
01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:14.470
uh,
asked you to manipulate the model that I just presented.
Uh,

904
01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:20.100
the model of how you form portfolios and the model of,

905
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:23.830
uh,
of,
um,
the capital asset pricing model.

906
01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:27.580
And I have one final question just about the mutual fund industry.

907
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.760
The mutual fund industry is supposedly according to theory doing this for you.

908
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.260
So the ideal thing would be that the mutual fund does these calculations and it

909
01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:41.860
puts it all together for you,
at least in some approximate sense.

910
01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:44.360
That's what they are doing.
Uh,

911
01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:48.970
and so I asked you in the final question to just get a couple of websites,

912
01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:52.600
the Federal Reserve and the ICI,
which is a mutual fund industry,

913
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:56.070
a website and a rate,
a little bit,

914
01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:00.520
a couple of paragraphs about what this industry is really,
uh,
achieving,

915
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.860
uh,
or how it's Chen,
how it's trending.
Okay.
And so next Wednesday,

916
01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:08.440
where there's three lectures this week,
uh,

917
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:13.570
Wednesday will be about the insurance industry and I'll see you in two days.

918
01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:13.780
Then.
