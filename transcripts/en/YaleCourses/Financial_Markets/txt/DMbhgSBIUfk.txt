Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Thank the sort of first thing that, um, I, I think most people think about, or the first question when you're, when you're thinking about financial markets, um, is whether they are efficient or not, whether they, um, uh, incorporate all known, uh, information, um, if it's possible to do sort of significantly better than the market as, as, as a whole. And, um, um, I'm not, I'm not sure, used to be absolutely received economic wisdom that, that financial markets where we're efficient now it's, um, I think it's still the dominant academic, uh, uh, view, but, but, um, uh, uh, there's, there's, there's a big debate and, and they're, they're partisans on both sides. It's actually, to me, it's actually a fairly simple question. The, the efficient, the notion that markets are efficient, um, derives from, from an APP priori theory, which is, you know, the same sort of theory about all, all, all Americans.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       There lots of incentives, people acting in their own interest. Um, uh, they, they, they, they, they have to do that. It's a very, um, um, appealing, you know, kind of APP, Priori theory. But, um, uh, the thing about theories is they're supposed to make predictions and if, um, some of the things they predict don't come true. The theory has to be disregarded in there are, there are many, many, many counter examples to um, financial market efficiencies, you know, sort of, um, on one level there are things like companies that have two different classes of stock, um, that are economically identical. So, um, didn't, um, royal shell used to have uh, uh, Dutch shares, uh, uh, that, that, that shares that, that um, um, traded in Holland and dumb UK shares traded, traded in London, um, economically identical. Um, but, but their prices would fluctuate and, um, um, fairly dramatically in, uh, uh, in 98, I forget which way, but, um, one of the share classes was at a a 20, 20% discount to the other and that, and that persisted for several years.

Speaker 1:          00:02:31       So you have economically identical things trading at different prices. Um, you have closed end funds, which are vehicles that, um, on, um, a set of other securities trade as a security listed on the stock exchange. But what they do is own other securities. Um, and whether they trade to a discount, uh, whether the security and the closed end fund trades at a discount or a premium to the stuff they own, um, fluctuates, um, um, meaningfully andW in a way that's sort of difficult to, to, to recognize with the idea that, that, uh, uh, uh, the, it, the security should be reflecting, um, economic value. Um, you have, um, what are called stubs where one public company owns a significant stake in another public company. Um, and, uh, uh, in instances where the one, um, uh, three comm owned palm, um, and the value of its palm stake greatly exceeded the total value of the market capitalization of, of, of, of three com.

Speaker 1:          00:03:45       And that, and that persisted for, um, uh, a number of years. Um, in general, um, uh, uh, less volatile stocks have done better over time than more volatile stocks, which is somewhat inconsistent with, um, uh, uh, the notion of, of, of efficient markets. Um, and, um, uh, lastly there are, there are meaningful number of individuals and institutions, um, uh, who's, um, sort of performance. Uh, look whose performance in portfolios and that Matt, you know, um, uh, is really inconsistent with the markets being, um, uh, efficient and can't really be explained away by, uh, some, some, some of them can, but, but by luck or by, uh, insight information whereby something, um, uh, uh, so, uh, while, while they're sort of a big academic debate, um, and, and then lastly, um, there are things like the Internet bubble or more recently that the housing bubble or, um, uh, uh, Matt usually called this, but, but the landing bubble where we're, um, or the subprime mess, uh, or so forth, lot lots and lots of, uh, security loans, securities that people bought it, pyre that were worth about, you know, somewhere between zero and 15 or 20 cents and, and, and, and now trade there.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       So, um, uh, um, I don't believe that markets are efficient and, um, uh, um, it doesn't really seem like it should be an open question. So, you know, the people that ha that believe it, you know, um, have to die and then nobody will believe it anymore. Um, not very many of them change their mind though they come up with more convoluted explanations, a clever, clever kind of alluded ex explanations for the, uh, um, uh, uh, for the counterfactual, uh, uh, for, for the things that happened in reality that, that, that, that the theory doesn't, doesn't predict. Um, some, some, some markets aren't that efficient on and on the other hand, um, sort of doing better than the markets, um, uh, is, um, is a nontrivial exercise. Yeah. And, um, uh, uh, it's not as easy as as it might appear as, um, I mean some people think it's impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       Other people think it's really easy. Uh, uh, it's actually, you know, not and passable, um, but hired and they are in the, are there are a number of challenges, um, first, um, for individuals, I think the primary challenge is, um, uh, uh, if an individual sticks to sort of areas where they might have an informational advantage or at least don't have an informational disadvantage. Um, they can't, um, they can't own a d they won't own a diversified portfolio of securities cause they're informational advantage. Um, uh, uh, we'll be, we'll be narrow. Um, they also, um, have, have sort of limited, uh, access, um, uh, to the gamut of products and so forth and, and, and, and restricted assets and restricted access and restricted offerings. So, so that's, so that's a challenge for, for individuals, um, institutions or, or, you know, sort of, um, professional, professional, uh, uh, investors, you know, all, all spend a lot of money on, on, on information, and, um, uh, uh, they are, um, um, which requires infrastructure and resources and so forth.

Speaker 1:          00:08:07       But the very sort of nature of being an institution, um, uh, constraints almost everybody, whether it's, um, uh, um, uh, in, in our case, um, all our investors have 30 day liquidity. They can, you know, um, uh, in mutual funds, it's daily liquidity, but their investors tend not to be, uh, uh, as wide awake. Um, but that's a constraint on us is that, um, uh, except for the principals, uh, maybe their families, maybe not, um, all our money can, can disappear in 30 days. So, so, so we, so we have to be cognizant of that. You know, we had, um, uh, uh, we have clients that have, you know, sort of a, um, uh, a set of expectations, uh, um, which you also have to, if not be cat this in about, you know, sort of, um, uh, uh, deal with, and then, um, and then there are kind of universal sort of psychological challenges, um, uh, uh, biases, um, in, in people's thinking. Um, uh, and, uh, um, uh, a number, a number of things that are just sort of difficult, um, for, for, for human beings to, to, um, process and make intelligent decisions. And I think this, this is, um, um, that's kind of an, um, uh, an area of mine. And, and one of the things that, that, that, uh, um, uh, uh, drew me to professor Shiller and, and some of his, his other colleagues. And that's really universal, you know, to not just financial markets but, but, but, but

Speaker 2:          00:10:11       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       but, but, but, but tall decision making. And I think sort of particularly, um, in the kinds of things that, that, um, um, have a serious mix of randomness and skill, that sort of the, the hardest thing for human beings to, to process is something that's kind of an unknown mix of, of, of randomness and scale people that, you know, um, uh, uh, we can understand something that that's, that's fully random and, and the, uh, uh, work out the statistics and, um, uh, be comfortable with that, you know, to some degree, um, uh, uh, things that are, you know, sort of completely cut and dry, fully, fully, fully determined to the Tif. Um, uh, we like that too, but, but, but stuff that's mixed, um, is, is, is, is, is very, is very, very hard. I mean, you know, um, quantum mechanics makes sense to no human being, um, uh, uh, in, in, in my view.

Speaker 1:          00:11:22       And, and, um, and, and, and, and, and in those areas, you know, people, um, um, people are inclined to do sort of, sort of strange things. I mean one thing, um, um, uh, I play a fair amount of po well, um, I play a little bit of poker and I'm very interested in the game and it's, it's sort of, it's a little, it's a little like the markets and other things in that, that there's an element of randomness and, uh, uh, an element of, of skill. One thing that's I find interesting, um, typically, you know, if, if you play poker in a quiet room or casino, I would say nine times out of 10, somebody sitting at the table will tell you that they're not trying. It's, it almost always happens. They'll say, um, uh, and I usually play for more money or, and it's hard to concentrate or I'm just, um, uh, uh, screwing around, um, very, you know, sort of why, why do they do that?

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       What's, what's, what's, what's, what's, why, why do they, you know, not they could just be screwing around, but, you know, why do they tell you? Um, and it's, you know, it's kind of my, um, uh, pet theory that, you know, they would rather, um, you know, they're setting up in advance to lose, you know, they would rather lose because they're sort of screwing around then that's, that's, that's easier for them to sort of deal with them then to, um, um, they could put out their best game, um, and they would do better, but, but, but they might lose anyway. Give, given it's, it's, it's sort of randomness and, and it, it is, you know, that's, that's, um, that's the thing about really good poker players versus less good poker players. Really good poker players play close to their best all the time and, and, and they're not really bothered, uh, uh, when, when, when they lose.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       And I think that's, um, uh, that's true in markets too, in all, in all sorts of decisions. What, what, what, what people are inclined to do. Where we're very interested in doing is, um, uh, uh, setting up pastoring for credit and blame, um, in advance. And, you know, sort of like having, having, having a pre, pre made excuse if things don't go right, they're, they're more there. I'm interested to some degree at least, and having in, in having an excuse if things don't go right, then in sort of maximizing the chance that things go right because, um, even maximizing the chance that things go right. Um, uh, uh, you can't get it to be 100%. There's an element of randomness. Um, uh, bad, bad, bad things can, can, can happen. So, so it's, it's, it's, it's really, really hard to just focus on getting things right and not winning the argument.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       You know, setting yourself up before the fats that you can win an argument after the fact that, um, uh, you didn't, you know, you just, you just got unlucky. Um, uh, um, uh, um, people are, you know, people are very inclined to see things as determinative to sort of, to attribute, um, um, and that not just in markets but, but the psycho psychology literature, um, uh, to believe if you're wired to believe, if something happened, if, if [inaudible] happened before be, um, a Cosby, um, um, B B has to be caused by something and a happened first, um, before it so that, so that's, um, uh, uh, uh, what so, so they, so, so they, so they assigned causality there also, um, uh, inclined to focus on sort of recency, you know, sort of thing. Things they see. Um, um, even, um, um, uh, even if, if, if, you know, they are irrelevant.

Speaker 1:          00:15:40       You know, for example, in the psychology literature, famous famous example is, um, famous kind of test question is I'm a tester. Um, we'll give the test, the person taking the test, um, the name of two cities that they've never heard of and the distance that they're apart, you know, so, uh, two random cities, Xyz and ABC are, uh, 4,200 miles apart. And then they'll give them to other cities that they've never heard of and ask them how far apart they think they are. And people anchor to the information they were given, even though, you know, there's kind of no causality or no sort of reason why it, why it should make any difference. So if, so if the reference that he's, the first cities are 4,200 miles apart, the answers for the next two will center around 4,200 miles. And if the reference cities, uh, we're 2,500 miles apart, uh, they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll center about that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:46       Um, um, so, um, it is, um, uh, I think it's useful to sort of know all the hard wiring biases and, and that, that, that, that, that people have and to, to, to try and, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, de bias. Um, uh, you're thinking, but it's, um, um, it's, it's, it's not easy. Um, and, and, and, and in lots of cases, it's, it's not actually people's objectives if, um, um, and if you watch mad money on CNBC, Jim Cramer and any Kramer rights, nobody, um, well, he starts, it starts this start to show, um, uh, some people want to make friends, I just want to make money. Um, and if you watch the show and you see Kramer, it's, um, um, it's pretty believable. I, you know, I think, um, uh, I think, I think it's true. Um, and, um, um, almost everybody in sort of financial markets is capable of saying that, you know, I, uh, uh, I don't want to make friends.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       I just want to make money. But for most of them it's, it's not true. You know, they have, they have all sorts of things that they want to do. I, the other than than, than, than, than make money. They have office politics. They have, uh, um, uh, um, any, any number of, of, of, of, uh, of, of other motivations. And, and, um, that, that, that psychology is, is, is, is, is really hard and, and, um, uh, somewhat applicable to not just markets, but, but, uh, other things. Um, um, so, uh, uh, so markets aren't efficient, but it, but it's not, it's, it's not that easy to, to, to beat them. Um, what are, what are, what are, what are we try to do? And I kind of would highlight, um, um, would I view was, um, uh, three, three sorts of principles. The, um, first, um, the invest the investment world, um, I believe divides between coupon clippers.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       Yeah. Um, that's the bands historically came with coupons, you know, actual sort of coupons like the thing you bri, Bri by Brit bring to the grocery store and, um, you know, get 25 cents off a can of coffee. So we have this security and, and, and a, uh, a 10 year bond would have 20 coupons attached to each with a, with the data on them. And when the date came, um, he would cut the coupon off and go to the bank and get, get your interest payment. Um, so that was called coupon clipping. Um, basically, um, uh, something that you re coupons or things that you redeem for, for a stream of money. And, and, um, my view, the world divides between, between coupon clippers, you know, sort of people that are taking that are interested in cashflow and taking in k cash flow. Um, and I, and what I would call security resellers, um, um, people that own things that they intend, um, uh, they intend to sell to somebody in the future at, at, um, a higher price.

Speaker 1:          00:20:24       And, um, there are successful coupon clippers and they're successful securities resellers and they, they tend to make their money off of, you know, sort of the off of the unsuccessful people in, in the, the other class. Um, um, uh, we try to be, you know, I think sort of invest investing is about clipping coupons, about getting about getting cash flow and having, getting and controlling, um, uh, uh, can't cash cash flow. But, um, there are, there are, there are good resellers and I think, you know, I think, I think reselling is an element of things like venture capital, the best, the best venture capital capitalists don't just, you know, have, have great ideas or, or, or whatever. But, um, uh, they take an idea, they advance it a little bit, um, and then they, they, they sex it up and promote it and have a good sense for what the public will buy.

Speaker 1:          00:21:26       Um, and, and they get a nice valuation from, from, from, from the public. And I think that that's, uh, uh, that's at least as much as distinguishing feature between, um, good vent venture capitalists among each other then then, then, then, then the quality of their ideas. Um, there are sort of, um, um, Kramer, again, Kramer Kramer was a good resell security reseller. Um, uh, hat had sort of a really good spend, a lot of time and effort and you know, kind of figuring out what is it that people will want to buy next week. And that's, and that's what, that's what I'll buy today. I'm not, because I'll derive income off of it. Um, but because, um, uh, it's what people are going to want next week, uh, and I'll be able to sell it higher. And that's, you know, that, that's, you know, some art, some science, and there are people that that are, are, are very, very good at it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       Um, uh, uh, but, um, I, you know, we tried, we tried, we tried to clip coupons, um, uh, uh, asked us some, um, that's, that's, um, it's a Warren buffet, Islam, he says all invest all investing is, is about, um, um, coupon clipping and, um, uh, the difference between equities and bonds are that, um, bonds come with a coupon that, that's known and equities have earnings in the future that, that you don't know. Um, you also don't know that they'll give them to the equity owners and that to management or not to, they won't squander them in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in the future. But, but, but, but to buffet it is sort of the same thing. It's, it's, it's clipping coupons and, and he describes his job is figuring out what the coupon is in an equity. Um, uh, and uh, um, if it's high enough, he, he, he likes it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       So, so, so, so the first sort of principle to me is, is, is clipping coupons. Uh, the, um, uh, the second, um, is that, um, uh, um, risk is primarily about what is the worst thing that can happen. Um, yeah. And, um, you know, typical sort of secure, you know, Wall Street risk management, um, uh, a lot of focus is on, um, what is the range of moderately profitable, um, outcomes. So, um, um, people talk about via, um, value at risk and, um, lots, lots of people trying to build viasystems. Uh, and what they are trying to determine is how wide is the band of outcomes, how wide is the band of, of stuff that has a 95% probability or 98% probability, usually 95 or 98. But I'm not, you know, 99.9. And, and if, and if you know, um, uh, I have a 98% chance of not losing a dollar, um, that works in the virus screen and, and, and the vibe, and it won't tell you, well, won't distinguish between whether the 2% chance is of losing $10 or losing $100.

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       And, um, to me, um, um, uh, uh, that's, that's, that's a fundamentally wrong approach and it's actually done because, um, uh, it's the sort of thing that, um, um, statisticians are good at. And, and, and, um, to some degree it's, it's harder to imagine the worst thing then to statistically sort of figure out, um, uh, uh, the, the middle band and there's, um, there's, there's a famous saying, if you're good with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Um, and that's, that's sort of what, uh, uh, that, that's, that's like, but, but, but the really important thing is, um, what's, what's the worst thing that that can happen? Um, um, and the last sort of principle, which is actually, you know, most, um, most at odds with sort of the academic community and, and, and even, you know, sort of the, the, the general perception and that is, um, that, um, you don't get paid for taking risk.

Speaker 1:          00:26:21       You get paid for eliminating risk. Now I actually believe in, um, uh, in the history of the planet, there are very, very few instances of people getting paid for taking risk. They get paid for, for eliminating it. Um, uh, as, as, as an example, um, if you think, you know, um, a, a tight rope walk, a tight rope Walker in, uh, in the circus, um, or there's a conception that he gets paid because it's a risky, drab, he might fall. He, you know, he might fall down, kill himself. Um, I think that conception is completely wrong. Now the lifetime earnings of a, of a, a tight wire Walker who falls down and kills himself aren't very good. And, um, in fact, what he's getting paid for is that he practiced a whole lot when he was a little kid. And, uh, a wire that if he fell off of he wasn't going to get hurt.

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       Um, uh, and that he's really getting paid for eliminating the risk of falling off via practice as opposed to taking it. Um, you think about drug development, pharmaceutical companies and, um, um, people will say, well, you know, um, uh, discovering compounds that are effective drugs is an uncertain or risky risky business. And that's so, so pharmaceutical companies are able to make, you know, it sort of get paid for taking that risk. Um, and, and I don't think so. I think they get paid, um, for applying intelligence and nat testing every, you know, not for the compounds they test, but for the ones that they've eliminated testing for because they know, you know, because they understand that the, um, the chemistry or a disease process and have and have some idea what sort of comp compounds, um, our, um, um, or are, are, are more likely, uh, uh, to, to, to work then than others.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       When I, uh, I don't know if he remembers this, but when I, when I last sorted, you know, sort of explain this to professor Shiller, he said, well, what about insurance companies? And I, and I said, proves my point. You know, the, the sort of exact exact case, um, uh, and insurance, um, uh, um, and an individual, you know, has, has risk of, of, of certain bad, you know, bad things, um, uh, happening. If I'm, um, if the insurance company has risk, it's because they've made a mistake, you know, if they're sort of doing their job right, they're, they're, you know, they're actually, um, uh, diversify, diversifying away all the risk and, and, and relying on the law of large numbers, you know, so, um, a casino, you know, does not have a risk that the law of large numbers will be repealed and a roulette table will be a longterm losing proposition or a craps table will be a longterm losing proposition.

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       Uh, uh, uh, they, you know, they have risk that, you know, their overhead won't cover it or that they won't have their risks, that a steady stream of people won't come and, and be, be making a steady stream of bats at which each of them has a slightly negative expectation. Um, so, so we really want to think whenever we look at, at, at anything, um, uh, uh, what kind of coupons can we extract, um, what's the worst possible thing that can happen and how can we eliminate that, you know, and, and, and we do that. Um, sometimes, um, uh, uh, it's, it's by diversification having a lot of sort of, um, of, of, of uh, uh, independent sort of, sort of that's more times. Um, it's having an offsetting kind of position where, um, we're long one security that, uh, uh, issued by a company and try something else that, that, um, uh, uh, uh, we think we think, um, uh, eliminates our risk.

Speaker 1:          00:31:08       So a common kind of position, um, will be long, a high yielding bond bond that yield sort of 15 or 16, um, present. Uh, and, uh, um, I mean, hypothetically, a bond trading at 60 cents on the dollar, uh, with an 8% coupon, uh, uh, five year bond that's yielding about 18%. Um, maybe the company has a $15 equity price. Um, and, uh, we'll be short 15 cents of, of, of, of the equity m and a, which we'll try and keep all, all the way down if, if, if, if the stock's $20 and we could stay short 20 cents worth of stock, all the, all the way down if the company went bankrupt, company goes to zero. Um, uh, on our short position, we'll have taken in about $60, which is what we owned at the bind for what we paid for the bond. Um, we have a superior claim in bankruptcy, will, we'll, we'll recover something.

Speaker 1:          00:32:20       Um, and, um, uh, uh, in the meantime, we, we get this 8% coupon that, that we get to, to, to, to clip. Um, so that's, that's coupon clipping and, and risk mitigation. Now, now there's, there's the other side of the stock going up and we have to think about, um, uh, uh, how much that can cost us and whether our coupons are enough and whether the difference between 60 cents that we paid and the hundred that the bond matures enough is, is, is app to cover that. But that's, that's, that's, that's the sort of thing. Um, we do and it's, it's coupon clipping and it's, um, a risk mitigation or, or risk elimination. Fair fit, fairly short. Um, the last thing, um, I thought I'd, um, uh, uh, talk a little bit about, is, um, um, what's, um, what's happening in the, in the world today and the, the financial system today, which, um, uh, uh, to us, um, it's, it's, um, if, um, uh, if you're trading at an, an investing, you know, kind of all sort of strange things happening in your world, um, uh, and, um, uh, uh, they're, they're just unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       Um, and, uh, um, you go outside and, um, uh, you, you, you talked to people that have jobs and, and you know, and lives or, or, or go to school. Um, and they're completely unaware that, you know, they're, they're, they're absolutely, you know, they have absolutely no idea that this really amazing, unbelievable thing, you know, just happened. You know, so like, um, uh, there's, um, uh, uh, there's a shortage in, um, uh, um, hard red winter wheat and the, the, um, uh, um, uh, uh, so, um, uh, Minneapolis, so Minneapolis wheat has gone from kind of 10 to 24 now back to now, now to about 18 or 20. But in one day it went from a 20 to 24 and a half, a 22% move, um, in, in, in, in Minneapolis, wheat, you know, and, uh, um, most of the people in the world, you know, had no idea that, that, that, that had occurred and it makes absolutely no difference to them.

Speaker 1:          00:35:15       Well, one of the things that sort of happening, uh, in, in, in, in, in the world that's, you know, sort of central to the people that, that look at it all the, all the time. Um, but of, of maybe less direct relevance to, um, uh, uh, to, to people that that bad head had everyday jobs. Um, is that, um, um, the banking, you know, more so then, um, I mean, I've been at this for 30 years. Um, and in those sort of 30 years, there've been lots of, you know, sort of mini crises and, um, uh, uh, um, violent violent moves up or down, um, dramatic squeezes or, or, or, or liquidations. But I'm more so then than any time in, in the past, um, uh, 30 years, um, uh, the banking, the banking system is really closed. Um, um, the, um, the, the big American banks are not functioning.

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       They're, they're, they're, um, you know, their doors are open and people come and go ev ev every day. Um, uh, but, um, they're there, they're there. They're not really open for business. Um, uh, you know, they're, uh, they're neither making loans nor selling the loans. Um, uh, uh, uh, they have, um, and it's, um, um, uh, um, uh, it is, it is starting, you know, it's, it's, um, it's affecting, you know, sort of the fringes of corporate America, uh, now not in that yet. Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, all of it. Um, and it's, um, um, it's what happened in Japan. Uh, I know from 90 to, is it over in Japan, you know, maybe, or maybe not, you know, uh, they usually talk about it as, as, as, as the lost decade. Um, um, Jap, um, were, were, were, were Japanese banks were not liquidated, but they were not, um, uh, uh, real, real, really in business.

Speaker 1:          00:37:54       Um, and, uh, uh, that's, that's happened now. No, primarily as, as, uh, as the result of, of, of losses in, um, um, uh, now all mortgages. Um, but, um, uh, mortgage just and, um, and, and, and, and leverage loans and the, um, um, and in my view, um, uh, um, uh, uh, the fad, um, had, um, uh, the fat has dramatically cut interest rates. Um, uh, you know, we started, um, from, from 5%, uh, to three, but three quarters of it, a quarter at a time. Every fed meeting, which are fed meetings are generally about six weeks apart, but then one and a quarter of it within a two week period from four and a quarter to three. And, and they're, and they're talking about, um, uh, looks like, uh, they'll go from three to two and a half, uh, whenever the next, what's the next fed meeting, um, in, in, um, within, uh, within a couple of weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       And the markets are saying they're going to go all the way back to one, which was, which was the low for, for, for short term rates. Um, uh, proport it, you know, um, uh, to some degree they say, um, um, uh, their, their, their, their, their, their objective is, is to fold, um, to spur economic growth, um, uh, as, um, uh, as, as the credit crunch sort of slows, um, economic activity. Um, and also, you know, I mean kind of independently or compliment or really as, as a corollary to that, um, uh, to, to free up the financial system, um, and to, to help financial institutions. Um, it's, it's kind of my contention around that. It's that it's actually hurting financial institutions. It's actually having the effect of not, um, um, of not letting the, the, the market's clear. Um, and it's, it's,

Speaker 3:          00:40:29       um, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       it's nature of financial. Um, um, uh, well, I mean that, um, when I was explaining that to professor Shiller, he's, he said he, you know, he didn't quite follow it, so I probably shouldn't try it. And he knows more than I do. So, um, um, but it, but, but, but, but, but, but, but it's, but it's a very interesting time in that, um, uh, we're, um, we're having a bit,

Speaker 3:          00:41:01       uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:41:05       we have consumers under pressure because of, um, uh, uh, they are over extension of credit and, and they're having a overpaid for houses, um, over, over the last, um, a handful of, of years. You know, we have kind of a slowing economy I had there because of that or because you know, the economy kind of slows, um, uh, uh, f, F, F, F, F, F, every once in a while we have financial institutions under, under stress, um, uh, or, or duress. Um, and unlike sort of the, the previous time, um, we, we, um, um, we have headline inflation of 4.3%. Uh, I think it's high or, you know, I think lots of economists think it's lower, but, but it's quite headline inflation is, is higher than, um, uh, not nominal interest. Um, uh, then, um, uh, nominal interest rates, uh, uh, we have a very weak currency.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       The, um, um, uh, the dollar has gone from, uh, uh, uh, um, from buying a little over one year old to, to buying two thirds of a year old. Um, and, uh, uh, uh, a couple of years and 130 yen to a hundred yen, um, one and a half Australian dollars to a little, uh, a little over one. Um, and the, um, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, uh, and, and, and Ann, Ann, Ann, Ann, an Ann Ann. In that scenario, um, there, there are more problems than policy tools. So, um, anything, um, uh, uh, any, any, any, any, any, any policy action, um, uh, has downside, you know, which, um, which makes it an interesting time, not half the time. So it's a questions.

Speaker 4:          00:43:37       There's the,

Speaker 1:          00:43:55       um, I think that the question is, you know, sort of, um, um, whether markets are more apt to overprice toe overpriced versus underprice, whether they're more inefficient when things are going up or when things are going down. Um, uh, um, I don't, I don't think I have a systemic sort of view. I mean, you know, lately they've been more inefficient, you know, um, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, in my view because, because the feds creating too much money. But, um, uh, in recent years there've been more examples of things that are priced too high than things that are priced too low. Um, but, but, but, but, but, but there are both and, and, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:44:52       um, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       it makes mistakes in both directions.

Speaker 3:          00:45:02       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:45:11       How do you think are the best ways an individual,

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       um, again, this, this, this is something that, that, um, uh, I think Ben Stein agrees with, but, but just about, um, uh, nobody else. I think, I think for individuals, um, um, instead of thinking of, um, uh, I want, uh, I want to have report actually to have a portfolio and I should be invested all the time and, uh, uh, I, I should divide it up. Um, uh, you know, Kay ash stack and bonds depending that pan. Um, how, how old I am. Um, I think, you know, people's default position should be cached. Individuals default position should be cash and, um, uh, they should only make, um, uh, in, um, investments. Um, if, if there's really, if they can see a really compelling case, um, and you know, over over the course of time, um, um, uh, fairly compelling, um, fairly compelling cases do come up and they're not, you know, um, and individuals are, are in as good a position as, as professionals, um,

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       uh, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       to, to, to, to, to, to see that. So sometime in, in your lifetime. Um, uh, um, stacks, um, uh, um, equities as a group. Um, um, we'll, we'll, um, we'll be, we'll be, we'll be cheap by sort of, you know, most of the standards that, that have have worked in, in, in, in, in the past. So, um, um, uh, professor Shiller in his books, he's, he's got, um, uh, current multiple of trailing 10 earnings, um, um, uh, uh, good measure. So that takes the cyclicality, uh, uh, out, out, out, out, out of earnings. And, and, and you can see over history how that multiple has varied. Um, and you've done very well, you know, over, you know, you've done poorly. Uh, if for the most part, if, if, um, snacks is done much better if, if you've bought them at a, at, at a point that looks cheap and that graft and one that that looks expensive and, uh, um, sometime in your lifetime you'll get an opportunity, uh, for, um, stacks and look cheap and they measure, they'll probably at the same time look cheap, um, on a, uh, on a price to book basis on a dividend yield basis that they, they, they, they tend to, to, to move together and you can sort of look at them and say, no equities as, as, as a class are cheap.

Speaker 1:          00:48:34       I have a compelling reason to sort of take money out of cash and, and put it into equities. Now, I mean, I think, um, um, uh, a few years ago as, um, uh, um, as, as the housing bubble, um, was taking off and going full bore and as it was easier and easier for more and more people, uh, who normally couldn't have bought house houses to, um, uh, uh, to, to eight, you know, to, to go from renting, um, uh, uh, to owning homes. Um, apartments, residential reads, apartment house reads. Um, we're again, you know, you know, sort of an obvious historical measures. Um, uh, interesting. Maybe even even compelling, you know, so, so, so you could buy apartment buildings for way less than it costs to, to, to replace them. You could, um, uh, with public apartment reeds you could get, you know, between, um, a, you know, five and 9%, uh, uh, current income component when interest rates were, you know, down at, at, at, at, at two or three, that was pretty compelling.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       Didn't re, you know, as, as sort of an asset class and, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, worked, worked, worked really, really well. Um, um, municipal bonds right now, um, municipal bonds yield more than the equivalent yield more than the equivalent treasuries. Um, proximately, um, 1.1, 1.2, um, uh, uh, times. That's, um, uh, that's, that's, that's pretty compelling. The, um, the only other time that happened was one, um, there was sort of talk of, of their losing their tax exemptions and, and tax rates were going down. Tax rates are going up. Uh, there's no talk about, about losing in their, their exemption. That's, that's pretty compelling.

Speaker 4:          00:50:58       I just want to point out that contradicts one of our docs should be equities, might misunderstand you or

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       I disagree with them. Um, uh, you know, I, and, and, and Ben Stein, I think is the only person who, who sort of agrees with then he, he wrote a book, yes, you can time the market. Uh, I think, and he, and he sort of basically says, you know, only buy things when you have a good reason, you know, sort of a really,

Speaker 3:          00:51:34       uh, uh, um, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       compelling reason, um, uh, to, to, to, to own them. Um, I think, you know, I don't, I don't, um, um, I don't know what he, what, what he says about this, but, but I, um, um, I think most of this sort of equity, um, uh, to me that the historic kind of case for equities is survivor by it. You know, it is us centric and it's, it's survivor bias bias. Um, obviously, you know, the, um, the u s went from, uh, you know, kind of average agrarian, uh, contrary to the industrial classes of the, the world. Um, and so obviously act or as a corollary to that equities did really, really well. Um, uh, it's not, you know, I mean, it's not,

Speaker 3:          00:52:36       um, uh, um, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       yeah, it's not a hundred percent clear that, you know, sort of over the next year, a hundred years that, um, uh, Asian might not China, India, um, the tiger is collectively might not surpass us or, you know, or the world might not do that well for the next hundred,

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       you know, um, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:53:05       hundred years and the, the last hundred years in the u s don't really have that much predictive power.

Speaker 4:          00:53:21       Can you talk a little bit about why securities and look what the manager,

Speaker 1:          00:53:34       um, uh, you know, I've, I've, I've convinced some people though, um, uh, David Swensen really disagrees with me and if, if you read his pioneering portfolio management and, and, and, and the syllabus, um, he has, um, uh, uh, um, uh, he really has, it has, has a preference for equities. What I liked about fixed income, I think fixed income is inherently more analyzable. Um, uh, um, with, um, because you have sort of specified coupons in and matured a specified coupon and a specified maturity. Um, and, uh, uh, uh, uh, you have, uh, you have a fixed income, you know, either either they pay you or they have to reorganize and, and, you know, they either pay you interest or they have to reorganize or they, and they pay you principal, um, or they have to reorganize. And it's, um, um, uh, um, uh, in, in inherently more analyzable.

Speaker 1:          00:54:53       Stacks really have to be, um, um, really have to be cheap because, um, you know, in general they don't pay out their earnings. And sometime in the future they're pretty apt to do something stupid. And they are, you know, um, uh, uh, and um, um, uh, and um, uh, um, um, you can't, you can't tell. On the one hand, I do think, you know, sort of, um, um, if, if, if there's a stack that, um, uh, um, is selling for four, you know, four or five, six times earnings. Um, and you have good reason to believe that the earnings are going up. Um, somethings, uh, um, when, when, uh, uh, one stack sells for, for you know, uh, mid single digit earnings multiple, uh, the market is telling you that the market is saying that that earnings are coming down. Um, if, if you have good reason to believe that earnings are going up, um, if in fact you're right, um, in that case, when you buy the stock, you are making a bet on the earnings going up and if the earnings go up, you'll get paid twice because, um, the multiple, the multiple we'll go up to.

Speaker 1:          00:56:19       That's sort of sort of the way, way things, things trade. Um, when you sort of just, if you buy something at, at, you know, um, um, uh, a, uh, um, Aramco, uh, um, uh, uh, the maker of, of blackberry sounds for came to 50, 60, 70 times earnings. When, when, when, when, when, when you buy that stock, um, uh, um, earnings can go up around it and you know, you could think, and I'm buying the stock cause I think earnings, you have to think earnings are going to go up. Um, you know, 12 fault to get it down to sort of work times earnings which you know, will take a long, long time. They are, um, if you know earnings are going to double, you really don't know very much about what will happen to the stock price because, um, uh, you know, if they're going to double over the next two years, hypo hypothetically if you're, if, if you're right on the head, it doesn't matter cause, cause I'm the multiple could very, very easily, um, uh, go from, from 50 to 25. So, um, it's, it's um, uh, and, and in the end they'll, they'll, they'll never pay you any dividends. You know, so, so, so how, so how do you collect, you know, um, um, how do you ever collect a coupon? How do you ever get a hold of, of, of, of cashflow? So, um, I, yeah, I just, I just hate on him and snacks. I love and I love and I, and I love people sending me checks, which is, what about,

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       um, um, uh, um, I think, um, uh, uh, um, a couple of points. First, um, uh, I do think it helps the world to have security prices that are closer to there. There they are accurate value, um, Dan then further away and um, um, uh, and, and more tending towards their fair value over time. Um, then, um, gyrating, um, complete so completely randomly. So, um, uh, if hedge funds could absolute themselves of hedge funds, could make markets completely efficient, um, it would benefit the world a lot. Um, uh, uh, is one. And so to the, and to the extent that they help make markets efficient, you know, I do think, uh, uh, they, they, they help the world. I do, you know, sort of agree. Um, um, I think, you know, sort of, um, um, involved investors, um, also, um, improve the performance of, uh, um, uh, the, the country's fixed assets.

Speaker 1:          01:00:09       Um, and, um, uh, um, uh, that, that, that helps the world too. And they had to turn, people aren't, um, uh, and, and I, and I think more and more that'll be a part of, of, of what hedge funds do. I mean, for, um, uh, we gave it up, but, um, uh, uh, we owned an air. Um, we are, um, we own some country, uh, along with, uh, um, the patterns group, um, which is a Minneapolis based point to point airline, um, uh, competes with northwest. And, and we, you know, um, uh, it was kind of an, an experiment I'm somewhat in, in, in behavioral economics and we, we hit, we had distinct ideas about what their business strategy should be. Um, uh, uh, we couldn't, um, and Petterson and white box actually did not disagree. Um, but, um, um, the, um, white, white, white box got completely disillusioned with, with management and wasn't, you know, so we sold our stake to patters.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       Um, but, um, if, um, um, uh, if, if, if, if, if, if, if our, is, if, if our ideas were good, you know, it really would have benefited consumers in, in the, the twin cities. Um, and, and I do sort of think that, um, um, people have sort of real money at stake. Um, our APP to, um, uh, over time and on the average, you know, their, their ideas will be better than, um, uh, uh, uh, um, peep, peep, peep, peep, people who, who don't have anything at stake. Um, I mean act activist investors, which, which are mostly sort of hedge funds. Um, uh, um, uh, I think often, you know, often, you know, either either make management better via via competition or on balance, their ideas are right. Um, and they certainly challenge, you know, for forest management to, to at least consider, um, uh, uh, uh, alternatives.

Speaker 5:          01:02:46       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:47       Yeah. I think if, if, um, um, I, I wrote in my, my last letter, I just, I just read Paul Krugman, Paul Krugman, his book that the kind of the New York Times editorial is the contract fee, the conscience of a liberal. And, um, um, like a lot of hedge fund, I'm pretty free market right wing, um, uh, uh, conservative. But, um, uh, uh, I think unlike hedge fund compensation is really a market result, um, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, um, it's the result of, of, of negotiations between informed parties of, of roughly equal economic clout and sophistication. Um, executive compensation is not the result of, of arm's length negotiations. And, um, uh, um, uh, there's a new, it's actually, I think a Yale study. Um, um, um, an executive compensation, something like 96% of, um, uh, fortune 500 CEOS, um, get their full severance severance package if, you know, even, even, even if, even if, um, uh, if they're dismissed for, you know, like anything other than, um, a major felony, they, you know, they can perform badly. They can, they can be found to have breached their fiduciary duty. Um, but, but, but, but, but they still get a lot. So I wouldn't, I, I, I'm, I'm on the hedge fund side and against the sort of company management side.

Speaker 5:          01:04:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:36       Backdating options. Um, um, and, um, um, uh, sure. Um, we, um, um, uh, um, somewhat, um, sort of the, um, uh, the, the history, um, when, when, um, um, um, bonds are governed by what's called an indenture, which is the sort of legal agreement between the company and bond holders. Um, yeah, in a typical, um, bond indenture, uh, if a company fails to file financial statements on time, um, that's an event of default under their band agreement. And, um, and usually, um, the rat, the remedy for an event of default is, um, you can demand, you can demand immediate payment acceleration and, and, uh, uh, immediate payment. Um, we, um, you know, in, um, in general, you know, like people don't read every, you know, PR people own bonds without reading the indenture. We, you know, we, um, uh, uh, they're long, they're not written in English.

Speaker 1:          01:05:57       Um, in most set of circumstances they are, they are irrelevant. So, um, we actually didn't really know this until, um, uh, we own, we own defined in the company that did, you know, that, um, couldn't file the fight, their financial statements on time and somebody else owned them and discovered them and, and, um, demanded that they get paid and, and ended up negotiating with the company and he, and, um, um, uh, uh, we got, uh, we got a kicker. So that was, that was kind of our first experience for thing that made us aware that not filing financial statements was an event of default. And therefore, um, um, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, something that would entitle you to, to, to payment immediately. So, um, for a comp, so for companies that could pay you back, but their bonds are trading below par, probably because they have a low coupon, um, you know, so if bond was issued when interest rates were lower, um, uh, they might have a 4% coupon when the prevailing rate is, is, um, six.

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       So, um, uh, if it's a four year bond, it would trade at about 90. So it would be yielding six. But if they default, you can, you know, if, if you can buy them at 90, and if they can't file your financial statements, you're entitled to Pyre. Um, uh, so we were interested in finding bonds, uh, uh, um, bonds trading below par. We are, we thought there was a chance, um, that, um, uh, companies would not file their financial statements on time and it turned out at the time, you know, um, one of the big causes of companies not filing financial statements on time was, um, if they had backdated these stock options, they do, they know what backdating is. Um, uh, um, if, if they had backdated their stock options, um, they'd have to restate their financials. It's, you know, they'd have to investigate, takes time and, and so forth.

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       They delay filing their, their, their financial statements. Um, so we tried to identify, um, companies that we thought it backdated there, their stock options. Um, uh, uh, we bought, um, we bought a database. Um, we can, we, we, we cleaned it up. Um, and, um, um, you know, we basically looked at at, um, their pattern of, of stock app shouldn't issuance and tried to figure it out. Um, uh, uh, the probability of and having been caused by chance. Um, and, uh, um, for companies that we thought had backdated stock options that, you know, we could, um, um, uh, we could buy their bonds at, um, what they would trade for it without, um, without this potential, um, event of default. Um, uh, that was kind of a, a, a riskless trade because if they filed on time, um, uh, we, we hadn't paid anything if they were late.

Speaker 1:          01:09:33       We had the prospect of, of, of getting par, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, quickly, um, uh, later, you know, um, um, in, um, um, in the very beginning, um, uh, the sort of, um, uh, so the kind of history, you know, there was the first trade where somebody else discovered that not, you know, um, company couldn't find their financial statements because they had sort of bad record keeping or, or whatever that that one was not. Um, uh, uh, I option related. Um, uh, uh, so, um, that, that, that first one was kind of happenstance, you know, kind of the next, the next time, um, mixed couple of times companies announced that, um, uh, uh, they were apt to delay it, their financial statements and the first few times you, um, you could, you could, you could buy their bonds at the same price it has before they had announced that [inaudible] and potentially, um, oh, do you pyre.

Speaker 1:          01:10:49       But, um, that, that did not, you know, um, and here, um, you know, in terms of, um, uh, uh, sort of, um, market efficiency, um, it didn't last forever. And, and you know, after, after three or four times, um, by, you know, companies would announce that they might, that they were going to delay their, their filings and lo and behold, their bonds would go up because people had discovered, uh, that, that, that, that, that you might be, um, uh, entitled to Pyre. So, so someone had stopped working, you know, like waiting, we, we tried to anticipate what companies might not, not be able to file them and, and, and, and buy their bonds. Um, uh, in, in, in, in advance. Um, we gave the SDC, um, uh, uh, are, are studying and algorithm. Um, they wouldn't tell us, uh, what they are out, um, uh, uh, exactly who they were targeting and, and, and how, um, though I got the sense that their approach was, was similar to ours and they sort of seemed, um, even though they didn't say anything when we were talking to them, they, they seem sort of pleased that, that, um, um, uh, when we did something you could see that when they were sort of pleased, when we took that to me and that was what they were doing.

Speaker 1:          01:12:22       And, and, and they were, you know, sort of, uh, happier or thinking that, that, that, that back got it right as, as it happens. Um, um, uh, um, for so far the, that we've been involved in, four companies have argued, um, uh, uh, in court that failure to file financial statements is not an event of default. Um, and, um, uh, um, we won the first case, which we really thought sat all that. Um, uh, we've subsequently lost too. And, um, uh, one one is pending. The wording is slightly different in, in, in all the dentures, but in general, um, we've settled eight or nine cases, companies sort of agreed and, and, and, and, and, and we negotiated a settlement. Um, and, um, in terms of, um, uh, you know, whether, um, uh, whether, um, whether hedge funds are an instrument of, of social good, um, uh, uh, or an act, um, um, the, um, in the litigation companies argue that, uh, you know, we're, we're opportunists and, um, uh, you know, we went in and bought more bonds after they filed late and, uh, um, uh, we haven't been injured. Uh, um, and it's, um, you know, basically unfair that, that, that, that they, that they should, should have to pay as pyre. Um, I, you know, I, um,

Speaker 3:          01:14:17       um, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:14:20       I did consider this, you know, sort of noble work, you know, cause, you know, I think, I think, I think companies should honor their agreements. Um, it's also the case that, um,

Speaker 3:          01:14:32       um, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:14:33       if we, if, if a company paid off their bonds or, or settled them, they sat on it for all bond holders. Um, uh, and, and not just us. If anything, you know, sort of other bond holders get to free ride on us.

Speaker 3:          01:14:50       Um, uh, but, um,

Speaker 1:          01:14:53       I think, you know, I think, I think hedge funds, you know, sort of,

Speaker 3:          01:14:56       um, uh, um, and now, um, uh, um,

Speaker 1:          01:15:04       no, again, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's sort of a good thing. Um, if documents in and agreement have, have, have meaning, um, uh, and that, that requires active, engaged paradise days. Otherwise the party that's active and engaged will take advantage of the other.
