Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay. So what I want to talk about today is about, uh, the places where stocks are exchanged and or bonds or other securities. And it's another huge industry. Uh, I would say it's part of our information technology or information network because what we have to do is find a, a national or international price for a security. The problem is that, uh, when, uh, when, uh, securities are traded without a central market, different people will be getting different prices for the same thing. Uh, we have what's called a, maybe the term, uh, what markets do for us is, uh, important

Speaker 2:          00:00:45       term is price discovery. That means that,

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       uh, there is a market price that an asset would have if everybody in the whole world, we're free to buy and sell the asset on the same market and at the same time, uh, but if you don't have an, uh, an organized exchange, uh, which is open and available to everybody without a lot of costs, then you don't have effective price discovery. And that means that nobody knows what the asset is worth. Um, in a, in the whole market, we take price discovery for granted, but we have to realize that there's a technology that brought us, that, uh, and it's a technology that I want to emphasize has been improving over the years. It's not static. Um, so, uh, I wanted to start by just defining some important terms, uh, regarding exchange of a securities, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       part and calm his broker and I'll put it over here. Another one is dealer.

Speaker 1:          00:02:04       Uh, that's the two kind of people who, uh, who trade a securities, uh, and, uh, uh, it's important to keep, uh, the concept. Uh, and so, uh, one thing that's used to describe it's, we start with the letters B o a see that sounds like it's very British overseas air corporation. But that's not what I mean. Now, this is a minimum, an active, remember broker, uh, it says brokers, uh, act on behalf,

Speaker 2:          00:02:43       uh, for others as an agent, uh, for which they earn a condition.

Speaker 1:          00:03:04       Okay. So, uh, uh, broker goes between two people, uh, and, uh, the two people trade with each other. The broker makes it happen. And the broker receives a fee called a commission, uh, for, uh, making, bringing these people together so that they could find each other and make the deal and make the trade for dealer. Uh, we have, uh, different, uh, it's d h p m.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       Okay. Uh, a dealer, uh, act for, we'll say herself or himself, uh, as a principal

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       for a markup. That's the fundamental difference. Uh, in contrast to a broker, the dealer actually buys and sell, sells, uh, himself or herself. And, uh, and that means the dealer, uh, I read, says hesitant inventory of whatever it is that a, so that the dealer is, has something to sell. If you, if you go to a dealer and biosecurity, you're buying it from the dealer out of the dealer's inventory. If you sell through a dealer, you sell to the dealer. Okay? So there's a fundamental difference. The mark up is the difference between the price that the dealer, uh, uh, buys and sells that. So you'll see that there's a fundamental difference. Now, a securities law says that you can never function as both a broker and a dealer. In the same transaction, you've got to be one or the other. The same person can do both. You can be both a broker and a dealer, but not in the same transaction. Uh, we also have the term, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:05:37       and finance broker, hyphenated dealer, that's called BD,

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       right? A BD is a firm that hires the employers, brokers, and dealers. Okay. Uh, and so, uh, the fact that they hyphenate, I'm doesn't mean that any one transaction involves both broking and dealing. Um, so, uh, the, uh, uh, you can see the difference in, in ordinary life when you buy and sell a house, you're a real estate agent is a broker. But the real estate agent usually does not buy the house from here. Or if you're selling your house, uh, or if you call up a real estate agent and say, I want to sell your house, the, the agent doesn't say, okay, I'll buy it. So that person is operating as a broker. However, if you go to an antique shop, uh, and uh, and say you want to buy a chest of drawers or dining room table, you will be dealing with a dealer.

Speaker 1:          00:06:54       Right? And I guess there's fundamental reasons and why it works out well and one and why, why did it tends to break down differently for the different, why is it that we have dealers for antiques and brokers for homes? Well, I think it has something to do with, uh, can you tell me why? Why did we do it that way? Uh, I was thinking it had something to do with the information cost of, uh, since make running a house is such a big decision. Um, and you've got to go looking at the houses anyway, right? Some are antiques. You wouldn't have an antique broker. Right. Would you, uh, the [inaudible] I guess you could, people could have antiques for sale in their homes and the antique broker would take you around on a tour. And what if that's my blackberry? So wired up here, uh, that was my blackberry. Sorry about that. Um, so, uh, okay. So, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       okay. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:08:15       so the, uh, anyway, uh, the, uh, concept of a broker dealer, uh, is that, uh, it is something regulated once again by the security and Exchange Commission. So that means any broker dealer must register with the SEC. So in that sense, we have a sort of licensing for broker dealers. Broker dealers in turn are responsible for their, uh, for their employees who are acting as brokers and dealers and, uh, the employees. Um, we'll have to be appropriately licensed. And so what broker dealers do is, um, according to our securities law, uh, they would manage their employees,

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:16       exams through Finra. Now, I mentioned that before. That's the successor to National Association of Securities Dealers that, uh, has exams for brokers and dealers. Uh, and so what it is that a broker dealer is a company that, uh, that hires people and they become a licensed as brokers are dealers through, uh, their own broker dealer using FINRA. And so that's the organization method that we have. The reason why we have it this way is that there are so many instances of bad behavior among brokers and dealers that have to be, uh, that have to be handled. And this goes back to a basic theme of this course that human nature is imperfect. And while economics theory ties to describe people as honest and following the rules, there are so many opportunities for bad behavior,

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       uh, that, uh, uh, that, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       that have to be corrected. So I, I've taken the licensing exams for Finra because I want myself to do, uh, to do, uh, we creating a securities. Uh, and I think it's actually a very good program. They have a, and they have continuing education that brokers and dealers have to take. And one thing that they do and the continuing education, I was impressed with what they've come up with. They have actors and actresses portraying situations that brokers and dealers will come up with, well encounter that are not quite ethical. All right. So, uh, you know, you'll have the, I remember there was a scene where a woman comes up to the broker dealer and, uh, there is a document that she has a joint account with her husband and there's a document, uh, that requires both of their signatures and the broker dealer hands it to her and she signs.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       And then, uh, and then he says, okay, can you get your husband to sign it? And he said, she said, oh, he already did look right in front of the broker dealer. Uh, and then they show the broker dealer backing down. This is in a skip that I saw a and accepting. Okay. She said, I'm sure it's all right with him. And so he says, all right, and then the get goes on and shows how much trouble he got into for accepting you. Then there's husband shows up the next day and they're getting a divorce and he's furious. And, um, he tries to cover it up by pretending he didn't know. And then she then comes back and admits that he just told me it was all right that my husband, I could sign for my husband. So there's all kinds of moral issues that arise and I think that the system works as well as it does.

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Uh, because we have institutions, we recognize that there's a tendency for all kinds of bad behavior. So my own experience with Finra was, uh, uh, increased confidence in our broker dealers. I think that, uh, we have a good system that there's going to be a lot of temptation for bad behavior. We have a pretty good system in this country for, uh, for educating people not to do that. Uh, we also actually go after broker dealers who do things that are seemingly innocent. So for example, churning, I mentioned this before. Churning is, uh, overtrading a customer's account. So, um, it's, uh, it's not obvious to an uninformed investors that it isn't a good idea to trade stocks every other day. Okay. He beat, uh, uh, but it's obvious to anyone in the field. If you're trading stocks that frequently, there's just no way that you could make money.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       He hasn't, there's nobody who can get a 50% return on stocks with reliability. You know, we've know that David Swensen, we mentioned him before, has got 18%, but he's the star. Right? And you're not going to do that. Well realistically. So if you're a jerk churning, if you're paying more than 18% in commissions every year, you, you, you just don't have a chance. And so I, you know, I broke her, could try to hide behind some kind of facade and say, well, but I think I can learn that, but unfortunately we have a good enough regulatory agencies to stop that. And so, uh, right now brokers who check to churn their portfolios will be caught by market surveillance and they will be thrown out of the profession. It's actually, uh, you can be disbarred, uh, prevented from trading for life. Um, so that's the kind of regulations we have.

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       I think it's a very, you know, the, the world is more ambiguous and, uh, faces more of moral dilemmas than you would imagine. You have to get out into the business world and start seeing how often they come up. And it's kind of remarkable that we have a system that handles these dilemmas as well as we do. You see a lot of anger now, like for example, with the subprime crisis and people who supposedly or allegedly behave very badly and it's certainly some of them did behave badly, but we have a system that, uh, I think, uh, has developed over many years that that works pretty well. Um, now these are so brokers and dealers are people who work with the exchanges. Uh, but I want to go on to talk about the exchanges themselves. Okay. Um, on which these people trade. And this is unfortunately a difficult topic to keep up with because, uh, the exchanges are changing every year. And I think a big impetus for change is the advance of information technology. And I might say also financial technology. This is a world in rapid change. Uh, it's not a fixed at all, but, uh, wanted to talk about different kinds of exchanges. We have traditionally we say in the U S or four markets

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       and one of them is called the first market.

Speaker 2:          00:15:56       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       Uh, and this is traditional. Uh, and that is New York Stock Exchange. I'm going to come back, it's now called NYC year or next, but let's just be traditional for the moment. New York Stock Exchange is the old original stock market, uh, and the dominant one. And so we call that the first market. Then there's the second to market. Uh, and that is Nasdaq. Okay. And that's, uh, that stands for National Association of Secure Securities Dealers. Automatic quotation system. Uh, that was the first electronic exchange. Uh, it was founded. Okay. New York stock exchange was founded in 1792. Nasdaq was founded in 1971. Very different tradition, uh, between the two. Um, and um, oh, I should say the second market I have to add that is the NASA Nasdaq national market is Nasdaq, uh, is divided into two parts. There's the national market and the third market, so called third market is Nasdaq small cap.

Speaker 2:          00:17:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       Small cap is means companies with capitalization is low capitalization. Remember is the price per share times the of shares. So it's the value of the whole company. Uh, and, uh, uh, the small caps are, are treated separately on Nasdaq, and then there was the fourth market. Uh, and that's, uh, beyond the exchanges itself. This is as large institutions trading amongst themselves.

Speaker 2:          00:18:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       Uh, it does happen. There's no law saying you have to go through and it an exchange.

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       You can just buy and sell whatever. And especially if it's a very large transaction, uh, it can happen that, uh, as part of some deal, uh, institutions will trade shares, uh, and they don't have to go through the market. But, uh, we, we really think that these are the most important, uh, markets. Uh, so let me incidentally, these are not the first stock ish and the United United States did not invent the stock exchange. Uh, and I think maybe I mentioned this before, but [inaudible] who, who's a professor at Stanford, uh, has researched the ancient Romans stock exchange and claims to have identified, I think I said this before, has a claim to identify where in the Roman forum, the Roman stock brokers a work and it was out of a certain temple. You can find the location when you visit Rome. Now I think it's in ruins, but you can find where they traded stocks, but it was never very big. Uh, and then some people say Antwerp had the first modern stock exchange, I don't know, like many centuries ago. Uh, Amsterdam was an early, uh, London was an early stock exchange so we came kind of late in the United States to stock exchanges. 1792 is kind of late in the world history. Uh, however, I think that the u s actually features somewhat prominently in the history of stock exchanges because there was a New York securities law

Speaker 1:          00:20:12       1811, which, uh, it became a model for securities law and which made the stock exchange in New York especially important. The 1811 securities law in New York, uh, established two important principles. The first one was that anybody can set up a corporation and have it traded on the stock exchange. Anybody who follows, who satisfies some criteria specified by securities regulator, but the criteria did not involve, uh, the state legislature convening and giving you permission. It was automatic. Okay. Who doesn't matter who you were, they would do anybody. But of course there were, there were restrictions then, you know, the company may have had a certain capital requirements and they're like, but it was democratic until then. It used to be that in many countries, companies would require an act of parliament to be founded or the king would have to sign something. Uh, now it was very clear that it was democratic. The other thing that New York securities a lot of 1811 did is, uh, make it law. That limited liability, uh, was always and standard.

Speaker 1:          00:21:35       And that is that limited liability means that you as a stock market investor can never be sued for the Miss Doings of the company you invested in. This was a very fundamental step in, uh, securities law because before 1811, while there were some limited liability, the idea was already out there and some companies put limited liability clauses in their charters. It was never clear, never so clear as in New York. Uh, and so you didn't want a trade and buy a few shares on some exchange because you had the possibility of getting hit for that. They could come after you. Uh, so, uh, with the New York Security Law of 1811, uh, the New York stock exchange began to really prosper because then it became something that anybody in the world could come in and, and buy a share there and have no worries, except you can only lose your money that you've put in and nothing more. So, uh, that turned out to be a very important innovation, which came in the u s and accounts, I think for the importance of New York, uh, in finance. Uh, it was copied, you know, later in the 19th century, Oliver Europe, this, this, this kind of securities law, but it took a long time.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       Okay. So, uh, the New York stock exchange was founded in 1792, uh, outdoors under a buttonwood tree. I've always wondered what, what was a buttonwood tree? Uh, the, I guess somewhat some stock exchanges occurred in coffee houses. People used to like coffee just as they do now. And that's like a good place to trade stocks. You'd be it at Starbucks or something in London for the equivalent of Starbucks, and it will be a natural place to trade stocks. Uh, but, uh, actually the New York Stock Exchange was founded under a buttonwood tree. I looked it up a buttonwood tree. It's just a sycamore, uh, or American plane tree. And we have them, I'm just wondering why we have them around here. They're just outside somewhere. Um, and I don't know why they call them button woods and maybe they've made buttons out of them. Oh, the wood.

Speaker 1:          00:23:56       Uh, but, uh, so, uh, the system has gone on now for well over 200 years, but it's changing, uh, because of, uh, our technology. Uh, and, uh, so, um, it's one of the themes of my book, new financial orders, how much technology has advanced our financial markets and institutions. So there was some, uh, if you look at the number of stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange, say around 1800, it was just a handful. It was just not very big or not very important. Uh, but it was certain kinds of information technology that really made stock exchanges, uh, take off. I like to just mention a few of them.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       Uh, one was, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       we were living in a very primitive world in 1800. You know, people were actually using feather pens. Uh, that was, that's what you would use. And at that time, um, also paper, it was very expensive in 1800, if you bought a newspaper, if you look at newspapers from 1800, there'd be a single sheet typically that folded in half of paper. And why was that? Well, it's because paper was so expensive, uh, because in 1800 paper had to be made out of scraps of cloth. They didn't have wood pulp paper, and they didn't have had to be made by hand. You'd have people, you know, uh, washing the fabric and then laying it on a screen all by hand and then enrolling at then. So, uh, it was too expensive. So, uh, we got, uh, in the 19th century, we got cheap paper.

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       Uh, uh, and then, uh, we got, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:26:07       I mentioned think that's important for us.

Speaker 2:          00:26:10       We got carbon paper.

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       This came in the 19th century, a lot. There were some maybe primitive version allowed you to make copies. The typewriter that came in, uh, in, uh, 19 late 19th century. Uh, so you could, you could make records much more accurately with a, and make copies and that's important to net copies so that they're backed up.

Speaker 2:          00:26:34       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:26:36       we had printed forms, although those actually go back, uh, to the, in Holland. I think we traced them back to the, maybe the 17 hundreds, but the idea is having a document with spaces to fill in numbers and then you put it in the typewriter. You've got printed up multiple copies of this with carbon paper between them and you type. It's very accurate. Uh, it makes it possible to do business. Um, we invented filing cabinets in the eighties and nineties comparatively recently, isn't it? You kind of amazing filing cabinet. We have the drawers that come out and you put file folders and it wasn't until the 1890s, uh, that came in before that you would take documents and tie them up with ribbons and put them on bookshelves. Well, it may have been other systems as well, but we didn't have the modern filing cabinet. But the really important thing was electronic technology.

Speaker 1:          00:27:34       Uh, and we had the telegraph, which came in, uh, by Samuel Morris. And, um, when was the 1840s, I think I might have it. Uh, Samuel Morris graduated from Yale University in 18, 10. Uh, and he patented the Telegraph, uh, in 1837 so it was 1837. Uh, so as I mentioned, there's also a college here or any of you from Morse College? Yes. Go only one. Nobody else from Morris. Oh, there's a good number. Yeah. Uh, so, uh, he did something very important. Uh, incidentally, he lived, his house is a 58 Trumbull, which is a three blocks from here. And if you want to, you can walk over there and see Moore's house. He used to have a inventions, uh, parked out on his front lawn, but they're not there anymore. They've taken the, taking them in. But this is a very important invention because electronic communication, uh, instantly or at the speed of light essentially, uh, is what now underpins our exchange. Um, and, uh, but the next thing that happened, and that's, uh, a little bit later in the technology was the ticker machine.

Speaker 1:          00:29:13       Uh, and it's not entirely clear who invented it, but, uh, because there's various versions. But apparently it was invented by Thomas Edison. Uh, and the, uh, this was, um, he was, uh, he, this was his first event. You've heard of many inventions and Thomas Edison quite remarkable that his first invention was in the area of finance. And so that was in 1867. And how old do you think he was when he invented the ticker machine? He was 23. So that's just so those of you who are thinking of your careers, some people get started at are good young age, uh, and doing this was a, this was a, the Annie, you can't even know what a ticker machine is. Uh, do you know what I'm talking about? I take her machine, if some of you do anyway, uh, what it was was, uh, like a computer printer.

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       I mean, he was just like way ahead of his time. We have these printers. You have one in your room or somewhere that, uh, when the electronic signals come to it and it prints out a on the paper, uh, well he didn't, he invented one in 1867. Uh, what, uh, did you remember the telegraph from machine that Morrison invented? Uh, was it required humans on both hands? One person would be tapping on the Morse code on one end and there'll be another person listening on the other end who would transcribe it by hand. So Edison thought, well, there's no reason why it shouldn't be done mechanically, uh, at the receiving end. So he invented a, a sort of automatic typewriter that printed out and the initial application of it was to a stocks because that was, that's the kind of information people needed continually on a big basis.

Speaker 1:          00:31:14       So he invented this printer. Uh, and uh, it's a little different from modern, we have a standard paper size now, which is eight and a half by 11. Right. But he didn't want to use all that much. Remember, paper was more expensive and he didn't need to get a lot he wanted. So he changed the shape of it. So the paper instead of being that wide was like that wide, uh, because all he had to do port was put symbols for stocks, uh, abbreviations for their names and then the price at which it traded. Uh, and he wanted to get a lot of these in rapid succession out, so he didn't need a wide width. Right. It's very all very logical. So it was basically a computer printer with a narrow, with, I forgot to bring it today. I should have, I was telling someone at the New York Stock Exchange that I was telling my students about the ticker machine and students didn't, my students didn't seem to know anything about it. So then he sent me as a gift, a ticker tape. Uh, it was just the roll of paper tape. So they were using a ticker tapes at the New York Stock Exchange until 1964 I think it was a, and he said, well, we still have some in the attic here and he gave me a role. They don't try to bring it. So, uh, um, this, this is just maybe a curious history about, uh, communications. But, uh, do you know what a ticker tape parade is?

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       Some of you are, uh, the, um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:42       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:44       these ticker machines used to be printing out stock prices.

Speaker 1:          00:32:49       Oh, constantly. And so this tape was just constantly running and sorry, it would pile up in these huge wads of, uh, you know, of paper tape. And so, uh, they had always dispose of it at the drawbridge is cause all this paper tape had to be thrown away and it was a disposal problem. Whenever there was a parade down Wall Street, people would, uh, they would use this ticker tape like confetti and they would tear it up and do the shorter legs and they would toss it out the windows. And so you'd see all this paper tape coming down. So we still are, this is all obsolete now, but it's in a sense, it's, it's, it is electronic communication technology, uh, that, um, uh, and I guess we're still wasting a lot of paper, right? And we just change the width. So we don't call it tape anymore. Uh, uh, we call it printer paper or something like that. So it's not the, not exactly the same. Uh, uh, so, uh, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       So, uh, the, uh, is the idea that we should have one market, uh, w w when we have a ticker tape machines, uh, we still use the word ticker symbol for the short abbreviation of a stock. Okay. So, um, every stock has a, a abbreviated name. We don't need abbreviations anymore because our printers are much more effective, but we still have them. Uh, and so that's the official, the ticker symbol is the official name for a stock, uh, or other security that's traded on an exchange. Uh, so, uh, when you have electronic communication, it should create a national market, uh, uh, that, uh, uh, is where everyone is getting the same price. However, it doesn't necessarily work automatically. Uh, in 1975, uh, people made a number of complaints to our lawmakers in Washington that in fact, while we have ticker machines and we have a lot of tea, actually, they were already gone by 75. But, uh, there were a lot of electronic communications, but we're, some people were not always getting the same price. Someone would say, I placed my order and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and I got a bad price. Uh, I realized later I could have traded at some other estate. Nobody told me, uh, at at the same time. And so, um, so congress created, uh, it was the securities act of 1975 wanting to create a national market

Speaker 2:          00:35:39       system.

Speaker 1:          00:35:47       Uh, and so congress mandated that securities brokers set up some kind of electronic system that would allow people to trade on whichever exchange has the best price. So it was a center of a challenge to the monopoly of the New York Stock Exchange because you're a broker. If you place an order with your broker, uh, this, we would have a new electronic system. So they broker would look over all the different exchanges and see which one has the best price. And so that's what you want as a customer. So it was implemented with something called the, its a her market trading system,

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       uh, which allows a broker to look over all the changes and find the best price. And that was set up with computers in 1970 in the early 70, [inaudible] 1975, uh, or shortly after 1975. And so it's been in place, uh, ever since. Uh, however, um, it was because it was mandated by Congress. Uh, the computer system was up to date and modern in the early seventies or late seventies, but it hasn't kept up. Uh, and it's become considered a slow as they sort of dinosaur, uh, and uh, um, people want to avoid trading in it. So, uh, in, um, 2006 all the major exchanges, uh, propose that we replaced the, its with something called and s linkage, which is just a more modern version of the computer technology. But, uh, I don't, I haven't heard anything about it being implemented. Now again, since I don't trade, I maybe if some of you knows what's happened with this NMS linkage system when we put this NNS linkage was from host.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       But you see what's happening when the government tries to mandate a linking of exchanges, that's not the same thing as having a market impetus for linking of exchanges. Uh, and so, uh, uh, what's actually happened is really ignoring the national market system. Computer technology has advanced so rapidly. It starts to create opportunities for people to set up their own competing systems and who cares about the its which is a dinosaur which nobody likes. Uh, and so that, that's something we have to, that there's different approaches and there was going to be clever people who come up with new ideas about how to trade stocks. So, um, this brings us to the so called e c ends. Uh, they were called the electronic communications networks.

Speaker 1:          00:39:03       Uh, and what happened was with the advent of the Internet in the mid 1990s, people started setting up websites that, uh, they look like stock exchanges, but maybe they weren't. Uh, the, uh, um, I guess the first one was instant that, uh, I'm not sure it's the absolute first one, but instant that was, uh, now understand that the exchange has to register with the SEC. And the SEC has all kinds of requirements. Uh, and if you're setting up some website, you probably can't satisfy all those requirements. So instant that set up a, an electronic bulletin board I call it, which was not an exchange, but it was a place where people interested in buying and selling shares could post their interest. It was like an electronic bulletin board. Uh, and uh, uh, so it will be especially important for people who are placing really big orders, uh, because, uh, they might want to, uh, not just put it on the floor of the exchange, but to, uh, uh, they might want to say something on the, on the thing about, you know, under what conditions I would buy this or something like that. So it became more flexible and became very popular among institutional traders. Uh, then there are a number of other easy and now the FCC allowed them to be, to function as ECM, which is a separate category. Uh, and they start to look like exchanges. And I guess the legal history of this is very complicated. Uh, they ended up merging with exchanges. This is in the 1990s and early two thousands.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       I remember one that impressed me because I heard in the 90s, the talk from the founder island was a, uh, exchange that was created when you see this, um, that was created, uh, for small investors. Uh, and uh, it actually started to look a lot like an exchange. Uh, what I found interesting about island, they, the person that I heard speak about it in the 90s, uh, spoke of this as democratizing institutions and it was the web culture taking over what the stock exchanges had done. Uh, and so what island did is it posted it's limited so-called order book order book on the web to the whole world to see, uh, and uh, uh, it, uh, it was kind of challenging stock exchanges which had kept the order books, uh, more or less in secrecy. So let me just step back and let's go back to what happens on an exchange and how instant that in Ireland are different.

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       There was another one, another big one was called archipelago. That sounds like Ireland archipelago was another website that you used to be able to get on and you could read these order books for any stock and you see some, but let me, let's step back and talk about what goes on. Traditionally at the New York Stock Exchange, and it still goes on today, the New York Stock Exchange, which is the biggest stock exchanges in the US, but also in some ways the most old fashioned, they still have a floor trading floor. Most dark exchanges, um, have uh, uh, abolish their trading floor. I just gave a talk in Moscow, uh, at their stock exchange and I was mentioning something about trading floors and someone raised his hand and your audience that you're talking it, the Russians stack exchange trading for, that's where my Tarko, I didn't even know I was in it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:22       Uh, I was in the German, uh, Frankfurt Stock Exchange, uh, and I was, uh, uh, they said, let's show, I'll show you our trading floor. So I walk in and I just see a bunch of school children. And they had, there was nobody there except schoolchildren. And it turned into a museum. That's what's happening all over the world. Everything is going electronic. But the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange and the American stock exchange of a few, uh, x versus the Montreal, I forget now. Anyway, there's very few that still do it this way, but we still have a floor. Okay. And so, um, you have, um, for each stock you have a specialist who stands and a post on the floor of the exchange. So each stock has a specialist. Okay. Uh, and then, uh, you have, uh, trainers who roam around the floor and go to, uh, these are, uh, brokers are dealers who are, um, uh, who are trying to buy and sell stocks.

Speaker 1:          00:44:34       Uh, and they go to the various posts, uh, and they make their rounds. They have so many stocks they want to buy and someone that they want to sell and they go around, uh, uh, on the floor of the exchange. And if they want to buy a particular company, they go to, they know where that specialist is and they go there on the floor of the exchange. They can either buy and sell from the specialist who is a dealer who maintains an inventory or they can buy and sell from anybody else. They meet at the post because everyone there is licensed. It's not open to the public. So what happens is there is a crowd that develops at each specialist post and the crowd, uh, consists of, uh, people who, uh, who decided to go to that specialist post to look, uh, uh, at what they want, uh, the passively by herself so that they can buy and sell with from anyone.

Speaker 1:          00:45:37       The specialist is sometimes just standing there watching and it's all happening. But the specialist and the New York Stock Exchange maintains that the specialist fulfills an important function, which is to create an orderly market. So the specialist has a responsibility as well as a, an opportunity the other people at the crowd or just doing their own business, but the specialist is supposed to be obligated to preserve a good market. So if for some reason the price prices dropping rapidly, uh, and the specialists thinks something's wrong, the specialist is supposed to come in and buy a on his or her own account to do it. That's an obligation. Uh, and so, uh, uh, there've been, there have been problems. For example, in 1987, when the stock market dropped precipitously, there are criticisms of the specialists for not buying to support the market, but then specialists said in their own defense, what can we do with the market is crashing.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       So it's not clear that specialists make a huge difference, but, uh, that's the presumed advantage. Now, it used to be, this is an interesting historical thing that, ah, in the, before the 1930s, uh, there were, um, there were two crowds on the stock exchange. There was the, um, the buy sell crowd. Uh, and there was another part of the floor. Uh, I can't find this in my notes, uh, where stocks would be rented. I had the dates here and I don't remember. I can't find it in my notes. Um, well, uh, shares are, it's called the lone crowd.

Speaker 1:          00:47:38       There used to be a special part of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where stocks would be lent rather than sold, right? There's two things. You can do it, there's two kinds of trades, but you got to a real estate broker. You can say, I want to buy a house. Or you can say, I want to rent a house and the broker can do both of those for you. Uh, same thing with stocks. You can say, I want to buy a stock. Or you can say, I want to rent a store, or you can go the other way. I want to sell a stock and I'd like to rent out. And I started, well, why would anyone want to rent a stock? Uh, or rented, uh, well, that's called short sales, right? They would rent to stock and sell it. And so, uh, uh, it used to be that, uh, uh, they, of course, if you're lending out of stock, you might demand some compensation for that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       So they used to, uh, argue at, there'll be a specialist crowd called the there to be a crowd that would argue about the rental costs, which is an interest cost for loaning, for borrowing a security. And The Wall Street Journal used to publish, there were two stocks sections, there was the price section and there was the loan section. Uh, and that however disappeared in the after the stock market crash of 1929 and apparently it disappeared because of a concern that shorting stocks was the cause of the 1929 crash. And the story was at j Edgar Hoover who was head of the FBI, thought that shorting stocks had caused the crash and he didn't like it. And if j Edgar Hoover didn't like what you were doing back then, you were afraid and worried. So the New York Stock Exchange without ever publishing it just shut the whole thing down. And to this day we don't have a loan crowd anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       We do still lend out shares, but it's uh, it's not done on the floor of the exchange. Uh, anyway, the specialist at the floor of the exchange has a book, uh, and it used to be a big thick paper book. Uh, and what the specialist would do. Uh, who would, uh, specialists would a record in the book, uh, offers and uh, uh, uh, bids and the bid and ask prices. There will be people who would tell them, um, the specialist that uh, I want to sell so many shares at such a price or buy so many shares at such a price. Uh, and the book would show a list of orders that were outstanding. Um, now this back to, um, I should clarify kinds of orders. When you call up a broker and say, I would like to buy or sell shares, there's different, you can, you can give, you're giving her a brook Roker and order. You can give the broker a market order. If you give a market order to your broker, you're saying you only have to give the broker one number, which is a number of shares. So I can have a buy order or a sell order market order. If it's a buy or all I do is say I want you to buy for me is let's say a thousand shares of this company and whatever price is out there, it just, you know, get the best price you can, but they execute it right now. Okay. So it only gives me a number of shares.

Speaker 2:          00:51:30       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       Another kind of order, however, is a limit order.

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:37       And with this order, you have to tell the broker both the number of shares and the price, uh, and uh, there is a, either a buy or a sell. So, uh, if it's a buy limit order, you want to say, I want you to buy the stock at any price up to the one I mentioned. So I would give, I would say like a thousand shares at $30 this year. Okay. And that means that if it's a buy order, uh, you wait until you don't execute it immediately, you execute it. When the price falls below $30, a person would do this. Who thinks? I think the stock is a good buy at 30, but not where it's trading now at 35. So I just put it in, just tell my broker, I'm placing, I want, I want you to take this limit order and I don't expect you to fill this order.

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       Maybe you'll never fill it, you know, but I just want it to be there until I correct it. Uh, you're disposed to be standing ready and you're supposed to notice when the price falls below 30th, and then you, then you buy, if it was a sell limit order, you would say, uh, I want you to sell it. If the price gets up to 40, uh, and again, if it, if it's above the current market price, it won't be executed. Now. It might never be executed. Uh, then there's another kind of order call the stop loss order.

Speaker 2:          00:53:12       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       and with a stop loss order, like a limit order, you have to both give a quantity and the price to your broker when you place the order. But, and it's similar to it, but it's in a different, uh, stop a cell. You can have the same numbers here. Uh, you can say 1,030, uh, for again, but it would have a different meaning. A stop loss order says to sell when the price hits 30 in this game, if it were a stop loss order for a thousand shares at 30, it would be to sell. Uh, if, if the price today is 35, all right, not by it, it's a different motivation that you would do a stop loss order. You see the difference. If it's a limit order, I'm saying, I think I, the stock is only worth 30. I want to buy it when it gets down to 30 with a stop loss order.

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       If the actual price today is 35 a share, I'm saying, I'm worried about the stock crashing on me. So I want you to get me out if it's crashing. And when the broker has to know, well, when do I get you out? Well, you have to say when, so that's, this is when, so you'd be telling if it's a sell order, you would be selling, telling your broker, sell the stock if the price falls below 30. So He's, he has a fundamental difference, you know, limit order and the stop loss order. There's also a buy stop order. You can tell your broker, uh, I want you to buy the stock. If the price rises above 40. All right. Now, why would someone do that? Why would you hell have an order to buy the stock? Only if it gets expensive. Uh, well, the people who would do that, or people who've shorted the stock, and if you've shorted the stock and the stock price starts going up, you're in potentially in big trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:55:04       And so if you worry about that, then you can take a buy stop order in place that with your broker. Uh, so what island did, uh, I'm going back to. The brokers used to have these, all these orders for the market orders wouldn't end up on their book because it would just be executed immediately. It would be gone. But these limit orders and stop loss orders would be, uh, would be on the book of the broker. And the broker would then know the mar, the specialist at the exchange would have this book, uh, which recorded customers' orders, uh, and sort of the specialists would understand the market because it would have a whole bunch of these orders on the books. Uh, nice thing about island when it became part of our web culture, uh, in the, um, in the 1970s is, uh, they created their own book on the web.

Speaker 1:          00:56:03       And, uh, so, uh, you could get a, and you can actually, and it was free open to everyone. Um, and so, um, so, so you have the, um, uh, you'd have my orders and sell orders. Uh, and this would be something you could see on the web. Actually. You can see things like this on the Webinar too, but, uh, not through Ireland anymore. But let's say this is some company. Let's say it's IBM. All right. Uh, and, uh, you would see something like this, uh, the buy orders, would you see how I get this? Right? It will be the first one. We'd say for $90, a share, 100 shares, someone's willing to buy a hundred shares. At 90 a and over here you would see something like someone is willing to sell at $92, let's say 200 shares. All right? So, um, there's no trade here, right?

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       If somebody is willing to buy at 90 and someone else was willing to buy at 92, there was no trade, then you'll see other orders. Somebody else is willing to buy at 89 and a half, say 200 shares. And you can see these descending, I'm just making up numbers, 88 for a thousand shares and so on. And so we didn't see other people, someone who's going at 92 and a quarter for 300 shares. I'm showing all the purchases in round lots around a lot as a hundred chairs. Uh, but you could also have odd lots, but most of the time people put round lots on as their trade. Uh, and so this book would then sit there. There's no trade here, right? This is the, uh, this is the inside spread that is, that is the, on the limit order book. Those are the trades that are closest to execution, but it's not a, it's not an executable trade.

Speaker 1:          00:58:23       Yeah. Uh, so what would happen then? Uh, and it was his, he would watch the book. It says it's not electronic. It corrects itself quickly. I don't know what the specialist had to do with a feather pen. Originally. They would have to cross these things out with ink and, uh, uh, the book was probably hard to maintain, but now it's all automatic. So suppose someone comes in with a buy order for a hundred, at 90, I mean, a sell order for a hundred at 90. So someone's willing to sell at a lower price. What happens immediately on this, this thing you can execute it in disappeared. Uh, and uh, so you see that happening on the book. And so it's fun to watch, uh, an electronic book. Uh, this is what a broker is. See who, uh, are members of Nasdaq and they see the electronic trading system, uh, or, uh, of course there's many such books now that are available.

Speaker 1:          00:59:33       Uh, so, uh, the dealer at the specialist on the exchange also has his own, his or her own bid ask spread, uh, which is a, also an offer you're by herself on the exchange incident island would only allow one kind of order. Original. Originally it was only limit orders, uh, because they didn't, they had a system where you had to put it onto their book and so everything had to appear on the book. Uh, and so it was just the limit order book originally. Uh, so the history of this, or let me see, I guess one thing I wanted to, uh, when I was leading up to is that the EEC hands are, are history now. They've been generally merged and acquired notably the New York Stock Exchange, which has been a holdout doing floor trading, uh, bought, uh, archipelago because archipelago, it was growing so fast doing this kind of electronic trading was, was really catching on.

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       And New York Stock Exchange began to worry that it was a starting to get behind the times. So New York stack, these things which were started by kids and by a young college students in the late nineties just grew so fast and they got so big that archipelago, we're starting to look like it was going to get bigger than New York Stock Exchange. So finally, New York Stock Exchange merge with them and they changed the name after 200 years in business. They changed the name to n y. S e r Arca X. Rkx is short for archipelago exchange. Uh, but that didn't last long. I'm going to change their name again. They just merged. New York Stock Exchange, merged with the European stock exchange euro next. And so now it's called NYC Euronext. Everything happens so fast. It seems fast to me. Maybe, uh, uh, the, uh, New York stock exchange is in the process we think of merging with the American stock exchange.

Speaker 1:          01:01:39       Uh, and that's happening right now. Um, but I, uh, I wanted to just finish with just a little bit, uh, of a thoughts about what it means to be a dealer in this market. Uh, and, uh, what is it that if you are a dealer operating on one of these exchanges, you are placing orders effectively in somebody's book and, and, uh, uh, uh, and standing ready to buy or sell a dealer is someone who is trading every day and, uh, who has an inventory of stocks, uh, fraternity. Uh, and I wanted to just maybe close with a little thought about what it's like to be a dealer. Uh, I've never been a dealer and I don't know the emotional thing, but, uh, the problem with being a dealer, uh, of any kind, uh, and maybe it takes a certain moral stamina, mental stamina to do this kind of thing, is that you're trading every day, right?

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       You're not someone who's managing the Yale portfolio. What you're trying to do is make money every day by buying low and selling high. Uh, and you have to be ready to stand, ready to take orders because people come to you, right? Someone will come to you or maybe someone in a specialist crowd who wants to place an order, uh, or by herself, and you have an inventory. You're like an antiques dealer. Uh, and uh, uh, the problem, one problem is that, uh, your life's work unfortunately as a dealer is summarized by your portfolio and your inventory. Uh, that's why I didn't become a dealer. Actually. I don't, uh, I guess you have to have the right her stomach of steel or something. But the thing that I wanted to invest on you is that no matter how well you do, uh, your cumulative score is there in your portfolio and it's a competitive business and so you run the risk of being ruined at anytime in your life.

Speaker 1:          01:03:56       Uh, and so this just, I wanted to remind you of the what's called the gambler's ruin problem because being a dealer is a little bit like being someone who goes to the gambling casino every day. If you enjoy your visit to the gambling casino, maybe you want to be a dealer. A, actually, I don't really enjoy it, so I just not the right person to do this. Uh, but I really wouldn't like about it is that you always stand the chance of being ruined. That is losing everything. So I just wanted to review it. This is a little bit of mathematics that is in a market microstructure theory. Um, okay. Um, so, uh, suppose you're a dealer and uh, you have a way of either winning or losing money on each transaction, okay? Uh, and suppose the probability of winning on a transaction is equal to p. Uh, okay. Um, that's the probability of winning on one of your trades. And to simplify this thing, let's say that you either win or lose. If you win, you get $1. Uh, if you, if you lose, you lose $1. So you win $1 with probability P and you lose $1 with probability, one minus P. Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       Uh, so I want to know what, what is your life life career going to look for? Like if you're just doing this every day for the next 30 years. Okay. Um, well the first question is, uh, what, what does, what does the probability of your being ruined and let, let's start with the case. P equals a half. And let's not say 30 years is close enough to infinity, but let's just say you're going to do this forever cause I don't, I don't want to have to figure out the effect of that last day. What do you think is the probability of being? Remember being ruined means having your inventory fall to zero.

Speaker 1:          01:06:20       You start with a s dollars. That's capital s dollars. All right? Which is an integer. When s falls to zero, you are quote ruined. You don't have any money left here out of the game and, and you will be dismissed from the exchange. You can't trade anymore. You don't have anything. All right? So you have to start with something, otherwise you can't trade it all. And so acid, something like $100. If p is a point, does any of you know the answer? What's the probability that I will eventually be ruined? This isn't something that you got in your probability theory. Oh, you got it right. Yeah, I know who said that. That's right. It's 100%, uh, you will with certainty, uh, be ruined. Uh, and in fact, the probability of ruin is, uh, is one minus p divided by P two. The s power, if he is great with them, 0.5 or greater than equal to 0.5.

Speaker 1:          01:07:39       Uh, that's because, uh, if you, if you substitute in 0.5, this is one. So the probability of ruin is one, but, uh, if it's, if the probability is greater than 0.5, then the probability of ruin will be something less than one. Uh, this is actually easy to derive because think of it this way, uh, we call this the probability of ruin if you have s dollars. And the reason it has this is because, um, if I start with s dollars, uh, there, there are two possibilities, either gain one or lose one. So, uh, this probability of ASCE has to equal to p times the probability of s plus one plus one minus p times the probability of s minus one. Right? Uh, that is the probability. This is the probability of ruin. If you have s plus $1, and this is the probability of ruin if you have s minus $1.

Speaker 1:          01:08:55       So the function determining probability I've asked has to satisfy this equation. And also we have the restraint. Probability of ruin if you have $0 million is one. And so, uh, this is a difference equation. If you solve it, you get this. Um, so, uh, what it means is that you had better have a probability of winning substantially above one or else have an awful lot of of dollars to start with. Uh, uh, unfortunately it's hard to get the probability of winning in any one trade much up above a half because you're living in a competitive marketplace. Uh, and so, uh, if uh, if p is close to a half, it's just a little bit above a half, then you will be standing for your whole life always with a probability that the rest of my life is going to end up in ruin. Uh, so you may have been very successful and you now have a a thousand s as equal to a thousand by the probability keeps going down, but it never hits zero. Yeah, art.

Speaker 3:          01:10:05       Okay,

Speaker 1:          01:10:07       well that's what you have. That's what people do.

Speaker 1:          01:10:15       Well, they are taking money off or maybe, yeah, because they are doing that, uh, uh, you, you, you live your life and you, you take money off. Uh, yeah, you're right. I don't have to play it out to the bitter end like this. Um, but I wanted to show, this is actually this mathematical model is something that you will find in the page, one of chapter one of a micro market micro structure textbook because you're right, there's strategies that can prevent ruin like that. Uh, but this is the basic, this is just, I'm presenting this as a very simple model, um, uh, of what underlies the restriction on a, on a broker. A broker has to, has to um, uh, main to create a strategy such that this p is sufficiently probable that this ruin problem doesn't become a catastrophic. And the way they do that, they set the, the bid ask spread that a dealer has a, with a consideration of this ruin problem, which has to be the focal point of their attention.

Speaker 1:          01:11:27       Uh, and they have to set the bid ask spread wide enough so that they feel comfortable enough with this probability of ruin. Uh, and, uh, if you don't, of course it's a competitive market and so you can't get this probability up too high. Um, and so if you don't like this, don't become a dealer. That's the way it is. So the people who are in this business are people who can tolerate this prospect of ruin. Uh, um, but yeah, in other hand, ruin isn't death. And that's nothing you were saying, I can make a living doing this for awhile and, uh, I am taking money out and that's part of the strategy. Uh, so maybe I'm just being too much of an academic here. Uh, I live in great comfort in academia and these beautiful surroundings. This university has been around for 300 years, you know, I have no worries. Uh, and so you might want to consider an academic career instead of you career and finance. All right. Uh, so I hope to see you again then on Friday. I think we'll have a good time with Schwartzman.
