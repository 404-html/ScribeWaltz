Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So I wanted to talk today about insurance, uh, which is another risk management device that's traditionally separate from a securities which we talked about last time, but the underlying principles are the same. Um, before I begin, I wanted to just give some more thoughts about, uh, the, uh, the diversification through securities and that will lead us into, uh, insurance. Uh, so let me just review a preceding lecture briefly, but that purpose, what we did, the core theoretical framework that we had was the mean variance, uh, theory, the, which led us to the capital asset pricing model. But the basic thing was that we had to, in order to use the framework, we had to start by producing estimates of the expected returns on each asset we call those are and the standard deviation of the return on each asset and the covariance between the returns of each pair of assets.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       And then once we did that, we could plug that into the formula that I gave you last time and get the standard deviation of the portfolio and the expected return on the portfolio. And from then on, if you accept the analysis and the assumptions that, uh, are the estimates that underlie it, we pretty much know how to construct portfolios. Uh, but the underlying estimates, uh, may not accord with your belief or your intuitive sense of common sense. And so the other thing that I mentioned last time was that there seems to be a really big difference between the expected return on the stock market and the expected return on a short term debt. Uh, we found an equity premium, or actually Jeremy Siegel's book gave an equity premium of 4% a year. Uh, and some people find that hard to believe. How can it be that one asset does 4% a year better than another?

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       Some people say, well, if that's the case, I want to invest in nothing more than that one asset. Why should I take something that, uh, is under performing? Jeremy Siegel goes on further to say that, uh, since the mid 19th century, we've never had a 30 year period when stocks underperformed bonds. So as docs are, uh, really, uh, if anyone who has a investment horizon of 30 years, you'd think, why should I ever hold bonds? Uh, so the numbers that Jeremy Siegel produces seem implausibly high for, uh, for the stock market. So, ah, what we call this is the, uh, want to emphasize that I wrote this again, I like this again, the equity premium puzzle, that term was actually coined by economists, Prescott and Mayra, but it's now in general use that it just seems that stocks so much outperform other other investments. So for Jeremy Siegel and the latest edition of his book, the equity premium is 4% a year, uh, since 1802.

Speaker 1:          00:03:34       That's almost, no, that's more than as 106 years. Uh, so, uh, why would that be? And how can you believe that? So one question that comes up is that maybe this is for the u s data. And so some people say, well, maybe, you know, why are we looking at the u s because the u s is an arguably very successful country. Uh, and so, uh, we have potentially a, a bias in our, uh, scholar selection bias. If you heck as the country you study one of the most successful countries in the world, uh, that doesn't inform you. Can you see now, uh, that doesn't inform you very well about what it is for a random country. And, or for the u s going forward. Uh, there's something wrong. Uh, the U S has been successful in financial markets and it's being imitated by lots of countries. Uh, financial markets similar to ours are being set up in many places.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       But you wonder, you know, maybe they're over imitating. Maybe, you know, maybe we were just lucky or maybe it was because the u s was, was the, uh, the, uh, the first, uh, in some ways to develop some of these financial institutions are one of the first. And so, but now when the more and more countries start doing it, maybe it won't work so well. The one way of investigating this is to, uh, to, uh, get around the selection bias is to try to look at all countries. Let's not just look at the United States. Let's look at every country of the world and let's see if they have, uh, if they have a equity premium. Okay. So, uh, but there's a problem with that. And the problem is that countries that are less successful don't keep data, that's a problem. Or are they, were they, they sometimes they just shut down their stock markets at some point. Uh, this is, uh, this is since 1802.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       How many countries do you think have uninterrupted stock market data? Since 18. Oh, two. What do you think you name another country that probably has it. What's that Angela? Then you got UK, you, uh, uh, I said, uh, if you go onto the continent though, they tended to be interrupted by World War One and World War II. Uh, what about Japan? Do they have, do you think they have uninterrupted, they have a little bit of a problem around World War Two and a, or you can try to bridge the gap, but, uh, but, uh, anyway, uh, there are people who've tried to sort this out. Uh, and, um, there's one, it's a book by Dimson Marsh, uh, and Stanton that, uh, called triumph of the optimists that Jeremy Siegel quotes. He has a table in, in, in the new fourth edition of his book and Dimension Dimson Marsh, uh, and, uh, Stanton look at, uh, the following countries.

Speaker 1:          00:06:58       Belgium, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Japan, Switzerland, Ireland, Denmark, Netherlands, UK, Canada, U, s, South Africa, Australia, and Sweden. Every one of them has a positive equity premium, although the u s is on the high side of them, or it's not the, not the, not the best, the country that has the highest equity premium. And that's for the whole 20th century. They couldn't go back to the 1802, uh, the most successful country, you, Sweden, uh, and after that Australia. So us is not the most successful stock market, uh, though it's high and the high on the list. So, uh, um, Jeremy Siegel concludes that there is a, that the equity, he said, uh, that these, that this book right Dimson Marsh Stanton, uh, late puts to bed, any concerns about selection bias. Uh, and he claims that so many countries have shown an equity premium that we can be confident. He, this book is really very strong.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       And the conclusions, the title of the book stocks for the long run, it's docs always outperform other investments for the long run. And he said it's not due to selection bias, but you know, I kind of wonder the list of countries that I just read to you that let them send marsh and Staunton's studied, exclude some important countries, doesn't it? What does it exclude? Well, it doesn't have India, Russia and China in it. For example, uh, and I know at least, uh, Russia and China, do you know anything about their history? Do they ever need to stock market disruptions in the last hundred years? I think it's kind of obvious. Uh, they had a communist revolution in both places. Right. And so, uh, Russia and China are not mentioned a buy or not studied by Demson. Washington's not. And why not? Well, they can't get data. There wasn't this stock work. Well, there actually was the stock market in Russia before 1918 and in China before 1949. So what, what happened to investors? If you were a Chinese investor in Chinese stocks in 1949, what happened? We know what happened. It went, that's that famous minus 100% return, right? Which dominates everything. And so, uh, uh, so I think what would Siegel say? You know, he's really saying that this equity premium is enduring and we should believe it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       Uh, but, uh, I dunno, I think

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       good. I think what Jeremy would say is, well, you're looking, if you look at Russia and China, you're looking at political factors and I'm only looking at politically stable countries. And so this whole thing is irrelevant really. We're not going to have a communist revolution in any of these advanced countries now. And so Jeremy would say, forget that. It looks pretty sound that we have an equity premium until we can trust that, uh, well he's a good friend of mine, but I think he may be overstating a little bit. We have, we'd have some disagreements. Um, the thing that comes to my mind is that I wanted to say before concluding this review of the last lecture, uh, that is that the stock market is inherently political in any country. That politics have tremendous, a tremendous effect on the values in the stock market. Uh, and that's because of even if the government doesn't nationalize the stock market or confiscate assets, they tax them. Right. And do you know, we have in the U s we have a corporate profits

Speaker 2:          00:10:54       text?

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       Well, it's not just in the u s uh, essentially every, I don't if there's any exception, there may not be an exception, but essentially every country has a corporate profits tax. And then we also have

Speaker 2:          00:11:15       personal income tax. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:24       So the corporate profits tax goes after the profits that corporations make the personal, it's taken from corporations before they pay out their dividends. The personal income tax is levied on individuals and, uh, these individuals have to pay it. But that the personal income tax is not simple. It's not just a flat rate on your income. It depends on the type of income. So dividend income or capital income. And the stock market is taxed differently. The interesting thing is, is that through time, as political winds change, these taxes have changed. Uh, and they've gone up through some very high levels in the past in the United States and other countries. I'm going to give some, uh, US tax rate. Um, the personal tax on dividends, of course, it depends also on your tax bracket and your income. I'm going to talk about the highest tax bracket in the u s it went over 90% in World War II and, and the succeeding years. So the government was taking 90% of your dividend income, right? What does it today, do you know what anyone know? What's the tax rate on dividends today?

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       Uh, it might be zero for, yeah, for some people, but it's actually, it is a, the standard rate for people who have not negligent, not negligible income is 15%. So it's gone down from over 90% to 15%. Why did it do that? Well, it's some kind of political change and uh, the, uh, corporate, uh, okay. And incidentally at the beginning of the 20th century, you were right who said zero. We didn't, uh, we didn't even have a income tax until 1913 when the Supreme Court, uh, allowed it. So it was zero. Then it went up to 90% are actually is 94% of the peak. It came down to 15%. Okay. That's a pretty big hit on the stock market. So, you know, it wasn't just China that took the stock market when we were taking 90% of dividends, that was 90% of the stock market was being taken by the government.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       But that's not all because we were also taxing the corporations. Uh, and in the early postwar period, the corporate, now I'm going to talk, there is a distinction between the rate that they charge and the actual amount that they take. Uh, uh, most advanced countries of the world today have a corporate profits tax rate for large corporations have about a third. So they typically, a typical advanced country takes a third of the profits. The government takes a third of the profits, but that's not the actual amount that they pay. Because it tax law is so complicated and there's so many loopholes. So what I looked at, and I have this on the website, I have a chart showing corporate profits taxes paid as a fraction of corporate profits for the United States since 1929. Uh, and that had moved around a lot, but it got almost up to 60% in the, in the post World War II period.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       And now it's down to less than a third. Uh, why is it that is because they're changing enforcement of the taxes and the changing of marks of loopholes. So, uh, most countries, uh, they have a tax rate of about a third, but corporations are paying less than a third of their profits detective. So if we want to look going forward at the equity premium, we have to know how much, uh, what, what's the politics and what's the government going to do in the future? And they've moved these tax rates around a lot. So I think that it's very hard to be sure that we know going forward what are sigma and, uh, the, the expected return, the standard deviation of returns. And the covariance of returns are really, so we have a nice theoretical framework, but the application of the framework to the real data is hard and it ends up politics underneath it all.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       And that's, uh, that's just the real world. I want to say one more thing about, uh, about the, uh, uh, diversification in a mutual fund. Uh, ideally mutual funds are calculating our and sigma and sigma one two, and plugging in and finding what the optimal portfolio that you should hold is, and then offering that to you in their mutual fund. That, uh, in, in Prac, it's firms that do that are in practice. However, the minority and most mutual funds have some gimmick or some special, uh, they claimed to be beating the market, not forming the optimal portfolio. And I also have up on the website, uh, some questions that I asked investors about, uh, about, uh, what they think about picking stock. Picking stocks means trying to find a stock that's going to do really well. Uh, and so, uh, what I found, the question I asked is, um, do you agree or say which of the following is a correct answer to this statement?

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       Trying to time the market to get out before it goes down and in before it goes up. Is a smart thing to do, or B, not a smart thing to do. Most people think that it's not a smart thing to do to try to time the market. Only 11% said yes to that. But then I ask another question. Do you think, uh, trying to pick mutual funds, uh, trying to, to find a mutual fund that will beat the market, uh, is a smart thing to do or not a smart thing to do the most people think it's a smart thing to do. So what I think the mutual fund industry has turned into largely is a stock picking industry, not a portfolio diversification industry. Uh, and so what most people are doing when they go into a mutual fund is they're trying to find smart people who will beat market, will pick those stocks that will do well.

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       Uh, but the Mutual Fund theory that we gave last time said, no, the mutual fund is just supposed to be diversifying for you. In fact, the truth is somewhere in between. Most mutual funds are providing some diversification service and they're also trying to, uh, they're also trying to beat the market. Finally, I just wanted to say that I, I've been talking mainly about the, uh, about the u s but, uh, mutual funds have been growing in importance around the world. Uh, and, uh, there was a recent paper by, um, uh, Havana surveys, I'm sorry, Urana surveys and too far now that looked at when it is that explains, uh, which, uh, countries have had rapidly growing mutual fund industries. And they found, not surprisingly, that it tends to, mutual funds have been growing more rapidly in countries that have stronger securities laws and institutions, especially laws that protect individual shareholders rights.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       Also, a mutual funds had been growing more in countries that have higher level of education and higher level of wealth. Uh, and they also grow more in countries that have institutional structures that encourage, uh, that encourage, uh, investing in mutual funds such as pension plans. Uh, but I think it's a trend around the world that we're going to see more and more mutual funds. Uh, and I think it's a good thing. I think they will help us to diversify our risks. Uh, so anywhere I wanted them to move on to the topic of today's lecture, which is, uh, insurance and, uh, the insurance is the other side of the risk management, uh, that, uh, institutions that we have insurance evolved separately from securities. It's long been a different industry, but the principles are the same. And the principles of Insurance, the fund, the fundamental powerhouse is the principle of risk pooling and, uh, insurance, just like mutual funds or providing risk pooling for you.

Speaker 1:          00:20:22       Okay. So risk pooling means they put a lot of people in independent or low correlated risk into a pore and reduce the risk for the whole pool. Uh, they have to contend with something called moral hazard, which is the risk that people will be affected by the fact that they're insured and then do something bad. The classic moral hazard problem is the problem that, uh, you would give fire insurance on her house and so someone burns down the house in order to collect the insurance. Um, and they also have to deal with selection bias. Uh, what this means it in the insurance context is that if you offer insurance policies, you will tend to attract people who are higher risk. All right? So if you offer life insurance, you have life tables which give you probabilities of dying at various ages, but that's for the general population. All the sick people will come to you to buy life insurance and they will, uh, turn out to have a higher death rate than the population at large. So these are the problems of insurance that we have to deal with. Um, I just wanted to review the mathematics of this. This is actually just in part I just to review of what we talked about in the second lecture. But, uh, in the ideal world, if you have independent risks,

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       uh, under the independence assumption, the probability distribution for the number of, uh, contract, uh, insurance contracts that you will have to pay on follows the binomial distribution. So x is the number of accidents that say this is some accident insurance.

Speaker 2:          00:22:28       Okay. Oops.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       Uh, the, the, uh, the probability of having an n is the number of policies that you're writing and if you're going to have p is the probability of an accident.

Speaker 2:          00:22:54       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:22:56       Then the binomial distribution, uh, gives you the probability of having x accidents out of your end policies. And, uh, we had that before. That is, uh, it is, um, p two, the x one minus one minus x

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       power, uh, times and all over x factorial times and x factorial.

Speaker 1:          00:23:39       And so that is the binomial distribution and it allows you to calculate the, the probability of any number of accidents. Uh, the, the mean, uh, proportion as the mean of x over n, which is a, is equal to p. So, uh, am I writing big enough? I can see the, uh, uh, if x is the number of accidents, the mean number of accidents divided by your number of policies is given just by the probability, but the standard deviation of x over n is equal to the square root of p times one minus p all over again. And so that is the should get these, uh, so that is the, that gives us a mean and standard deviation of the proportion. So to actually apply this, it helps to go to something called the normal approximation cause the binomial. Uh, so, uh, because it's kind of difficult to compute, this formula is an easier formula and you assume that, uh, the binomial distribution is really a normal distribution with a mean of, let's say the proportion of accidents x over, around and follows a normal distribution with mean p and standard deviation given by this. Uh, and that's all, that's the, uh, the whole theory that I have here. It's simple. Um, so maybe I should make a bigger,

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       well, let me do it here. I can fit it in here. I think I'm going to draw an example. I've got a plot it out and it's on the website, but it's a very simple example where I have the case where p equals 0.2. Okay, so the probability of an accident is 20%. This is a significantly high probability of accident. Can you see down, you can see all of this right from zero. Let's do this from zero to 0.4. Uh, if, uh, if you wrote only one policy, what's the probability distribution of x over n? Well, it has two possible values. It could be the one person doesn't have the accident or does have the accident. So if any equals one, uh, we have, uh, an 80% chance this would be 80% of, of, uh, of no accident. Uh, and uh, actually this makes this one not 0.4 then a 20% chance of one of x over n equals one.

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       Okay? So I'm plodding, uh, this is the probability of various values of x, ovarian, if any equals one x over and can take on only two values, zero or one. And it takes on the value one with a probability of 20%. And the value of zero with a probability of 80% I didn't use the normal approximation there. I just, that's obvious, right? I use the binomial itself, but let's go to the case ware and as a hundred then, uh, see how should I, maybe I'll leave that up. You can see this, okay, these diagrams on growing, if Annie was a hundred, now I'm going to label this access differently and now I'm going to show the normal bell shaped curve. And I'm going to do this from zero to 0.4. Maybe I do have to make this be, can you see this all right back there? Okay, so zero to 0.4. Uh, and so 0.2 is here in the middle. That's 0.2, uh, for any equals. Now I'm going to do any equals a hundred. Okay. Uh, what is the mean? But the mean is always point to no matter how many policies you write. So it's going to be, we're going to have a normal distribution centered on point to this point to is not very readable here. Um, I have to crunch down and to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       Okay. So, uh, and what does the standard deviation is the square root of 0.2 times 0.8 over a hundred. So that's a 0.16, uh, uh, over a hundred. So the standard deviation is 0.04. Uh, so what does the curve look like? Uh, it's a bell shaped curve that looks about like that. I didn't draw that very well. We try it again. I should do, I'll do a nice bell shaped curves, but uh, it's harder than it looks standing up here. Okay. So that's your bell shape curve. So with a hundred policies, uh, they can't really count that accurately on having 20% of the policies pay. There's still substantial insurance risk because the, it could easily be only 15% or it could be 25% of the policies, uh, that ended up paying. So the insurance company with a hundred policies would have still substantial risk. It's much better.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       The, the, the uncertainty about x over n is much lower for the case n equals a hundred than it was for the case. N Equals one. But it's still there. Now I want to draw, what if we write 10,000 policies? Okay? Uh, and so what is the probability distribution for x over N in that case? But you can see you're going to be dividing that by 100 here, but by a hundred times a hundred. So it's going to reduce this from 0.04 2.04. Okay. And so the normal, the bell shaped curve in that case for the x over n is going to look something like this. Well, I've got a plotted here. It's even more steeply than that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:04       That's a bell shape curve, but it's Senate exactly on point to exactly a number of policies. It doesn't affect the mean, but it affects this Dan deviation. So it becomes very collapsed. And this is the basic core idea of insurance. You have to be a big company to do it. And if you have a big company, you've exhausted the, uh, the risk of a almost never goes away completely. Uh, and so if we did a, uh, we could go another, another two decimal. If we did a million Chi now, uh, yeah, a million, uh, policies, then we would, this would almost be just, uh, a spike here at, uh, at that point. But that's the concept of insurance. Um, but, uh, the idea, uh, uh, really took root, the idea, the intuitive idea that as you write a large number of policies, the fraction that are, that will result in accidents becomes closer and closer to the probability of one accident.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       That's an idea that it struck, struck people intuitively at various times in history, but they didn't know how to, um, how to do these calculations. So, uh, historians of probability have noted that this basic idea is actually in Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher or scientist, and I'm going to quote Aristotle from his book, Decarlo, uh, it, and he says to, uh, he's talking very generally here, but I think it's this, he's really talking about this. He says, to succeed in many things or many times is quote difficult. For instance, to repeat the same throw of dice a 10,000 times would be impossible. Whereas to make it once or twice, it's comparatively easy. That's Aristotle talking. It's exactly this theory, but he doesn't have the word probability, which hadn't been invented yet. So he's using intuitive, he says, difficult or easy. So he says it's difficult, meaning the probability is very low or easy.

Speaker 1:          00:33:16       It probability is high. He had the idea, but he didn't have the math. Uh, so that, I think that may be the first a known statement of the binomial distribution. Well, it doesn't get very precise, but it has the intuitive concept. The idea of using this theory for insurance. Uh, it's, uh, the earliest known statement of it is a, uh, it was in an anonymous letter written in 1609 to account Oldenburg. But that's not the person who said it. That was the person who received the letter. Uh, anyway, uh, the person wrote, he was talking about fires and it was proposing that people should pay 1% of the value of the home every year into a fund and then the fund would be used to replace the home if it burned down and coating this anonymous person writing in 1609. Uh, there is no doubt that it would be fully proved if a calculation we're made of the number of houses consumed by fire within a certain space in the course of 30 years, that the loss would not amount by a good deal to the some that would be collected in that time.

Speaker 1:          00:34:30       So it's interesting that this person uses the word calculation. This person has the idea, this is the 1600 was the year when probability theory was invented. So someone had the idea of going beyond the intuitive notion that, uh, Aristotle have mentioned and moving to something that is calculable. And that's when the insurance industry, it was really born. So, uh, it's, so insurance relies on this theory of risk pooling, but it has to make it work. Uh, and I, I stressed in the third lecture that, uh, like any insurance, like any other risk management device is an invention. And that, uh, uh, every risk management device relies on a design and the design is, uh, is usually complex and has it all has to work together. In order for a design to work well, we have to have every component there. If one component is missing, we may have a failure. All of these components have to be compatible with each other and it has to work. Uh, in a, um, I work according to a plan which ultimately is informed by this theory. So insurance as an invention has to have what, what, uh, things, uh, it has to have a contract design.

Speaker 1:          00:36:13       It, that would be a, uh, document, uh, which is a contract between the insured and the insurance company. It specifies what does it specify? It specifies what risks are covered, uh, and uh, exclusions. Some risks are not covered. Uh, and those exclusions are carefully designed in regard of moral hazard and selection bias. Um, there, there has to be the mathematical model, which I just presented, but it may be more complicated. Um, there has to be a form for the company. Uh, there could be a corporate form that there's the, the insurance company could be a corporation and, uh, or it could be either a nonprofit corporation or a for profit corporation owned by shareholders or the insurance company could be a mutual insurance company, in which case the insurance company is owned by the insured. Um, and then you need as well, you need a government regulation because, uh, the insurance companies don't seem to exist without it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       There has to be regulators that are at least verifying that the insurance company is doing what it it, it says it's going to do. And so, uh, one thing that the government has to do is assure that, uh, reserves requirements are met. The company has to have enough money on hand to pay out, uh, in the, in the case of default. So, uh, okay. One way of classifying, uh, insurance companies is that they, um, can exist as either a multiline insurance companies or mono line insurance companies. A multiline insurance company insures many different kinds of things, uh, and, uh, doesn't confine itself to one thing. So if a company were just a, a fire insurance company, it would be a mono line insurance company. Uh, but, but then they're essentially more risky and more regulators have to watch them more because they're, they're standing a higher probability amount of line of some major disaster.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       Uh, and, uh, in contrast to a multiline kind of ensures, uh, it, uh, itself. Uh, so we hear a lot about mono-line insurance companies in the newspapers today. I don't know if you're reading about the subprime crisis, but, uh, we are living in a time at this moment of a financial crisis, uh, called the subprime crisis. And, uh, that naturally hits mono-line insurance companies more than multiline insurance companies because they are more specialized and more vulnerable. Uh, I'll come back to this distinction in a minute, but I wanted to talk about a certain kinds of, uh, of, uh, uh, uh, mono line insurance companies that, uh, uh, the biggest, uh, well, one category is property and casualty insurance company or PNC. He's aren't insurance companies that insure the value of a home or a business or an automobile. Uh, and another kind of monolines insurances, health insurance company that merely ensures people against health costs. And another important category is life insurance.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       Uh, so, uh, life insurance is, uh, w what it ensures is, uh, a beneficiary against the death of an insured. Uh, and the classic example of the most important example is families. Uh, the, you would buy life insurance on both the husband and the wife. Okay. You might have, might do different amount and it's done right. Families with young children to protect them against the economic cost of the death of one of their parents. Uh, and you need insurance on both parents because both parents are contributing, uh, to the, uh, success of the children. So, um, these are big industries. Uh, the, uh, total assets of a property and casualty in 2007 and the United States,

Speaker 2:          00:41:36       uh, and these are assets,

Speaker 1:          00:41:43       property and casualty, uh, was one point $4 trillion. Uh, and life insurance was four point $9 trillion. So, uh, I don't actually did, I don't have to, somehow I missed getting the health, but that would be another big, uh, insurance. So this is a, these are huge, hugely important institutions, uh, in our, uh, in our, um, in our society. So, uh, what are, what does proper, let me go to property and casualty. Um, what do they insure?

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       actually the most important that thing that they insure is automobiles.

Speaker 2:          00:42:36       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       the total premiums collected on automobiles is about, is much bigger. I like five times bigger than the premiums they collect on homeowners.

Speaker 1:          00:42:51       Automobile Insurance is collision insurance. Okay. Homeowner's insurance is used to be called fire insurance, but now they've, they've extended it to include so many other risks. Uh, it depends on the particular policy, what it includes. It might include risks as well of personal liability if someone injures themselves on your property or risks of storms of hurricanes, earthquakes, everything else. So we call it homeowners insurance, but actually the automobile insurance is more important. And then the homeowners insurance, even the homes are so much more valuable. Uh, because I think that's because cars move and they drive around and they bumped into each other, cut homes, just stay where they are. And so we have far fewer accidents so they don't have to charge is high premium, uh, for, uh, for, uh, for the, uh, insurance. So, uh, these insurance contracts have come across gradually through time. Uh, as we developed the theory, uh, and I talk about the growth of insurance and about some of the components of it.

Speaker 2:          00:44:07       Uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       real insurance industry, as I mentioned before, began in the 16 hundreds, uh, with the invention of theory and with the invention of a life tables for an invention of actuarial science. But it grew slowly. And I think the reason that it grew slowly was that insurance is a very sophisticated concept. Uh, in order to explain it, I had to write down in the binomial distribution and, uh, I have to explain it properly. For most people, that's a difficult concept. Uh, and so, uh, I think I may have mentioned some of this before, but let me give this history, uh, in, uh, insurance, it was invented in the 16 hundreds, but it did not for the, for eight fast. They proliferate, proliferated only very slowly. And some of the, uh, important figures is there had to be certain inventions, uh, to make it work. Uh, again, I'm repeating a theme that isn't my book, New Financial Order, that financial innovation and insurance innovation is a succession of inventions.

Speaker 1:          00:45:33       And each invention propels the idea more forward. So it's like, uh, we have laws of thermodynamics that underlie the use of engines. Uh, and, but you know, you can't just go from the laws of thermodynamics to an automobile. There's a million steps along the way. And if you look at the history of engines, there are discreet advances. And when people were able to apply the theory more and more, well, in insurance, there's a similar list of inventions. So, uh, Morris, Robert Robinson, uh, was head of mutual life, um, of New York and the 1840s. Uh, and he, uh, got the idea of highly paid life insurance salespeople. Uh, the idea was that, uh, it's difficult to sell people on insurance back in the 1840 [inaudible] life insurance was very important because the average expectancy of life was only something like 45 years. And so that meant parents were dying left and right.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       What would be the probability that a married couple would live both of them to the, uh, to the, uh, time when their children are grown? Uh, well it was fairly low, right? If the average age at death was something like 45, uh, you know, maybe a 50, 50 chance of, of high a risk, uh, of, of one of the parents dying. So you should think that people would really want life insurance, but they, uh, but they were not buying it. And why was it? Well, first of all, they were dying in such numbers. P was so high that it was expensive. They have to pay that premium has to cover the costs. And so it was tough to get someone to buy life insurance even though they really needed it. It was such a idea for them. Uh, but, uh, it's partly because there's a psychological resistance to it, you know, this is still very much alive today.

Speaker 1:          00:47:38       I was standing at the World Economic Forum at one of our lunch things and a young woman approached me from Swiss re, uh, which is a Swiss reinsurance company. And she said she wanted my ideas on how to sell crop insurance and Africa. She said, we have it now at Swiss re. Uh, and of course the World Bank sponsors a crop insurance for farmers. So, and there are some very poor areas in Africa where farmers really run the risk if their crop fails, uh, it could be really bad. Uh, you know, they would be approaching starvation. So wouldn't you think that farmers would want to buy crop insurance from this Swiss company? It looks like a good idea to me, but she says we're having a lot of trouble selling it. Uh, and uh, he said, if you talk to the farmers in these rural areas, what do you think they say when you offer?

Speaker 1:          00:48:36       They say, I can't afford the insurance. Well, they're not thinking, right. You know, the whole idea of insurance is that you take from your good years and you move it into your bad year so that you make it through all your years. And so you're having a good year this year. Maybe it looks that way now and you think you can't afford it, but just think how bad it will be. If it's a bad year, then you really won't. You won't feel afford to stay alive. Uh, and so, uh, but she says they didn't, some of them respond, but a great majority of them don't. And I think it's because of a psychological aversion to people have to thinking about insurance. It's just unpleasant. And Life Insurance is actually an insurance against one of you dying. It's a very unpleasant topic. So if someone comes to your home and says, I'm, I would like to send a sell you life insurance.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       You know, you think, you know, some other day, I don't want to talk today about the probability of one of us dying. Uh, and so, uh, it was a tough sell. So Morris Robinson, however, realized that some people are very talented salespeople and they're probably talented at other things as well. So it may sound like a small, uh, a small improvement, but he just had very highly paid insurance sales, uh, and they were paid as long as people kept their policy. And so that motivated insurance salesman to form long term relationships with the families and he was insuring and to keep them from canceling their policies. So he got talented, respected members of the community who people admired to become life insurance salesman and he had to pay them enough so that they would stick with the job. And then it finally worked. It may seem crazy, but it may seem like a modest innovation, but it actually, uh, was, uh, it was an important innovation. So I don't know how you think of life insurance salespeople, but they have been pillars of the community. There are people that you, the community trusts that people are willing to let into their home and discuss things like death. Uh, and that was an innovation that came in then. Then the other innovation was Henry.

Speaker 2:          00:50:53       Hi. Uh, and he was at, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:50:59       another insurance company, equitable life.

Speaker 2:          00:51:04       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       Uh, and that was in the late 18 hundreds.

Speaker 1:          00:51:17       Uh, and what he invented was a insurance policy that had a cash value. And that's another, uh, it's a cash value on the insurance policy. That is that the insurance policy doesn't just insure you against death. It also builds value over the years. Uh, and this invention was very important because it stopped people from canceling. The big problem with life insurance had his people would buy it and they'd pay for several years. Uh, and then eventually they would think, well, we didn't die. We were losing all this money. Let's just cancel the insurance. And it especially happens the way life is and real families is, you know, you start getting accustomed to a certain style of life and you start spending more and more money and then it comes upon it. There comes a time when you have a little crunch and you know, you're a little short on money and so you're casting, you're out for some way to come up with some money. And so canceling your life insurance was a good idea. Uh, but, uh, uh, the turns out that if you make them forfeit their cash value on canceling, then they won't cancel. And so, um, that both of these were ideas, uh, that, uh, were copied all over the world. That's the way inventions are. Uh, and so a lot of insurance policies today have cash values. Uh, the third thing I was going to report,

Speaker 2:          00:52:43       uh, was a sociologist Viviana Zelizer, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       wrote a book about life insurance salesmen sales in the night in the 19th century. And she found that, uh, there was a lot of resistance to purchase of life insurance in the 19th century. Uh, and she tried to study it and try to figure out how it was that life insurance became more and more important over that century. Uh, and one of her conclusions without life insurance seem to be opposed quite a bit by women, uh, 19th century women.

Speaker 2:          00:53:22       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:53:30       and why didn't they like it? You would think that any rational, a woman in the 19th century would reflect on the fact that there's a significant probability that her husband will die of something while you still have children. And why wouldn't they want a, well, what she found is that life insurance salespeople, we're going to families and trying to sell them on life insurance by explaining the concept. And they would say something like, I did. Maybe they didn't write down the binomial distribution, but they explained the idea of insurance. Uh, and uh, it didn't sound right to the typical 19th century American woman or I suppose it wasn't just America. It was a worldwide problem. And the reaction that salespeople would get from women was, you know, this, this, you're giving me some probabilities or something. And you're asking me too. It sounds like you're asking me to play in some gambling thing where I win.

Speaker 1:          00:54:26       If my husband dies, it doesn't, it doesn't sound right to me. Uh, I think, uh, in fact a lot of women would say something. I put my faith in God, and I think I might bring down God's wrath if I did such a thing as to bet that my husband is going to die. Uh, and so she would, uh, refuse to take part in it. It doesn't sound right to her. I'll trust in prayer and other things. Uh, so it didn't work and you couldn't sell them on. So what Xcel is a reported is that some life insurance companies surmounted this problem by changing the pitch, by telling their salespeople, don't try to explain probability theory to these people, uh, but you have to do is come across differently. And so the, the thing that she said they started doing is to pretend that in a way that they were missionaries with a Gospel and the Gospel is insurance. Uh, and they would tell these women, uh, you know, if you buy life insurance on your husband, then should anything happen, your husband can love and protect you from beyond the grave. Uh, and uh, that sounds good. So, uh, it worked. And these little things you, you may, they may seem like little things, but they are technological advances. People in a profession over the years learn more and more how to, um, how to, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:55:59       how to manage the public's expectations and get them to actually purchase insurance. So, uh, I wanted to talk about government regulation of insurance because, uh, I said that was an important aspect of insurance. Uh, and what the regulators do. Many things, uh, but insurance regulators, uh, most of our, our concern with capital adequacy, so, uh, so insurance, now insurance is in the United States, is regulated not by the federal government but by insurance regulators in each of the 50 states. So it's very hard to summarize insurance regulation in the United States. Why is it regulated separately by the 50 states? Uh, that's because it started out that way when the federal government wasn't involved in those sorts of things. But somehow we never had the, uh, uh, in fact, it's talked about, we should maybe we'll see it in the next 10 or 20 years. Uh, there's talked about that there should be a federal government regulation of insurance, but it's actually state regulators and it makes it hard.

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       This is a handicap to the US insurance industry. Other countries have it centralized, but in the U S it's split up over 50 states, it was very hard to start an insurance company because you've got to meet the requirements of all 50 regulators. But the most important thing that these do is they specify what reserves insurance companies have to hold. Okay. And so, uh, they, in other words, the insurance company doesn't trust the insurance companies to do the calculations like I just showed with the binomial theorem. They want to make sure that there's a significantly high probability it since sufficiently high probability that even if they get a bad draw, and there's a lot of policies that require paying out, that these reserves will satisfy. Uh, so an insurance company must hold the reserves, it can hold more. Uh, and that's called a statutory surplus. So, uh, the reserves are an accounting entry.

Speaker 1:          00:58:11       It's how much they are required to hold. Uh, but the companies will hold more than that. Uh, if, uh, typically in order to protect themselves more than is required and their policy holders more than is required by the regulators. So, uh, occasionally you get into problems, uh, with uh, with the reserves. And, um, uh, before I get to that, let me just say, uh, uh, I want to just mention, mentioned a few types of insurance that are important. So, uh, let's talk about life insurance and we're talking about kinds of policies that are around today. The simplest form of life insurance. It's called term insurance. Okay. And this is insurance that you pay each year for insurance in that year and it does not build a cash value. So this is the symbol of me. I can buy insurance for myself this year, uh, and I can stop and if I, uh, there's no nothing her, uh, next year I would just have to pay it again.

Speaker 1:          00:59:25       Um, whole life is more complicated because it builds a, a cash value according to a schedule. Uh, and uh, there is both a non participating and participating with non participating what was participating. You in a, you are participating in the portfolio outcome that the insurance company is experiencing and so you have some uncertainty about your cash value. Um, there's something called variable life, uh, which refers to a life insurance policy where the policy holder can shift. You can make decisions about the investment of the money in the whole life policy. And so it's not just taking what's given by the insurance company. There's something called universal life. These are all explained in full Bozi at uh, uh, that's a, it's a whole life policy that gives the policyholder flexibility over the insurance premiums. You can pay more into the cash value in one year and less than another year as long as you keep paying a a, a minimum amount. Um, and uh, it was also survivorship policies, uh, that will pay, uh, uh, for example, uh, the second to die. There'll be a policy if a husband and wife get it and uh, it pays out when the second of them dies.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       Or also about regulation. I want to dimension n a I see very important institution that stands for National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Uh, and this is something that's very important in the United States because as I mentioned, uh, insurance regulation is divided up over the 50 states. And the problem that that creates is a, that it's a nightmare for insurance companies because every different state has different laws. Uh, recognizing this problem, the insurance commissioners in the various dates have decided to form an organization that's the NAI seat and they hold regular conferences. Uh, and at these conferences they, uh, decide on a recommended or uniform like insurance regulation policy, uh, and it acts a little bit like a congress and they make laws, but the laws are not binding on anyone. They just suggested laws or regulations. Uh, and so it's an effort to try to get the complex, uh, uh, complexity of different regulators uniform.

Speaker 1:          01:02:21       So as I say, when they nai see decides on some regulation, it's only a recommendation to the separate state regulatory commissions. Uh, but of course it has a lot of force because all 50 states have met. The commissioner has a 50 states I've met and hashed it out. Uh, so most states would essentially adopt with the NAI c says, uh, otherwise, you know, they're not going to figure it all out. They can't claim the beat. It would be rational to do that. Right? You wouldn't think that we would rethink all of these things ourselves and then have a different in our state. So the NAI C is kind of a quasi regulatory body or is it quasi government? It's not government, uh, because it has no authority and yet it acts almost like a parliament where these people get together and decide on things and they end up as a force of law. Uh, so, uh, another important, uh, there's some milestones in insurance that, um, I wanted to mention. Um, and then I'm going to come back to finally concluding with problems that we see. Uh, and of course the problems are not damning. There are problems that reflect the progress yet needed to be made and insurance. But, um, I just wanted to mention the, uh, the um, uh, the itch lily, um, financial modernization act of 1999.

Speaker 1:          01:04:10       And what this did is it allowed banks to offer insurance or to, uh, ally and join in merge with insurance companies. Before that did I said before, insurance is really the same thing as security. So both based on risk management and pooling of risk diversification or pooling. I really the same thing, but we had a separate set of institute and people never thought of insurance as the same as a bank. Uh, but since this is relatively recently, that's only nine years ago, um, at this time. So it means then that we are now seeing a, uh, expansion of our banking system in the u s to become, uh, uh, insurance related. It's different in other countries. In Europe they've had a universal banking which allowed banks to offer insurance for a much longer time. But in the U S it's a kind of a recent, a recent innovation. So I wanted to conclude with problems, which may sound kind of, but, uh, this is, uh, I don't shrink from negative is it's not really negative isn't it? It's talking about what, what should be done. So I wanted to come back to, I told you that Marta line was in the news a lot lately.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       And so why don't we talking about when it, uh, I don't know how much you read about that.

Speaker 2:          01:05:45       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:46       Uh, right now we are going through a major financial crisis which started in the u s but has spread over the world and this is called the, uh, the subprime crisis.

Speaker 2:          01:05:59       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       Subprime refers to mortgages, which is not the subject of today's lecture, but a sub prime mortgage is a mortgage issued to a borrower who is not considered a crime. That's not a good risk. Borrowers that are thought by the various models to be likely to fail, to pay on their mortgage and to have to be foreclosed low, often low income. But also there are people with poor credit histories. So, uh, the crisis that we're in now, and this is very important you where you're living through it. Uh, and we'll see how it pans out. Uh, the subprime crisis is happening today because home prices are falling and with falling home prices more subprime borrowers are re are, are failing to pay their mortgage and default rates are shooting up and a valuation of securitized subprime mortgages have crashed. Uh, and it's throwing turmoil all over the [inaudible] all over the financial community. Uh, it's, we're, we're seeing what they call systemic effects.

Speaker 2:          01:07:17       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:07:19       that's a very general term that goes beyond insurance. By systemic effects, I mean something that affects the whole financial system. Uh, and when you do these calculations, which I just did for insurance, I was talking about insurance companies, assuming that risks are independent, everything's independent, we've got it all figured out. Uh, underlying at, there were other things besides just the calculation of their accident rates that I had a certain assumptions built in. Uh, and the failure of the assumptions in many different industries can create systemic effects. So what happened? I want to talk about a particular line of Mano Line insurers that you may never have even heard of because they don't deal with the general public. And these are municipal bonds

Speaker 2:          01:08:09       insurance.

Speaker 1:          01:08:11       Okay. These are private companies, insurance companies, their motto line, because they look only at a certain class of risk and not all risks that the insurer they deal with principally with state and local governments who are issuing bonds to raise money for their activities like new haven, for example. Uh, or any other, uh, any state or local government, we refer to the bonds that they issue as municipal bonds. Now, the problem is that if you invest in bonds from some state or local government, they might not pay you back. They can just go bankrupt. The cities going bankrupt and they just can't pay. Uh, and so you as a, as a buyer of these bonds, uh, feel reluctant to invest in them. Okay? So in order to make their guns salable to the general public city and state governments go, or any region, a local governments go to the municipal bond insurer companies, uh, and

Speaker 2:          01:09:18       they have names. Big Ones are Mbia Ambac,

Speaker 1:          01:09:25       uh, F G I see. That's not FDA. I see. It's not the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It's f GIC and there are others as well. Okay. And so what these do is they ensure the bond. They ensure the investor against the municipality failing to pay on the bond. All right? And so lots of investors won't buy a municipal bond unless it's insured. Uh, okay. So now I'm talking about systemic effects in the home. So these insurance companies have reserves on hand and they invest these reserves in something. So what are they invest in then? Well, one of the things they've been investing in a man, uh, is sub mortgages. You know, I can see what I'm talking about. Systemic effect. So, uh, the housing sector in the United States, you might say is completely different from municipal bond insurers. But when the housing sector starts going down, people start defaulting on their mortgages. Uh, then the value of the subprime loans that the mortgage, municipal bond insurers own starts to go down. Okay. Now these guys have never failed to live up to their guarantees. They're doing just fine. But people are noticing that their portfolios are going down. And so their surplus, uh, statutory surplus is going down. And, uh, and so we're starting to worry about these companies. And so notably it was January 18,

Speaker 2:          01:10:58       a rating agency, Fitch lowered handbag from AAA rated to Aa

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       rated. Okay. That was a big news story or you might not have caught it right? But it was a big news story for the field work in municipal government. You Thought, oh, this is bad news. If this is the only, if only one rating agency does that. Okay. But, and it's only Ambac that's been down rated. But uh, yeah, you start wanting to, reporters start calling the other rating agencies standard and Poor's and Moody's and others and say, are you going to down rate these guys? And, and you read in the newspaper their interpretation of what is going to be said. And so far the other aid agencies, I haven't, you know, they're not saying anything, they're not, but now people are suspecting that these are all going to get down rated. Well if they're down rated then nobody trusts him anymore as insurance companies.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       Uh, and so that means that the municipal governments will have it, find it hard to issue bonds to continue their activities. So the municipal governments might have to shut down some activities like fixing the roads or bridges or whatever things, building schools, whatever the cities do with their municipal bond money they raised from the municipal bonds. So then what you can see how things are feeding through the system. It starts out in one thing, it goes to the insurance companies and then it goes to the municipal governments and all that kind of thing can, might, might put this economy into a recession if it's not just the municipal governments, but a lot of different of a lot of different aspects of our financial system are going to be touched by a crisis that spreading from one segment to another. Uh, so, uh, that's where this stands right now.

Speaker 1:          01:12:57       The latest thing. Well, now this is a crisis. Uh, I'm municipal bond crisis, which is unfolding. The New York state regulators have been trying to get companies to subscribe more capital to the line insurance companies to bolster their, uh, their capital so that they have more money to pay out and that will prevent any more Lorings of their ratings. And, uh, uh, so, uh, uh, the other thing has happened now is that Warren Buffet said he wants to get into the, um, uh, municipal bond ensuring business. And so, well, he's just a business person coming in. Uh, and so there will be new municipal bond insurers appearing that will take up the slack. And so we'll be all right. But the problem is that we may have a crisis for a while. The other thing that I wanted to talk about, I guess I'm running out of time, was about, uh, uh, management of disaster risk.

Speaker 1:          01:13:55       Uh, and, uh, we, we have another insurance crisis developing now, uh, because of, uh, well a very important source of insurance risk that's developing. It has to do with the rising rate of hurricane damage that we're observing in the east coast of the United States. And notably, we saw Hurricane Katrina, uh, that caused a huge property damage, uh, in, uh, uh, uh, a couple of years ago that, uh, I kind of tested insurance companies again. And the risk is that global warming will, uh, will, uh, make hurricanes more common. And, uh, I guess I, I'll have to, I'll just conclude that, uh, uh, I'll talk a little bit about that. I've gotten through almost all of us, uh, next time. The only other thing, uh, then next year we're going to talk, on Friday we're meeting again and we're meeting again about, um, this time, it, it's about efficient markets. Uh, and, uh, I want to talk about the evidence for efficient markets and against it. And that will lead you into your third problem set, uh, about efficient markets. But that's not coming for a little while.
