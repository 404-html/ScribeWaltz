Speaker 1:          00:00:02       So today I want him to then, uh, the today, the title of today's lecture is, um, uh, uh, what is it, uh, the universal principle of risk management, a pooling and the hedging of risk. Uh, and what I'm really referring to is I think the, the, the very original, the deep concept that underlies theoretical finance. I wanted to get that first. Uh, and it really is probability theory, uh, and the idea of spreading risk through risk pooling. So this idea, uh, is, um, it's an intellectual construct that, uh, appeared at a certain point in history, uh, and it has had amazing, uh, number of, uh, applications and finance is one of these. Uh, so I, I want some of you, uh, this incident, they will be a more technical of my lectures. And so it's a little bit unfortunate that it comes early in the semester.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       For those of you who've had a course in probability and statistics, there will be nothing new here. Uh, well, nothing in terms of the mat of the probability theory, new, uh, others. Though I want to tell you that, uh, uh, it doesn't, uh, if you're shopping, if I had a student come by yesterday and ask that, uh, he's a little rusty and his math skills and should he take this course? And I said, well, if you, if you can understand, uh, two miles elected as today's lecture, uh, then you should have no problem. Uh, but, uh, so I wanted to start with the, uh, the, uh, concept of, of probability. And, uh, you know what a probability is. Uh, it's a no, we attach a probability to an event. Okay. So what is the probability that the stock market will go up this year? Okay. Uh, I would say point my personal probability 0.45.

Speaker 1:          00:02:09       And so that's what I'm a bear. But, uh, that's, you know what that means that 45 times out of a hundred of stock market will go up and the other 55 times out of 100, it will stay the same or go down. Uh, that's a probability. Uh, and now you're familiar with that concept, right? If someone says the probability is 0.5, 5.45, you know what that means. But I wanted to emphasize that it always hasn't always been that way. Uh, and that probability is really a concept that arose in the 16 hundreds, uh, before that nobody ever said that Ian Hacking, who is a, uh, he wrote a history of probability theory searched through world literature for any reference to a probability and could find none anywhere before 1600. So there was an intellectual leap that occurred in the 17th century, uh, and it became a very fashionable to talk in terms of probabilities.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       It spread throughout the world, the idea of quoting probabilities. Uh, but it was, it's, it's, it's funny that's such a simple idea. Hadn't been used before. Hacking points out that, uh, the word probability or probable was already in the English language. Uh, in fact, Shakespeare used it. But what do you think it meant now? He gives an example of, um, a young woman who was describing a man that she likes and she says, I liked him very much. I find him very probable. Okay. What do you think she means? Cause I'm going to answer that. Then he went no Elizabethan English well enough to tell me what does a probably young man anyway, I'm asking for an answer. Say it sounds like people have no idea. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:04:20       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       Anyone venture a guess?

Speaker 2:          00:04:24       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       no one wants to venture a guess that he can father children. Uh, I don't think that's what she meant, but maybe now what? Uh, what, uh, apparently she met is trustworthy. Okay. That's very important quality in a person I suppose. Right? So if something is probable, you mean that you can trust it. Okay. And so probability means trustworthiness. And so, uh, uh, you can see how they moved from that definition of probability to the current definition. Um, but Ian Hacking being a good historian, uh, thought, you know, someone must've had some concept of probability going before, uh, even if they didn't quote it as a number the way there must have been in their head or in their idea. So he searched through world literature to try to find some use of the term that preceded the 16 hundreds. And he concluded that there were probably a number of people who had the idea, but they didn't publish it. And it never became part of the established, uh, uh, uh, literature. Uh, partly because he said throughout human history, there has been a love of gambling and probability theory is extremely useful if you are a gambler. And hacking believes that there were many gambling theorists who invented probability theory at various times in history, uh, and never wrote it down. And I kept it as a secret. Uh, and he gives an example. I like to, um, uh, he gives an example from a book that, or it's a collection.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       No, this, uh, I think there's a, this is a collection of epic poems written in Sanskrit. Uh, and that goes back, uh, it actually risen written over a course of a thousand years, uh, and it was completed in the fourth century. Uh, well, there's a story, there's a long story in the Mahabharata, uh, about a emperor called Nala. Uh, and he had a wife named Demante, uh, and he was very pure and very good person. Uh, but, uh, there was an, uh, an evil demon called Kali who hated Nava and wanted to bring his downfall. So we had to find a weakness of Nala. Uh, and he found finally some, even though Nala was so pure and so perfect, he found one weakness and that was gambling. Now, I couldn't resist the opportunity to gamble. So the evil demon seduced him into gambling aggressive. And you know how sometime when you're losing, you readable and you keep hoping to win back what you've lost?

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       Uh, in a, in a fit of gambling, Nala finally gambled his entire kingdom and lost, okay. The terrible story and not a of them had to leave the kingdom. And his wife and, uh, they wandered for years. He separated from her because of dire necessity. They were wandering in the forest, uh, and he was in despair, having lost everything. But then he meets, uh, someone by the name of a, who do we have here we have Nala, and he meets this man to paranoia. And this is where a probability theory apparently comes in. [inaudible] partner tells not lot that he knows the science of gambling and he will teach it to Nala, but it has to be done by whispering in his ear because it's a deep and extreme secret. And Nala is skeptical. How does [inaudible] and know how to gamble? Uh, and so, uh, too paranoid tries to prove to him his abilities.

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       And he says, see that tree there, I can estimate how many leaves there are on that tree by counting want leaves on one branch. So over to paranoia looked at one branch and then estimated the of leaves on the tree. And Nala was a skeptical. So he stayed up all night and counted every leaf on the tree and it came very close to what Nala or lot route two parent. I said, uh, and so, uh, he next morning believes Nala and begins I believe for two partner. Uh, now this is interesting. Uh, hacking says, because it shows that sampling theory, it was part of knowledge theory. You could, you don't have to count all the leaves on the tree. You take a sample and you count that and then you multiply. Um, so anyway, they story ends. Nala goes back and now armed with probability theory, we assume he goes back and Gamble's again.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       He has nothing left to wager except his wife. So he back, he puts her and Gamble's her, uh, if I remember now he knows what he's doing. Uh, and so he really wasn't gambling his wife. He's really a very pure and honorable man. But, uh, and so he won back the entire kingdom. Uh, and uh, that's the ending. So anyway, that shows that I think probability theory does have a long history, but it not being an intellectual discipline, it didn't really inform, uh, uh, a generation of finance. When you don't have a theory, then you don't have a way to be rigorous. So, um, it was in the 16 hundreds that probability theory started to get written down as a theory and many things then happen in that century, which I think are precursors both to finance and insurance. One was in the 16 hundreds, people started constructing life tables.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       What does a life table? It's a table showing the probability of dying at each age for each age and sex. Okay, that's what you need to know if you're going to do life insurance. So they started to do collecting of data on mortality and they developed something called actuarial science, which is estimating the probability of people, uh, living, uh, and so, uh, uh, that, uh, then became the basis for insurance. Now actually insurance goes back to ancient Rome in some form. In ancient Rome, they had something called burial insurance. You could buy a policy that protected you against your family, not having the money to bury you if you died, uh, in an ancient culture of people worried a great deal about being properly buried. Uh, so that's an interesting concept. They were selling that, uh, in ancient Rome. But, uh, you might think, well, why just for burial, why not?

Speaker 1:          00:11:47       Why don't you make it into a full blown life insurance? And you kind of wonder why they didn't. Uh, I think it's maybe because they didn't have the concepts down. Uh, in renaissance Italy, they started writing insurance policies. But I read one of the insurance policies. It's in the Journal of risk and insurance. They translate a renaissance insurance policy. Uh, and it's very hard to understand what this policy was saying. I guess they didn't have our language. They didn't, uh, it was, uh, uh, there were intuitively halfway there, but they couldn't express it. So I think the industry didn't get really started. So, uh, I think it's the invention of probability theory that really starts, and that's where I think theory is very important in finance. And I, um, uh, some people date a fire insurance with the fire of London in 1666. The whole city burned down, uh, practically in a terrible fire and fire insurance.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       I started to proliferate right after that in London. But, uh, you know, you kind of wonder if that's a good example for fire insurance because if the whole city burns down, insurance companies would go bankrupt anyway. Right? Uh, London insurance companies would, because the whole concept of insurance is pooling of independent probabilities. Uh, and so, uh, but nonetheless, that was the beginning. Uh, we're also going to, uh, recognize however that insurance got a slow start because, and I believe it is because people could not understand the concept of probability. They didn't have, uh, they didn't have the, uh, concept firmly in mind. There's a lot of aspects to it. You know, there's an APP in order to understand probability, you have to take things as coming from a random event. Uh, and people don't clearly have that in their mind from an intuitive standpoint. They have maybe a sense that I can influence events by willing or wishing a, and if I think that if I have kind of a mystical side to me, then probabilities don't have a clear meaning.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       Uh, and it's been shown that even today, people seem to think that, that they don't really take at an intuitive level probabilities, uh, uh, very, uh, as objective. So for example, if you ask people how much they would be willing to bet on a coin toss, they were, they will typically bet more if they can toss the coin or they will bet more if the coin hasn't been tossed yet and it could have been already tossed in concealed. And what, why would that be? It might be this just some intuitive sense that, um, that I, that I can, I dunno, I can, I have some magical forces in me and I can change things. So the idea of probability theory is that no, you can't change things. There are these objective laws of probability out there that guide everything. Most languages around the world have, uh, a different, uh, uh, uh, word for luck and risk or luck.

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       And a fortune luck seems to mean something about you. I'm a lucky person. I don't know what that means. Like the God or gods favor me. And so I'm lucky. This is my lucky day. A probability theory is really a movement away from that. And so we then have a mathematical rigorous, uh, um, uh, discipline. So, uh, now I'm going to go through some of the, um, uh, some of the terms of probability here and uh, um, this will be review for many of you, but, uh, it'll be something that we're going to use in the, um, so I use the symbol p or I can sometimes write it out as probability to represent a prob probability. Okay. And it is always a number of that lies between zero and one or between 0% and 100%. Okay? Percent means divided by a hundred in Latin, right? So 100% is one. Okay. And so this is the probability. If the probability is zero, that means the event can't happen. If the probability is one, it means it's certain to happen. If the probability is, does everyone see this from over there? And if I could move, I can't probably move this or can I? Yes, I can.

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       Can you, you're the most disadvantaged person and you can see it, right? Uh, so, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:16:52       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       that's the basic idea. Uh, now one of the first principles of probability is the idea of independence. Okay?

Speaker 2:          00:17:03       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       so the idea is that probability, uh, is the, um, uh, measures the likelihood of some outcome. Let's say the outcome of an experiment, okay? Like tossing a coin, you might say the probability that you'd toss a coin that it comes up heads is a half. Okay. Because equally likely it heads and tails, uh, independent experiments are experiments that occur without relation to each other. So if you toss a coin twice and the first experiment doesn't influence the second we say they're independent. And so there there's no relation between the two and one of the first of probability that theory is called the multiplication

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       rule.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       And that says if you have independent probabilities, the probability of two events is equal to the product and their probabilities. So the probability of a and the is equal to the probability of a times the probability of B.

Speaker 2:          00:18:26       Okay. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:18:28       that wouldn't hold if they're not independent. The theory of insurance is that ideally an insurance company wants to insure independent events. Okay. And so ideally life insurance is insuring people, or fire insurance is insuring people against independent event. So it's not the fire of London, it's the, it's the problem that sometimes people knock over an oil lamp in their home and they burn their own house down. Uh, and so it's not going to burn any other houses down. It's this just completely independent of anything else. So the probability that the whole city burns down is infinitesimally small. Right. Uh, this, this will generalize to probability of a, and B and c is the probability of a times the probability of B and probability times the probability of c and so on. So if their probability is one in a thousand that a house burns down and there's a thousand houses, the probability that they all burned down is prob is one 1000th to the thousandth power, which is virtually zero. And so insurance companies then basically if they write a lot of policies, they have virtually no risk. Uh, and so that is the, um, the fundamental idea, which may seem simple and obvious to you, but it certainly wasn't back when the idea first came up. Uh, so, uh, one of the, uh, incident, we have a problem set, which I want you to start today and it will be do, uh, not in a week this time because we have a, uh, Martin Luther King Day coming up, but it will be due the Monday following that. Uh, so the, um,

Speaker 2:          00:20:21       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       if you follow through from the independent theory, there's a, uh, one of the basic relations in probability theory is called the binomial distribution. And I'm not going to spend, spend a whole lot of time on this.

Speaker 2:          00:20:40       Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       but it gives a probability of x successes in n trials or in the case of insurance, uh, x if you're insuring against an accident, the probability that you'll get x accidents and, and trials. So, uh, it, the binomial distribution gives the probability as a function of x, and it's given by the formula where p is the probability of the accident, uh, p to the x times one minus P to the n minus x, uh, times n factorial over and minus x factorial. Uh, and so, uh, that is the formula that insurance companies use when they have independent probabilities to estimate the likelihood of a having a certain number of accidents. They're concerned with having too many accidents, which might, um, exhausted their reserves to an insurance company has reserves and they, they, they have enough reserves to cover them for a certain number of accidents and they use the binomial distribution, uh, to calculate the probability of getting any specific number of accidents.

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       So, uh, that is the multiplication, the binomial distribution. So I'm not going to expand the hunters because I can't get into detail. This is not of course in probability theory, but, uh, I'm hopeful that you can see the formula and you could apply it. All right. Any questions? Is this clear enough and you read my handwriting? Um, okay. So, um, another important concept in probability theory that we will use a lot is expected value. Uh, and so, um, the mean or average, uh, those are all roughly interchangeable concepts. So we have expected value mean or average.

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       Okay. Um, so, uh, but we can define it in a couple of different ways depending on whether we're talking about sample mean or a population mean, the basic definition, the expected value of some random variable x. Um, I guess I should've said he ran a variable is a, uh, a quantity that takes on value is x. If you have an experiment. And the outcome of the experiment is a number than a random variable is that number which comes from the experiment. So for example, the experiment could be tossing a coin and I will call the outcome heads the number one and I'll call the outcome tails the number zero. So I've just defined a random variable. You have discrete random variables like the one I justified or there are also con which take on only a finite number of values. And we have continuous random variables they can take on any number of values along a continuum.

Speaker 1:          00:24:17       Another experiment would be to say mixed two chemicals together and put a thermometer in and measure the temperature. That's another invention of the 16 hundreds of by the way, the thermometer. Uh, and they learned that concept in the sig, perfectly natural to us temperature, right? But it was a new idea in the 16 hundreds. So anyway, that's continuous, right? When you mix two chemicals together, uh, it could be any number is an infinite number of possible numbers and that would be continuous for discrete random variables. We can define the expected value or Musa backs. That's the Greek letter mu, uh, is the summation, uh, I equals one to infinity of the probability that x equals x survive times x rabbi. All right. So, uh, I, I have it down that there might be an infinite number of possible values for the random variable x. In the case of the coin toss, there were only two, but I'm saying in general there could be an infinite number, but they're accountable.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       And so we can list all possible values when they're discreet and form a probability weighted average of the outcomes. And that's called the expected value. Uh, and it's people also call that the mean or the average, uh, often, uh, but you know that this is based on theory. These are probabilities a, okay. In order to compute using this formula, you have to know the true pop probabilities. There's another formula which applies for a continuous random variables. And it's the same idea except that I'll also, I'll call it muse of x, except that it's an indoor. So we have the inner girl from minus infinity to plus infinity of f of x times x Dx. Okay. And that's really easy. It's the same thing because in integral isn't an analogous to a summation. Uh, those are the two population definitions. F of x is a, is the continuous probability distribution for x.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       Uh, it gives a, I will, uh, well, yeah, so that's different. When you have continuous values, you, you don't have the probability that x equals x to buy because it's always zero. The probability that the temperature is exactly a hundred degrees is zero because it could be a hundred 0.0, zero, zero one degrees or something else. And there's an infinite number of possibilities. So we have instead what's called the probability density in when we have continuous random variables. Uh, you're not going to need to know a lot about this for this course, but this is, I wanted to get the Jason, the basic ideas down.

Speaker 1:          00:27:21       So these are called population measures because they refer to the whole population of possible outcome and they measure the probabilities. So it's, it's the truth, but there are also sample means, uh, when you would get, this is, uh, the two parent. Now counting the leaves on a tree, you can estimate from a sample, uh, the population expected values. And so the population mean is often written x bar. If you have a sample with an observations, it's the summation. I equals one to n, x of by divided by N. All right? That's the average. You know that formula, right? You add, you get, you can't end leaves on, you count the number of leaves. Uh, uh, you have an well, you have an branches on the tree, uh, you count the number of leaves and sum them up. Uh, one would be, there is a, I guess I'm having a little trouble putting this into the, uh, the two part in the story, but you see the idea, you know, the average, I assume that's the most elementary concept.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       Um, and, uh, and so you could use this to estimate either a discrete or continuous expected value. Uh, now they're in finance. There's a often reference to another kind of average, which I want to refer you to and which in the Jeremy Siegel book, uh, there's a lot is made of this. Uh, and the other kind of average is called the geometric average. Uh, and so, um, we'll call that a, I'm the only show the sample version of it, uh, g of x equals there's left parentheses the product I equals one to n act. So by there's a one over n power is everyone. Can you see that back there? Um, maybe you have trouble seeing that, but uh, it's different. Instead of summing them and dividing by him, I multiply them all together and the route of them. Uh, so this is called the geometric average and it's used, uh, only for positive numbers.

Speaker 1:          00:29:51       So if you have any negative numbers, uh, you'd have a problem, right? If you had one negative number in it, then the product would be a negative number. And if you took a route of that, you might get a, an agile, very number. So we don't want to use it in that case. But, uh, uh, there's a appendix two, one of the chapters in Jeremy Siegel's book where he says that one of the most important applications of this theory is to measure how successful and investor is. Okay. So, um, uh, if, uh, suppose someone is managing money, uh, uh, have they done well? If, so, you would say, well, they've been investing money over a number of different years. Let's take the average over all the different years. Okay. So suppose someone has been investing money for n years and rabbi is the return on the investment in a given year.

Speaker 1:          00:30:49       What is their average performance was the natural thing to do would be to average them up. Right. Uh, now, uh, but, uh, Jeremy says that maybe that's not a very good thing to do. Uh, so, um, but he says you should do instead is take the geometric average of gross returns. Okay. That now what is the return on an investment is how much you made from the investment as a percent of the money invested. Okay? The gross return is the return plus one. All right? The worst you can ever do investing is to lose all of your investment Lewis, 100%. So if we add one to the return, you've got a number that's never negative and we can then use geometric returns. Okay. Um, and so, uh, Jeremy Siegel says, really in finance we should be using geometric and arithmetic. And why is that? Well, I'll tell you in very simple term, I think suppose someone is investing your money and he announces I have had very good returns.

Speaker 1:          00:31:59       I have invested and I've produced 20% of the year for nine out of the last 10 years. And so you think, gee, that's great. Well, what about the last year? And the guy said, oh, I lost 100% in that year. Okay. Uh, so you might say, all right, that's good. So I, I would add up 20% a year for nine years and then, uh, put in a zero, no, 120, because it's grocery turned for nine years and put in a zero for one year. And then maybe that doesn't look bad. Right? But think about it. If you are investing your money with someone like that, what did you end up with? You ended up with nothing. If they have one year, when they lose everything, it doesn't matter how much they made in the other years. Uh, so Jeremy says in the, in the text is that the geometric return is always lower than the arithmetic return, unless all the numbers are the same.

Speaker 1:          00:32:55       Uh, and so it's a less, uh, it's a less optimistic version. And so we should use that. But people in finance resist using that, uh, because, uh, it's a lower number and when you're advertising your return, you want to make it look as big as possible. Okay. We also need, uh, some measure. Uh, we've been talking here about measures of central tendency only, uh, and in finance we need as well measures of dispersion. Uh, that's how much something varies. Central tendency is a manager of the center of a probability distribution of the light. But a central tendency is a measure of variance is a measure of how much things change from one observation to another. So we have

Speaker 2:          00:33:47       variance,

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       uh, and it's measured often represented by sigma squared. That's the Greek letter sigma, uh, lower case squared, or especially when talking about, uh, um, uh, estimates of the variance. We sometimes say s squared, uh, or, or we say standard deviation

Speaker 2:          00:34:16       squared.

Speaker 1:          00:34:17       Uh, the variance, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Okay. Uh, so for, uh, population variance, the variance of some random variable x,

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:34       A is defined as uh, the summation, I equals one to infinity of the probability that x equals x by times x minus new squared. All right? So, um, new subjects, new subjects is the mean. We just defined it of x. That's the expectation of acts are also EMX. So it's the, it's the probability weighted average of the square deviations from the mean. If it moves a lot, either way from the mean, then this number squared is a big number. So the more x moves, uh, the bigger the variances. Okay. There's also another, uh, variance measure a which we use in the sample also there. Sometimes he was, um, so this is sigma squared.

Speaker 1:          00:35:43       There's also another variance measure, which is where the sample and when we have an observations, it's this, uh, the summation, I equals one to n of x minus x Bar squared all over n Oh, this should be squared. Um, okay, so that is the sample variance. Now some people will divide by n minus one. Uh, all right. I suppose I would accept either answered, I'm just keeping it simple here. Uh, that's, uh, they, they've divided by n minus one to make it an unbiased estimator of the population variance. But I'm just going to show it in a simple way here. So you see what it is. It's a measure of how much x deviates from the mean, but it is, since it's squared, it weights big deviations a lot because the square of a big number is really big. And so, um, that's the variance.

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       All Right, so that completes of central tendency and dispersion. Uh, we're going to be talking about these in finance as regards returns because generally the idea here is that we want high return. So we want a high expected value of returns, but we don't like variance. So expected value is good, variance is bad because that's risk. That's uncertainty. West part. This whole theory is about how to avoid, how to get a lot of expected return with, uh, without getting a lot of risk. Now another concept that's very basic here is covariance. Covariance is a measure of how much two variables move together. Okay? So, uh, so covariants, uh, is a covariance.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       Uh, we'll call it. Now we have two random variables. So the covariance of x and Y, uh, I'll just talk about it in a sample term. Uh, it's the summation. I equals one to n of x minus x Bar Times y minus y bar all over N. Okay. So, uh, ex, uh, this is the deviation of, or for the, I thought I subscript, meaning we have a separate eye, uh, exit rabbi. And why? So by for each observation, so we're talking about an experiment. When you generate, each experiment generates both an x and a y observation. And we want to know whether when x is high, why also tends to be high or whether it's the other way around. If, if they tend to move together, if when x is high and why is high together at the same time, then uh, the covariance will tend to be a positive number.

Speaker 1:          00:39:03       Or also if x tens when x is low, why also tends to be low, then this will be a negative number. And so, well this, so their product is positive. All right? So a positive covariance means that the to move together and negative covariance means that they tend to move opposite each other. So if x is high relative to x, buy, this is positive then why it tends to be low relative to its mean. And this is negative. So the product would be negative. And if you get a lot of negative products that makes the covariance negative. Okay. Uh, and then I want to move to correlation.

Speaker 3:          00:39:42       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       So this is a measure, a, it's a scaled covariance. Uh, the correlation, how are we tend to use the Greek letter role? Um, or if you, um, where do you use excel? It would be Corel or sometimes I say car. Uh, that's the correlation. Okay. Uh, this number always lies between zero, between minus one and plus one.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Uh, and what it is, uh, is defined as Raul is equal to the covariance of x and y divided by the standard deviation of x times the standard deviation of y. Okay. Uh, and uh, that's the correlation coefficient. So, uh, that has kind of almost entered the English language in the sense that you'll see it quoted occasionally in this papers. So I dunno how used to it, you know, uh, where would you see that, you know, they would say there is a low correlation between sat scores and grade point averages in, in college or maybe it's a high correlation. I know what it, does. Anyone know what it is? But you can estimate a car. It's probably positive. I bet it's way below one. Right. But it has some correlation. So maybe it's 0.3. Okay. That would mean that, uh, people who have high sat scores tend to get higher grades.

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       Uh, if it were neg, it's very unlikely that it's negative, right? It couldn't be negative, it couldn't be a, that people who have high sat scores tend to do poorly in college. So if you want to quantify how much they, uh, then you have to, you can look at the correlation. Um, okay. So, um, I want to move to regression. And this is another concept that is very basic to statistics, but yet, um, has particular use in finance. Uh, so I'll give you a financial example. Okay. So the concept of regression, uh, it goes back to the math and efficient and Gauss, uh, who, uh, talked about fitting a line through a scatter of points. So let's draw a, I took my watch off and see my time here. Uh, let's draw a line through a scatter of points here. So this is, uh, I want to put down on this axis, uh, the return and the stock market.

Speaker 1:          00:42:35       And on this access, I want to put the return on one company. Let's say Microsoft, okay. And I'm going to have each observation as a year. Okay. I shouldn't put down a name of a company cause I can't reproduce this diagram for Microsoft. Uh, let's not say Microsoft. Let's say, uh, uh, Shiller Inc. There is no such company. So I can be completely hypothetical. Uh, and, uh, this put zero here because, um, and these are not grocery returns. These are returns. So there are often negative, okay. And suppose that in a given year and say this is minus five and this is plus five is minus five plus five. Suppose that, uh, in, in the first year in our sample, uh, the company Shiller Inc and the market both did 5%. So that puts a pie, a point right there, okay. At, uh, at five and five. Okay. Uh, and another year, however, uh, the, the stock market lost 5% and a Shiller ink lost 7%. So we'd have a point say down here, right at five and seven. All right? So this could be a 1979. This is going to be 1980. Uh, and we keep adding points. Uh, so we've got a whole scatter of points. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       It's probably upward sloping, right? Probably when the overall stock market does well. So does a Shiller Inc. All right, so what gas dad is said, let's fill aligned through the point, uh, this have points and that's called the regression line. And he chose the line so that, uh, this is gauss. Uh, he said he chose the line to minimize the sum of squared distances of the points from the line. So these distances are the lengths of these lines segments. To get the best fitting line, you find the line that minimizes the sum of square distances, and that's called the regression line. And the intercept is called Alpha. There is Alpha and the slope is called Beta.

Speaker 1:          00:45:02       Okay? So that's maybe a familiar enough concept to you. But in the context of finance, this is, uh, this is a, uh, a major concept. The way I've written it, uh, the Beta of Schiller Corporation is the slope of this line. Okay? The alpha is, uh, uh, is, is just the intercept of this, of this curb. Um, so, uh, we can also do this with excess returns. I will get to this later where I have the return minus the interest rate on this axis and the return minus the market return minus the interest rate on this axis. And then that case Alpha is a measure of how much Shiller Inc, uh, outperformed, uh, we'll come back to this, but Beta of a stock is a measure of how much it moves with the market, uh, and the alpha of a stock is how much it's sort of outperforms the market.

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       Well, we'll have to come back to that. These are basic concepts. Um, okay. So, uh, I wanted to, oh, and another, uh, so I guess I've been implicit in what I have is there, there's a distribution called the normal distribution. Uh, and that is, uh, uh, I'm sure you heard of this, right? Uh, if you have a distribution that looks like this, it's bell-shaped, right? This is x and I have to make it look symmetric, which I may not be able to do that well. Okay. And this is after the, the normal distribution is equal to the one over square root of two Pi Sigma e to the minus x bar minus mew squared over two sigma. It's a famous formula which is new gauss. Again, uh, we often assume in finance that random variables such as returns are normally distributed. So this is called the normal distribution or the Gaussian distribution. It's a continuous distribution. I think you've heard of this, right? This is a high school material. Uh, but I wanted to emphasize that there are also other bell shaped curve. This is the most famous bell shaped curve, but there are other ones with different mathematics and a particular interest in finance are fat tailed alternatives.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       So it could be that a random distribution. And I'll, I don't have colored chalk here, I don't think. No. So I will use a dash line to represent the fat tail distribution because the distribution looks like this. Okay. And then I have to try to do that on the other side symmetrically as I can.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       These are the tails of the distribution. This is the right tail and this is the left tail. Okay? And you can see that the dash distribution I drew has more out in the tails. Okay? So we call it fat tailed. Uh, this refers to a random variables that have fat tail distributions are random variables that occasionally give you really big outcomes. So you have a chance of being way out here with a fat tail distribution. And it's a very important observation in finance that returns on a lot of speculative assets, have fat tail distributions. That means that you can go through 20 years of a career on Wall Street and all you've observed his observations in the central region. And so you feel, you know, a pretty well how things behave. But then all of a sudden there's something way out here. This would be great.

Speaker 1:          00:49:22       Good luck if you're long and now suddenly you've just got a huge return that you just would not have thought was possible. You've never seen it before, but you can also have an incredibly bad return. And this complicates finance because it means that you never know. You never have enough experience to, um, to get through all of these things. Um, it's a, it's a big complication in, uh, my friend Nassim Taleb has just written a book about it called, maybe I'll talk about that called the Black Swan. Uh, and it's about how every, so many plans in finance are messed up by, um, by a rare events that suddenly appear that out of nowhere he called it the Black Swan. Because if you look at swans, they're always white, right? You've never seen a black swan. And so you end up going through life assuming that there are no black swans, but in fact, there are a, and you might finally see one. You don't want to predicate making complicated gambles under the assumption that they don't exist. Um, and, uh, so Tyler who's a Wall Street professional, talks about, uh, these black swans as being the real story of finance. Uh, I wanted to move away from statistics and talk about present values, does another concept in finance that is, uh, uh, fundamental. Uh, and so let me, uh, and then this will conclude today's lecture. What is a present value?

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       This isn't really a statistics anymore, but it's a concept that I wanted to include in this lecture. Um, people in business often have claims on future money, not money today. Uh, and um, for example, I may have someone who promises to pay me $1 in one year or in two years or three years. Okay. The present value is what that's worth today. Okay. So I may have a, a, an IOU from someone or I may own a bond from someone that promises to pay me something in a year or two years. Uh, according to Time, honored tradition in finance. Uh, if it says that it's a promise to pay $1, it's not worth $1 today. Uh, it must be worth less than $1. Uh, so what you could do hundreds of years ago and can still do today is to go to a bank and present this, um, uh, bond or Iou and say, um, what will you give me for it? Okay. And so, uh, the, uh, the bank, well discounted. Oh, sometimes we say present discounted value.

Speaker 2:          00:52:28       Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:52:30       So the banker will say, well, you have $1 a year from now, but that's a year from now, so I won't give you $1 now. Uh, I'll give you the present discounted value for it. Okay? Uh, now I'm going to abstract from risk. Let's assume that we know that this thing is going to be paid. So it's a matter of simple time, all right? Of course, the banker isn't going to give you $1 for something that is paying $1 in a year because the banker knows that a dollar could be invested at the interest rate. And so let's say the interest rate is r.

Speaker 2:          00:53:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:53:11       Uh, and um, that, uh, uh, that would be a number, um, which, uh, like 0.05, which is 5%, which is five divided by a hundred. Uh, then the present value of $1, the present PDV or Pv have $1 equals one over one plus r dollars. Okay? That's because the banker is thinking, well, uh, if, uh, if I have this amount right now and I invest it for one year, what do I have? I Have One plus r times one over one plus R it's a dollar. So that works out exactly right. So you have to discount something. That's one period in the future by dividing it by one plus R. Uh, if it's, this is a present value of $1 in one time period, which I'm taking to be a year, but it doesn't have to be a year. The interest rate has units of time. So I have to specify a time period over which I'm measuring an interest rate. So typically it's a year. So if it's a one year interest rate at the time period is one year, the present value of $1 in one time period is given by this, the present value of $1 in end periods.

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:46       Is One Oliver, one plus r to the nth power. Uh, and uh, uh, that is uh, uh, that's the, uh, all all there is to this. Then, uh, so, uh, I want to talk about valuing streams of payments. I suppose someone has a contract that promises to pay an amount each period over a number of years. We have formulas for these peasant values, uh, and these formulas,

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       are well known. I'm just going to go through them rather quickly here. Uh, simplest thing is something called a console or perpetuity.

Speaker 2:          00:55:55       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:56       I perpetuity is, is a asset or a contract that pays a fixed amount of money each time period forever. We call them councils because in the early 17 hundreds, the British government issued what they called console's are consolidated a debt of the British crown, uh, that paid a certain amount of pound sterling every, I think it was every six months forever. Uh, and you may say what audacity for the British government did promise to pay anything forever. Will it be around forever? Well, you know, as far as you're concerned, it's as good enough as forever, right? Maybe someday the British, uh, uh, United Kingdom will, something will happen to it. It will fall apart or change. But that is so distant in the future, we can disregard that. So we'll take that as forever in any way. The government might buy them back too. And so, you know, who cares if it isn't for everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       Let's just talk about it as forever. So let's say this thing pays one pound a period forever. Okay? Uh, what is the present value of that? Well, the first, uh, each payment we'll call a coupon. Okay? Okay. So it pays one pound one year from now. Let's say it's one year, just to simplify things. It pays another pound. Two years from now, it pays another pound. Three years from now, the present value is equal to remember it starts one year from now under assumption. We could, we could do it differently, but I'm assuming one year from now, the present value is one over one plus R it's one pound over one plus r for the first year, right? Uh, plus, uh, for the second year it's one town over one plus r squared. For the third year it's one pound all over r one plus r cubed.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       And that goes on forever. So that's an infinite series and you know how to sum that, I think anyway, I'll tell you what it is. It's one over r or the one pound over are generally, if it pays see dollars for every period, the present value is c over r. And so that's the formula for the present value of a console. All right? That's one of the most basic formulas in finance. Uh, so, uh, the interesting thing is it means that the value of a console moves inversely to the interest rate. The British government issued those consoles in the early 17 hundreds and while they were refinanced in the late 19th century, they're still there. And if you want to go out and buy one, you can get on your laptop right after this lecture and buy one of them and you've got something that will pay you something forever. Uh, but you're going to know that the value of that in the market moves opposite interest rates. So if interest rates go down, the value goes up. If interest rates go up, the value of your investment goes down. Okay? Uh, another formula, uh, is what if the console, um, doesn't pay? Well, what I sorry. Uh, next thing. It is a growing console.

Speaker 3:          00:59:25       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:27       I'm calling it a growing console, even though the British console's didn't grow. Let's say that the British government didn't say that they'll pay one pound per year, but it'll be one pound the first year. Um, and then, uh, uh, it'll grow at the rate g, uh, and will eventually be infinitely large. All right. Uh, so you get one pound for the first year, you get, uh, uh, uh, a one plus g pounds. The second year it stopped Ya, one plus g squared the third year. And so on the present value of this, I suppose it pays, let's say it's PC pounds each year, so it would be c times this. All right, one plus it would be c times one plus g cubed and the third year, et Cetera. Then the present value is equal to c all over r minus G. That's the formula for the value of it growing.

Speaker 1:          01:00:40       Cancel. Um, GE has to be less than our for this to make sense because if g if it's growing faster than the rate of interest, this infinite series will not converge and the value will be infinite. Uh, and you might ask, well, how does that make sense? What if, what if the British government promised to pay 10% more each year? Uh, what would the market value that with formula doesn't have a number? Well, I'll tell you why. It doesn't have a number. The British government will never promise to pay you 10% more each year because they can't do it and the market wouldn't believe them because you can't grow every year faster than the interest rate. And that's a basic one of the most basic lessons. You can't do it. Um, okay. Uh, one more thing. I think it, which would be relevant to the, uh, oh, there's also the annuity formula. And this is a formula that applies to, um, what if an asset pays a fixed amount every period and then stops. That's called an annuity. Okay. So, uh, an annuity it pays. See, I'll go back to dollars. See dollars starting in, uh, t equals one, two, three, and is

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       the last period. And that stops. A good example of an annuity is a mortgage on a house. Uh, you, when you buy a house, you borrow the money and you pay it back in fixed, it would usually be monthly, but let's say annual payments. All right? You pay every year a fixed them out on your house to the mortgage originator. Uh, and then after so many n is 30 years, typically you, uh, you would then have a paid off. It used to be that mortgages had a blue called a balloon payment at the end, which means that you'd have to pay extra money at the end, but they decided that people have trouble doing that. It's much better to pay a fixed payment and then you're done. Otherwise, if you ask them to pay more at the end, a lot of people, they won't have the money.

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       So we now have a nuity mortgages. What is the present value of an annuity? Okay. And so that is the present value of annuity. It is equal to the amount, what did I say is c times one minus one over one plus r to the nth power, all of our r. And so that is the present value of an annuity. Um, I wanted to say one more thing because I realized that you have to your, your first problem set, we'll cover this, is to talk about a concept that applies probability theory to economics and that is expected utility theory. Uh, and then I'll conclude with this. Uh, the, in economics, it is assumed that people have a utility function which represents how happy they are, uh, within outcome. Okay. And so we typically take that as you, uh, and uh, uh, so if I have a monetary outcome, I have a certain amount of money, x dollars, how happy I am with x dollars is called, you have x. Okay. Uh, and this I think you've gotten from other other economics curses. We have something called diminishing marginal utility.

Speaker 3:          01:05:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:05:05       Okay. Uh, and the idea is that for any amount of money, if this x is the amount of money that I received utility, uh, as the function of the amount of money I receive is a downwardly concave. The exact shape of the curve is subject to discussion. But the point of diminishing marginal utility is that as you get more and more money, the increment in utility for each extra dollar, uh, diminishes. Uh, usually we say it never goes down. We don't have it going down. The trust that that would be where having more money makes you less happy. That may actually work that way. But our theory says, no, you always want more, but it's always upward sloping. But it may be after a while you get close to satiation where you've got enough. All right. And so, um, uh, the theory that I mentioned this last time I was talking about, I was philosophizing about wealth and I said, what are you going to do with $1 billion?

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       We have many billionaires in this country and I think that the only thing you have to do with it is a philanthropy. They have to give it away because you are essentially satiated because you can, as I said, you can only drive one car at a time and if you've got 10 of them in the garage, it doesn't really do you much good because you can't do it. You can't enjoy all 10 of them. So it's important. That's one reason why we want policies that encourage, uh, equality of incomes, not necessarily equality, but reasonable equality because the people with very low wealth have a very high margin that utility of income and people with very high wealth, uh, have very little. So if you, uh, if you take from the rich and give to the poor, you make people happier. Um, but um, we're not going to do that in a Robin Hood Way, but in finance we're going to do that in a systematic way through risk management.

Speaker 1:          01:07:09       So we're going to be taking away from lucky peop. You know, you think of yourself as randomly on any point of this. You don't want, uh, you know, that you'd like to take money away from yourself in the high outcome years and give it to yourself in the low income years. So, uh, what, uh, what finance theory is based on in much of economics is based on the idea that people want to maximize the expected utility of their wealth. Okay? And so the, since this is a concave function, it's not just the expected value to calculate the expected utility of your wealth. You might also have to look at the expected return or the geometric expected return or the standard deviation, or you might look at the fat tail. There's so many different aspects that we can get into a, and so this underlying theory motivates a lot of what we do, but it's not, uh, it's not a complete theory until we specify the utility function.

Speaker 1:          01:08:12       Uh, of course, we will also be about behavioral finance in this course, and we will at times be saying that the utility function isn't the idea that people are actually maximizing expected utility may not be entirely accurate. But in terms of the basic theory, that's the core cancer. And I have one question on the problem set that asked you to think about how you would handle a decision whether to gamble, basically efficient, uh, based on expected utility theory. That's a little bit of a tricky question. Uh, um, but, uh, so, uh, do the best you can on it and think, try to think about, uh, about, uh, what this kind of theory would imply for gambling or behavior. All right? So I will see you on Friday. That's two days from now in this room.
