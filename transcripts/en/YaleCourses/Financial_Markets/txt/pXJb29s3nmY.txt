Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I want to talk today about the efficient markets hypothesis. Uh, and, uh, uh, let me just first say a last lecture was about insurance. Uh, and I was telling you about the theory of insurance and how it's evolved over the years, uh, and how it's produced some real benefits.

Speaker 2:          00:00:25       Uh, um, is that better?

Speaker 1:          00:00:35       It says Mike Volume. Did that go up?

Speaker 2:          00:00:37       Okay. So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       I wanted to just tie this in, uh, the advantages of insurance that we have to some big events that occurred. Uh, and that will, I think, uh, point out the strengths and weaknesses of our institutions. So we had a terrible hurricane a couple of years ago in Los Angeles. Uh, Hurricane Katrina, uh, damaged, uh, the city of, I'm sorry, did I say Los Angeles? You have to stop me when I say things that are, uh, obviously wrong. Uh, my mind lapses sometime New Orleans and Los Angeles doesn't have to worry about hurricanes as far as I know, unless there's some major change. Uh, in New Orleans, uh, there was a hurricane Katrina, uh, it, uh, broke the, uh, levies that were surrounding the city and cause a flooding of the city. Uh, and, uh, what, what saved the people of the city? Mostly I would say it's actually the insurance institutions because, uh, the city was heavily damaged, but homes were generally insured.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Uh, there was some conflicts that happened when this huge disaster came. Some people had wind insurance and some people had flood insurance. Uh, and, uh, it would be, became, you came difficult whether this was a wind or a flood problem, right, because the wind caused the flood. So if you had only wind insurance, are you covered? So there was a lot of bickering and arguments afterwards, but I think it worked out well there. Uh, there, there were surveys of, uh, customer satisfaction, uh, after the, uh, event. And I think generally people were happy with their insurance companies. Of course there were some that were not, who may have found out that they weren't covered. But, uh, uh, on the whole, the experience worked well. So, uh, the other thing I wanted to say about the last lecture is that, um, as, as financial progress moves on, the distinction between insurance and other forms of risk management may get blurred.

Speaker 1:          00:02:56       And one very interesting thing that's been happening is that, uh, we are starting to see development of another institution called the catastrophe bond, which is a, uh, another way that people have of protecting themselves against catastrophes. And it's not insurance. So I, catastrophe bond is a bond that the issuer doesn't have to pay off if there's a catastrophe. All right? So you can have hurricane. The city of New Orleans could raise money with catastrophe bonds, uh, that, uh, uh, they have to pay back if there's no hurricane, but, uh, they don't have to pay back if there is a hurricane, uh, or it could be some mixture. They'd pay back. Part of it if there is a hurricane that that's like insurance, isn't it? But it doesn't operate through an insurance company. Uh, it operates through the securities market. So a good example of that is a couple of years ago, the government of Mexico issued catastrophe bonds against earthquakes.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       Uh, Mexico City was hit by a terrible earthquake about 20 years ago. Uh, and it's vulnerable to being hit again. So what does Mexico do about this? Mexico could wait until there is a hurricane and hope that there's some international relief effort. Uh, but you know, that's not a very good way to perceive. We want to arrange it in advance. So, uh, what Mexico did, his issue, cat bonds, uh, that, uh, have to be repaid in the absence of a hurricane and have a lower repayment if there is, I've said it, a hurricane and not at my desk to form today. Earthquake in Mexico City does not have to worry about hurricanes either. Every area is different and they have their own, um, their own, uh, individual, uh, characteristics. So right now, the insurance industry is a bit challenged, uh, because in terms of some risks, because the risk seems to be changing through time, uh, and notably, uh, it looks like hurricane risk is increasing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Uh, and so people who are insured in it seems to be increasing because of global warming. Although I don't know if all scientists are agreed on that. But if you live in a coastal area of Florida, it does appear that your risk is increasing through time. So insurance companies want to raise your rates. Uh, and this is a huge issue down in Florida. Well, the government has kind of taken over, uh, for the time being, uh, insurance, uh, in Florida because, uh, we, we have problems, uh, people that are having problems paying the increased insurance premium. Uh, so, um, I don't think we've figured out finally how, uh, uh, insurance will ultimately look in a matter of years. But I think that the important thing is that it's protecting us against already, maybe in perfectly, but it's already protecting us against some of our worst fears, uh, like hurricanes and earthquakes.

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       Uh, and that I think the system is evolving and we're getting new developments like cat, like cat bonds that are changing the way we're doing things. And in the future, I think these will develop more and make us even better able to handle, uh, uh, catastrophe risks. Anyway, that's the last lecture today I wanted to talk about back to a securities markets are actually more general asset markets. And I want to talk today about the efficient market's hypothesis, uh, which is, uh, a very important intellectual construct, uh, that has guided a lot of, uh, a lot of theory in finance. Uh, I want to talk first about the history of the hypothesis. I haven't defined it yet for you, but maybe you already have heard of this. But a history of the hypothesis and the arguments for it, uh, and then the arguments against it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       And I want to talk about technical analysis and uh, empirical evidence in the literature about technical analysis. Uh, and other, uh, uh, other, uh, schools of thought that doubt of market efficiency. Talk somewhat about behavioral economics. Um, and then finally we have a homework assignment. Actually it's coming up. I'll start talking about it now. So, uh, uh, it'd be an assignment for you to try to forecast the stock market using statistical methods. So, uh, you don't have to look at the screen yet. It just blinked off. I'll come back to that. Uh, so the, uh, what is the efficient market's hypothesis? Uh, the term actually is a fairly recent, uh, origin, uh, that is, um, a few decades ago. But the idea it goes back much further. Uh, the idea is that in, in asset markets that have a good, uh, uh, they have good, uh, uh, uh, regulations and, uh, uh, market makers and develop markets that have a lot of depth and liquidity in these markets.

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       The prices that you see are perfect indicators of true value. In other words, efficient markets says that the market efficiently incorporates all information and the prices are like the best information, uh, about the value of something. In other words, the efficient markets hypothesis tells you trust market, don't trust people, trust markets. Uh, so, uh, I've been trying to find out who said that first. Uh, and, uh, the earliest, uh, statement of the efficient markets hypothesis, although it doesn't call it the efficient market's hypothesis. The earliest statement that I could find comes from a book, uh, written in 1889, uh, by George Gibson, uh, and it's called, um, the stock exchanges of London, Paris and New York. Uh, and, uh, a quote him, uh, he said, when shares become publicly known in an open market, the value which they acquire there may be regarded as the judgment of the best intelligence concerning them.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       So, uh, I kind of interested to see this book. I found it in the mud library actually by accident, looking through old, uh, stock market books. Uh, and, uh, the, uh, the book had some interesting observations. One observation which took my interest was that, uh, he points out that in this modern electronic age, uh, information speeds around the globe at the speed of electricity, uh, or the speed of light. Uh, when I, when I first read that, I thought from it, wait a minute, 1889, that sounds like 1989 or something. Are we going to interrupt the, uh Huh? Just a moment. We found the microphone. Why didn't want him, it was right there.

Speaker 3:          00:10:50       Sorry about that. There you go.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       No, I'm free from my, from my tether. Um, in 1889, uh, they had already invented the Telegraph, right. That goes back decades earlier. Uh, and the telephone was, was starting to appear. And so it really was true that, um, information would speed around the globe. Uh, and so information that became publicly known would be entered into market price almost immediately. And so the conclusion that Gibson had was that, uh, uh, there's no, uh, there's, there's no hope and trying to beat the price or, or, or, or beat the market because the price already has all of the information in it. It, let me elaborate on that theme a little bit. Actually. It goes back before telegraph. There was a famous story of a Mr Writers who had a information service, uh, before the Telegraph was invented, uh, and he, uh, wanted to help his clients, uh, get the information first so that they could trade on it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       Uh, and he had the idea of using a, what you call a carrier pigeons, uh, what you do because you get these birds and you raised them, you know what I'm talking about, right? You raised them in once place and then they're going to want to go back there. So then you take them away in a cage to another city, and when you need to get a message across, you tie the message to the pigeons foot and release it, and then it will fly back and it will beat any other method of a, of a message. Transmission. Uh, so writer, incidentally, riders information service is still in business today. Uh, and now they use computers that way. Everyone else does. But the hope, the whole principle precedes the invention of computers. Uh, the idea is that the only way you can beat the market is to get information that nobody else has.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       The way it works today is that, uh, uh, the, we can't actually improve on the speed from 1889 right? Because they were already going at virtually the speed of light with their information. But we can improve on the, uh, our access to it. So now many people have beepers or, uh, you know, something like this in their pocket that wakes up and tells them a news is announced. So what happens when there is news about a stock? So let's say it's a drug company that just makes an announcement that it has a new drug, let's say good news, uh, or it has gotten FDA approval to market some new drug. What would put that out? Um, over, uh, over the, uh, network of information. And some people would have their, their things beep on the men alert them immediately. There are analysts who try to keep up with the news about stocks.

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       And so, uh, these analysts then, uh, would jump to action when they hear that news like that. That's because they know that markets move really fast information, uh, to, uh, important new information. Uh, and they've got to be there first. So what happens when the drug company announces that they have some news important news? Well, the guys who are with their beepers immediately spring to action and try to figure out what the news and within seconds they're trading, because you know, you've got to be there first. Uh, otherwise you don't, you can't benefit from the news. So what happens that they said they've announced they've got approval for this new drug and then they did maybe maybe do a quick call to their drug company expert and say, quick, how much should I change the valuation of the stock? Uh, and the guy will give a quick guests, you know, twenties, this is now 20 seconds after the announcement, and then immediately you place a big trade for a million shares or Flusser mounted.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       And then the guy calls back 30 seconds later and says, oh, no, you know, I wasn't exactly right on it. I've had 30 more seconds to think about this, so let me change it again. Uh, so over the next few minutes, the price, a lot of people are trading like that. So the price is jumping around rapidly. Uh, then after maybe five minutes, these people that have had time to assimilate it and think about it and check their thinking and the price starts to settle down. Maybe I'm exaggerating how fast it sells them. Maybe an hour later you have a committee meeting and the experts are arguing about, uh, about what this really means and trying to, uh, assimilate other information and coordinate with it. But after two hours, it started to really settle down. So suppose you then the next day read in the Wall Street Journal about this new announcement. Do you think you have any chance of beating the market by trading on it?

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       I mean, you're like 24 hours late, but I hear people tell me, I hear, you know, I read in Business Week that there's a new announcement. So I'm thinking of buying and I say, well, business week that that information is probably a week old. Uh, even other people we'll talk about trading on information that's years old. Uh, and so you kind of think that maybe these people are, are naive. You know, first of all, you're not a drug company expert or whatever it is that's needed. Uh, secondly, you, you don't know the math. You don't know how to calculate present value is probably, and then, uh, and then thirdly, you're a month late. Uh, and so, uh, you get the impression that a lot of people shouldn't be trying to beat the market. Uh, and that, uh, you might say to a first approximation, the market has it all right.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       And so don't even try. Uh, so the efficient markets hypothesis is a, a hypothesis that one should respect financial markets. Uh, very much so. Your Textbook, uh, by, uh, for Bozi at Al mentioned, I looked it up in the index to see what they say about efficient markets hypothesis. They define it. Uh, according the textbook for Bozi, uh, publicly available relevant information about the issuers will lead to correct pricing of freely traded securities in properly functioning markets. That's their definition of the efficient markets hypothesis. Uh, they didn't say it was right. They just said that's the hypothesis. What for Bozi et Al Said is that the, uh, the hypothesis has informed a lot of regulation. The Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies that regulate financial markets, uh, have shown some faith in the efficient markets hypothesis and therefore they feel that their, um, their, maybe their primary mission is to regulate the flow of information to make sure that it's an even playing field so that everyone has access to information at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       Uh, so for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that when a corporation publishes information that's relevant to the value of their stock, they have to put it out to everyone at once. Uh, well there's rules about what that means, but typically they'll have a webcast or something like that and it's announced in advance. So everyone who is really interested can, can listen in. Uh, but I don't find a whole lot of enthusiasm. And if avast he'd work for the efficient markets hypothesis. And maybe that's because it's not exactly right, which is my view. It's a half truth. And I'll come back to that. I wanted to quote another, uh, bestselling textbook, not your own. Uh, but there's another textbook Breely and admires, uh, which is a textbook, a of corporate finance. Uh, and they are much more enthusiastic about efficient markets hypothesis. At the end of their textbook, they have a concluding chapter, uh, and the concluding chapter is built around what they call the seven most important ideas in finance.

Speaker 1:          00:19:05       And one of those seven ideas to them is efficient markets. Uh, and, uh, they don't call it a hypothesis. He just say efficient markets, which they define as the, the theory that I'm quoting them. Security prices accurately reflect available information and respond rapidly to new information. As soon as it becomes available, then they have a little qualifier. I think there's interesting, they say, don't misunderstand the efficient market idea. It doesn't say that there are no taxes or costs. It doesn't say that there aren't some clever people and some stupid ones. It merely implies that competition in capital markets is very tough. There are no money machines and security prices reflect the true underlying value of assets. Uh, well that's, uh, that's a pretty enthusiastic endorsement of efficient markets. Uh, I said I have some doubts about it. I guess I, I, uh, uh, I don't, I guess what I don't like, is there a concluding statement? Security prices reflect the true underlying value of assets. I don't think that's a really true, uh, but I guess I agree it's tough to make money reliably and quickly in financial markets. And so if that's what efficient markets means, uh, there, right. Um, so, um, but you know, efficient markets is not so easy to define. Uh, there, uh, we go back to, um, in, uh, the terminal, he goes back to 1967 and it was professor Harry Roberts at University of Chicago who defined three different efficient market's hypothesis. Uh, there is the weak form,

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       the semi strong form, and then the strong form, uh, the weak form. These differ only in terms of the amount of information that is assumed to be efficiently incorporated into prices. The weak form says that Info of past prices

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       is already in the incorporated into price. So, uh, uh, but, but only past prices. What it means only is that you can't predict stock prices, but noting that, say if it goes up today, it'll probably go up tomorrow or if it goes up today, it'll probably go down tomorrow. That would be relying only on past prices. And so Harry Robert felt most confident that this a form of the hypothesis was was uh, it was good. So he call it a week. For him, it's the least criticized of a form of efficient markets. Semi strong form says that market prices incorporate all public info information. Anything that's known to the public is already incorporated into the price. So don't bother to trade on it. The strong form says all information, whether public or not,

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       is it incorporated into price? This is a really strong, it's the least likely to be true because every time you increase the information set, what strong form says is that no information is private. Really, it all gets out into price. Uh, companies keep secrets. And so that's not public information. The Securities and Exchange Commission insists that companies keep secrets because they have to disseminate information in an orderly way. And so there has to be a secret until a certain hour in which it's announced to everybody. But the strong form efficient markets hypothesis is cynical about that and said, you know, nobody keeps secrets. It all leaks out. Uh, I think that when we refer to the efficient markets hypothesis, it's the semi strong form that we're usually referring to because the strong farm is a bit, uh, a bit strong. And, um, okay, so, um,

Speaker 1:          00:23:27       the definitions of efficient markets that I gave you a are intuitive but not very precise because then you have to ask, well, what does it mean to say that, uh, price incorporate all information? Uh, what does it mean to incorporate information? Uh, so, uh, there's not one answer to that question. Uh, and so I'm going to give the simplest answer. Uh, what does efficient markets mean? Uh, and, uh, I might, I'll have to raise, this is the simplest version, but it's often the one that's often the one that is referred to most. And that is that price is the expected value, the expected present value of future dividends paid on the stock. Okay. Uh, and so, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:32       the efficient markets hypothesis, it says the true value of a stock comes from the dividends that it pays. That's a cash flow that is valued by the market and the market values it as the present value of the optimally forecasted future dividends. Okay. So, uh, and the theory that's most often referred to is the simple, uh, I, I've already talked in the second lecture about present value of 400 rows. We had a growing perpetuity models. Uh, remember that I said that the present value, the present discounted value of a growing perpetuity that pays an amount d, uh, if it pays, if the pant is d times e to the GT,

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       Are these subzero either the GT is the dividend, so it's growing at rate lowercase g there. Then the formula we had for the present value was d over r minus G.

Speaker 2:          00:25:43       I remember that. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:25:47       and uh, this assumes of course that the growth rate of dividends has to be less than the discount rate are. So the simplest version of the efficient markets hypothesis says price is equal to the dividend all over the, in the discount rate minus the growth rate of dividends where, Gee, the growth rate of dividends is a, is an optimally forecasted growth rate of dividends. And so that gives us, uh, evaluate a model for the, uh, uh, price. Uh, another way of writing more generally as if I don't assume the constant growth rate of dividends is to write just a present value formula. It's another, uh, less strong form of, uh, writing down the efficient markets hypothesis because it doesn't say how dividends are thought to grow, but you can write the price is equal to the summation of the expectation at time. T of dividends at time.

Speaker 1:          00:26:52       T plus k all over one plus r to the Keith Power k equals one to infinity. This is another incarnate that that's just the present value formula. I have the price, I'm sorry. They should be the expectation at yeah, Tang t the price at time. T is the expectation of the dividend at time. People pay discounted by, uh, a discount factor are, uh, and that's just the present value formula where I've substituted an expectation, uh, for the future dividend. So, um, uh, that's the efficient market theory in this incarnation. There's other ways to envision the efficient markets, what it means, but let's consider this simple story. What this means then is that, uh, the, uh, price is a forecast of future dividends to be paid on the stock. This, this would be a of the present value of future dividends to be paid on the stock.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       And this means then that, uh, price, uh, relative to dividends, uh, is, uh, related to expected future growth rates of dividends. If you expect dividends to grow a lot, if g is high, then price will be high relative to dividends because this is subtracted off the denominator. It makes the denominator is smaller and it makes the price higher. Uh, on the other hand, if you expect dividends to do poorly in the future, then price will be low relative to dividends. That's what the efficient markets hypothesis would say. Uh, and so, uh, um, I would give you an example of that. Um, I talked last year about a company that I read in Business Week, uh, read about in Business Week. Um, so this is a year old story in Business Week. Uh, there was a company called first fed financial, which was a company that issues mortgages. And already this was in January of 2000 and said actually the business week story.

Speaker 1:          00:29:18       It was in December of 2006, but I was still reacting to it in a year ago in January of 2007. Uh, and so, uh, uh, the, uh, businessweek story, this is first fed financial, uh, was referring to the fact that, uh, the price dividend ratio, actually they talked about price earnings ratio, but the, the, the price earnings ratio for this company, uh, was very low. It was only 8.5 in, um, in, uh, in December, 2006. That's 8.5 and right that very clearly, typically price earnings ratios of companies are very high, much higher than that, typically like 15. So, uh, the price of first fed financial relative to its earnings was very low. And so some people might be inclined to think, well, that looks cheap. I can buy by buying first fed financial, I can buy the stock at a low price relative to its earnings. But if you believe in efficient markets, you wouldn't think that this is any reason to buy the company.

Speaker 1:          00:30:44       Because efficient markets would say that if the price is low relative to either dividends or earning, it must mean that people think that bad things are going to come to the dividends are earnings. In other words, the first fed financial has a low expected growth rate of, of dividends in the future. Uh, and so I was interested in this particular story because Business Week wrote an article about them, uh, and noted the low price earnings ratio and said, uh, what does this mean? Uh, uh, and what, what businessweek presented a year ago was an argument why g was likely to be low. Yes.

Speaker 2:          00:31:35       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:31:40       Uh, yes. If they don't pay dividends, you can't use this formula. And I'm not sure what the dividends were first fed financial. I only know the price earnings ratio, uh, at that time. But you're, you're right, you cannot use this formula if they're not paying a dividend today because, uh, the, uh, um, this formula I erased it, but it was up here assumes that dividends are following a growth path and your, and if they're not paying dividends then that we were very clearly, that's not inappropriate assumption. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       Right. So for Berkeley, incidentally, if you know, Berkshire Hathaway is the company that Warren Buffet a owns and it's a very famous company cause it's done extremely well. And Warren Buffet is regarded as by many people as a financial genius. Um, but if Berkshire Hathaway is not paying a dividend, we have to revert to this formula. So the efficient market theory would say, well, they're going to pay a dividend eventually. And so the price reflects, uh, these future terms. If you spell this out, this is the expected dividend next year, plus the dividend in two years, just divided by one plus r squared plus the expected dividend and three years divided by one plus r cubed, et cetera. So this theory would say that, uh, the dividend that Berkshire Hathaway has value only because they investors expect them to pay dividends in the future. Um, and that, that sounds right because if Berkshire Hathaway is never going to pay dividends, why would you hold it?

Speaker 1:          00:33:26       You might say, I'll hold it because I could sell to someone else at a higher price. Uh, but then you said, well, why would anyone else buy it? Look, if they're never going to pay a dividend, what good is it? It's just a piece of paper. Write it. Unless I can sell to a greater fool. But anyone who buys it, it's either would be buying either on the assumption that there is some greater fool coming or they would be the fool, a fool of themselves. So this theory says that the value, if Warren Buffet, cause he can't even say this, but let's somehow say the company could say, we will never pay a dividend. This company is going to give it away to charity. Someday. You won't get a penny as a stockholder. Well, if that happened, the price should be zero. It would convert into a nonprofit like Yale University.

Speaker 1:          00:34:18       So what's the price of a share in Yale University? I mean it's undefined. I guess it's zero, right? Because Yale is not paying, I'll write, I'll write a piece of paper for you and said, this is a share on my, my authority. This is a share in Yale University. Um, and it might just as well be that because it also says in my fine print, you will never get a dividend on this. So what's the point? Right? Uh, so, uh, incidentally Microsoft for many years never paid a dividend. It's often common for young companies not to pay dividends, but they did start paying a dividend. And, uh, the whole theory of efficient markets theory says that that's what, that's what people are looking for. That's why the, the value of a company is related to its activities. Otherwise, even if the company never paid a dividend, that what would you care what the company is doing?

Speaker 1:          00:35:13       You only care about it because someday they're going to give you money. A lot of investors forget that. That's a very naive thing, attitude. They think that somehow it's docs generate capital gains, prices go up. But you have to realize in efficient markets, theory is saying this, that prices only go up because there's new information about future dividends. Um, okay, so, um, the first financial, anyway, this is an efficient market story. First financial had a low PE and so people were wondering, is this a bargain? This is a cheap stock. Pe means price earnings ratio. Uh, and uh, the business week article pointed out that 40% of first federal had been sold shorts. 40% of their stock had been sold short. This is a very high level of short shortages. Do you know what that means? That means a lot of investors said, uh, I don't like first fed financial.

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       I don't want to invest in it worse than that, I want to go and short them. So that means you borrow shares and sell them and hope that the price goes down. When you have 40% of the shares sold short. That means that there's a lot of people who didn't believe in first fed financial. So business weekend, it's article pointed out that uh, this first fed financial, it was a, a small mortgage lender. This is the before the mortgage crisis that we're in and started in Santa Monica, California. Uh, and that it was particularly, uh, innovative in a chance in its lending, notably 80% according to the business week article, 80% of the mortgages it's issued were no doc mortgages. And you know, the no doc mortgage, it's something that appeared recently in the housing frenzy. A No doc mortgage is a mortgage where you walk in and say, I want to borrow money to buy this house.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       And the company says, fine, we'll give you a mortgage. We won't even ask you to send a, have your employer sends a letter saying that you have a job. We won't even ask you to prove that you own anything or have, we'll just give you the mortgage. Uh, that's considered by many people, risky behavior, but it was done during the housing boom. Also, they, they issued a unusually high proportion of what are called option arms. These are mortgages that are adjustable rate, but also the person doesn't have to pay the full payment every time you have the option of paying. And if you don't want to pay, you can delay it for a while. And these are also controversial because it thought they would attract borrowers who are unreliable, uh, borrowers who thought that they could afford the house because they didn't have to pay now, but of course it's all going to come later and then they might default.

Speaker 1:          00:38:01       So business, we thought that the low price earnings ratio was because the market expected earnings to go down, uh, and dividends to go down. So I, a year later, that is, this morning I wanted to see what first fed financial is doing. Uh, and actually it's still in business. Everything's alright. It has positive earnings, uh, but it's price. The price was $70, uh, in beginning of 2007, and now it's down to about $40. A 2008. So, uh, this is a testimony to efficient markets. Uh, the market was expecting the price earnings ratio. They gave it a low PE because they were worried about, they had information that there was something going badly in this company. And indeed they were right. Uh, it, you know, it's not as bad as you might've thought with the business week story, but it is bad. So, uh, uh, I guess the lesson, are you following what I'm talking? So what happened was they did get into trouble. Uh, the, uh, uh, the low PE was indeed a forecaster of, of, uh, of bad performance later.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       Uh, but, um, uh, so, um,

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       now I guess this isn't exactly efficient, efficient markets wouldn't, in this case, the, the people who sold first fed financial short made a lot of money, uh, when the price went down so much. That's not really consistent with efficient markets because it makes it sound like I, as a matter of fact, I could have, I could have reading the business week article at the beginning of 2007. I could have called my broker and I could have told my broker, uh, short please, I want to short first fed financial and I could have done that. And I looked like I've made a lot of money right by shorting it because the price went down a lot. Efficient markets theory, uh, would, would have to say, uh, that that was an anomaly, that that was just good luck. Those people who shorted first fed financial did make a lot of money, but hey, they were just lucky this time. Another word, efficient markets theory would say that the price was already down as far as, you know, basically as far as it would go in 2007 and that earnings would fall, uh, and dividends would fall later and that would explain why the price was low, but it wouldn't allow you to predict the price. So this and this anomaly, uh, uh, uh, the, the, the fact that it worked out so well is really not test two short investors, uh, is really not testimony too efficient and markets

Speaker 1:          00:40:58       efficient market. You know, in some sense I think I, I'm sympathetic, efficient mark. We have to be sympathetic to some extent. If I were to try and I actually did not short first fed financial when I read this last year and it was because I guess I had my doubt, you know, I had my feeling you read a business week article, you know, and it's a, it's everyone in the world knows it now that a lot of people doubt first fed financial. So if I come in late as a short seller, am I going to do well? You know, I start to doubt myself because there's so many people looking at it and so many people who are more knowledgeable about first fed financial, I am so, you know, maybe I won't try shorting it and that that's what efficient markets is all about. Um, so, uh, the efficient market theory became very popular in finance, uh, in about, um, about, uh, w w when Iran in 1970 and it became a, uh, uh, a prominent theory and finance, uh, it has a particular incarnation that I wanted to emphasize, uh, called random walk.

Speaker 1:          00:42:07       Uh, and so the random walk theory, uh, which follows loosely from this formula that I have to qualify it. But let me talk about random walking as a theory in itself. The random walk theory says that under efficient markets, stock prices and other a speculative asset prices are random walks. And that term goes back to Carl Pearson, uh, in an article in nature in 1905. So this idea is about, uh, about a hundred years old. Uh, and what, uh, Pearson wrote about was where the example he gave was a drunk. Imagine the person who is so drunk that every step that person takes is random and independent of the preceding step. Okay. And so suppose we, uh, this is 1905 story. Suppose we had, uh, a lamppost and we had a drunk standing at the lamp post. I've had drawn a picture that's a lamppost and that's a drunk, this person is so intoxicated that steps are completely around them.

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       And your object is to predict where will this person be in one minute, in 10 minutes and 20 minutes. Okay, well Pearson wrote about this. It said that the optimal prediction is to assume that the person in 10 minutes, the best forecast is the person will be here in 10 and 20 minutes. What's the best forecast person who will be here? Of course they probably want, because they're randomly staggering around. But the point is that if it's a true random rock, there's no bias. It's equally likely to go this way or this way. The most likely place for the person is right where that person is now. And so, uh, Pearson and other people following him thought that speculative prices are like that. That that sounds like the markets are crazy. They're drunk, but they're not drunk. It's, it's, it's because they respect all need to new information.

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       And so new information is by its essence and forecastable. And so it has to look like the market is driven by a drunk, when in fact it's very precise and responding optimally to new information. So that's one of the paradoxes that confuses people. Uh, so our statisticians develop the theory of a random one. And let me define it for you. A random walk occurs when you have, uh, a very, uh, variable x at time t is equal to x at time. T minus one plus epsilon, sub t where epsilon to be is noise. Unforecasted forecastable noise. Okay, so this is a random walk. X would be here. How far the person is from the lamppost. Here's zero. Let's say, okay, x is the distance from the lamppost. So at every time interval we have x of t, which is how far the drunk has deviated from the lamp post.

Speaker 1:          00:45:30       This is the random step. This is where the drunk was last period and we're, this is where the drunk is this period. Okay? So that's a random walk. Uh, and the, uh, in the heyday of efficient markets theory, people said that efficient markets is working very well. In other words, the random walk hypothesis, uh, uh, describes stock prices very well. So let me go to my spreadsheet, which I have up here. Uh, and uh, uh, I'll put this spreadsheet up on the web for you. Uh, what I have here is shown, uh, there's two lines shown. One is a blue line, uh, which is, um, the, uh, the Blue Line is the actual standard and poor composite stock price index. Uh, going back to 1871, this is a series that I, well actually it got this theories from standard and Poor's. Uh, I emphasize it a lot in my book.

Speaker 1:          00:46:37       It's a hundred. Uh, it's a a 130 year long stock price series money monthly for the United States. It's now called the s and p 500. Um, because starting in 1957 standard and poor, well, they kind of reorganized the index and they kept it at 500 stocks. So this is the second most famous stock price index after the Dow Jones industrial average. Uh, but I think it's better than the Dow Jones industrial average because the dow has only 30 stocks. And this has 500, it's representative of most of the market. So that's history. That blue, that Blue Line there is history. Okay. Now what I did on excel is I, um, I generated a random mark because there's a random number generator on excel. I used the random number and plugged it into this formula. A X of t equals x of t minus one plus Epsilon T. And that pink line is a true random lark.

Speaker 1:          00:47:38       It was generated by a random number generator. Okay. And the point here is don't they look kind of similar. Okay. Uh, when you look at, uh, when people look at stock pricing, they get an a, it's an illusion. This is a psychological illusion. They get the sense that, uh, there are bull markets when the market is going up and there are bear markets when the market is going down and it must be some force pushing it up for awhile. Um, but, uh, so you can see, for example, I'm looking at the Blue Line, there was a bull market in the 1920s, a famous boat market, right? The roaring twenties. Uh, and so you would say that can't just be a random walk. It was just going up all the time. And then this is the 1929 peak. And look at there is the crash from 1929 to 1932 big crash.

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       That can't be a random walk, right? That's what people think. They have this intuitive idea. But if you look, this random walk seems to do the same thing. The pink line, uh, has, uh, look, there was a nice bull market there and there's another crash. Look at, look at this whole period here. This was really strong and then it leveled out. We had bad bet. They kind of look similar, don't they? This is pure chance because that random mark that I generated was pure random walk. But that there's the bull, the actual bull market of the 1950s and sixties. And my random walk, it comes out pretty close to that. So the random walk theory says that people are operating under the illusion that there really is no trends or uh, there's no way to predict the market. It is just completely and forecastable. Now, incidentally, a nice thing about excel is I can generate a new random walk for you on the spot by pressing f nine if you know that key on excel.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       So I will press f nine and history is going to stay the same. The Blue Line is going to stay the same, but the pink line is going to change and I'm going to, I can generate whole hundred year history pseudo histories with the press of a button. So let's see if this works. Okay. We just got, what does that thing? Okay. I put an upward trend to the random walk there, uh, because I think there's an uptrend to the stock market. So it's a little different than this. I just added a time trend. Otherwise it's exactly that random walk formula that I use. Okay. That looks pretty much like history too. Except we would be in a bear market for, for quite a while, right? We have quite a bear market in the pink line, but I can correct that by pressing f nine again. Well, well, this is bad luck. Uh, the stock market crashed and it went off the chart. Uh, here, uh, that's bad luck, but I can try again. Oh, look, looking at that one. Isn't that a beauty that almost, that almost a well, it really, it really looked like the market.

Speaker 2:          00:50:37       Yeah. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       so I can just go, it's just amazing how fast this thing generates.

Speaker 2:          00:50:45       Look at that.

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       Well, I should stop. Tell me when one looks really interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:50:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       That's an interesting one. That's, that's if that, if that was the history that we randomly had, Jeremy Siegel would write not just stocks for the long run, he would be jubilant their returns on stock. He would say for a hundred years. This is like, this is 130 years for 130 years. Stocks have wonderfully outperformed the market outperformed us. Other things like that, that, that is looking pretty good, isn't it? And I just pressed the button and get like, getting many bad ways. That's how I have an uptrend in it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:27       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       but they all look similar right now. The other thing I wanted to talk about was a, uh, another thing called a ar one, which is a different story. Uh, and the Ar one,

Speaker 2:          00:51:40       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       this is the random walk here.

Speaker 1:          00:51:48       The other idea is, let me do it intuitively. First, I'm going to tie in elastic cord around the ankle of the drunk. Okay. And target to the lamp Paul. And okay, you see my elastic cord? It's very lucid beginning so the drunk can move freely. But if, if it, if it starts to get stretched and when the drug makes it all the way over here, then it's really hard for, it's pulling the drunk back. Okay. So that means it biases the drunk back towards the uh, starting point. Uh, and that's called a ar one or first order auto regressive,

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       a model.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       And so that means that there is something, the random walk has no center. It just has a starting point. It doesn't tend to go back anywhere. But here we have a center, uh, what do I call that? I'll call it the x bar is this point here, not necessarily a zero. And it says that x sub t minus x bar is equal to x bar plus row times x sub t minus one minus x Bar Plus Epsilon T. Okay. And row a row lies between minus one and plus one. Usually it's positive. All right, you see that? So row is the smaller row is the tighter the elastic cord is. So, um, it, it, it gets pulled back by one minus row the way back to the x bar in every time period. But then there's new noise that Alexander it. If there were no new noise, then the drunk would we just be gradually pull back.

Speaker 1:          00:53:52       But uh, but there's new Norris and so the uh, the drunk is not so, uh, uh, the drunk is not so predictable. Okay? So that's another model of the stock market, but it's not an efficient markets model. Uh, the random walk is efficient markets model. It says you can't profit by trading because you just cannot predict a change in price. But with the first order auto regressive, you can predict the change of price at least a little bit. Well when it's, when, when what goes up comes down. If the, if the drunk is over here, it tends to get pulled back here. If the drunk is over here, he tends to get pulled back up. And so that's the random walk man. So I programmed into this program, uh, and ar one, so I go down here and click on it.

Speaker 2:          00:54:45       That looks very different doesn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       Maybe I didn't get the parameters exactly right, but let me just hit f nine. I'll get to it looks better. Well, it looks a little different, right? You see a difference in this? That's because I chose, I chose row equals 0.95 for that diagram. So it's going to getting tug back to the trend. Um, but at sometimes it's hard to tell. I mean, I thought, can you tell the difference between a random walk and an ar one? It seems to be coming back faster.

Speaker 2:          00:55:17       So, uh, that, that looks different.

Speaker 1:          00:55:21       Well, with Roy 4.95, I guess it, it does look noticeably different, right? Because,

Speaker 2:          00:55:27       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       it's coming back pretty fast. I have 130 years observations and it's coming back 5% of the way every year. So in five years it's 25% of the way back. I've got the cord too tight. So it's not fooling you, right? You can see a difference between this ran this ar one and the true stock market, the stock. So this is revealing some truth to the efficient markets hypothesis. But what if I made real equal 0.99? Then I think I should have done that instead of 0.95. And then it gets harder for you to see the difference. And if I make row equals one in the US, what happens if I plug roe equals one into this expression? It comes back to the random walk, right? Cause the x bar is drop out because you've got one times x bar and you've got one minus x bar over here. So they drop out of the equation and you'd come back up here. So a random walk is just a one with a coefficient of a row of one. Uh, now the point is then that we can easily see that the stock market is not strongly mean reverting or trend reverting, but it's somewhat maybe somewhat trend to be run. It's very hard to tell whether it's row is one or 0.99. And so that's, that's the point of, of my little analysis here, uh, of random walk versus ar one.

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       So I'm okay now, uh, the, the homework, the problem set, uh, that you will have a next time. Now, you still haven't turned in your second problem set, but I want to work ahead now to the, to the third one. But I want you to do is to try forecasting the stock market. Uh, and so let me show you what I did here and I want you to do something. You could use this spreadsheet, but I'm also encouraging you to find your own data. So here is my spreadsheet, um, which uh, uh, has stock prices back to 1871. Can you see all this? Uh, I have this on my website all the time. I've had it on my website. Um, how long? It must be 20 years. I've, I've been just, I give it away because I, I'm, I'm the person who updates s and p data, uh, for, uh, 1871 to the present and s and p I now have a relationship with SNP cause there are publishing our indices, but they still don't provide updates of this hundred year long series.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       So here it is, uh, all the way back to 1871. So what do I have here? Uh, I have in column one is the essence, the standard and poor composite dark price index today called the s and p 500. Okay. This is the dividend on the s and p 500 even paying a dividend consistently. It's never missed a year. Maybe some companies have missed a year like Berkshire Hathaway or Microsoft, but the, but the whole aggregate has never missed a year. This is the earnings reported on the companies. All right? It's all per share. All right, so this is a first year earnings. Uh, and I have here the consumer price index in this column. Okay. And then, uh, and I've got long term interest rate and I can, I can convert it to a real price, uh, by dividing by the consumer price index. Uh, and this is the change in the real price.

Speaker 1:          00:59:02       Okay. I don't, it's, it's between this year and the next year. And so, uh, what I wanted to do is this is your homework assignment and maybe I'll come back to this or maybe your tas will come back to it as well. I want you to try to forecast the stock market. Okay? Uh, and so that means, but remember what you're trying to forecast. You're trying to forecast epsilon, you're not trying to forecast x. We already know x is easy to forecast. It's close to what it was last period. That's the hard thing is to predict where the next change will be. So I had to generate a column of data here, uh, which is the, um, uh, which is the change in the price. So you see up here it says, uh, J 10 minus day nine, uh, is the change in the price. That's what you want to try to forecast.

Speaker 1:          00:59:56       All right. And so, um, uh, I created this column going all the way back to 1871 showing for each year how much the, uh, s and p composite index in real terms change. I did it in logs. I took the change in the log, the real price. So that's essentially the percentage change that is going to be hard to forecast. Obviously it's going to be hard to forecast because there's some truth to the efficient markets hypothesis. If that were easy to forecast, you could have been rich. However, this fear, somebody could have been written, it can't be that easy. Uh, nonetheless, the problems that for you is to try to do that, to try to forecast it. So you have to do is go to regression analysis and you don't have to use excel, but that's just what I'm suggesting here because that's the easiest thing. So to run a regression, uh, you go up to tools, uh, and uh, let me see data, oops, data analysis, you can't even find it down here. Uh, and then you got to regression.

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       Uh, I guess I have to say. Okay. And then it asks you to fit fill in Europe, uh, x range and your y range. So the x variable is the, remember the regression model, uh, is, um, it's m y equals Alpha plus Beta x plus some error term epsilon or you, I know, I call it you. So we don't get mixed up. All right? So it's asking you to say where are your y variable is a, and I've got my wive variable is in column K, right? Because that's what I've generated. That the change, uh, in, uh, the k, oh wait, I've lost it. I can't, it's not column k. It's a, and if I can do it, it's a, I'm trying to find it here. It's calm. I isn't it, the move this,

Speaker 3:          01:02:15       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       That's the change in price. Uh, and then the x variable, I can pick some variable. The forecast, what I did is I just took column a, which is time. It's just the year. Uh, and I ran the regression, uh, since 1950 and I got the results here. Uh, right here. Whoops. Let's get rid of it. I'm just going to show you the results from what regression I man. That's how excel prints out regression results. Uh, and uh, the Alpha, the Alpha, which is the intercept is, um, it's shown here. So the intercept was 0.05. The Beta, uh, is, uh, the coefficient of the variable is minus two times 10 to the minus fifth power. Uh, you can see it. Now I've struck out, it doesn't like time as a forecast. It's a very small coefficient. Uh, the key statistic is a measure of statistical significance and the t statistic should probably be over to first just to go significant and insignificant piece statistics for both Alpha and for Bayer.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       So, um, the r squared is a measure of what fraction of the dependent variable y is variance I have predicted. And so it comes out with a fraction of 0.00014, seven. All right, this is not a success. This is not a get rich quick story because, uh, I'm explaining a one 10000th of the variance of the stock market. So, uh, I've, I struck out, I wasn't really trying that hard. I just regressed the returns on time. Um, so the problems that for you is to, uh, think about, uh, seeing if you can forecast the market. Uh, you don't have to use my data set. You can use others. Uh, and uh, you can go online and find them. For example, finance dot. yahoo.com has a lot of indexes, uh, but you can find them on other sites. Um, so if you find some other data and you can try to see if you can beat me, I not setting up a very high standard for success.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       Uh, if it were this bad efficient markets, well, this looks good for efficient markets theory. So, um, uh, uh, so, but, uh, what I thought you might do for the problems that is to try to think creatively about how to forecast the market. And let me say this, uh, I'm not, uh, I'm going to have to go and continue with my doubts about efficient markets in another lecture. But, uh, I, I think that the story has a good element of truth to it. It has to be hard to beat the market, but it's oversold as well, especially in academic circles. I think us professors who are poor are, you know, it's kind of a wishful thinking by us. We're not making much money and you can't. Anyway. Uh, and so, uh, we kind of over at tend to overstate efficient markets hypothesis and the other hand relative to your expectations as naive young people, uh, it may be a good thing to do to overstate efficient market's hypothesis.

Speaker 1:          01:05:50       There seems to be a life cycle effect where young people think I can surely predict the market. Uh, and then they get beaten down. Um, uh, Brad, Barbara and Terry Odn who are professors at UC, at different campuses of California, teamed up with, uh, economists from, uh, Taiwan, uh, and looked at data of, they got really good data from Taiwan about day traders, uh, and their actual returns that they traders are people who trade every day in the markets. Uh, and they found that there was a really predictable pattern. The young people, they started out as a day trader, uh, and they quickly lose it and then they lose badly cause they're trading too much and they really can't predict the market. There's like 1% of them though, who seem like they can actually beat the market. This looks like really good for efficient markets. Uh, but they found that there are some Taiwanese people who know how to beat the market.

Speaker 1:          01:06:49       1% survives and stays in. So is that contrary to efficient markets? Well, it does seem contrary because they found a small number of people did find some forecasting rule and succeeded. On the other hand, none of, uh, hardly any of them got really rich. And so it's very rare. Warren buffet is an extremely rare outcome. And so it's, I guess when I talk about efficient markets, I want to, uh, help prevent you from suffering under any delusions about your forecasting ability. But I don't mean that Warren Buffet can't do it or that you can't do it if you develop yourself into a Warren buffet. So the next, the problem set number three asks you to think creatively about how you would forecast the market and to take a stab at it by running a regression. And I expect you all to fail, or almost all of you to fail your grade will not depend on your success in forecast. It may even depend inversely, because if you show a big success in forecasting, you're a teaching assistant will look at it very carefully and try to find some mistake you made because if you do succeed, uh, it's probably a mistake. Uh, on the other hand, I don't want to tell you that you can't because as I said, we're going to come back to this, but I have doubts about efficient markets and I think that you just might be able to do it if you're smart about it.
