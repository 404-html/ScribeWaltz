Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I want to start out by talking about real estate as an asset class. It's actually the biggest and most important asset class. Uh, the value of real estate in the United States today is a of real estate owned by households directly is about $20 trillion, which makes it a comparable, uh, or maybe a little bit bigger than that. Then the stock market. Uh, and so, uh, stocks owned directly by households are only, uh, about 6 trillion. So for a typical household, the home is the, is the major source of wealth that they've accumulated. Uh, Chris, other stocks are held by institutions on their behalf, but, uh, in terms of direct ownership, homes are, are the main thing that people own.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       So, uh, there's also commercial real estate, which is smaller than owner occupied homes, uh, but we own that indirectly to, as the people through the stocks that we own and through the institutions we participate in. Uh, so it's very important, uh, and it has some important, uh, financial. Uh, there's a lot of financial institutions built around dealing with the fundamental problems of real estate. So I wanted to talk first about institutions, uh, and then move to what I think is myself more interesting, which is the real estate boom. Uh, and, and the kind of s fluctuations we've seen in real estate over the years. So I'm going to start out by talking about commercial real estate and the kind of vehicles that, uh, um, uh, we used to invest in commercial real estate. Uh, and then I want to talk about mortgages, which is the way that we finance both commercial and, uh, owner occupied real estate. And then finally, I want to come to the, uh, real estate boom that we are recently in. Uh, so,

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       so let me start by,

Speaker 2:          00:02:18       uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       the way that the kind of institution that you probably know relatively little about

Speaker 3:          00:02:28       for commercial real estate, commercial real estate, that means real estate owned

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       not by individual households, but by businesses. Okay. Uh, and, uh, the, the, uh, institution I wanted to talk to you about, first one, it's called

Speaker 3:          00:02:47       a DPP, a direct participation program,

Speaker 1:          00:03:01       which has been traditionally, uh, the single most important form of holding of commercial real estate. So when you drive along and you see all these commercial buildings, you might wonder who owns them. Well, sometimes they're owned by corporations, but, uh, I think the more important institution is the DPP, uh, which is, um, uh, uh, a, uh, a financial vehicle that owns commercial real estate on behalf of investors. Uh, and so, uh, the, uh, most important DPP, uh, it's called a limited partnership

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       or LP. Uh, there's a very simple reason why real estate tends to be held in limited partnerships rather than corporations. And that reason is the corporate profits tax corporations are taxed on their profits, uh, and, uh, DPPS are not. Uh, and so you want, if you are setting up an organization to hold real estate, you want to do it if you can, as a DPP, uh, because you don't want to pay those taxes. And so, uh, whenever possible, uh, uh, a, um, uh, ownership, uh, vehicle for commercial real estate will have the form of a DPP. Um, and a limited partner is a ship, is one kind of DPP, uh, and it has, it's not a corporation. So it's a partnership. Uh, at the simplest kind of partnership would be if several of you got together and formed the business. Uh, and in a normal and a simple partnership, the partnership would not be taxed because it's you doing business just as partners.

Speaker 1:          00:05:07       Uh, and so you are taxed but not the partnership. But the problem with partnerships generally has been that they don't have limited liability. A corporation is an entity that could be sued, uh, for uh, or could lose more money than it's worth. But the value of a corporation can never fall below zero because to the investors, because the investors are not liable for the mistakes of the corporation. If you buy stock in a company, the most you can lose is the money you put up. So that's called limited liability. But if you take part in a partnership, uh, you are individually liable for the debts of the corporation. And that's a problem with the partnership structure because you could join a partnership, uh, and uh, the partnership does something awful and loses, uh, more than you put into it and they can come after you for those losses.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       There is something, however called a limited partnership that has a two kinds of partners, the general partner and the limited partner or and usually many limited partners. Uh, and so the general partner takes on the liability. Uh, the limited partners, uh, don't have liability. So typically real estate is held in a limited partnership. It's limited because, uh, well they want to put it in a limited partnership because they don't, it's not easy to sell other people on joining the partnership if they could get unlimited liability for doing so. So there is a general partner who takes on the liability and the, uh, the limited partners who are many are, uh, are the participants who do not share the liability. So the general partner is typically the organizer of the, of the partnership. Someone who buys a 50 story building downtown and then, uh, well ranges Tobiah and gets partners, limited partners to join in financing it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:09       And so that's the arrangement. You have a general partner and limited partners, uh, and um, you don't hear about, uh, dpps I'm telling you something that you probably haven't heard a lot about. Uh, this is not commonly advertised or described, just like hedge funds are not commonly advertised in describe because it is thought that dpps are suitable only for wealthy and sophisticated investors. They're complicated. Uh, so the general rule has been that, um, only accredited investors, uh, should participate in them. And so, uh, accredited, I mentioned this before in the u s and in other countries as well, there are estimate similar thing we define an accredited investor is someone who can participate in a DPP or other sophisticated programs. And that definition is in regulation d, which defines a, an accredited investor. Uh, and, uh, for many years now, uh, to be qualified as an accredited investor, you have to have $1 million in wealth or income in excess of $200,000.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       Or if you're married $300,000 for the couple, uh, in, uh, 2000 and I mentioned this before in 2006, the sec proposed raising the definition to make it harder to be an accredited investor, but they haven't done that yet. Uh, so, uh, it remains that $1 million to do it. But nonetheless, a DPP is don't advertise. So you see mutual fund advertisements everywhere. You don't see advertisements for participation in commercial real estate like this because, uh, the government would be on their backs if they did it. Since it's available only to accredited investors, you can't be advertising because everyone would see it. Uh, so, um, that, uh, that's why, uh, the financing of a lot of this real estate is something of a mystery could because they can't talk openly about it. Uh, sorry. Uh, these DPP is go back a long time. Uh, but there began to be complaints about though because people said, well, why is it that because I'm not an accredited investor, I can't get into real estate like these other people do.

Speaker 1:          00:09:49       Why is it, you know, why isn't there something offered to me that's like a, a DPP that's available to everyone? Or another way of putting it, the government is effectively saying that unaccredited investors are free to invest in corporations that invest in real estate and they're subject to the corporate profits tax. All right? Wealthy people have the choice of getting around the corporate profits tax. So in a sense the tax structure was regressive. It was saying we're going to have lower taxes on rich people then on ordinary people. And that didn't seem fair at all. So there was a complaint, uh, aired about how about DPPS, uh, in the late 1950s, uh, and people said, let's change it. Let's make it so that everybody can have something like a DPP. So Congress finally acted, um, and uh, it was in the year 1960 that Congress defined a new investment vehicle called a real estate

Speaker 3:          00:10:59       investment trust.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       And this is for everyone. Uh, real estate investment trust is for smaller investors, although wealthy big investors can invest in it also. Uh, and so, um, the, um, they had to make a distinction. So these are called routes. Um, r E. I t a real estate investment trust congress had to make a distinction between these and corporations. And it's kind of a subtle distinction because there's a lot of corporations that own real estate. Like for example, Walmart. All right, Walmart, why they pay corporate profits tax? So after ninth, I don't know if Walmart was it around in 1960, I don't know. Uh, let's say it was all Walmart after the 1960 [inaudible], uh, act of Congress, it would say, hey, we're a real estate investment trusts. We are real estate. All these, how these stores, but that's not what the intent of this bill was. They wanted to reach to be companies that just own real estate. Uh, and Walmart is primarily a retailer. Uh, okay. So they specified

Speaker 3:          00:12:16       that 75% of assets must be real estate and 75% of income,

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       the real estate income. So that would, uh, that would be ruling out Walmart. Um, uh, and 95% of income must be paid out. They can't read it.

Speaker 3:          00:12:46       Pain earnings that limits

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       further. They're supposed to be like a pass through a vehicle. They, they're owning real estate on your behalf, so they shouldn't be retaining earnings. Uh, uh, also they had to be longterm holders. Uh, it had to be less than 30%

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       of, um, income from sales of properties for less than four years.

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       Less than no more than 30% of their income from sale of properties had to be, uh, from properties held less than four years. They didn't want flippers. They didn't want a company that that's speculating. They want it to be a holder of real estate. So real estate investment trusts became very important. Uh, and uh, actually in three waves, the first wave of rate, um, growth occurred in right after Congress passed the 1960 bill. So, uh, the, the first wave was in the 1960s. At that time, Congress had limit or governments, state governments had limits on the interest that, uh, savings banks could pay people on their accounts. So a lot of people switched from savings accounts.

Speaker 3:          00:14:21       Uh, two, two, uh, reads, and that's called disintermediation.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       Uh, an intermediary is a bank. Uh, and so when they pull out of banks, they were disinter mediating and going from banks into reads a, although in some sense it wasn't really disintermediation because you could say a rate is a different kind of intermediary between the individual and the investment. The second boom and rates

Speaker 3:          00:14:51       occurred

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       after 1986. The tax reform act of 1986 made DPP is much less valuable to investors. And so a lot of wealthy people switched from dpps to reads before 1986, the tax law allowed use of DPPS as a tax loss device and people would invest in buildings solely for tax purposes because you could write off the depreciation on the building. Uh, and so people were cynically setting up dpps as tax shelters only. And Congress said, finally, I think wisely in 1986 that we don't want to create rules that encourage people to do a different sort of business just to evade taxes. So they, they, they made, uh, uh, they, they said that losses depreciation that in 1986, the tax reform act of 1986 said that depreciation on structures in dpps can, uh, is called a passive loss and can be used to offset only passive income, which comes from, uh, uh, something like another DPP.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       And so it eliminated the tax advantage. So if they didn't have a particular tax advantage to DPPS, they went into, um, into rates. And then the third greet boom, uh, was in the 1990s. Uh, and I think that this third rate boom is different from the others because it didn't, uh, arise from any government regulation change. It arose from, uh, the beginnings of the, of the housing bubble, the real estate bubble that we're now in. So they're just became a lot of enthusiasm for rates. It's not just a bubble. It's also that rates began to be more diversified. They, they had many different kinds of rates for different kinds of real estate. It became a more interesting and diverse, uh, uh, asset class.

Speaker 2:          00:16:55       Uh, so,

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       so that's what I wanted to say about commercial real estate. So the two principal ways that commercial, whether it's three ways, one is commercial real estate is held by corporations in the line of business, but after that it would be dpps and reads. And we have democratized. Now rates are a rapidly growing force in, uh, in investing. And now, uh, we have substantially democratized real estate holdings. So it's not exclusively DPPS, uh, that are holding, are not primarily, we have a lot of rates now.

Speaker 2:          00:17:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:33       So then the next topic I wanted to talk about, mortgages. Mortgages are, uh, debts secured by property as collateral. Uh, so that when you mortgage property, that means that you offer the property as collateral for a loan. And that means that if you fail to pay on the loan, the property is taken by the lender, uh, to, uh, satisfy your debts. It makes it possible for people to borrow who otherwise couldn't borrow. Uh, if you, if you put a property up as collateral, then the lender knows that they can get the money back from you. So the, uh, the critical thing is the loan to value ratio lenders or Ltv, a mortgage lender doesn't want to lend more than the property is worth because that would be a loan to value ratio of over one. Uh, because then if you fail to pay on the mortgage, pay off the debt, the lender can seize the property and sell it.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       But if the loan devalue ratio is, is greater than one, they won't be able to get all the money back. Right. Um, moreover, whenever they seize the property and try to sell it, it usually loses value anyway in the process. So for example, if there's a homeowner who have you lent money to and have homeowner is defaulting on the mortgage, the homeowner might wreck the house, uh, that happens all the time. Or they might steal things from it. Who knows? They're angry and they're living in this house, and then they can stall you for a year. You're trying to sell the, how they hire lawyers and sue you, and you've got to hire lawyers. So there's a lot of costs. So you want to have a loan devalue ratio, which is sufficiently low that you the collateral, we'll cover the value of the loan. Okay. Now the history of mortgages, uh, is that, uh, they have generally over time, gotten more easy on loan to value ratio and, uh, also on maturity. The maturity of a mortgage is the date when it's paid off. Okay? So if we go back to the 1920s, okay, uh, and I compare that with now 1920s, the typical mortgage had in loan to value ratio of 60%. Uh, and a maturity of five years, often even less than that. Uh, and so, um, they also had, they were back then in the 20s, they were called balloon payment.

Speaker 1:          00:20:42       What that means is, uh, you would borrow $5,000 to buy a house, uh, and in five years and every year along the way, you'd be paying interest on your mortgage. And then in five years you had to come up with $5,000. Okay. So it was interest, interest, interest until the end. And then it was the 5,000. Of course, five years is too short because most people live in a house for more than five years. But the assumption was, well, when five years comes up, you refinance the mortgage, you get a new one. The banks weren't willing to lend more than five years because they didn't trust you. They thought things would change and whatever. Um, after 1929 real estate prices fell dramatically and people became unemployed, the unemployment rate in the United States rose to 25%. Lots of people could not refi, refinance their mortgages because they were unemployed.

Speaker 1:          00:21:42       And you go to a bank and say, I want a bow to refinance my mortgage, which is due now they're asking me to pay $5,000. I don't have $5,000. But the bank would say, hey, you're unemployed. We can't give you a mortgage anyway. Your loan to value ratio is getting pretty precarious because your house is now down 30% in value. You're a loan devalue ratio. If we are to give you a $5,000 would be something like 90% and they would say, no way are we going to do that. Our rule says we can't lend on a LTV of higher than 60%. So people would be turned down for the refinancing of their mortgage and what happened? They would lose the house. Uh, and so that happened in huge numbers in the 1930s. The 1930s was the, uh, the biggest housing crisis in US history.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       you see what the problem was? The mortgages were too short, uh, the loan to value ratio, well, it's not so much the loan. It was the maturity was short a and the balloon payment at the end that they change. So, uh, in 1933

Speaker 2:          00:22:56       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       Under the Roosevelt Administration, uh, Congress created something called the home owners I mentioning this it, it's actually relevant to right now, homeowners loan corporation.

Speaker 2:          00:23:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       R H, O, l, z.

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       That was financed by the u s congress and it started offering indirectly, but I started offering mortgages to all these people who couldn't refinance. Okay. It did it through banks. They, they, they, they gave the money to banks to make loans to people who were in trouble. Uh, and they, they created a very important change. They said five years is too short. It's gotta be longer. They said 15 years. Okay. And get rid of this balloon payment thing at the end. That was a dumb idea. People can't pay that if they're in any trouble. They can't come up with the whole value of the, of the loan all at once. And so they made it, they demanded that the mortgage is be self amortizing. This is what came in in 33. It was a very important change in mortgage finance. Self Amortizing means that you're not just paying the interest every year or every month, you're paying interest plus principle so that when the mortgage ends, you're just clear and free.

Speaker 1:          00:24:25       You don't have to pay anything. Nothing comes at the end. And, and so the, the HLLC said that's a lot more sensible. And so they demanded that that'd be done. And of course, banks would be reluctant to do it by themselves, but when the government is coming with a checkbook to write the money so that they can make the Lavar grudge and guarantees it, the hosc said, don't worry if they don't pay, we'll look. We'll, okay. So, uh, the banks said, of course we'll do that. And that created a major change in mortgage lending. It's especially relevant because, I don't know if you saw, maybe you did in the New York Times yesterday. Alan blinder, who is a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board under Greenspan, is now a professor at Princeton, had an article saying, we need to bring back the HLLC now. Uh, and in fact, our own Senator Christopher Dodd has a bill in Congress right now to bring back the hosc basically.

Speaker 1:          00:25:26       Uh, he wants it. He has a new name for it. Uh, uh, I think it's called Home Equity Protection Corporation. The almost the same idea. So ideas that were common that were new in the 1930s are being brought back, but we don't have to make the change. We're well in a sense. The other thing that happened is in 1934, uh, Congress set up the federal housing administration, Fha and the Fha is specifically aimed at, at guaranteeing loans, mortgages for low income people. And it was a vision that Roosevelt had to bring more and more people into owning homes in this country. The FHA went further than the HLC and they, they demanded that mortgages be 20 years also self amortizing. Okay. So this was, maybe it's more of a paternalistic role of government that came in. Then the government said that the private sector with these kinds of mortgages is not doing things right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       It's not planning for our future in the right way. Uh, and so they made the switch. It was really the government that made the switch from five year mortgages to the longterm mortgages. Now as today, the Standard Mormon, which would you would probably get when you buy your first house is not 15 or 20. It's 30 years. Well they just kept going up. The 30 year mortgage came in in the early 1950s, but it seems to have gotten stuck at 30 years. That's because, well, when you buy your first house, you might be 25 30 years brings you to age 55. That's close enough to retirement. I guess most people think 30 years is long enough. But that's the way mortgages go ever since. But we have to, what we've seen recently, we had more government intervention back then in the mortgage industry since the 1990s. We've seen a proliferation of new kinds of mortgages that uh, especially are offered to low income people buy certain lenders. Uh, so, um,

Speaker 4:          00:27:38       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       We've had a growth in popularity of arms, which are adjustable rate mortgages, adjustable rate mortgages have a long term. They might last for 30 years, but the interest rate is not fixed for the whole 30 years. So, uh, a typical arm is two and 28, which means that it has a low teaser rate for two years. A teaser

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       when they call it a and then rates that go up after two years and then tied to some other benchmark rate of interest, like the treasury bill rate. Uh, and so, uh, the, the problem is then that, uh, these were sold to low income people in many cases who didn't understand what they were getting and that the, after two years, the interest rate would reset up. Uh, so we would see resets after two years to a much higher level. And some of these people will discover that they can't afford them. Uh, and so we need, uh, and there's a lot of talk in Congress right now. Uh, we need to, uh, think about new regulations that protect individuals much like the regulations that the h o l c, uh, and the Fha made. But we have to do it again because the mortgage institutions, uh, have deteriorated somewhat.

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       There's a lot of anger about it. I know on Thursday, um, Angelo Mozilo who is a head of countrywide, which is one of the biggest mortgage lenders to low income people, it made a lot of subprime loans is being called before a house committee, uh, to testify. Uh, I want to try to watch it faster, but it's going to be interesting because there's a lot of anger about what's happened similar to the anger that we saw in the 1930s, uh, Ho hos see is no longer with us. It was actually set up as a temporary camp, uh, uh, corporation by the government. But, uh, it's, uh, the Fha is still with us and you know, we just had an Fha modernization act. Congress is starting to propel that forward, so it'll be a bigger part of our, uh, I wanted to say it a little bit about the math of, um, of, uh, mortgages.

Speaker 1:          00:30:13       The, uh, uh, typical the convention. I'm going to talk about the conventional 30 year mortgage, which has been a standard, uh, in the United States, uh, ever since the early 1950s. Uh, it's not a standard in most countries. Actually. I think it was partly the new deal legislation that made it very strong in the United States. In Canada. Uh, the mortgages tend to be shorter term. It's something like what we had in the 30s, although they have other institutions that protect home buyers, so they don't see, they don't see the, uh, the, um, the turmoil that we saw in the 1930s. But a typical home, um, uh, probably about it

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       30 year

Speaker 1:          00:31:10       mark. This is what most people get today. Uh, and that's, except for subprime, subprime borrowers seem to be the ones who are being really hit with new, new ideas. But if most people who are good Bowers, who know what they're doing, what these, they want a conventional 30 year mortgage because it will fix a mortgage payment for the rest of the 30 years. And you have nothing to worry about. If you can afford the mortgage payment, uh, then, uh, then you're, you're all set. You don't, you just pay it every month and then you just start paying at the end of 30 years. So, uh, if they quote the rate on the mortgage, uh, call that are, uh, traditionally you would be paid paying monthly. So if you do it in monthly terms, your interest rate is our over 12, because there's 12 months in a year. Okay. How did they figure out what the mortgage payment is? Uh, well, the, the mortgage balance, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:32:16       mortgage balance is equal to the mortgage payment times.

Speaker 1:          00:32:33       And now we just use the annuity formula, which is the formula that, uh, we've learned. Uh, again, I think we've seen it again and again, one all over the interest rate because are over 12 times one minus one over one plus r over 12 to the 12 t power where t is the term, uh, in years of the mortgage.

Speaker 4:          00:33:07       Okay. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       [inaudible], uh, I should maybe make this the same

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       to get my brackets right. All right. This is just the annuity formula. Remember, uh, what, what this equation merely says is that the present value of your remaining payments is always equal to the mortgage balance. Uh, and so this is how they actually compute the payments. Because, uh, you can take, if you want, if someone is borrowing, let's bring it up to today, they're borrowing $200,000. The median price of a home today is just over 200,000 in the u s so if, if it's an 80% mortgage, you would be borrowing a 160,000. Okay? So you'd have a 160 k here. Uh, and you know what this is whatever the mortgage rate is coated, you substituted into this formula and you find out what the square bracket thing is. And then to get the monthly payment, you take the square bracket and thing and you divide by, uh, the mortgage balance. And that's the monthly payment. That's how it's calculated. Um, so one peculiar property of this, incidentally, at every point of time this thing holds, this is time to maturity. This is, this is, um, years to go.

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       All right? And so 12 t would be the number of months to go before it ends. So at every point of time your mortgage balance is equal to your mortgage payment times that square bracket of thing where t is the amount of time you have left. So I suppose, um, you are uh, moving after five years, he took out a 30 year mortgage and you're moving after five years. When you first bought the house, they told you what the mortgage payment was and they're fixing that forever and ever for 30 years. So when you get, when you sell the house, what do they do? They go back to this formula. If you sold it after five years, then there's 25 years left. So 25 times 12 is a number of months left. They plugged that into this formula. The mortgage payment is, this was decided when you took out the mortgage.

Speaker 1:          00:35:28       So that never changes. They then figure out what your mortgage balance is. Okay. And then the deal is that when you sell the house, they subtract, you've got to pay this, they subtract this from the purchase price of the house, and then you've got the cash to go and buy another house. But that's how it works. Okay. It's very important to understand that the mortgage balance is, um, is recomputed according to this formula every month. And they will send you a statement showing how your mortgage balance is falling. Peculiar property of this is that the mortgage balance fall slowly at first and then it gradually picks up. It's just a property of this formula. When you first buy a house, most of your payment is going to interest, uh, your payment. Your mortgage payment is constant through time, but the fraction of it that goes to paying off principal versus interest changes through time and it just changes as dictated by this formula.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       And that's because at the end, if suppose you're one month or two months away from the payoff of the mortgage, you don't have any balance left. And so the interest that you're paying is hardly any balance left is very low. And so your payment is paying off principle. Uh, mostly, whereas at the beginning you're the, uh, the, the, the mortgage balance is dropping only very slowly because you've got a lot of interest to pay and your mortgage payment is constant. So, uh, that's funny. Property of, of conventional mortgages that the, the mortgage balance declines very slowly at fast first, and then it falls rapidly when it comes to maturity.

Speaker 4:          00:37:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       Okay. Um, okay. So I wanted to, um,

Speaker 1:          00:37:20       but just mentioned, I wanted to mention a couple of other institutions that are very important in real estate and that is, uh, fanny and Freddy, uh, in 1938 as part of the new deal, uh, I'll just write Fannie Mae, uh, 1938 under the Roosevelt administration in order to further work on the problem and housing, which was still troubling them, they created a government institution called federal, National Mortgage Corporation. Uh, and, uh, people on Wall Street found that difficult to say Federal National Mortgage Corporation. So they nicknamed at Fannie Mae, uh, it sounds like a woman's name. Uh, and so the idea was that they would help, uh, advanced the mortgage market by buying up mortgages from our mortgage originators, uh, and therefore allowing them to make more mortgages. Okay. So you would buy mortgages from originators.

Speaker 1:          00:38:29       What does an originator and originator is a company that lends money to hustled. Okay. So they, they raised money and then they landed artists, mortgages, the households, and then they deal with the households by having a local office and, uh, telling people, uh, what their balances and, and calling them up if they're not paying. And that sort of thing. Uh, where they were, that's a servicer is someone who might make a distinction between originator and service or the originator is the one who makes the loan. The servicer is someone who manages the paying of the loan. And Congress thought that these people could be given more money to operate if they, if someone would buy the mortgages from them. So Fannie Mae started doing that in 1938. Uh, and then the government created a second such, uh, uh, institution called, and they gave it a boy's name, some of the nickname, a boy's name, uh, with Freddie Mac. Uh, so the government created competitors, uh, and it privatized them so that both Fannie and Freddie became what are called GSEs. Uh, these are government sponsored enterprises.

Speaker 1:          00:39:55       Technically, Fannie and Freddie are private companies. They're traded stocks. You can buy shares in Fannie and Freddie. They're not part of the government, but they were created by the government and they are massive, uh, supporters of the housing market. So the general market assumes, and also the government still regulates them. Uh, it tells how there's a conforming loan limit that is a limit on how much fanny and Freddy, uh, how big a mortgage they can make to one homeowner. And it was just part of the new President Bush has planned to increase the conforming loan limits on Fannie and Freddie to allow them to lend at a higher price. So you can see the government is still involved in them while they're technically private companies. Now there are still thought to be related to the u s government. And so people are willing to lend to these organizations at low interest rates because they think there's an implicit government guarantee.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       There are critics of Fannie and Freddie who say the government guarantee it doesn't sound right because why is the government guaranteeing a private company? On the other hand, the government says it's not guaranteeing them, but then nobody believes the government when they say, because people say, surely the u s government is not going to allow Fannie and Freddie to fail. This is very important. Suddenly now with the housing crisis, and if you just saw the news yesterday, Fannie Mae is predicting where they are predicting that Fannie Mae is going to make huge losses, uh, in their latest earnings statement. Uh, and so, uh, it, it's still, they can make losses for a long time, uh, before they're in trouble. So presumably there won't be a problem, but in principle there could be. And so that's the kind of issue that we have now. Um, okay. I want her to talk about the current boom, and I have so much to say about this. Uh, but, uh, uh, let me see if I can.

Speaker 4:          00:42:06       MMM. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:26       this is a plot that I created for the second edition of my book, uh, irrational exuberance that shows the real estate market and the United States since 1890. Uh, and what is really significant. I created this plot, uh, just a couple of years ago in 2005. Uh, and uh, to my surprise, nobody had it before, created a 100 year long home price index, which seems surprising to me because a, the long history of home prices seems like a relevant fact. Uh, we want to know what markets do. A lot of people have the impression that home prices only go up, uh, and that there are a wonderful investment. So I thought we should try to find out what home prices have done. So I constructed a series of home price that's the red line. And the red line is, um,

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       you can see how it's a move through history. It has suddenly shot up in the, uh, in the latest year is this is since the late 1990s. So this, um, this behavior recently, uh, I think confirms that we are living in a very unusual time in the housing market. Uh, and it's going to put a lot of stress on us. The only other time we've seen a boom, like this was right after World War II, and that's this shown by this line here. Uh, but that wasn't as big. So after World War II, uh, there were two things that I think contributed to the huge housing boom at that time. One of them was that the US government had shut down the construction industry during the war. Uh, and so, uh, they didn't build any houses for close to five years. So obviously we had a shortage of housing. The other thing was the soldiers came back from World War II and they wanted families. They started something that you may have heard of called the baby boom. Uh, and so the birth rate shot way up, uh, and so everyone wanted a home with one bedroom wasn't good enough anymore. They wanted, you don't want the baby in the same room with you, right? You want to have two bedrooms, um, you might even want two bathrooms. So, uh, uh, the demand for housing went up, but the, but the current boom is different because there was nothing like that happening. Uh, and so,

Speaker 2:          00:44:54       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:55       it's strange. Uh, the question is what caused the current boom. I have some other data has shown here. The Green Line is the building costs. Uh, and uh, you can see that building costs since 1890 in realtor, everything is corrected for inflation. Building costs have gone up a little bit since 1890, but not a whole lot. And in fact, for the last step, this is the engineering news record building costs index. It's an index used by people in the construction industry since around 1980. The building costs have been falling. Uh, that I think is partly because the biggest single component of building costs is labor. And, uh, as you know, income inequality is getting worse. Uh, low income wages are not going up. Uh, and so, uh, that component of housing has been declining in real terms. The other components are not doing much.

Speaker 2:          00:45:52       Uh, so, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       the other thing I have down is population or the population of the u s has been pretty steady, right? That pink line, it looks awfully steady and I have interest rates. Now are a lot of people talk about interest rates. I was just reading Alan Greenspan's new book, the age of turbulence, and if you saw this, it came out last year and he said he didn't think there was a bubble. I don't know how he can think, not think there was above him. He didn't see it. Uh, and is honest. He's, he said maybe froth in the real estate market, but not a bubble. Uh, but anyway, I was reading, well, why didn't you think there's a bubble? And he said, well, part of the reason is interest rates were coming down and if interest rates are coming down, as you can see, they are, that means the rate of discount is going down and the present value formula. So ash asset prices should go up.

Speaker 2:          00:46:41       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       I guess that's plaza. It doesn't match up very well though, because interest rates have been going down since 1980 and the, and the room is very sudden. So it seems to me that Greenspan should have seen this bubble coming.

Speaker 2:          00:46:54       Uh, uh, so

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       what causes that? That's the, um, uh, I wanted to show you one city that, that I actually do it. There's a short comparison between a couple of cities, uh, Los Angeles and Milwaukee. Who is there anyone here from Los Angeles? How are we got a good number. What about Milwaukee?

Speaker 1:          00:47:17       Nobody from Milwaukee. Um, I might be insulting Milwaukeeans when I talk about the, not really no walkie. Is there someone up there? Yeah. Huh. Um, so, uh, Milwaukeeans are, um, uh, much more stable than this is actually prays for loss ever for Milwaukee. It's not, not the, um, Milwaukee ends are much more stable than Angelenos I guess you call them, right? Los Angeles resident. Look what the housing, the Blue Line shows what home prices in real terms have done two in Los Angeles, uh, uh, over the last 30 years. When you compare Norwalk, you look at that. Isn't that amazing? Milwaukee has been extremely steady over this period. Uh, so one theory is that, well, it's because people say I'm going back to Los Angeles. The problem with Los Angeles is that they've had a unsteady employment and unemployment. Uh, if, if they, if the economy is sagging, then the Los Angeles housing prices will respond.

Speaker 1:          00:48:24       Well. You can see the pink line shows the employment in Los Angeles. Uh, and indeed it did move around corresponding to the booms and busts in the Los Angeles market, but not so dramatically. And if you look at Milwaukee, the unemployment, the employment figures don't look that much different than Los Angeles. Uh, what's different? There's something about Los Angeles that's different from Milwaukee, and that is that in Los Angeles there's just a history of volatile markets. Uh, and, um, I wanted to try and figure out why, what, you know, Milwaukee, the reason we picked these two, these two cities, we asked realtors or Carl Case is my colleague, he teaches at Wellesley College. Uh, it, back in 1988 when we started this study, we asked realtors around the country, what is the hottest market in the United States? Uh, and they say, oh, that's Los Angeles. Uh, or maybe Anaheim, which is where it right outside.

Speaker 1:          00:49:22       Um, and then we say, what's the, the dentist market and United States, there wasn't as much agreement on that, but one of the names suggested was Milwaukee. Nothing has ever happened there in terms of real estate. Uh, now I think that ultimately, uh, you know, interestingly enough, Los Angeles had a real estate boom and bust in the 1880s. Uh, that's hard to believe. There was a huge boom in real estate prices in La, in it peaked in 1886 and then a crash. Now you might think, uh, that's a long time ago. 1886. Isn't that when the cowboys and Indians were out there in the old west and the covered wagons and uh, well that's right. But there was a real estate boom, uh, in Los Angeles. And so I went back and studied this. Boom. It rather extensively, uh, by, uh, there's one book written about, there's also the La Times, which you can get now online with no problem from the pier. You can read every day's newspaper. And it turns out I was talking about what in La and

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       the 1880s, they're a view arose that Los Angeles was just the most wonderful place on earth. The climate out there is beautiful, especially feel that on a winter's day like today, you might wish you were in some of you, you might wish you were there. Uh, but it wasn't just California because California was a huge state, right, with all kinds of, but mostly empty land. People somehow got the idea that Los Angeles is just this wonderful city and so they started built bidding up real estate prices. You can explain that to me. Some of it from Los Angeles. Uh, it turned out to be kind of wrong because in the 1880s they started building so many houses in response to the demand that there was eventually a crash. But somehow people get this idea at some time. So we compared loss and we couldn't go back in a time machine and do questionnaires, surveys, and the 1880s but we could do it in the 1980s.

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       So a case, and I did identical questionnaire is in Los Angeles and Milwaukee. Uh, and these are median price expectations in 1988 when there was a boom in California, but of course not in Milwaukee, the average person in Los Angeles thought home prices would go up 10% a year for the next 10 years. That's the median, I'm sorry. Uh, 10% a year is a pretty fast appreciation and if it goes on for 10 years, that means that the oil double in seven years. So it'd be going up like two and a half fold. Um, that was quite an a nice expectation. If you compare that with Milwaukee, they thought only 4%, which is about the inflation rate. So there was something different between Los Angeles and Milwaukee. The Los Angeles people had extravagantly high expectations. We saw it again in 2003, uh, when people in Los Angeles expected 8% appreciation every year, uh, it's coming down now in 2006 they're gradually coming down as the, as the boom unwind.

Speaker 1:          00:52:34       But you notice no walkie is going up. I think what's happening is that we're becoming more national and Milwaukeeans are starting to think more like Angelenos, uh, that it's one boom. And so they start to expect it to happen in Milwaukee. So Las Angeles in Milwaukee, we're tied in 2006 where their expectations, this is the boom. Uh, people had great fear of being left out of the real estate market. I think the boom was driven by fear. So in 1988, we asked people in Los Angeles, uh, are you worried? Unless I buy now, I won't be able to afford a house in the future. We had 80% agreement with that in Los Angeles. So people were really worried. Uh, in Milwaukee it was only 27%. Uh, you kind of wonder how can it be that the people had such different, depending on which city they lived in. Well, I can kind of explain it that there's a couple of factors.

Speaker 1:          00:53:30       One is in 1988, home prices were rising rapidly in Los Angeles, not so in Milwaukee. So people were just extrapolating the price increase. But the other thing is that Los Angeles just has this sense of its own glamor and excitement that, uh, you know, it is the home of movie stars. What, what city is more glamorous, or Beverly Hills is part of Los Angeles, right? And it's the most expensive city in the u s uh, so this sense, this glamour thinking along with price increases because the Los Angeles to boom, so it's the boom. He asked us city, we ask people whether they had a perception of excitement, uh, directly. And in Los Angeles in 1988, 54% said yes. Whereas in Milwaukee, only 21% said yes. Um, but as you know, as the years go by, you notice that Milwaukee is starting to look more and more like Los Angeles. Uh, uh, Alan Greenspan in his book says that he thinks housing markets are all local.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       And there is no, he says this firmly in his book, there is no national housing market. Uh, but in fact, it's becoming more national because Milwaukeeans no longer think that they are some kind of outpost. It's unrelated to the excitement of a glamorous cities. They see it happening at home as well. So, um, now I wanted to compare it with another question that, uh, people have this simple idea that there's a best investment. This is about the stock market, but I asked a number of, uh, uh, this I've been doing since 1996. Do you agree with the following statement? The stock market is the best investment for longterm holders who can just buy and hold through the ups and downs of the market. Uh, I only started asking this in 1996 when the stock market boom was well underway, but already 69% of my respondents who were high income investors, uh, strongly agreed.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       That percent grew to the peak of the market. In 1,999, after the peak in 2000, it began to fall. So we see what happens is that when the markets, people are chasing past returns, when the stock market is going up, they think that they increasingly think that the stock market is just the best investment until when it starts falling, then they start retracting from that. Uh, or I didn't have what happened? I lost it. Uh, the, um, what is going on here? Oh, uh, okay. Where were we? So, um, uh, we see the same thing in real estate. Uh, and the percent who think it's the best investment is higher in Los Angeles then in Milwaukee. And since the peak of the bubble in 2003, it's been declining in Los Angeles, but surprisingly rising in Milwaukee. Uh, and so they've almost come, well, they pretty much converged in 2006.

Speaker 1:          00:56:37       So the lesson is that I think that we have a glamorous city phenomenon that excitement about real estate prices, uh, centered in places like Los Angeles, but it's spreading and becoming more and more of a national phenomenon. And that's the bubble. Uh, part of this is the, uh, uh, it's not loan to value ratio. This is the ratio of mortgage debt to personal consumption expenditure. Uh, over the boom period, we've been seeing a gradual uptrend just as loan to value ratios were only 60% in the 1920s. Now they're up to 90% of our 100%. Um, we were much more willing to take risks on mortgages. People are also borrowing much more. So you can see that in the early 1950s, mortgage debt was only something like 25% of a personal consumption expenditure, but now it's up to about 100%. So we're much more expansive in mortgage financing.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       And we were, I put this chart out to just show the international aspect of home prices. Uh, they're here. The Blue Line is the case Shiller home price index for a Greater Boston. Uh, and the red line is the Halifax a home price index for greater London. We're talking UK now and they're both deflated by, uh, a consumer price index or in the case of the UK, the retail price index to give us a real home price. Isn't it striking how similar London and Boston are? They both had dramatic booms. Uh, the, the London boom of the late 19 days is really something. Look at that. It went up. Peak suddenly turned around, came all the way back down. I don't know what the, uh, and then it kind of waffled around in London. And then it shot up even higher. And now look what's happened. This is the latest quarter.

Speaker 1:          00:58:31       It's starting to fall rapidly. Uh, so just a couple of months ago, London seemed to be sorry. And now suddenly there's this pessimistic atmos. Well, cause we don't know what's going to happen in London. Look how it, it fell in 2004, there was this sharp drop and most people thought that the housing boom was over. But then it went up again. Uh, and so, uh, to a new peak, uh, in 2007 we have an international crisis. This is another couple of countries. I managed to find a price indexes for Norway and Netherlands going back to 1890. And compared that with the u s we're seeing a similar pattern in all three of these countries. These are the only countries that I've been able to find that have high quality, uh, repeat sales price index is going back a hundred years. You can see that in all these countries, real estate prices didn't show much trend until recently.

Speaker 1:          00:59:28       And now they all have real estate booms. So we have an international real estate book. Why is that? Why would we have an international boom? Uh, I talked about this in the book. You have irrational exuberance, uh, and I let you read that and that, uh, summarize it here. But a part of the reason I think is globalization is creating a global culture and the excitement and enthusiasm that we once saw in isolated cities like Los Angeles, uh, are spreading out and they're seeing more and more around the world. And it's tied in with our sense of rapid economic growth. We're living in an era of excited economic optimism. And so it's feeding into home prices, uh, in the U S in Europe, in China, in Korea, in India, in South Africa, uh, uh, Australia and New Zealand. Lots and lots of places have seen home price boom. And I think it's, it's the, it's not anything unique to any one country that explains it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       It's, it's the psychology. I think this is a residential investment in the United States as a fraction of GDP. A, and I have it shown with, um, the, uh, uh, the vertical lines on this chart are recession's indicate recession's a and this shows, okay, this is from 1948 to 2007. And every recession that we've had since 1948 is shown. For example, we had a recession that started here. Uh, I believe that was 48 and then it ended in 49. And then we had another recession that began in 1953. That's that line. And it ended in 54. Uh, and so on. The most recent recession we've had is a 2001 it began and ended in the same year. 2001 we may be in a recession. Now, a lot of people are saying that. So I, I would be tempted to draw a new line here somewhere around here, maybe December of 2007.

Speaker 1:          01:01:39       Uh, but the National Bureau of economic research who announces recession dates hasn't announced yet whether there's a recession. So we'll probably find out in a few more months whether we're already in a recession. I suspect we are. Now, the interesting thing is the, the Green Line here is the expenditure on real estate, uh, investment. What does that mean? There's three main components. One is building new houses, another one is building new apartment buildings. That's commercial instead of, oh, but it's still adding to the housing stock. And the third one is improvements of existing houses people, but new additions are, are they redo the kitchen and bathroom and whatever. Uh, so we add all that up and that's residential investment. You can see that residential investment as a fraction of GDP has been very variable through history, uh, of the United States since, uh, since World War II. Uh, and that it has had a strong relationship with recession's.

Speaker 1:          01:02:42       Uh, so, um, you can see what a residential investment has done recently. Uh, we had a huge peak in residential investment, uh, and the peak was a, a couple of years ago, uh, I believe, uh, 2006, uh, or there abouts, uh, and at the level of residential investment was the highest. It has been since 1951. And that's over here. That's the only time since World War II that we've had a higher level of residential investment. Even 1951 was a very unusual year. Uh, I'll tell you why because we were getting into the Korean War and, uh, the people remembered that during World War II, the u s government shutdown the housing market. They said no more new houses to be built. So everyone thought are in fact, they were talking about world war three. There were really scared. You don't remember how awful it looked because the US was proposing to invade Korea and then the Soviet Union and China were being very angry and we thought we'd be in some war with communist China.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       Ours, some awful war. People got really scared. Uh, but one thing they did is they want, this was the baby boom. They just got back from World War II. They didn't want another, they wanted to live a normal life. They wanted to have kids, and then this terrible war was coming. They thought, uh, and so they, they rushed and bought houses. So everyone was scrambling to get a house before they shut down the housing market. It turns out that it didn't turn into world war three. Uh, and, uh, maybe they did shut down the house. They must've curtailed it. Uh, but it, it created that book. But what's causing this boom here? It's almost as big as the 1951. Boom. Well, the answer is, uh, high prices. I believe we had this huge bubble in home prices and it pushed prices up to extraordinary levels. What does that do to builders?

Speaker 1:          01:04:52       Well, builders can sell for a really high price, and so they start building a lot of houses. They will do it, uh, as, as long as the home prices high relative to their construction costs. So we've seen a boom in building in the United States that is at a record level, uh, except for that one Korean War, a blip. Uh, and so I think it's, it's an APP. It's a highly abnormal situation that we've been in. Um, and uh, but now look how suddenly in sharply it's correcting downward. Why is it correcting downward? Well, that's because the housing market is now in decline. And, and so when the housing market is in decline, the ability to sell houses drops dramatically. So builders, we're doing extremely well. Until a couple of years ago, their stock was soaring. Now all of a sudden they're in crisis. Uh, and well, it's no surprise. This is what a housing bubble does.

Speaker 1:          01:05:50       And I have, I think, uh, maybe, uh, you can see various side, this is the growth rate of home prices. Actually, I should update this. This is now tip negative. Uh, the peak. This is the case Shiller 10 city index. Uh, housing permits have dropped way off, uh, because of course they're not building homes anyway, this shows a law, a strong seasonality. And then a dropoff, uh, since the 2006, and his, my last slide, uh, the National Association of Home Builders, uh, surveys its membership to ask them what is the traffic of homebuyers, uh, w what they mean by that is if you're a builder and you have this, a place where you show off your model homes, how many people are coming by to look at your model homes today, uh, as put potential buyers. The Blue Line is the traffic of home buyers. You can see that it has reached the lowest level ever.

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       It has dropped precipitously and you note that the pink line, which shows the, uh, the rate of growth of home prices, the rate of growth of home prices has fallen just right along with the traffic of home buyers. So I think it's pretty clear what's happening. People saw the rising home prices, they thought they would rise forever. They were flocking in trying to get into the homeless housing market before it w it out, priced them, and now suddenly the word is out. It's falling. So suddenly they don't want these homes. So the inventory of unsold homes has shot up. Builders can't sell them and prices are falling. That's a situation where, and we'll talk more about this very interesting situation because it, it ties in with so many other aspects of financial markets.
