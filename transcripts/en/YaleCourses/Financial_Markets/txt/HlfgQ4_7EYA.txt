Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Uh, if we can begin today, we have a very special lecture. I'm very pleased to introduce Carl Icahn as our lecturer. Uh, Mr icon has a career that is really, uh, relevant to some of the topics we've talked about in this course. Uh, one theme we've talked about in this course is corporate democracy. And we've talked about a book written by Burl and means who said that shareholders are so dispersed that they have really no control over a company. And boards of directors are self perpetuating. Well, Carl Icahn has made a career of, uh, of really opposing that tendency in American business. Uh, Carl Icahn graduated from Princeton University premed in 1957, a in 1968, he founded icon and company. Uh, and this company icon and company has taken substantial shareholder positions in a number of major corporations including Rjr, Nabisco, Twa, Texaco, Phillips Petroleum, Time Warner, a Motorola, uh, and when, uh, icon and company takes a position in a company, it then becomes active in the management of this company and in changing the way they do business. And they've done this with enormous success. So, uh, Carl, I'm very pleased that you could come and do this today.

Speaker 2:          01:37          See you, Bob.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Uh, it would be really nice if you could give some clues to our students here who are themselves launching out on careers of, uh, how you got started in this and what your philosophy is and what you would recommend to them. The

Speaker 2:          01:51          recovery or you're asking about. I went down to Wall Street back in way back in the 60s, and I thought I was really, uh, I had gone to Princeton, a really good school and um, and uh, uh, I had gotten in there from a top high school. I was the first to go for my high school. Nobody believed I right. They never took an ivy league. The Ivy League never took anybody from this school I went to. But, uh, anyway, I went, got in and uh, left there and I thought I was real smart guy caught a shot, went down to Wall Street and a, worked with Jack Dryfus and I was playing the market and 1961 and shows how old. And, uh, in a, in a bull market, you make a great deal of money by doing leverage. It's a little bit like today with all the leverage that we had and now might be coming to fruition.

Speaker 2:          02:46          But, uh, I was, I was borrowing money and bought all these, could have hurdle of those and I thought I was a genius and Jack Drivers said, you're going to lose all your money. I had made a few bucks playing poker and that's how I started about eight, $10,000. And I made all this money by borrowing at 90% and I would go out and make it a lot more in until weeks. So my father made it and two years and, uh, I saw father said, well, you know, put some money away. I said, no, Dad, I'm going to really make a fortune here. But I went out. I remember once I bought a Galaxie convertible, then it was a beautiful car. I had a beautiful girlfriend. It was a model. It was pretty nice. But uh, but uh, uh, what happened, the crash came in 1962.

Speaker 2:          03:40          I was wiped out in one day. I didn't even have the poker winnings lap. And I tell you, I can't recall, that's a call left first. So the girl left first, but it was pretty, it was pretty close. Maybe just think day, maybe the same day actually. And um, after that I learned and you have to learn something and uh, I became an expert in options and um, after that I built a following and built a big, uh, a big following and a big commission base by yeah, just learning one area very well. Probably I knew that area better than almost anyone on Wall Street to, not to sound too presumptuous, but very few people knew it, so it doesn't mean very much. But in any event, I will build up a big following in 68 boards, the seat on the stock exchange with the help of, uh, one of my uncles and I time I saved a pretty big amount of money for those days.

Speaker 2:          04:35          And then, uh, I got into arbitrage but not merger. Botified and that's something else you could learn where you can, where you can do it. You still do it today, but it's much tougher with all these computers. So I don't do it because I don't understand the computers they'd beyond me. So, uh, I don't, I don't work with them to, well like being a little facetious but not too fussy. So you could buy different convertible bonds and short the stocks against them. You had no risk but you could make a lot of money. And eventually we did real well with that and what I do today. So it's pretty much the same idea. You buy stocks in a company that is cheap and, and you look at the asset value of the companies that you buy the stocks in and it becomes a little more complex.

Speaker 2:          05:25          But basically you look for the reason that they're there. They're really cheap. And the major reason is often and usually a very poor management. So in a sense it's like an arbitrage can go in, you buy a lot of stock in a company and you then try to make changes at the company. Today. If you read the newspapers tomorrow, you'll read them. We're trying to do the same thing at Motorola. And if you bothered to read the Wall Street Journal tomorrow, or maybe the times, I don't know, you'll see a little bit of what we're to do there. We're trying to get them to change the structure of the company. We think the board is very, is very poor board there. And uh, we're trying to change what happens. The other thing about corporate America, a few people that go to college where you are now and, and, and most people in America don't realize how, how poorly most of our companies are run in this country.

Speaker 2:          06:28          Uh, with many exceptions. There's, they're really very poor. And when you get inside the companies, you realize that. And, and the real reason is there's no accountability. There's no corporate democracy. And I've been staying in that, proselytizing it, writing about it. And the reason that we can make so much money when we go into one of these is, I'm not even a manager. I never took a course in management. And, uh, uh, I wouldn't profess to really know much, but I don't micromanage. I put in a very good manager, they cut the heck out of a cost, but they changed the structure of the companies. And this is the problem in American today in my opinion, that we are basically under managed. We can't compete because the best and the brightest don't get to be at the top of the corporate ladder. And I, I was sort of a metaphor that's a little facetious, but not completely about it.

Speaker 2:          07:27          I call it anti Darwinian. It's anti Darwinian in American's corporations and that means the guy goes to college and did this and this, the guy that gets to be the CEO and he's in college and he's the kind of guy that, you know, was the president of the fraternity. Now all these presidents of fraternities aren't bad guys, but basically the normal guy that I remembered it college was, he's always there at the fraternity or the Ed club and he's always had to be there. If you have a bad day, you walk over to the club and get feeling bad, your girlfriend left, you did bad on a test score or whatever and you go over there. He's always there, buys you a drag and you sit around with him. He commiserates with, yeah, you play a little pool or whatever and he tells you whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          08:19          Yeah, by girl left me all, they're all no good. Usual conversation back and forth. And what would happen would be your life again. You can't help it. Like if you do, just to wonder a little bit when the hell did he ever do any work. But you know, he was always there for him and he never made money waves. He was never said anything too obtrusive or we never show too much intelligence. But he was a good guy. He goes, that same guy goes out into corporate America and he, he politically, he's a student. He knows how to get along with you. And he never really rocks the boat. He never comes up with any great ideas. He's not a threat to a superior. And as a result, he moves up the ladder because we, because they're really in corporate America, there's really very little accountability.

Speaker 2:          09:17          And what happens in corporate America, he moves up that ladder. There's a good show how to succeed in business. That was ag many years ago. That sort of sums it up. You know, if you say if a genius has an idea or in corporate America that junior has an idea, the next idea is to give them an idea to resign. And so he moves along the ladder and he gets to it and he gets up slowly up to the top, I guess too. He has to a attribute fees likable, he's politically astute and he used this survivor and he knows when he's threatened and it gets to the top. And this is the attributes of today's CEOs for the most part with exceptions. So you know, he doesn't ruffle feathers, he doesn't get the board of upset. And as he moves up the ladder, he finally gets to be number two to the CEO.

Speaker 2:          10:14          Now the CEO is the same as the same attributes where he doesn't want to be threatened and it's violent. So the CEO will never let anybody be number two who's smarter than he is. So by definition, this the assistant of the CEO, there's a little dumber than the CEO. Now there's this guy now is the assistant. The board likes the CEO eventually retires and they make this guy, the CEO, the fraternity president would talk in a bit. Now he's the, he's now the head guy to see him and he'll bring in a number two guy that's a little dumber than he is because he doesn't want to be threatened. So by definition will be run by morons. I wouldn't pretty soon, and we're not too far from that right now, but I'm not from that point in, in, in our economic history. And so this is a problem that we have now.

Speaker 2:          11:12          We've been able to do okay in this country in pretty well, even with the fact that were badly managed because over the last 20 years we've had a pretty free prewrite we've gotten from all over the world. The whole global economy has been booming and we've been able to get cheap goods. And these cheap goods kept us from having inflation. So very simply put, if you don't have inflation, it's easy for the Federal Reserve to keep pumping money into an economy. So they, so money kept flowing you and he was throwing up at a punch ball. The country was at a party and we kept drinking from this punchbowl enjoying and the rest of the world would take out dollars. They would take our dollars cause everybody thought, oh America, you know, it's great. It's a little bit like it came from some town, you know, and, and, and there's one family in the town that, you know, doesn't do much work, sort of probably goods, raw wire around the pool, how fun party and a lot of the big cars and have the, the good times and the rest of the time works hard, you know, and the farms or wherever they are and they keep bringing stuff to this.

Speaker 2:          12:24          Rich families have stayed, you know, they give them whatever they want. They give him food, they give them slowly. But you know, anything in the Bloomberg family just gives him IOUs and they keep taking the [inaudible]. So the rich family, does it do anything, just lie around the pool and have fun and travel or whatever and they're, everybody's working well. One day, a few of these people are gonna say, I don't want your IOUs anymore. You know, what the hell am I going to take your eye on users? Worthless cause you to go, you know you lost all your money. Well I country think about it is a bit of not situation we've been given our audio use, which are dollar bills to the rest of the world and taking that cheap goods. However, we're reaching a point now where the dollar as you've been reading, if you're, if you're, if you're attuned to it, the dollar's devaluating as we speak.

Speaker 2:          13:10          And we got a, I believe a real problem on our hands and the economy. The other thing we've done in the last five, 10 years, and I know Bob I'm sure has been talking to you about this, there's housing. Housing is like tulip bulbs off they, they got, you know, there was a big crisis in Holland in the 16 hundreds on tool of bows. And I like reading about these crises. It cause everybody bought or what tool of us, one of the greatest. The one guy looks and says, Hey, what the hell am I doing with is to have both. And all of a sudden he got a crisis. Well, and I'm not going to get into the depth of it, but banks, because they wanted to make more and more money and our investment banks, Wall Street kept issuing different paper against mortgages. So it made it simple to give a mortgage.

Speaker 2:          14:00          So these mortgages were given out to people that couldn't afford them. And today you have what you call subprime mortgages, subprime paper. They issued against his favorite stuff, go a mortgage back security. They securitize them. And these things are all floating around out and there's maybe about $3 trillion worth of stuff I'm in all day mortgage out there. Well, as you've seen, these haven't produced prices of confidence and I don't think we've heard the last of, and the government sort of bailed out of the situation. But I have a JP Morgan takeover, bear Stearns, and when I'm not going to get an a depth of it here, but it's a real fascinating story. In any event, we have a problem of, of, of problems in our economy. And, uh, I think that, uh, we are going to see more of these problems and the next year or so I think, uh, Bob and talk to you more about what's going to happen in housing.

Speaker 2:          15:04          But a lot of it depends on that because if, if you can't have your housing prices go back up, a lot of these pay, a lot of the people that bought them can't afford to pay the mortgages, nor would they want to. If they see the homes go down in value, they are going to just say, oh, they're going to walk away. Now if that happens, these homes, other collaterals and the banks for all these mortgages and we're going to have and probably do have already a recession. And that recession could become a lot more cute because today, uh, and I'm not going to go, I'm just gonna open it for questions soon. But today there is fixed trillion dollars more of debt in this economy that I believe that can sustain because everyone in the middle, the middle class and the went on a borrowed, we'd been shoulder the last few years to buy these homes.

Speaker 2:          16:06          It's a buy for any, you know, with the credit cards and go buy anything they felt like buying. And as a result, I'm not certain that they can pay that 6 trillion back, but even if they can, they're not going to be willing to go buy, uh, they're not going to be willing to go buy uh, more things. So as you, as you have that happening and you have an inflation, the earnings of our corporations will go down and they estimate, I've talked to one or two very, a good economist in the last few weeks. They estimate that earnings of the s and p averages will go down about 20% of the next year. With that, the stock market is at a, I would say a precipice. You don't know which way it's going to go. So, with all that said, you have to worry about about all these things. And I know you're studying this and you're learning about it, but I think there'll be great opportunities ahead for it.

Speaker 2:          17:06          It did. And the ability for Wall Street who again to girl dies and buy a lot of, uh, a lot of these companies, if you have capitals, you'll be able to buy these vibes. So I do tell you that I think Wall Street is certainly a good area. If you thinking about a career, I still think it's a very good area, but I, you know, I'm not going to tell you if you love to writer, you'll love to play the cello to go and come to Wall Street. But, but I do think it's a good career. I think it makes sense.

Speaker 2:          17:41          I think that corporate America is learnings from this and I think we're going to make our top management much more accountable in the years ahead. There were tremendous abuses of corporate America. Today, a year CEO, I'll make school a hundred times the what? The average worker mate. And he's just simply not worth it. And the reason you have this is that you, you have no accountability. That shell, the simply don't vote. They don't care about voting. And as the whole reason for that, you like you'll have an incident as dean relation with the owners of a lot about stocks, which are the mutual funds and institutions that don't like to vote against these managers. However, someone like myself and a few other activists do get a vote now and we do get a proxy fight going and we'll see, for instance, what happens in Motorola's that we're doing as we speak.

Speaker 2:          18:38          And I think that that will give an opportunity for young people like yourselves to get into corporations in our country. And while I think Princeton is the, might be a little better than Yale, I think yellow is a good school. And I think that all of you are, are, uh, are really, uh, probably the top, top, top of, of, of the, of the, uh, of the, uh, student body in this country and going ahead in your lives. I think that the corporations might be a good blood place to look what, or Wall Street for that matter, because I think there's going to be a need for bright people and, and I think that you'll be able to be rewarded for it in the fact that there will be accountability again. Well that, well, when I say again, it never really was accountability. So I think there will be, uh, too, like food, corporate democracy will have to evolve so that we can become competitive with the rest of the world again. So with that, I'll just basically, I think Bob this, leave it open to questions and see if anybody has any comments.

Speaker 3:          19:57          ECON, you were mentioned in, uh, 1962, you kind of blew up, uh, after that, uh, entire tobacco and sued. Uh, did. Uh, how did you regain your confidence? And I guess most importantly, how did you regain or gain the confidence of a future investors?

Speaker 2:          20:21          Well, you're asking a few questions. I mean, how did gain competence? I don't think I have a lot of confidence in my ability to understand what was going on. I just learned that you have to really, really work at something and understand it. And little by little, I mean it, what sort of interest and I'm a sort of obsessive guy and I work real hard all my life. I really get it just topping and I really delve into it. And what I came up with was, uh, a letter there at that time, the people who stole these options that were wealthy people across the country. And it's sort of interesting that it's not around today, but they would sell options, calls on the stock. So if you, so if the, if, if you're, uh, uh, uh, someone who traded the market, you'd like to buy an option on Xyz stock and wealthier people across the country would spell these options.

Speaker 2:          21:19          We give you the right today, you have the CPOA, you know, it's much more computerized. But then he would do it in the, over the counter transactions. And I was really one of the first to come in and say to people across the country rather than to do it with your broker who doesn't really understand this business, rather than sell it, sell it with my teammates. I was a broker, is telling me, and little by little people actually answered my ads, I would put it out of an ad and say, get to get to see what the true prices are and what the real value should be for that option that you're selling through Merrill Lynch who sell them with nation those days or whoever. And we, I get letters from all over the country and literally I'd stay down at Wall Street till midnight calling people in California that would write in for this, uh, for this letter.

Speaker 2:          22:07          And we built up a big following because I was really, uh, the risk of being modest, the only real honest guy in that business because everybody, I mean, not that they were dishonest, but you know, the brokers didn't care and they get business back from who you sell it to. I'm not saying that we did anything, you know, criminal or I'd say, but nobody really cares to get the right price for these people. And, and, and so by getting them the right price, they would stay with me as customers for years and years. So we, we, uh, uh, you know, built it up and built it up. And then I got one assistant, then I got another assistant and I, and I kept, and I kept moving up the ladder, but it took a lot of hard work and perseverance and that's really where it went to from there was arbitrage. And now what I do. What was the second part of your question? I forgot.

Speaker 3:          22:58          How did you regain confidence in your investors and people who gave money to you? Uh, did you feel confident that you could give, get them to give you money after you had a kind of wash yourself out?

Speaker 2:          23:12          Well No, I told you that, that we have that letter and that we were able to, uh, we were, we were able to amp to the letter, have the, I don't know if he heard me because like I was talking to telling you that we, uh, we, we, we put the letter out and then we just gave him a good, uh, but the thing, yeah.

Speaker 3:          23:33          Okay. All right. How are you? Hi, I'm mark [inaudible] or how are you, I actually have three questions for you, but, um, I'll start

Speaker 4:          23:46          with the first one. I watched the 60 minutes special on you recently and they try to portray that there'd been kind of an evolution in your career. Uh, they showed some bad press from the 80s with the TWA deal and then they showed some good press recently with the so called icon uplift and some of the political, I mean the, um, uh, corporate activism that you've been engaged in. And in that interview you sort of insisted that you hadn't changed at all. And I was just curious if you had changed and he didn't want to tell a reporter or if the media was giving you a bad rap,

Speaker 2:          24:23          why can't hear the whole question, but I haven't changed. I haven't changed it off. They call me, they call me to call you an activist, you know, I mean, I haven't really, uh, I think what we do though is very, uh, it's very, uh, helpful to all investors. I mean, I think that's the point because when we get into the company, the stock goes up for everybody. So it really works out. But, uh, but I've never changed what I do.

Speaker 5:          24:54          Okay.

Speaker 4:          24:55          Okay. Uh, actually I had two more questions. Um, the second question was about China and there was a special report in the recent economist talking about the, a ravenous appetite the China has for national resources right now. And I was curious what you thought the, the effect that would have on global financial markets and your investing strategy.

Speaker 5:          25:19          Okay.

Speaker 2:          25:21          Well, yeah, I mean, giant shiner is, is, uh, is the great fire of, of, of low, of, of these commodities. The trouble with this country is we don't, we don't have a lot of that. We don't have a lot of natural resources. So sell them hanging in the question really what this country does, we make software, we make technology. We were in innovative, but so are they. So what we really have to do is become a lot more productive and we have to make our companies a lot more competitive. And today I feel we're losing that Ed. So while China is going to continue to buy things, it doesn't mean they're going to buy them from us. And that's a fairly, even though the dollar has gone down a great deal.

Speaker 4:          26:12          Thank you. Uh, this is my last question. Um, New York Times columnist, David Brooks gave a great commencement speech last year at wake forest and he said he was, uh, a journalist who led a boring life and observed interesting lives, uh, people like you. And I was curious. Um, you mentioned that a lot of the great people that he'd met, successful people, um, had lots of pictures of dead people on the walls. Uh, meaning that they had conversations. He said famous people on pictures of themselves on the wall, truly famous people at pictures of dead people on the walls. And I was curious if you had any pictures of great historical figures or what historical figures inspired you or influenced you on a regular basis?

Speaker 2:          26:58          Good question. I, uh, well one of the greatest, uh, lots of his I ever read was Aristotle Nica and ethics. If you read it and make a, a great, uh, a great deal of stance where you live with this golden mean, but at the end, use your intellect. I mean, now you have to really read them in depth to understand what he's saying. And then, um, and then there's a poem by Roger Kipling. And I like if I'm sure a lot of you read it, you know, if you can keep your head about you and we'll lose him as I read that every once in a while and, uh, in the code that we follow, that's really important to be able to meet with triumph and disaster. You know, and not let either of those imposters treat those imposters just the same meaning that if you're doing great, don't think you're a genius than if you're doing badly.

Speaker 2:          27:59          Don't think the world comes to an end. And if you work hard, if you work hard, maybe south drive, but if you worked on, and don't let your ego get ahead of you with so many people do when you're doing well, and don't let yourself become too despondent. If you're not doing well for awhile, then I have faith in your own ability, uh, and, and, and, and really work hard at whatever you do. Give it everything you have. Whether if you can do all that, I think the chances are that you're gonna hit a lucky streak. He goes, luck comes and goes. If you have your health, what comes and goes. And uh, realized when you, when you're doing really well that it's not just you and then when you're not, it's not just you either. So I think that kind of thing. You should read that poem.

Speaker 4:          28:54          I like the line where it's, if you can be in a crowd but not lose the common touch, that's fine.

Speaker 2:          28:59          That's right. That's right. If you could walk in a crowd and still not lose, but if you can walk with kings and that moves the common. Yeah. Okay. Yup. I've never walked with Kenzo so I don't have to worry about losing the common touch cause I'm not walking with him.

Speaker 5:          29:19          Hmm.

Speaker 4:          29:21          Hi, miss drag on. I have two questions. My first question is, to what extent can investors like us adopt your strategy of buying cheap unexpecting the value of a company to go up?

Speaker 2:          29:32          Well, I mean, I don't consider that to be very lean as strategy. I think that, uh, when you, when you buy sampling, the best is, it sounds simple. It's not simple. So by generally when everybody thinks you're wrong and if it, and the more people I think you're wrong, the better you're going to do it in a long run. That's how it works. Because at the end of the day, when everybody is against you, everybody sorta stole. You know, so it, it, it's very hard to do it psychologically, but at certain times you're in between and you're not going to get the benefit of that. But, uh, the old grave, a dog philosophy that you, you should just look at value. But one of the things is when people get given up on a company, that's the perfect dog. But it, but it doesn't always work because you don't have to be damn sure you're right. I mean, sometimes everybody is right, but generally it's not true that they're right. Generally if you look at the total, uh, outlook on a company and if everybody saw it, it is down on it. That's one to look at.

Speaker 3:          30:56          Thank you. And my second question is, what in your opinion these days do you see I was going to do to be successful? So they need more education, experience, industry knowledge.

Speaker 2:          31:07          I take, I think the answer is, I think the answer is that most of them have to have to leave the company.

Speaker 3:          31:15          Okay.

Speaker 2:          31:19          But there'll be a little more

Speaker 5:          31:24          good.

Speaker 2:          31:24          You'll be a little more fair about it. Uh, uh, the, the CEOS

Speaker 5:          31:29          okay.

Speaker 2:          31:29          Uh, have a lot of companies probably could do a good job, but, um, they, they, they're more it into building up. Um, it's like the royal we, you know, it's more like the imperial CEO and they build up a huge amount of people around them and they very rarely,

Speaker 5:          31:49          okay,

Speaker 2:          31:50          get to the nub of the problem. And some of them are probably okay, probably good guys, but there's no accountability. It's like you go to school and you never have passed and nobody ever bothers you. And that's what really happens until they really hit the bad times eight. And, uh, and I guess you could say I'm a bad time when I come in. They don't like it too much, you know? Uh, uh, uh, uh, I think that

Speaker 2:          32:17          the problem we have today is very simplistically, you don't have true, so you can't, it's very hard to get rid of the studio even though you theoretically have a boat. It's very hard to use the boat. I mean, do you imagine it a political race that the senator is fighting? Is the incumbent is fighting for an election and he can take all the money out of Washington. Did he could take it out of the treasury of the United States and the other guy can't, you know, and uh, it's completely, it completely set up and rig for the CEO because anybody coming in to fight them, they slew them to begin with. You know, they, they see it. They don't see me anymore, too much, cause they know I'm not going away. But they, they, they, so they do not let a ledger have, I could go into all the different shark repellents for all the mud. Um, it's, it's very, very difficult to beat one of these guys. I think that's going to change in the next four or five years. That's what I was telling you. And I think we're going to have a, a better corporate democracy, which gives people with real talent who are really with a work ethic, a, a chance to really make it.

Speaker 4:          33:30          Mr Icon, as you've touched upon it, we may be in the worst credit bubble in history currently. If you are right, the upcoming debt deflation will be long and painful. How would you recommend that investors protect their wealth during this period to take advantage of upcoming investment opportunities?

Speaker 2:          33:52          Well, it's, it's all I do recommend, uh, how, how do we invest at this time? I, you know, it without knowing how much capital you have, but, but I would be again, you know, I'd been a year at a different arena. You know, we invest and we look for these opportunities now, but, uh, I feel that, uh, you have to be certainly very careful, right? You have to be very careful in your investment of your investments. Even though the markets were going up the last few days, I would be careful and not have all your money invested in stocks. I would look at a lot of these distressed debt. Some of the distress that that has gone down. I don't know if you understand that, but some of the, some of the debt that even even back then, which was the highest level, uh, I think is, is there, is become very cheap. So that kind of stuff if something to look at, but I'd be very careful in buying equities, but I mean, you certainly could make a fortune by, and I'm, I mean, I, I'm certainly not telling you it's not going to work, but, uh, I think it's all risk reward and a lot of risk. I wouldn't be looking at this at the dead areas.

Speaker 4:          35:11          You mentioned, um, about the US dollar falling in value recently. What kind of a foreign currency vehicles or training would you recommend to kind of hedge your bet against the dollar, assuming that it continues to fall?

Speaker 2:          35:23          Yeah, I don't, I don't know much about carbon seats and I really don't get into something I don't know, something about or generally dog. So I don't play the currency market unfortunately because I current, she's gone down so much and uh, I, I don't necessarily think that you should do that now because it could theoretically turn in this country, but I'm only saying that, uh, that it has become one of the manifestations of our problems. The currency of out of the dollar has the wallet. But do you know, you can't be that same whine about everything in Asia either. Everybody loves Asia now would love Jina and loves all these countries. What'd you kind have some global problems too, so I don't know that it's time to rush out of the dollar, you know?

Speaker 5:          36:14          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          36:15          Hi, miss di Com. Why major criticism that I'm CEO, I can stomp top right activist says that they think activists think longterm in chase of cooperation. They just want to get money and get out. How do you answer to that?

Speaker 2:          36:33          I would just say that the, uh, that the facts don't bear that out as far as I'm concerned. I mean if you wee, I own quite a few companies. Any company we, we got controller. I put literally hundreds of millions of dollars into, I made me, I bought a company in 85 and rail car company. We put a hundreds of millions. We still have the pleat. I, uh, I kept the, I bought casinos and energy companies and over the years kept them, sold them now, but that's after 10 years. So any company that we've been able to get control of, uh, I actually kept because getting control is a great thing. And if you, if you really believe that management is not doing well, you can go and clean them up and put it in big guy. And so we, uh, we, we, I don't, I know that criticized you like that, but that's part of the propaganda machine. We just not the fast,

Speaker 6:          37:28          um, I related question is that, um, what do you do when your um, uh, activist spirit as now? I appreciate that as a nutcase. I Moto roll out when you ask for a seat in the board, but just the decline and, well, well, what's your next step?

Speaker 2:          37:47          All right.

Speaker 5:          37:47          Hm.

Speaker 2:          37:49          You'll have your, you have a, you have a patient and now it was a year later and we'll see what happens now. But a Motorola is a good example of what I'm talking about. People don't like it, they don't like the cell phone business. But uh, I really think that that business, if you look at Motorola and study it, you're buying that whole business for nothing. It's not reflected in the stock price. And what they have to do, and I've said it publicly, is take that business out of Motorola, spin it off and give it to the shareholders. And I think then you've got a real good value. So what I'm saying is nobody likes it now, but hopefully I'm correct on that. And I really think by being an activist and, and putting pressure on that board that has done nothing really, that I think eventually that will happen. Hopefully.

Speaker 4:          38:43          Maybe we'll have one or two more questions.

Speaker 5:          38:47          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          38:47          Two more questions and then we'll wrap up.

Speaker 5:          38:50          Okay.

Speaker 4:          38:53          Mr Icon, why does the United States have bad corporate governance and which countries have better models?

Speaker 2:          39:03          All right. We got bad corporate governance. It's evolved into this. I don't think that why she didn't understand how bad it is. Nobody's really focused on it. The different states, the way we structured the different states, one corporations to to register it and therefore what the rules are such that they protect the corporation with the poison pills and I can't get into all these different things. Staggered boards, poison pills, and I think if you just change some of that, we could be like for instance, England as much better. Canada has much better where you could without getting too detailed and simple by this where you can't have two or elections and the United States because of the way they're structured in the stage, you know the division between the federal and the state government, the have not been able to really Patel some of the abuses. But I think it will of course sooner or later, especially to have a bad recession.

Speaker 4:          40:09          You mentioned that you believe that many companies are poorly managed. Obviously you don't invest in every company. So I was wondering what factors you look for in identifying companies that you want to invest in and that you think are especially poorly managed.

Speaker 2:          40:25          Okay. We look at a lot of company, it's obviously, I have a whole group of people here that do that and I have a bunch of lawyers that look at all the providence and lead companies and their bylaws and their charters. But really some of them become very apparent. And when you look at them, you can, you can understand and you have to see that it related to the economy. But some of these companies, uh, it's just the parents that, uh, the value of these companies would be much better if, if they were, if they were better run, well, they just simply did certain things like, you know, like, like borrows examples later that broke it off or he, you know, and then some biotech companies that we're involved in now, there's a need to them by the big Pharma, big Pharma. It hasn't really done research for years for many, many marriages in the biotech area.

Speaker 2:          41:19          And therefore a biotech companies are that well run. But they do. They have spent a great deal in research for, you know, uh, the large molecule drugs and, and, and so therefore, you look at the [inaudible], some of them become quite apparent African. You're doing it for the years and years. I've known him a lot of, it's almost after you do all the work, it's almost an inch thick, you know, a there which could be at a monitor too fast. You know, it's, it's like asking some real great tennis way. Well, why did you move here instead of, there are four core player, you know, when you're running down the field, why didn't you go to this way instead of that way when you're, when you're running down the field. And I don't think you could tell you it's just one of an instinct why you do it. But that's after a lot of work on,

Speaker 1:          42:10          well, I think this has been a very, uh, enlightening talk. Uh, and Carl, I want to thank you very much.

Speaker 7:          42:18          Thank you.
