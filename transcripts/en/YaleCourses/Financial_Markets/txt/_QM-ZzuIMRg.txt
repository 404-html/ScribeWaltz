Speaker 1:          00:00:01       The fundamental point that I want to make today is that, well, economic theory describes, people has managing, they're maximizing their own utility and subject to constraints. Uh, most people have a lot of trouble doing that, particularly as regards investing in financial markets. Most people are confused and, uh, find it just very difficult. So, um, we have an industry of people who help people with their investments, uh, and we moreover have a whole array of regulations, uh, regulating the industry of people who help others with their investments. The problem is that most people are not that good at dealing in financial markets. They're mysterious, they're difficult. And Moreover, uh, there's a tendency of psychological biases that cause people to get into mistakes. Uh, we talked about overconfidence that most people think they're smarter than others, and it seems like people can easily get overconfident about their ability to beat the market.

Speaker 1:          00:01:19       Uh, and what naturally happens if not regulated, is that there will be others who will victimize and exploit these people. So the classic story is some kind of stockbroker who, uh, promises to make great wealth for you, uh, by trading your portfolio. Uh, and, uh, in fact, uh, doesn't really know anything. The guy is just a showman who is just pretending. Uh, there was a 1940s book called where are the customers yachts, which, uh, it was a best selling book. The title refers to the fact that stockbrokers give the impression that oh idea with a very wealthy, successful crowd of people and you are now one of the chosen people that I'm managing for. And so some stockbrokers will pretend to be very wealthy, create the appearance of that, like are associated with the rich people. And it draws people in. But in fact, the customers often don't do very well because the stockbroker make churn, their portfolio keep coming up with new trades and the broker is making money from commissions and, um, uh, that's the kind of problem that arises. So as a result, a lot of people recognize the importance of giving help to people. Uh, and so that's what we're talking about. I want to talk mostly about, uh, portfolio managers, uh, but I first talk about, uh, financial advisors,

Speaker 1:          00:03:07       uh, and also financial planners. Um, and then I'll move to a fiduciaries or institutional investors.

Speaker 2:          00:03:24       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       so we do not live in a world where people freely do business as they would like. The financial world is especially heavily regulated. Okay. So the first thing is financial advisor. Uh, again, most people don't know about these markets. They need someone to give them advice. So people set themselves up as financial advisers. Um, and uh, in most countries, these are heavily regulated by the government, uh, in the United States. Now what does that, what does a financial advisor, I should define that for you? It's someone who gives advice about investments for some kind of fee or commission. All right? Uh, it excludes lawyers, bankers, insurance salesmen, reporters for newspapers, professors. Even though these people may all give financial advice, it's not considered as part of law to be a central to what they do. And so there are excluded from the definition of financial advisor.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       Uh, it also excludes broker dealers. If someone presents himself or herself just as a broker, that's someone you can call up and say, I want to buy a hundred shares of GM or whatever. And the person does the deal, does the trade for you. That is also not a financial advisor. Even if that person, uh, occasionally dispenses advice, it's only incidental to the business. Financial advisers includes people who present themselves as offering advice to individuals and also includes analysts. So, uh, these are regulated and there's something called the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996. National Securities Market Improvement Act says that all financial advisors with less than 25 million under management must regulate, must register with the state regulator. And if it's greater than 30 million, they must register with the SCC in Washington Securities and Exchange Commission. If it's between, they can choose either. Uh, so they're all regulated. Okay. And, uh, the, uh, government, uh, wants to be sure that financial advisors are, uh, no, uh, what good practice is.

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       And so that means they have to take an exam and the exam is administered by a, what's called Finra should know. Um, that is, uh, was it, uh, financial institutions regulatory authority, formerly called an ASD. See how this is getting complicated. And a s D is National Association of securities dealers. And they started the Nasdaq Stock Market index, which you hear about all the time. Nasdaq is Nisd automation, automated quotation system, but NISD merged with the New York Stock Exchange Regulatory Authority last year. And so they've been renamed as Finra. Okay. These are all these institutional details. I want you to know because it, it's, it's boring maybe, but I think it's what's true. It's what's happening. This is what drives so much that happens. So Thinra says that if you want to become a financial advisor, you have to pass a series. They call it series 65 or 66 exam and then you are eligible according to Finra.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       Uh, it, Finra is an example of a s a self regulatory organization. The government in the United States doesn't want to be making all the rules. So they allow industry groups to form their own self policing organizations. Uh, and so Finra is the Organization for financial advisors and that is a, an SRO and the SEC accepts their licensing. So that's what you have to do to become a financial advisor. Uh, you have to take these exams, join Finra, then you go to the sec, and then you register as a financial advisor. Um, and so the exams would warn you about all kinds of bad practices. Uh, for example, uh, about churning a portfolio.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       I just mentioned what they did, but repeat it. That's when you call the guy up every day and you say, I just got a hot new idea for you. Of course, yesterday you bought, you bought Microsoft, Oh, sell that, move to this. Uh, and they just keep calling you up. And that's, that's, uh, it's a way to get licensed if you, if you're, if you are caught doing that because it can't work if you trade every day, there's no, it's virtually impossible to make money because the commissions will eat you alive and less, you know, you know, these guys who are attorney or fakes because they can't be getting a new idea every day. So that's the kind of thing. Now, financial planners are, um, are a little different. Uh, they, uh, the designation of financial planner is not regulated directly, but we do have, is self regulatory association.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       Uh, that, uh, manage manages them. Uh, so, uh, we have the financial planning association, that's their website. Uh, but uh, fpa.org, uh, and they, uh, license where they provide their own designation. This is how it works. Uh, in the u s particularly, uh, they, they will, uh, certify someone as a certified financial planner and FPA will require that every financial planner first become a financial advisor. Uh, so that's, uh, this is a big organization that incidentally, if anyone ever asks you, I need investment advice. Where do I get it? Uh, it might be a good idea to direct them to that website because they'll help you get a financial planner, which is more than a broker is supposed to actually be planning for your life. And that that's the essential economic problem that we faced. A stock brokers will often this, it comes back to what a Henry Paulson said in his proposal for rec reorganization of our financial markets.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       He thought, and I think this may reflect some essential wisdom, that we should have objectives based regulation. Each organization should be focused on an objective. I think the objective of the organization affects what you do. So if you are a stock broker and if you present yourself as someone who will buy and sell stocks for you, you're probably not going to get into financial planning with your clients. But if it's, if it's on your title, if you're, you write this after your name, your John Doe CFP, then it says planner in your title. I think that affects what you do. And it helped. What financial planners do is they say, let's sit down and think about your life goals and you know, do you expect to have children, are you going to send them to college? Uh, and you know, this kind of thought, which is very important.

Speaker 1:          00:11:35       Um, there's another one called isn't for financial advisors, napfa.org National Association of Personal Financial Advisors. And if someone asks you a, where should I go for advice, this is another good website to go to because, uh, what I like about nafa.org is that they have all of their advisors sign a statement that they will be fee only advisors and they will never steer someone towards an investment that provides a kickback to them that that's a problem. Is that often a financial advisor, uh, we'll be really trying to make money selling you things that, uh, provides, uh, um, money. They're not unbiased, but NAPFA, uh, it's part of their code of ethics that they're completely separate from any, uh, any organization. They're pure financial advisers and they don't make money from commissions. It's only from the hourly fee. So anywhere. What else? So that's basically what I was going to say about, um, financial advisors.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       Uh, it's a big industry and it's important. Uh, and actually in my new book, uh, I have, I have no, I shouldn't say I have no connection to this industry whatsoever, but I actually was, uh, uh, ad saying that I think as a national policy we should subsidize this industry. I think people need more financial advice. Uh, most people are just not with it enough. They're not getting the basic wisdom, uh, that, uh, and so I think if, if we need more of this, we should subsidize it. I was just in Mexico, uh, or over the weekend, and I had the opportunity to meet the president of Mexico, which was exciting. And I, I also heard him say that he thinks Mexico needs more development of financial culture. And this seems to be the thing that not enough Mexicans are really used to dealing with sophisticated financial institutions.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       And so that's where we have to go with Mexico. But I was saying, well, it's just the same in every country. I think there's a problem. So, uh, uh, but the other thing, so that's, I won't say more about financial advisors, but, uh, uh, let's move now to, the other way that happens is that people will turn over there. Uh, uh, actually I'm going to come back to trust and then later, but the other, the really big industry that manages people's financial problems for them, our institutional investors, and these are groups that, uh, organizations that pool money for many people and uh, invest the portfolio for them. Uh, and I wanted to start by emphasizing how important they are. Uh, and I wanted to just present you with the balance sheet for households and nonprofits, uh, as, uh, and just get some idea of how important institutional investors are. They're more important than these financial advisors because most of people's wealth is really managed by institutions. You don't have to ask any questions, you don't have to do anything. It's all done for you. Uh, so, uh, just to, um, I wanted to show the balance sheet

Speaker 2:          00:15:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:27       Of households and nonprofits,

Speaker 1:          00:15:39       and that's table be 100 of the flow of funds account. This is for the United States, but I think it would be similar in other countries. Um, and uh, so we have assets on one side and we have liabilities on another. So we'll have assets and then we'll have liabilities. You might wonder, why do we put households and nonprofits together? It's really because there are three types of persons that own things. There's individuals are natural persons, there are nonprofit organizations which are like individuals because nobody owns them. They own themselves. They're like people in contrast to corporations that are owned by individuals. And then we also have the government is the third. So this is the non government balance sheet. And so it's just about everything, uh, in this country. And I just wanted to review, this is from the Federal Reserve and these are estimates of course in subject to error, but uh, and this is for 2007 fourth quarter, which is the latest data.

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       Okay. So assets are things that people own and liabilities are things that people, oh, okay. And your net worth is your assets minus your liabilities. Um, so let's start with assets. What do you, I won't ask you to guess. Uh, the biggest asset that people own Indian and I did state that households own is, and nonprofits, this is almost entirely households are nonprofits. I small compared to household. Real estate is the biggest thing. And that is 22, uh, four, eight, $3 billion or $22 trillion. Uh, and people own this directly. It's their house. But the second most, the second biggest thing is pension funds. And that is a 12 billion. I mean it's 12 trillion, 12 billion, twelve thousand seven hundred and seventy nine billion. Okay. So that comes after right after real estate. Uh, then we have equity in non corporate business. That is, um, seven, three, eight, nine. I'm sorry, I'm reading the wrong line. Seven, eight, nine to almost 8 billion.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       What, what is non corporate business? It's business is run by individuals, so it's like the low, you know, if a family runs a little grocery store, uh, then their ownership of that is represented here as non corporate business. Or if you, if you're a barber and you've got your little barbershop, um, it all adds up. They valued all of these businesses and they valued them up totally as worth $8 trillion. Uh, and that we have corporate equities that's star. Uh, and, and uh, that is five, four, four, 7 billion or about 5 trillion. Um, that's stocks owned directly by household. Uh, and then, uh, we have mutual funds.

Speaker 2:          00:19:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:19:35       And mutual funds are institutional investors that invest in stocks or bonds. Uh, but usually it's mostly stocks five oh eight to a trillion. So it's almost as big as corporate equities hell directly. Um, and then there's consumer durables. That means your car, your furniture. Uh, that's four oh eight, I'm sorry, four oh three 5 billion, uh, bonds.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       I'm running out of room here to seven. Three. Oh, not so much. Not as big a insurance. Um, I have everything ranked by size, so we're going down the scale. Insurance is, um, this is life insurance one, two oh five. Um, and then I'm running out of room at the bottom of this. There's some other minor categories, uh, but the is, I'll write it up here and since I would normally put it at the bottom, but I've out of room with the bottom. The total assets total is 72 oh nine, $3 billion. So $72 trillion liabilities of households. Um, our mortgages, home mortgages, and that's 10, five or nine. Um, consumer credit, that's a credit cards, installment credit, various types, two, five, five, 1 billion, uh, loans and other one, three, one 5 billion. And the tall and the total liabilities is, um, 14 three one five. So people own 72 trillion.

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       They owe 14 trillion. The difference is net worth, uh, is um, uh, 57, seven one 8 billion. So that's about $192,000 per person in the United States. It's unequally how light. This is just consolidating everybody. It's unequally held, uh, because, uh, uh, rich people are more this than poor people. But in the average family of four has about 800,000. I'm just multiplying by 192,000 by four. So we have a lot of wealth, but the point here is what form is it in? But real estate is very unmanaged. People own their own homes, uh, and there's not much institutional involvement except through the mortgage. Not that they owe about half. They only own about half of their home. The average person, oh, is on the mortgage, almost half the value of the home. Okay. So if you took net worth in real estate, it would be, uh, only like 12 trillion, right? Assets minus real estate liability.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       So by that account, the biggest asset that people have is apparently their pension fund. Uh, that's huge. And that is institutional investors. The thing I wanted to make, the point I wanted to make about this is that institutional investors dominate just about everything. I mean, you've got real estate and non corporate business, which are not easily managed by institutional investors. Beyond that, uh, it's mostly institutional mutual funds, well, and insurance. So, uh, we, we live in a country where things are done, are managed by a professional investors. Uh, so maybe I'll just start on this board. Uh, so, uh, so let's just talk about a mutual. What does a mutual fund, a mutual fund refers to a structure of an investment company. Uh, they're much more important than hedge funds. Hedge funds are, we talked about those before, are designed for a small group of wealthy investors.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       Mutual funds are for the general public, uh, and the reason they're called mutual is that the fund is owned by the investors. In it. Uh, and, uh, the first mutual fund was called Mit, uh, no connection with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This was the Massachusetts Investors Trust, uh, in the 1920s. Uh, and at that time there were a lot of investor funds, uh, that were not relatively unregulated. Uh, and they were offering investments to people that were, uh, oversold often and often. Uh, there were classes of shareholders. There was a, uh, uh, class of prime shareholders who got the profits from the enterprise. And then there was a class of other shareholders who were the Hoi Polloi who, um, and after 1929, many of the investment funds crashed and burned and people got very upset. They were very upset, particularly that the investment fund was really being run for the profit and benefit of the guys who started the fund, not all the people who were in there.

Speaker 1:          00:25:49       And so after 1929, there was looking around is how should the investment funds really be organized. And then attention became focused on MIT because it was an honest fund. Uh, and they thought this should be the model for, uh, our investment fund industry. But what Massachusetts Investment Trust did is they said, everybody is equal and we're completely open about what we do. We publish our portfolio. Uh, and most investment funds were secret. They were saying, well, we're going to beat the market. We're not going to publish what we're doing. The Mit published its portfolio. It had only one class of investors. In fact, the fund was owned by the investors. It's a mutual fund. So if you put money in, you join the crowd, we invest for you. Uh, and if you want to take your money out, we'll share your proportion of the whole portfolio. That was the concept. So the concept, uh, became very, uh, widely respected and the whole industry grew. The Investment Act of 1940, uh, the Investment Company act,

Speaker 2:          00:27:08       uh, 1940,

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       it doesn't actually define mutual funds, but it defines structures that are used by mutual funds. And so after, uh, after the Investment Company act, uh, starting in the 1950s, mutual funds began to grow and grow. Uh, and, um, uh, they are regulated in such a way that, uh, the, as I've said, all, everyone is equal in the fund. Everyone benefits from the portfolio in an, uh, in an equal way. And the rule is that if you don't buy and sell shares in the Mutual Fund, this fund owns shares. You're putting money into the fund and if you want to get money out of the fund, you call him up for, or maybe you can do it on the web and you, you say you place an order to withdraw money from the fund. And what they will do when you withdraw money is they wait until 4:00 PM, uh, on the day of your order.

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       Uh, and then, uh, they calculate what your share of the fund would be based on 4:00 PM is when the stock market's closed. Uh, and so at 4:00 PM, you would get out at those prices. Uh, and that was considered a fair and honest thing, uh, to do. They don't charge high management fees. Uh, there's rules about that. Uh, and so, um, uh, they have their own Srr, uh, called ICI a investment company institute that was created I believe in the 1940s. So this has become the structure for the way most people, well, I, half people, most small investors do not own corporate equity directly. They own mutual funds. Uh, there have been some scandals about mutual fund, um, that emerge in the last decade or so. My spirit scandals, uh, there's something called late training. What was happening is, uh, sometimes there's mutual funds didn't enforce the rules well enough. Uh, you would, you would tell your broker, uh, I'd like to withdraw money from the mutual fund and the broker would then sometimes call, um, after 4:00 PM and say,

Speaker 3:          00:29:43       uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:29:45       my client really asked me to sell this at 10:00 AM this morning. I know it's 5:00 PM, but you know, trust me, I'd like to get out. Uh, and mutual funds would let this happen. Then it turned out to be abused. Why is that abusive? If you're a mutual fund, then you get this call from my broker saying, trust me, my client asked me to get out at 10:00 AM I know it's five. Can we get out? Uh, well, that turns out to be a bad practice because what ended up happening is people are abused. That they would wait until five or 6:00 PM and they would observe what seems to be happening in the markets. And if it's going up, then they would say we wanted to put money into the mutual fund. And if it's going down, they would say, we're trying to take money out of the mutual fund. You see how that, that hurts the other mutual fund investors because you do it strategically. You do. If you know the market is up, you're trading on, on steel prices and old prices, obviously you can make money doing that. Uh, and this got a lot of attention in the newspaper, the late trading. Um, and uh,

Speaker 3:          00:30:58       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       there was another, uh, another variation on that called market timing, but it's basically the same thing where a mutual funds, we're not enforcing the rules properly. And so some people were trading at that 4:00 PM price effectively after it. Uh, and so, um,

Speaker 3:          00:31:21       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:31:25       but, uh, they've cleaned up this act. And so I think that a mutual funds, our most trusted way of investing in the stock market and most people won't invest in individual stocks anymore. Uh, they just go through mutual funds. There is another kind of thing that has developed more recently, uh, and it's called an exchange traded funds, R, n e t. A. And these were created first. These are relatively new. Uh, these were created first at the American Stock Exchange and 1993. Uh, and they're different from a mutual fund. Uh, I did was show them separately on this. They're much smaller, uh, then mutual funds, I believe they're less than a trillion dollars. They must be in one of these other categories up there. But, um, exchange traded funds are different than a mutual fund in that they are traded on a stock exchange. Uh, and so the first, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:32:42       the first exchange traded fund with a company called a spider, that's standard in toward depositary receipt. But now there is a proliferation of, of uh, exchange traded funds. So what is an exchange traded fund? I said, this is louder than you hear me. All right, right. Uh, uh, exchange traded fund, uh, is uh, as epitomized by the, this is the s and p 500.

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       It's a port folio that is managed according to rules. It's not judgmental. Uh, and uh, you cannot call up the exchange traded fund and say, I want my money back. It's different from a mutual fund. If you get in, you would buy or sell an exchange traded fund on the Stock Exchange. Uh, and so the uh, uh, the fund is traded on the exchange traded fund holds a portfolio. I like the spider holds the portfolio equivalent to the s and p 500. Uh, and they pay out dividends on that. But in the meantime, uh, you can buy or sell shares in the fund on the Stock Exchange. They also have what are called creation units,

Speaker 3:          00:34:06       uh, which are, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:34:09       in large denominations like millions of dollars. And institutional investors can either create or redeem shares in the ETFs, but you as an individual cannot. All right. So if the creation unit is $1 million, then an institutional investor who is an authorized participant and it has signed the right papers, you can say, can you go to the AMX and say, I want to create a $10 million of new spiders. And then the Amex, we'll say, that's 10 creation units. I'm saying, I don't, I forget what it spiders creation unit is, but let's say it's $1 million. Then the AMX would say, all right, you have to give us the stocks in the s and p 500, uh, in the proportion that they are in the s and p 500 equal in value to $10 million. Uh, and that becomes, uh, uh, one creation and then they'll give the institutional investors the shares to sell.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       Conversely, the institutional investor can go to the AMX and say, I want to go the other way. I've got a 10,000 shares of these ETFs, I want, I want this stocks back. So the institutional investor can present the shares to the AMX and AMX will then give them the shares in the s and p 500. That enforces the price of the ETF equal to the price of the underlying stocks. So ETFs were designed so that the price of the ETF tracks tracks the price of the underlying stocks, uh, in contrast to things called close down funds, uh, which are similar, but they don't have the creation units closed down. The funds, the price of the fun and the stock market tends to go through either a premium or a discount depending on the market, but ETFs tend to track well. That is the price of the unit.

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       TF,

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       uh, tends to correspond to the price of the underlying stocks, whereas close a closed end. Mutual funds, I say close down funds track poorly. And so ETFs is the new thing, uh, that, uh, uh, that has developed. I said, I would talk about, uh, personal trusts, uh, and I thought, oh, this is something that, um, uh, is, um, I've less, somewhat less important, but it's about a trillion dollars in our modern economy. Uh, so what is a trust is another form of institutional investing.

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       Ah, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       Trust is a, uh, uh, it's often, uh, the department of a bank that manages money, uh, on behalf of a, uh, uh, of a individual or family. Uh, and, uh, for example, suppose a, your parents are concerned about you and they don't trust you. They trust the banker, not you. Uh, and there's a family fortune. Uh, maybe it doesn't have to be that big, but let's say it's $1 million. Uh, they could give it to you. Uh, but they might not, I don't know about your parents are doing, they're doing this behind your back, maybe not telling you in great detail. Uh, but, uh, a particular importance as an example of something called a spendthrift

Speaker 2:          00:38:10       trust. I'm not spelling it right. T h. R.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       Okay. Well what does a spend thrift and someone who can't save money and squanders it. So your parents can go to a bank and set up a spend thrift trust on your behalf and the spend trust will then pay you an income for life. Or they could even go beyond your life. They could go to your children or whatever, uh, but, uh, that prevents you from squandering the money from going to the casino and gambling it away. If your parents don't trust you, uh, and so, uh, you see the idea of the bank, then we'll manage it for the rest of your life and your parents will, will die and you'll outlive him. But that money will be stuck in that trust and you can't get it out because they set it up and it's there. Uh, and so, uh, uh, then, uh, the manager of the trust is a fiduciary who is by a contract is supposed to be managing in the interest of the child, the spendthrift child.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       Uh, and, uh, of course everyone, all these people will be dead before you are. Your parents will die. The first thing they talk to at the bank, setting up the trust and will die. Uh, but when you're 90 years old, there'll be someone at that bank person is much younger than you who was appointed in succession to manage your trust and will continue to pay you that income out of your trust. Now, if there's another reason why your parents might be doing this, uh, which he might not, you might be angry with your parents if they did this right? Uh, but they might do it for another reason, and that is you could get married and get a divorce. Okay? And they're worried about this. A really awful person you married taking half of the family money when you get divorced, right? So they lock it up in a spend thrift trust.

Speaker 1:          00:40:12       Uh, and then after the divorce, the trustee will say, no way, I'm, you know, I'm bound to pay this person, not the wife or husband, the amount of money for life. And it apparently works. So that's another reason why families, we'll do this because they don't want to give them money to the awful person you married. Uh, uh, so, uh, in common law countries, trusts are, that's like the u s in the UK. Uh, trust are well defined in law and a trustee has well defined rights. Uh, if you are, and it doesn't have to be a bank, we allow, uh, you can have a friend of yours become a trustee. Uh, in common law countries. There's a nice segregation of the, uh, assets in the trust and the assets of the trustee. So suppose you ask your brother-in-law to serve as a trustee for your children and then your brother in law gets into some bad financial situation and goes bankrupt.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       Courts will not be allowed to take the trust that the brother-in-law is managing for your children. Okay. This wasn't so clear in a civil law countries such as in Europe, the typical trust in Europe has been that you would go to a, and the bank would manage the trust for you, but if the bank went under, you might lose the money. Uh, and uh, maybe there's more trusting of their banks in Europe. I think this is also changing. The law is always changing. Um, okay, now I wanted to come to pension funds, which are, uh, the most important kind of, uh, institutional. You can see up there that the $12 trillion, it doesn't include, this pension fund here does not include social security, which is of comparable magnitude. The government runs its own pension fund in effect called the social security system. And that's not shown here.

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       So, uh, there's a lot of pension funds are private funds managing a portfolio of assets. The social security system does not manage a substantial portfolio of assets. Uh, the social security system, which is a, it's not on here, I'm just mentioning it as an aside. We set up by US Congress in 1935 to provide for the elderly, uh, and also for a disabled and uh, um, orphan children. But this main social security provides for the elderly, but it does. So without investing it, there is something called the Social Security Trust Fund managed by the government, which invests in assets to help the government pay out on social security. However, the Social Security Trust Fund is only last time I heard about $1 trillion. So the government is not investing much compared to, uh, these pension funds. The pension funds are much bigger. And these are our agencies, private agencies that invest, uh, on behalf of people for their retirement.

Speaker 1:          00:43:35       Uh, and they are very important element of our economy. They help us solve the essential problem that everyone goes through the life cycle. You're young, you're healthy for a while, you're working, and then your health starts to deteriorate and then you have years or decades when you are either not inclined to work or cannot work. Uh, and this happens with such regularity that, uh, it, it, uh, requires some kind of professional management and that's what pension funds do. So I wanted to talk about these in some more detail. The, the, uh, it wasn't until the 19th century that we had them, which is kind of surprising because it's such an important problem. And even in the 19th century, they were few and rare. Uh, but, um, the, uh, the first us, I think they go, they go back earlier in the UK and in places in Europe. But, uh, in the United States, the first corporate pension funds was American Express in 1875.

Speaker 1:          00:44:46       American Express then was not a credit card company. It was a, it was a shipping company or a transportation company. Uh, and uh, it's first a pension fund was for the, was for the employees of American Express. Uh, and the original terms where you had to work there for 20 years and past the age of 60, and you had also to be disabled. Uh, and if you satisfied though, if you were over 60, you had worked at American Express for 20 years and also were disabled, uh, you would get 50% of the average pay for the last 10 years you worked there. This is the earliest model in the u s

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       uh, and that, uh, gradually they became copied by more companies. Uh, it became more and more important as the 19th. And we moved into the 20th century because life expectancy was going up. There were relatively few people with the life expectancy at 1900 was something like 45 years. I don't have the exact number. So 60 was a milestone that a lot of people didn't reach. Oh, of course. Others, many did as well. So it's not a, this was important even then, but, uh, it wasn't, the original pension funds tended to be done for the benefit of the employer in the sense that like the American Express, you had to work there for all of 20 years, uh, in order to get anything. It was all or nothing. If you work there for 19 years, uh, then too bad and you've got nothing. It didn't seem well designed, but it was designed to keep people there. They didn't want people leaving. And so once he signed onto American Express, you were kind of stuck there because you didn't want to get out, uh, you'd lose your pension. Um, so, uh, the, uh, it wasn't very big, but, uh, uh, big institution in the Carnegie Steel Pension,

Speaker 1:          00:47:02       a pension plan was 1901. Andrew Carnegie, uh, which was a milestone because it started to, uh, establish the principle on there. This was the first big company to establish a pension fund. Uh, and it grew through the first few decades of the 19th century. Uh, and by 1929, there were many pension funds. Uh, they started doing union pension funds. So there were the cigar makers, uh, that was a union, um, or granite cutters and cigar makers in 1905, uh, locomotive engineers, that was 19, 12. Uh, many of these funds failed in 1929 and they were offered by companies for their employees or unions, uh, for their members. Uh, when companies offered tensions for their employees, that was a risky thing because companies go bankrupt. It happens all the time. And if they go bankrupt, how are they going to pay the pension plan? Well, that was tough luck for the employee.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       He's, that was a lesson enlightened time. They didn't, the point was that they rarely funded the pension funds in the early decades of the 20th century. Carnegie steel just ran about Carney, but generally they just promised to pay. They just said, we will pay you when you retire. And out of what you might ask, well, that wasn't explained, but it had to be out of profits. And what if they weren't making any profits? Well, they didn't ask. People didn't seem to anticipate this. After 1929, uh, these, these, um, pension funds became discredited because so many of them failed. Uh, and that led to, uh, a, a idea that we had to do something different. So, uh, the big milestone in pension history is the General Motors Pension Fund,

Speaker 2:          00:49:16       uh, which, uh, g m pension, which was created in 1950.

Speaker 1:          00:49:29       Uh, and, uh, it was, uh, promoted by GM chairman Charles Wilson.

Speaker 2:          00:49:36       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       I visited them recently. They were in that building right across the street, what is the Plaza Hotel at the corner of central park. Um, and they're, uh, a very big organization now, but the thing that GM pension fund did is it, it invested, it funded.

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       And so they started investing money on behalf of the pensioners so that if GM were to ever go bankrupt, they would still be money in the fund. Uh, and not GM stock. This was the most amazing thing. The people that Ge General Motors was investing money for its pension fund and of all things, it wasn't buying GM stock. Seville thought, why wouldn't they buy their own stock? They would push the price up, but of course it's not enlightened to buy their own stock because that would be stupid to invest the pension fund in your own stock because the stock would become worthless in the same circumstance that you would be unable to make good on the pension. So it wouldn't do any good. So it was odd. It seemed obvious that companies should fund their pension funds and should invest in something other than their own stock.

Speaker 1:          00:50:56       Uh, and so, uh, uh, that may seem obvious, but it took until 1950. One thing that strikes me about financial history is that it seems like we go for such a long time doing things that are obviously not right. Uh, and as long as there is no crisis, nobody pays attention to it. Then we have this huge crisis, like the 1929 stock market crash, and then it's an only an after the crisis that anyone thinks about it. So I don't know what was happening for the first 30 years of the 20th century. They had all these pension funds, but the whole idea seemed to be faulty. Right. Why would you think that your company can support you in your old age? That's decades in the future. You know, the chance that your company would go under. It has to be substantial. Uh, but you know, people don't seem to see these risks and they don't think about them until there's a big crisis. That's where I think that we are at an opportune time right now with another financial crisis. And it's a time when people might be willing to think about how to do things differently. Um, so, uh, the next big crisis in pension fund history was the Studebaker default.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       1963. Have you ever heard of Studebaker? No. You were heard of them. They are made cars. They were one of the big, and how many car makers in the fifties and sixties? Uh, you probably still see these on the road, but they're getting quite rare because that's 45 years ago. Uh, they were big for a while. Uh, anyway, they, the company went bankrupt, uh, in 1963. And, uh, now they claimed to have funded a pension plan. They were learning from GM and they were investing a pension plan or their employees in assets that should have survived the bankruptcy. So they thought, uh, but uh, after the bankruptcy it found out that they had underfunded the pension plan. Okay. That means that they didn't put enough money to pay what they promised to pay so that while they had it, they just didn't, they didn't put enough in. So then people started getting angry.

Speaker 1:          00:53:23       Obviously people at work, their lives at Studebaker promised that they were told that they had a funded pension fund and when they went there, they found that they got nothing or at least very much reduced. So people started looking at the union, the United autoworkers. Isn't the United auto workers supposed to stand up for the rights of the men, the employees, and shouldn't they be looking at the pension fund and demanding that Studebaker funded adequately? Well, they were, they were asleep. They were not, they were asleep at the switch or some people accused the UAW of complicity with Studebaker, that basically the UAW was not paying attention to the distant future because they didn't think that their members really cared. So you UAW wanted it when they had negotiations with Studebaker, they wanted big pay increases. Now they didn't care about funding the pension fund.

Speaker 1:          00:54:23       Why didn't they care? Well, because the workers at Studebaker didn't know or understand this. And so the workers were not attuned to this. So the union thrives on getting something that looks valuable to the employees, but the employees were being deceived so that both Studebaker and the union were in it together against the employees in a sense. So this created a lot of them anger, uh, about, about failures of pension funds. Uh, I'm talking about financial crises of years past. Uh, we're going through a subprime crisis right now. Uh, and this is one of a series. Every time we have a financial crisis, we make fixes. And so in reaction to the Studebaker it took, took 10 years, but the Studebaker default set in law enforce a dialogue about how pension should be managed. And that led to, uh, Arista, uh, 1974, actually 11 years later.

Speaker 1:          00:55:26       And, uh, Rissa, uh, stands for employment, retirement income security act, all right. Employment, retirement income Security Act, uh, and, uh, it then required funding. So it required a adequate funding. You know, Studebaker had a funded pension plan, but it was under, uh, underfunded. So that's what Rissa created. Um, and, uh, they also created, uh, the, uh, pension benefits guaranty corporation. PBGC this is a government, uh, core, well, it's, it's a government sponsored enterprise that, uh, uh, insurers, so pension benefit guarantee corp the deal is, it's likely federal deposit Insurance Corporation, which guarantees your bank deposit. It guarantees ear pension plan. So the PBGC then receives dues from a pension plans and the pension plans. Then if they were to fail, uh, would get, uh, the pensioneers would get a payment from the PBGC. All right. So the PBGC is supposed to monitor the funds of pension plans, make sure that they're adequately funded, and then, uh, if they are not adequately funded, then they would make up the difference.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       Uh, now, ultimately the PBGC has a portfolio of assets which it accumulates from the fees paid to it by the pension funds. Uh, that portfolio of assets might not be adequate in a huge crisis. Uh, and so congress might have to step in to support the PBGC. Otherwise the PBGC is not taking taxpayers' money. Recently the PBGC has come under some attack because after the stock market, it's very hard to know whether a pension fund is adequately funded or not. Right? Because it all depends on assumptions about asset prices. During the run up of stock market in the 1990s, uh, for firms started cutting back on the amount they contributed to their retirement funds because the, the stock market had made them, had made their plans look very rich. Uh, and so, uh, there are people like me claiming that it was a bubble and that, so the price is, we're not going to stay at this level, but it's kind of hard to make that prove that point. So companies in the late nineties, uh, were not, they were putting their money in risky stocks and, and saying they were adequately funded. Uh, when there were people like me who are doubting that, and the PBGC being a government organization didn't protest. I, after the stock market came down after 2000, it put the PBGC and jeopardy. Fortunately, the market went back up again and kind of avail them out. But, uh, uh, the Erisa act also embodied something called the prudent person rule.

Speaker 1:          00:59:09       Actually in 1974, they called it the prudent man rule. Uh, that was because 74 was just before we tried to use nonsexist language. So the prudent man rule is now the prudent person. But I'll read what the Arista said. The act said, um, investments must be made with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances. Then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a light capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a light character. And with like ames, well that's lawyer ease, but basically what they're saying, the fundamental problem is that even if you get beyond the deliberate underfunding of a pension plan, you still get the possibility that the pension managers will do something wild like put everything in the stock market. Or they could put leverage investments in the stock market and they could say we're funded enough because with this huge, hugely leverage portfolio, we should have enough money, but that wouldn't be prudent.

Speaker 1:          01:00:14       Right? And so if the government is guaranteeing pension plans as they're going, as they, they started doing with the PBGC, then they've got to prevent that. Uh, and so because they can't let companies just do wild investments. But this put the government in a funny circumstance because it was Darren to tell these funds that they, that they had to be doing sensible investing. But what is sensible investing? It actually, it was a difficult thing to define. Look at Yale University back in 19, when David Swensen came to Yale, most universities put their money in sensible, safe government bonds and stocks were considered risky, but Swenson said, no, let's not do that. Let's put into these strange alternative investments. And after the fact, he turns out to be right. Right. Was he not prudent? Do you want to tell investment companies that they shouldn't do that? It's a, it's a difficult question.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       And the question is, how far should it be pension plan go in taking on risk risky investments. So the law created the strange, prudent person rule, which says that an investment company should do whatever a prudent person would do. Um, and I created an unfortunate environment for pension fund management. Basically they're telling pension fund managers do, don't use your own judgment. Do what somebody else would do. And you manage the portfolio. Uh, right. I mean, that's law. I mean, you've got to do this. It's in the law as a manager. Uh, and so, uh, uh, it's a, it's a slippery business to be in. So, um, I have on the, it's actually, I don't expect you to go to read this because it's, it's, it should be in the library, but Obar and commonly, uh, wondered how tension funds deal with this strange situation they're put in.

Speaker 1:          01:02:09       Uh, so this is oh, Var and calmly work. One of these, uh, is an anthropologist. So we're getting a little bit of insight from it. I mentioned I like to take insights from all the different social sciences. Anthropologists like to go into some primitive village somewhere in the world and interview people, uh, who live in a very different culture and try to learn about them. And what an anthropologist does. It goes into some village, uh, and, uh, it doesn't disturb their, tries not to disturb their culture, doesn't start explaining things, just listens and tries to understand how they think it has to learn their language and listened to their, and presumably to get insights about human behavior, uh, from the experience of immersing oneself in some other culture. Uh, so, uh, these people went to interview a pension fund managers with the same techniques that anthropologists use in a primitive villages.

Speaker 1:          01:03:16       Uh, and, uh, they concluded, uh, that, uh, pension funds, uh, are there, uh, there, there are rather critical of pension funds. The pension funds are living in this strange world created by Arista, which requires that they behave as somebody else would. And so it kind of separates them from any real sense of their mission. They're regulated so heavily. Uh, and so what Obara unkindly found is that they engage people in discussion. They listened to what managers have pension funds would say on their own without suggesting that topic of conversation. And what they found was that managers, uh, we're very much aware of the prudent person rule, uh, and that they were always looking to shift blame, possible blame. They're always thinking of some lawsuit that they could eventually be embroiled in. And they, they're always saying, well, this is what a prudent person would do.

Speaker 1:          01:04:25       They talk a lot about the law and relatively little about economics or, uh, or the objectives that they're supposed to have about how do we get to, uh, the management of a, how do we manage this portfolio to provide for the benefits to our employees in the future? Uh, and, uh, it's interesting that as anthropologists, they took note of what anthropologists have noted in many primitive societies, that if you let people living in some isolated culture talk, they tend to come up eventually with a creation myth. Okay. So this is the term the anthropologist, every primitive society. We can, you can ask them where did it all start? Right. And they would, they will generally have a story about the creation of their little village or their people, uh, which involves some great man or God that, uh, founded everything. Uh, and there some story about this person, uh, and, uh, a sense that we are the chosen people that were the, uh, we have some values are, and it's built around a story of some great man or woman, I suppose. Uh, but, uh, uh, what they said is that that's one of the things they heard most commonly, the creation myth. So they would say are a pension fund was started by so and so 40 years ago. And this person had great insights and we're living in this tradition ever since. Uh, so, um, but, uh, so, uh, uh, so, uh, anyway, uh, Rissa came in at more or less the end of an era. There's, there are really two kinds of pension plans. There is a defined benefit

Speaker 1:          01:06:32       and defined contribution.

Speaker 1:          01:06:42       There's a fundamental difference. A defined benefit pension plan tells you that the pension, we'll pay you a certain amount. For example, I mentioned the very first us pension from American Express. It promised to pay you 50% of your average pay for the last 10 years that you were employed. Okay. So you were told this, uh, when you started the job that this was your plan. Uh, and so that define the benefit. You would get a, until 1974, virtually all pension plans were defined benefit. Uh, there were some exceptions, but it was the overwhelming norm. Labor unions liked defined benefit, it sounded right to them. But the, the, the contrary, the Chi is called defined contribution in a defined contribution plan. The pension plan does not promise you anything about what your retirement income will be. They merely say that we are going to contribute your, a fraction of your salary, uh, to a portfolio that will be managed to provide you income when you retire.

Speaker 1:          01:07:56       But the amount you get will be determined by the portfolio and not by, uh, any arbitrary rule. There's nothing like, you know, 50% of the last 10 years of your income. The defined contribution plans got their biggest impetus in 1981. So that's what, seven years after a Rissa with the advent of what was called four o one k plans, four o one k is a paragraph in the Internal Revenue Service Code Code. That's the tax. That's the IRS that the agency of the government that taxes, uh, everyone and rule section four o one k of the IRS code, um, uh, defined circumstances in which, uh, money held in trust for others might not be taxable. Uh, and in 1981, uh, for the first time a company, uh, invoked this clause to get asked that the defined contribution plan that they were setting up would not be text. Uh, the, uh, well actually what make it clear, what it would be is if the employer or employee made contributions to the plan, then there would be no tax that would be a tax deduction for the amount of the contribution until later after the person retires.

Speaker 1:          01:09:34       It would be taxed many years later as ordinary income when they received it. But by postponing the tax, it was a significant tax advantage. So after 1981, there was a tremendous revolution in our tax, in our pension system because, uh, it led, uh, first of all, people like tax breaks and it sounds good to get a tax break. But secondly, um, people start unions were declining unions, which had always advocated defined benefits were declining as a force in the u s and people were developing in the United States more of an investment culture. And they liked the idea that they would have a defined contribution plan where there would be a portfolio which is theirs, which is being invested for the retirement rather than trust the company to provide a benefit in retirement. So the general public showed a strong preference for defined contribution plans after 1981. And so that is a big force.

Speaker 1:          01:10:41       The U S was a leader in defined contribution plans, but it is now spreading all over the world. Uh, and I think it again reflects the change in our world culture. So they're growing in Europe and uh, and other, I guess Mexico, a Chili there. There's so many of the pension plans now are of the defined contribution variety, even a government pension plans. So the government, social security planning Chile, uh, allows you invest for you. Uh, and if there's a portfolio and you can get on a website, I understand I've never done it in Chile, but you can see what the balances in your account. Another thing that defined contribution plans began to do with the advent of 401k is they would allow you as a employee or as the pensioner to choose the general categories of investments. So they would, they would typically in a defined contribution plan, after 1981, there will be a number of mutual funds that you could invest your money in.

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       And now you couldn't take it out until you retired. You could choose which from a selected list of mutual funds, you could invest your money. And so this helped promote mutual funds dramatically. Uh, and it also created more of an investment culture in our society. So, uh, so, uh, that's where we are now. Uh, the defined benefit pension plan is declining rapidly. Ressa is, it's still not irrelevant because they're still important, but a Rissa is becoming less and less important and we're moving on toward a country. When you get your first job, the first thing you will get, I can predict, will be a four o one k plan. And, uh, you will probably not be given a, a defined benefit pension.
