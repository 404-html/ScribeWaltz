Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So I wanted to talk today about investment banking, uh, which is, uh, a subject of some interest around here. Um, but first, I, I, uh, I thought I would, uh, there's been so much news. I wanted to just briefly comment about what's going on in the world today with our, um, financial crisis. Uh, notably I think that this is the, uh, it could be the biggest financial crisis since the great depression. Uh, and, uh, as evidence of that we're seeing a lot of talk about what changes should be made. And I think it reminds me of the very basic fact that we live in a financial world that was created in the wake of the Great Depression. Uh, so many of our financial institutions were created in the 1930s, uh, because that was a time when everything was being shaken up. And, uh, it was a time when people were willing to consider it something really different.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       Uh, if you just look at back where various of our institutions when they were created, it's most likely to be in the 1930s. Uh, we are not yet at such a crossroads. The financial situation is not as bad as it was in the 1930s, but it's getting bad. And as a result, we're starting to see, um, proposals for big change. Notably, uh, on Monday, the Treasury Department Under Secretary Henry Paulson, uh, announced a proposal for fundamental change in our financial markets. Uh, and this proposal if implemented, might be the biggest change since the great depression. Uh, however, uh, the news are calling it dead on arrival. Uh, it's unlikely that the Paulson proposal will be implemented, uh, partly because it's, it's being proposed by the Republican administration, but not just Republican eight, just an administration that's coming to an end and we're having an election. So this, uh, Paulson proposal probably has very little chance of being implemented as is, but it's puts, it's put in a to change the discussion.

Speaker 1:          00:02:36       Uh, and it's, it's going to be talked about a lot and I, I suppose it will influence what happens that the interesting thing is that the next president of the United States will likely have a mandate for big changes. Uh, so maybe it's just as well that for Bozi and Al are slow to do a second edition of their book because if they got it out this year, it would be a bad year to get it out because everything is changing. Uh, I studied the Paulson proposal carefully since I'm writing, I'm writing a New York Times column about it, which will appear Sunday. Uh, and reading the various commentaries about the proposal. Uh, I had the impression that not many of them are very thinking very deeply about it. They're typically, they'd like to talk about the politics of it, uh, and this thing that it's dead on arrival or it's, uh, someone said it's an amateur amateurish proposal.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       All the groups that stand a win or lose from it are all figuring out what it does to them and they're taking their positions out of self interest. So I wanted to write something that was more, um, perspicacious if I could manage that. Um, the interesting thing is actually we, everyone calls it the pulse and proposal, but it was apparently mostly written by a young man who was in his early thirties. You may not consider that young, but I think that as young, he could have taken this course from me 10 years. Actually, he didn't go to Yale. I looked it up. He went to American University, both undergraduate and is, his name is David nascent, uh, undergraduate. And then he got a law degree at American University. Uh, and then he just went to work for the government. As far as I know, he doesn't publish, uh, is not in the newspaper, but he's gotten the ear of the treasury secretary and they spent many weekends together figuring out what should be done about the, uh, system. Uh, and they wrote up a proposal, uh, which I, I like many aspects of it actually a, it's an interesting proposal. Uh, but, uh, but it's not so much what's in the proposal as it is that this is a time, uh, for reconsideration. Um, w the w one interesting thing that they proposed is that we should have what they call objectives based regulation of, all right. I can find a piece of

Speaker 2:          00:05:08       charge. So, uh, so okay. So we have, uh, this is David Mason and Henry Paulson, although it's not signed by them, it's signed by the treasury. Uh, so the treasury, it's called a blueprint, a blueprint for reform of our

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       financial regulation. Uh, and, um, it's, it's built around, uh, what they call objectives

Speaker 2:          00:05:54       regulation.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       That means that, uh, the different regulators should each have their own objective. And so they have a three part proposal. There'd be a market stability regulator, uh, which would, uh, make sure that the markets don't freeze up on us. We don't have the systemic crisis. There'd be a prudential financial regulator, and then three, there would be a business conduct regulator. So that's the, uh, the main part of the proposal. And so what they're doing is emphasizing the different, uh, objectives of, of regulators. Market stability is going to be the Fed. Uh, but, uh, but it's not just banking. They want it to be, uh, the feds role would be broadened so that it's not just a banking regulator, it's the whole financial system. It's supposed to be maintaining the stability of the system.

Speaker 2:          00:07:18       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       and then the prudential financial regulator is, uh, supposed to regulate, uh, it's supposed to a mat. Uh, I, uh, protecting the u s interest in various institutions that are guaranteed by the government, such as, uh, banks that are federally insured, uh, are, uh, uh, enterprises that have government guarantees are apparent, government guarantees like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And then the business conduct regulator is supposed to regulate.

Speaker 2:          00:07:58       Uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:08:00       well, when I saw it was, it was, it would be aimed at consumer protection

Speaker 3:          00:08:07       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       That it would, um, make sure that businesses are, uh, are protecting individuals.

Speaker 2:          00:08:17       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:08:19       so I found this, uh, interesting because it calls to mind some of the problems we had with the subprime crisis. One very important problem was in the u s we have regulation divided up in crazy are archaic ways. Different agencies were formed at different times, and they have specific missions. Uh, and for example, we have the office of the Office of the comptroller of the currency. The OCC was founded in 1863 to national banks, but it only supervises national banks. Well, why not state chartered banks or why not credit unions or other things? Um, well it's just an accident of history. So, um, what, um, uh, what these people are proposing is that we merge various agencies so that, uh, and, and define new agencies of the government that are separated by these different objectives. Uh, so an objective defines an, uh, an agency or regulatory agency. Uh, so, uh, so what, uh, they want to do is merge the SI c and the ots merger.

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       That's one of the proposal, but I wonder why they don't carry it further, but that that's, that's the thing they emphasized. The OCC is office of the comptroller of the currency regulates national banks. The Ot ots is the office of thrift supervision. It regulates savings banks. So we put the two together. That sounds sensible. I guess. Why are they separate? Um, and various other things that they talked about had that for, they weren't to merge, uh, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. All right. The Securities and Exchange Commission is the principle government regulator for securities. They make sure that everything is on the level and working right. They pretend they help prevent fraud, misrepresentation, manipulation of information in stocks and bonds. The CFTC is the commodity futures trading commission and it regulates our futures markets. Um, there has been over the years a lot of turf battles between the SEC and the CFTC because it's sometimes unclear whether something is a security or a future.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       For example, when they started trading stock index futures, these, both these agencies thought it was in their turf because it involved both stock indexes and futures. Anyway, false in is proposing merging these, uh, that makes sense. And it seems like, uh, getting rid of some of this division of regulatory agencies is very beneficial. Uh, and it, the division is what hampered regulators from, from dealing with the financial subprime crisis. So people knew that a lot of bad loans were being made or loans were being made to people who couldn't be getting them low income people were being given adjustable rate mortgages with very low starter rates called teaser rates that would be raised in the future. And they were given them with in such a way that after the rates were raised, they likely couldn't afford to pay the mortgage anymore or they'd be under great stress and trying to do so.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       So a family that bought a house, low income family buys a house, they can barely afford it. Then the rates go up on them. The parents would have to take out second jobs to try to, you know, they're just going to, they're just going to go bankrupt when that happens. So it was a, in some cases unethical and it was plainly a problem, and yet the regulatory agencies in the U s weren't stopping it. Uh, another reason why the regulatory agencies weren't stopping these problems was because they often saw their mission in different terms. So when I gave a talk at the occ in 2005, I was asking them about, why aren't you policing these mortgages? And their first answer was, well, you have to remember, we were set up in Abe Lincoln's Day to manage the national banks. Uh, we're, that's our mission. W W W I, I may be overstating their answer, but I got that flavor from them that you want us to go out and protect consumers.

Speaker 1:          00:13:12       Well, of course that's a nice mission, but that's not our mandate. So, uh, uh, so, uh, I think that what Paulson and nascent want to do is to create a separate business conduct agency that is aimed at consumer protection. And so it would be working parallel with these other agencies too, uh, too. But their job would be to represent the consumer. And that sounds like a good idea to me. Um, the thing I stressed in my column was the market stability regulator, which is the Fed. What they want to do is expand the actions of the feds that they're not just, you can describe the Federal Reserve or any central bank. Traditionally as a banker's bank, remember I told you the story of how the first, the Bank of England was the first central bank and it made banks keep deposits at the Bank of England. So in other words, the banks were like customers of the Bank of England.

Speaker 1:          00:14:15       They had to keep deposits there. And the Bank of England watched them to make sure that they were behaving responsibly and had authority over them because it, um, it had a market power. Well the Fed is like that now. Um, but what, uh, Paulson and Mason wanted to do is make it more than a banker's bank didn't want it to be a bank for the whole financial system. And that's what's already happening. Uh, in fact, it's just happening rapidly as we speak. I mean, in this last month, things have changed. The Fed has never given loans to anyone other than a depository institution that is a bank until last month. And except they did. So on the depression, there was this long gap in the 1930s, the Fed was making loans to private companies that were not banks. And then they stopped doing that until last month. Uh, and they created the, I mentioned that last time, that term securities lending facility and the primary dealers credit facility, which are lending outside the banking system. And so, uh, what Paulson wants to do is make that official that the Fed is no longer just a central bank. It's a market stability regulator. This is going to be very controversial, but I think it's a good thing to raise,

Speaker 2:          00:15:43       uh, in my opinion. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       this is the trend anyway, and I think we're going that way. Uh, the problem is that in a modern financial economy, we have so much instability, which is already built into the system

Speaker 2:          00:16:00       that, uh, that, uh, we have to,

Speaker 1:          00:16:05       we rely on something like a central bank, uh, to do things that, uh, that helps stabilize markets.

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       Uh, and so

Speaker 1:          00:16:22       I think that we're probably going that way anyway. And I think that in the next presidential administration, we'll see an expansion of the role,

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       uh, of the Fed. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       I wish the Fed had behave better in the recent crisis in a sense. They didn't seem to recognize the bubbles that we had in the stock market in the 90s and the housing market and the two thousands. And if there are market stability regulator, you'd hope that they could do a better job. Uh, but, uh, there what we have, and I think that, that we should probably, uh, uh, give them the authority to do that job. And I think that's what we need to do. So I was generally positive about their, the treasury proposal, but, um, another thing that they want to do, which has been talked about for some time. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:17:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:30       Yeah. So he asked why, why did the news media, I think that the crisis is already over. Uh, and secondly, why do they think we can prevent, right. Is that, I'm paraphrasing. Uh, I don't know if the news media are concluding anything, but you do see, we have seen over recent years we've seen a lot of, um, uh, suggestions that the turning point is just around the corner. And so, uh, in the news media report that I think there's a bias towards optimism, uh, buy in among business economists generally are business people in general. You know, it's not considered good form to say, I think we're about to have the crisis of confidence and the whole house of cards is going to collapse. So it's also not a, you know, if generally not in a business person's interest to suggest that. So we're all instinctively trying to promote each other's confidence.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       And that's what business people do. They carry it a little further than that. Uh, I was, uh, I was asked to be on, uh, uh, it could and Kramer I could load and company show. Um, uh, I guess it was two nights ago I turned them down, but they wanted to put me on opposite the, the CEO of Coldwell banker. Uh, and uh, who is, uh, who is claiming that the crisis is just about to end. So I did a little research. I would be thinking, I have still might go on the show, but, uh, I, um, I looked up a CEO of Coldwell banker, but I found that there was another CEO, this is a broker, a real estate brokers for, there was another CEO a year ago who was on TV just exactly a year ago saying, I think this is the best time ever, or the best time in at least 10 years to buy a house.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       And he said, uh, the, uh, inventory is high. Uh, the market is bottoming out. Uh, and so, uh, he was spectacularly wrong, but I notice he's also no longer CEO. So these things happen. So, uh, there is a general bias. On the other hand, I have to respect these people that usually financial crises and okay, there's, there, there are repeated scares and usually it's all right. Like we had a big scare in 1998, uh, it started with the Asian financial crisis and then it spread to Russia and there was this terrible collapse in Russia in 1,998, uh, when the government couldn't pay its debts and then that spread to the u s and people were very fearful. But the Fed under Alan Greenspan was very quick to respond and the whole thing didn't turn out to be anything so bad. The, the Fed again did like what it's doing now at rescued a company called long term capital management.

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       Uh, but your, your question about whether we can prevent this kind of thing in the future is a deep question. And I think that the problem is that our financial markets are inherently somewhat unstable. When we start thinking up really important new ways of doing financial business, they start to grow and they get huge, get bigger and bigger before you know, it, it, it's amazing how things can suddenly grow and then nobody understands them. So there's a vulnerability. I was just the got the latest number. Do you know how much credit default swaps there are? Outstanding. According to the bank for international settlements, there are now $52 trillion worth of credit. Default swaps, outstanding. $52 trillion with a GDP of the United States is only 14 trillion. So how can that be $52 trillion and these things all I came in in the last 10 years or so. Um, and so I called the bank and economist at the vis and said, can you please explain it to me?

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       Where is this 52 trillion coming from? Uh, and, uh, I got a note from him and still trying to figure it all out. But that's what happens. The system performs very well and then it becomes vulnerable. Nobody understands all of it. So that's, that's the problem. Uh, and, uh, the other side of it though is there was a recent study that looked at financial crises and compared countries that have had financial crises with countries that haven't. And the conclusion was that countries that have experienced financial crises are generally more successful on average over the long haul than countries that haven't. Uh, and so in that sense, a financial crisis is assign just that you're moving with the times, uh, and you know, you, you're making a lot of money and so then things suddenly blow up on you, but hey, you're, you'll recover and you'll figure something out.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       And then you have moved from there. Uh, so I don't know that, uh, Paulson's proposed Parsons proposals. I kind of like them. Uh, but I think that they're not enough. That's why I'm writing a book about this. I think there's a lot more to be done, but even if you did everything that I would do, we would still have a vulnerability. The financial crises. And part of the reason why I'm endorsing this market stability regulator, uh, is that I think that there's no way that we can just guarantee there's no way we can set up a system that is both very effective in allocating resources. And that is also, that is also a very stable, uh, so, you know, just like when we went to the moon and we sent people up into space, one of those space shuttles blew up. Well that's what happens.

Speaker 1:          00:23:22       Uh, but most of them made it all right. So, um, uh, that's the way it is in, in finance as well. So anyway, I'm here to talk today about investment banking, uh, which of course is relevant to this is all part of this general thing. But, uh, let me, uh, I said earlier that investment banking seems to be a great interest of students at Yale. Uh, that's because they get some really great jobs there. Uh, it's a, uh, investment banking is a very important economic institution and its fundamental, what they do is fundamental to what happens in our economy. And so, uh, as a result, uh, people who work for them have a chance, uh, for great economic success. And I'm not saying you want a job at an investment bank because it's also a demanding and difficult. And, uh, I, I've talked to some of our students who have been taken jobs at investment banks and, uh, sometimes I think they're probably too demanding.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       As a young person, you should be enjoying your youth and not getting dragged in to some huge investment bank. And some, there are some terrible stories. Young people who took, uh, who left the college five, 10 years ago and they got a job at bear Stearns, uh, and bear Stearns demand. I'm just making this story up, but it must be something like this for somebody demanded 80 hour, a hundred hour week devotion to the job, but they kept paying in bear Stearns stock and the extent the student was making millions every year, uh, meanwhile, uh, was, uh, his youth was going away. And, uh, now, uh, this imaginary student is now 33 years old. Never had time to marry or have you started a normal life. And then the whole thing blows up and all the various during stock is worth just about nothing. Um, so that's the kind of mistake you don't want to make.

Speaker 1:          00:25:34       Uh, I, I find the industry very interesting. You have to form some kind of balance in your life and not let anyone demand a hundred hours a week of your time. Uh, and if they do, you should sell the stock they give you as soon as you can diversify. Uh, but I also like investment banking because I've created one. We have, um, uh, my colleagues and I founded a investment bank called macro markets. Uh, and I'm not actually running it. I'm a coffee. It's named after a book I wrote called macro markets. Uh, and we're not a very big important bank yet, but it makes me interested in the whole field. Uh, uh, we have only hired one Yale students so far because we're too tiny a to if there were not hiring in case you wonder. Uh, uh, uh, so yeah, it was a student in this class that we hired, but again, that's, that's all history. So, um, so anyway, uh, what does investment banking, which is the subject of, uh, investment banking, uh, means the underwriting of securities. There's a, that is arranging for the issuance by corporations of stocks and bonds. So the, the term bank is misleading because, uh, we often use it, I'm writing over here, a depository institution,

Speaker 1:          00:27:15       uh, is an institution that accepts deposits and make loans or invest the money from the deposit. Do you know what I mean by it depends. If you go to a savings bank or a savings and loan or a commercial bank and you say, I want to open up a checking account that's a deposit, or I want to open up a savings account, that's a deposit. Okay? The thing about a deposit is you deposit your money as an individual and there are millions of people that all deposit, uh, in, in a depository institution. And then, uh, later on whenever you want, you can take your money out. Meanwhile, they invest the deposit somewhere or another at a higher interest rate than they pay on the deposits and they make the difference. And that's how they make a profit. So I often use the word bank to refer.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       And so does everyone do a depository institution. But if you look at what the law says, they tend to use the word depository institution and Investment Bank. If it's doing our pure investment banking business is not a depository institution. So if you go into an investment bank and say, I want to open up a deposit, they'll say you should go next door to the credit union or something. We don't do that. Uh, so the word bank is somewhat misleading. Uh, on the other hand, historically, most institutions, uh, uh, do both. If you go around the world, uh, most banks, most depository institutions are also involved in investment banking. But let me just get right under here. And investment banking does underwriting of securities.

Speaker 3:          00:29:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       And what does that mean? That means they,

Speaker 1:          00:29:11       they, uh, arrange for the issuance by other institutions of securities. So, for example, if Ford Motor Company wants to, uh, issue corporate bonds or they want to issue new shares, they would go to an investment bank and the investment bank, we'd say, okay, we can underwrite for you, but we'll do it for you. So, um, uh, so a pure investment bank a is not a depository institution and it's also a pure investment bank is not a broker dealer either. They're not trading and securities there, although they would, they would deal insecurities as a part of the underwriting process, but they're not. Uh, you wouldn't go to an investment, a pure investment bank either and say, I want to buy a hundred shares of Ford Motor Company. Where's your stockbroker? They wouldn't be dealing with that. They would, they deal, their customers are companies. Uh, and uh, they wouldn't do that either now, but in many cases, firms do a mixture of different activities, one of which is investment banking.

Speaker 1:          00:30:19       But there's a peculiar, um, it's a story that refers particularly do America, United States. And that is the glass steagall act of 1933. Again, you see everything happened in the 30s. Uh, the stock market crash in 1929 cause tremendous chaos in the financial markets. And, uh, Carter Glass, uh, was a senator from Virginia and he, and I think it's Henry Stegal, uh, put together a bill, which passed congress and was signed by President Roosevelt. Uh, that said that, uh, we want to, um, make a law saying that investment banks, uh, cannot be combined with commercial banks or insurance investment banking had to be a separate from, okay, this was what they said in 1933. You could not be both a depository institution and an investment bank. So they said, after this act, every bank has to choose one or the other. Do you want to be investment bank or Commercial Bank?

Speaker 1:          00:31:38       So for example, then JP Morgan in the United States was founded by a man named James Pierpont Morgan. Uh, and it was one of the biggest banks in the U S uh, in 1933, it was told you gotta make a choice. Uh, are you an investment bank or a commercial bank? Uh, and so JP Morgan made a choice, a and said, well, we'll go to be commercial bank. And so they stopped their investment banking business, uh, in 1933 they've since gotten back into it, but, uh, that, that's the, but for a long time they became a commercial bank. So what happened? They had a lot of people at JP Morgan who were doing investment banking, uh, and they, um, uh, they, uh, uh, were upset because Davey Morgan was shutting them down. So, uh, there was a Mr. Stanley, I forget his first name now, uh, who has, I've mentioned him cause he was a Yale graduate and, uh, he got the guys together from JP Morgan who did investment banking. Um, and JP Morgan was dead already, but, uh, his son, the young Morgan, uh, and he created Morgan Stanley. Okay. I have the suspicion that Mr. Stanley put, uh, the son of JP Morgan on just for the prestige of the name. It sounds a lot better. Right. Morgan Stanley, uh, and so this became an investment bank.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       And now JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are over 70, 75 years later. Our competitors.

Speaker 2:          00:33:30       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       so, uh, so that, that is the important history of glass. Steagall um, but the problem is that as the years went on, uh, in the U s we had a division between investment banking and commercial banking, but in Europe, uh, and in other places of the world, their banks were under no such restriction is there was a lot of complaints that are laws in the U s we're handicapping the, uh, u s banks. Uh, and, uh, so, uh, finally glass steagall was repealed,

Speaker 2:          00:34:07       uh, and, uh, that didn't happen until 1999. So we have the gram, oops Leach Bliley if I'm the AF spelling this right act of 1999 which repealed,

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       uh, glass steagall. Uh, and so that led then to a whole wave of mergers of investment banks. Uh, so JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley could presumably have merged, but they didn't, uh, they become too much competitors. Uh, and, and, uh, they, they just developed their own, uh, they just, uh, internally adopted more broad a definition of their business. Um, so, uh, but there's lots of mergers that we can talk about that came, uh, either sometimes they occur just before 1999.

Speaker 2:          00:35:16       Uh, but, um, uh, which, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:35:26       uh, so for example, um,

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       travelers,

Speaker 1:          00:35:34       and this is the, the new, uh, Gramm Leach bill also allowed insurance companies to merge with commercial bank. So travelers insurance, uh, and Citi Group marriaged, uh, in 1998. I know that's before the bill. That was as the bill was just about to happen. Um, and then, uh, JP Morgan and chase a merged in, um, how 2000, uh, and then, uh, UBS, uh, and, um, uh, Paine Webber, um, merged in 2000, um, and, uh, Credit Suisse, a Swiss bank and Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.

Speaker 2:          00:36:38       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:36:45       Donaldson was the dean of our business school here at Som, but that merger occurred in 2000.

Speaker 2:          00:36:55       So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       so there's some examples. So now we're, we're seeing a movement back toward a, so that a bank has an investment banking business within it, but it's not just an investment back. Uh, and so, uh, sometimes hard to define what something he has. There's been a lot of news just in the last year or even more recently, like yesterday, or like tomorrow, this morning's paper about an investment banks, because under the current financial crisis, uh, they are buckling there. A lot of them are in trouble. Uh, and that's why it's big news. Uh, so I give you some examples. Um, I mentioned, I mentioned bear Stearns. Um, so, uh, bear Sterns,

Speaker 2:          00:37:57       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:37:58       was founded in 1923 by, uh, uh, Joseph Bear and Robert Stern's. Uh, I just try to find something out about them and they don't seem to be very well known. I couldn't tell you, but not on the web. There's no bear stern. There's no Joseph Bear is my work club on the web, but whatever they set up was really big for awhile. So, uh, I'm gonna say from 1923 to 2008 when it went bust, so it lasted a 85 years. Uh, so, uh, it's, uh, it has investment banking business, but it also has private equity business and private banking. Uh, and, uh, it started to get in trouble during the current, in fact, it was maybe the first a US investment bank to get in trouble in the current financial crisis because it was in, um, uh, June of 2007, uh, they had, uh, some of their funds collapsed.

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       They, they had funds that we're investing in subprime mortgages. Uh, and this is a sign of something wrong. The names of these funds were, uh, the bear Stearns high grade structured credit fund. You have to say high grade, high grade is supposed to mean and finance that it's not going to fail on your right. Well, uh, and they had, uh, they had another one called the bear Stearns high grade structured structured credit enhanced leverage fund. That sounds a little bit contradictory. You should, as a consumer of financial products, wonder when they put both high grade and leveraged in the same name. Right? High grade is supposed to mean safe, but leverage sounds like the opposite, doesn't it? If you leverage means that they borrowed a lot of money to buy risky subprime securities. So if they borrowed 80% of the money, the security is only half to lose 20% of the value for you to be wiped out.

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       Right? So that shouldn't be high grade if it's so leveraged. So anyway, these two funds were wiped out. Uh, and uh, bear Stearns had to give, uh, uh, deal, uh, three point $2 billion. That was last summer, but they, the news kept getting worse and worse. Apparently bears had invested a lot in securities that were, uh, unstable. And so it finally became where rumors started developing that bear was, it was really rumors that killed there. The rumors started going, now you know, bear is in trouble. And so there you're going to be, they're going to be in bankrupt before long. This is exactly the market stability problem that Paulson is talking about. Once the rumors get started, everybody is saying, don't, don't do anything with bear. Don't, don't lend them any money. Don't just stay away from them. Even young people who are getting jobs and they were right to right to think this, don't even take a job with them because you're going to be on the street again shortly.

Speaker 1:          00:41:14       So it's that kind of rumor that kills bear Stearns. Uh, and so they couldn't, they couldn't pay their bills and, and they, they were finding it difficult to sell their assets to come up with money. Uh, and so, uh, the Fed decided to bail them out. This was a huge fed bailout. Well, they didn't want, uh, the Fed didn't want to bail out the stockholders. They didn't want to just give money to people who didn't invest because the firms are supposed to be allowed to fail. So what the Fed did is it gave a line of credit to JP Morgan and non-recourse line of credit to buy bear Stearns. And what it amounted to was that the Fed would take a troubled, a securities that bear Stearns couldn't sell. It would take that as collateral for eight $29 billion loan to JP Morgan, uh, under the condition that JP Morgan would buy bear Stearns.

Speaker 1:          00:42:21       And it was supposed to be at $2 a share. Uh, and so that left the total value of bear Stearns at a little over 200 million, which is pretty tiny compared to what they were worth. Um, which was in the tens of billions short while ago. Uh, but the, the Fed didn't want a disorderly collapse. So, uh, so it was a, uh, a $29 billion loan to JP Morgan. This is highly controversial these days because, uh, uh, uh, the Fed isn't normally doing this sort of thing. Why would it be lending money to JP Morgan to buy another company? You know, you say, how is that benefiting the, the average person in this country? Uh, but it does benefit them because if they didn't do this, bear Stearns would have dumped its assets on the mock market. Uh, it would go down in flames. Uh, lots of its debts would become, uh, lots of people who had, uh, you know, accounts with bear Stearns and find that their accounts were destroyed.

Speaker 1:          00:43:30       Uh, and, uh, and then what would it do? It might lead to contagion to other financial institute. People would say, well, it happened to bear who's next? And so there'd be this huge pulling back. So the Fed decided to bail, bail them out. And that's what they did. Now it's not clear that it's over. If you read this morning's paper, Lehman Brothers is another, uh, another, uh, investment bank that, uh, uh, is rumored to be in trouble. And so, um, it's, it's got to do something about these rumors, uh, because it can kill them, kill them, just the rumors, no one what we'll want to do anything with them. So it was in this morning's paper or yesterday's news that they have arranged to raise capital, uh, on the, on the markets, uh, and it was not entirely clear. That means that they're, they're getting people who are willing to invest, give them, uh, invest in the company.

Speaker 1:          00:44:33       Uh, and it's a sign of confidence in Lehman brothers that someone would do that at this critical time. Um, so another story that came in yesterday was UBS. I mentioned before it was a Swiss bank, but it's not Swiss and it's international. I started out, uh, as the Union Bank of Switzerland. That's what it stands for. Union Bank of Switzerland, which was, uh, uh, the result of a merger between two Swiss banks around 1900. Uh, but then it had, uh, I mentioned merged, uh, with Paine Webber and it's become an international corporation. So they, they just call themselves UBS. But in, in this morning's newspaper, uh, it said that UBS announced that it has lost, um, what was it? The same way? Remember what the numbers were?

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       What's that?

Speaker 1:          00:45:31       They've lost 19 billion. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:45:34       Right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:37       So, uh, yeah, so that's a huge loss. $19 billion. It's a substantial part of their market cap, but they are also announcing that they are arranging to raise capital as well. So, uh, the news that these firms which are rumored to be in trouble, are managing to raise capital. Uh, Boyd markets. Yesterday we had a big upsurge in the stock market. Uh, it was,

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       well yesterday was the first day of the second quarter and the newspapers were reporting that it was the biggest, uh, upsurge on the mark on the first day of a new quarter since 1938. Um, I looked at that with some curiosity because 1938 was not such a great year after all who were still on the depression. Uh, I think, uh, I have to look up the market didn't do great after that then. So it doesn't, this doesn't predict much one way or the other.

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       Uh, but, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       so anyway, this is where we are now. It's an interesting situation. If you are thinking of taking a job at one of these companies, you might consider the, uh, look out there a situation because some of these companies could, uh, follow the way of, of bear Stearns. Um, at this point, uh, we have the Fed aggressively landing. I'm trying to prevent another thing, but you know, the Fed is not in the business of making sure that your career is a success there in the business of preventing a systemic failure. So while the Fed, uh, arranged for an orderly dissolution of bear Stearns, it didn't do a whole lot of good to their employees who, uh, we'll see what happens to all of them. I don't know the whole story, but, um, uh, it's a tumultuous world out there. It's not a, it's not like you live in an academic environment where Yale University has been in business for over 300 years and it looks so stable here.

Speaker 1:          00:47:42       Well, this is a very stable business and these other businesses are not so stable. But anyway, I wanted to talk about the underwriting process and um, uh, what it's done. So, uh, I think underwriting of securities, uh, is, um, uh, it's analogous. The investment banking business is analogous to the business done by, um, by ordinary commercial banks in the sense that it deals with the moral hazard problem and an asymmetric information problem. We were talking about, uh, about what banks do, commercial banks. Remember I was telling the story that, uh, the big problem with lending to companies is that it's hard to tell whether they are really deserving of the loan or not. And so a commercial banker is someone who spent lives in a business community and keeps abreast of everything that's going on and plays golf with all the local business people and has a sense, here's the gossip, has a sense of who's responsible, who will pay back alone, who's got a business that's really going, who's got a business that's sick and on the way out.

Speaker 1:          00:49:00       Uh, and so that's what a bank does. So everyone else who wants to invest doesn't know this, but they put their money in the bank. And then that's the idea. So the moral hazard is that moral hazard that the company, uh, which, which receives a loan from the bank would take the money and run. And the asymmetric information problem is that, uh, you as a investor, if you were to make loans directly to a company, you would be suffering at a disadvantage because you know, less than other people. Uh, you don't play golf with these people. And so you would end up taking on the worst loans, loans that would fail. Well, the same thing applies to underwriting because, uh, but they do it in a different way. Instead of a certifying, instead of creating deposits at a bank, they, uh, they underwrite securities and they are not taking the money.

Speaker 1:          00:50:02       They're just an intermediary between you, the public and the issuer of the security. But it's much the same thing. It's the reputation of the, uh, of the bank that, uh, makes it possible for firms to, uh, uh, uh, it makes it possible for firms to issue securities. So, so the, the underwriting, uh, is very important to understand, uh, because, uh, it's a process that allows, uh, issuers of securities to, uh, take advantage of the reputation of the underwriters. The issuer of the security may not be so well known or not so well understood. Uh, and so the, the, what happens is, uh, the underwriter, it's a little w w what's a good analogy? I was, I was going to say it's like a dating service, but that, I guess dating services don't do this. Right? They don't call, they don't testify to the moral character.

Speaker 1:          00:51:07       They should. It would be nice. Did they do that? Does anyone do that? Uh, they probably can't. Right? That's an, that's an even bigger moral hazard problem. When you're looking for a spouse, you have a huge moral hazard problem and there's nobody there to help you as far as I know. But at least in the business world, we have professionals. So there are matchmakers in a sense, they're trying to match up, uh, a company that's issuing securities to buyers of the securities. Uh, and, uh, this is an important reason for a difference between investment banking and other aspects of, um, of finance. Investment. Bankers will compare it particularly to traders. Investment bankers like to cultivate an image of sober responsibility and good citizenship, uh, because, uh, they thrive on their reputation. And so they, to be successful as an investment banker, you have to be so impressive.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       Uh, and so it's such high character that companies like Ford and GM will come to you to represent them in the sale of their securities. So as a result, investment bankers tend to be well dressed. They tend to be, uh, a patrician in their appearances and manner. And, uh, in contrast, traders, uh, tend to have a vulgar accents. They shout on the phone and they slam the phone down, they roll up their sleeves, they dribble food on their shirt and maybe putting them down too much. Uh, so, uh, uh, I personally think that we have a strength at Yale because of our patrician image, uh, in providing people to work for this field. So, uh, typically investment bankers go to the symphony on Saturday night. But beyond that, if you open up the program at the symphony, you'll see their name under platinum sponsor of the program.

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       And so that's the kind of people that go into investment bank and they do it because they have to manage this underwriting process well. So what does the underwriting process? Uh, okay. Well, uh, what happens is a company that is thinking of issue, it's at, say you're at any company, a big company. It doesn't matter. Uh, people don't trust big companies even if had been around a hundred years. So if Ford Motor Company, it's been around since when, uh, something that like around 1900, but people sure don't trust it anymore because it's had a history of trouble. This is not a question just of morality or the thing. It's a question of are you willing to buy their securities? So they would go to an investment banker and a, and say we need money. We'd like to raise it by say, issuing shares and in our company, and then, uh, the, uh, they would probably contact a number of investment banks, uh, and try to make a deal. Now that there's, um, there's two kinds of deals. There's a bought deal and a best efforts.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       Uh, the difference is, uh, some investment bankers will tell the company, uh, we will, um, we will, you want to issue these shares? Fine. Sell them to us, we'll, we'll take it, we'll give you a price. Of course, the Investment Bank doesn't want to hold these shares, but the investment bank knows the public well enough to know which shares it can sell. So in a, in a bought deal, the investment bank is taking the risk that they might not be able to sell the shares at a, at a decent price, they might lose on it. Uh, but, uh, also there's a different kind of offering, uh, which, uh, uh, maybe the best you could get, it's called a best efforts are offering. And here the, uh, investment banker will not buy the deal, but it will say that we will use our best efforts to place this.

Speaker 1:          00:55:17       Uh, and uh, if you have a minimum price, uh, we hope we can get above there. Otherwise the dealer will fall through. Uh, and so, uh, the underwriting process, um, uh, is, uh, it takes the form of, uh, uh, it's actually very much regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. So the process, uh, is formalized. Uh, so, uh, in order to issue securities, you were talking about public securities here, you have to register them with the SEC. And so the sec then becomes a partner in a partner, her, an adversary in your effort to issue these securities. So the SEC securities and Exchange Commission, all of this might be changed next year. Who knows? But this is the way it is right now. Uh, so, uh, the, the law says there's a pre filing period. You have to file with the SEC, uh, to get, uh, um, your, your security is effective. So the idea of I'll say Ford Motor Company wants to issue new shares, they go to the investment bank. A then the investment bank negotiates with the, uh, affirm with Ford about what kind of a securities that wants the issue and what price is reasonable. Uh, and during this period, the sec says there's no talk, uh, to the public about the shares, uh, uh, at during this period, uh, no talk publicly,

Speaker 2:          00:57:04       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       the fee, the sec wants to manage the process so that everything is done appropriately. Um, at this point during the pre filing period, the, uh, the investment bank forms a syndicate of other end of other

Speaker 1:          00:57:23       underwriters and they have, they sign an agreement among underwriters. Usually one investment bank is not big enough to handle a big issue and it wants to get help of other investment banks. And so they form a syndicate of underwriters during the pre filing period. Uh, so, uh, the underwriter, there's a lead underwriter, which of Ford Motor Company approached first and the lead underwriter promised to take on the issue. Uh, but the lead underwriter doesn't want to do it itself. And the reason it doesn't want to do it just itself is that in order to sell an issue to a broad public, you have to make use of a broad network of contacts with the public. And, uh, no one underwriter, no one investment bank has, has them all. So they formed a syndicate or a group of investment banks that, um, that are all participating in the issue of the security. Uh, and then they, uh, then they file and then there's what's called a cooling off period.

Speaker 2:          00:58:39       Uh, when the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       security is in registration. So they file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, uh, a, a prospectus for the preliminary prospectus.

Speaker 2:          00:58:54       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:59:00       this goes to the federal, to the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval. It's not really approval of the issue, but it's, it's, um, uh, registration of the issue. Uh, and, uh, the preliminary prospectus, uh, is called the red herring.

Speaker 1:          00:59:26       And, uh, the red herring, it's lost in history, why they call it that. There's different theories about it. It, uh, uh, herring of course, is a type of fish. Uh, and the best explanation that I can get for this name for the preliminary perspectives is that it was, uh, referring to an activity that hunters used to do with dogs. Uh, and if I should tell you this story is about, I'd like to know why they call it a red herring. Uh, if you have hunting dogs, they're supposed to track down a fox by their sense of smell. Uh, and so at one pace you can put your dogs through is to try to try to confuse them. And they would take a, a red herring, which is a very smelly kind of fish, and they would drag it around and over the trail of the Fox.

Speaker 1:          01:00:20       And it's very difficult for dogs to still smell the fax over that smell. And so the word red herring became known as a euphemism for something trying to distract and confused. And so it was a joke, I think it was a joke on Wall Street that the prospectus is really just there to try to confuse you. And so they called it the red herring. Um, but the preliminary prospectus is now often printed with red borders on it to indicate that it's the red herring and it's only preliminary. Uh, and so, uh, finally it is the Fed evaluates the prospectus and make sure that it accords with all regulations. It puts it up on its website, uh, at the sec while it's in registration. Uh, and again, during the cooling off period, uh, firms are allowed to circulate the preliminary prospectus. Underwriters are allowed to circulate the preliminary prospectus with a potential buyers, uh, but they're not supposed to say anything besides what's in the preliminary perspectives.

Speaker 1:          01:01:33       There with are concerned about the SDC is concerned about people overselling securities. Uh, and so they might point out advantages of it and not the disadvantages. The idea of it perspective. What's in a prospectus. A prospectus is a document that completely tells everything about a security. The whole idea of the sec is that we're not letting anyone pull the wool over your eyes. That's why it really shouldn't be called a red herring. It's not supposed to deceive you. It's supposed to pour out everything about the security. One thing that's in a prospectus, a preliminary or final prospectus, is the company thinks of everything bad that could ever happen. If you read prospectuses, they'll say awful things. If you read them, care for them. Let's say this company could lose everything. We could be sued, we could be going to jail, we might have done all sorts of, I may be exaggerating, but uh, the, the lawyers put everything imaginable that could go wrong with US investment in there.

Speaker 1:          01:02:32       And they do it. Of course, it's in kind of fine print, but it's all in there so that it's disclosed. And so later, if someone loses money in the investment and wants to sue them, then they'll say, well, look, you know, it's in our prospectus. And the reason that the SCC doesn't want them to talk about securities at this point except to give the prospectus is so that they can't conceal and hide these things. So this is the sec process. This process says that the underwriters have to give out the prospectus, and that's all they can do. They can't have a separate brochure. They can't, your broker can't say, well, we're, we're thinking of a issuing a security, uh, we've got this perspectives, but I'm going to send you a brochure instead. That's easier. Okay. Sec says, no way because that brochure will be a sales job and it won't have all of this in there.

Speaker 1:          01:03:27       So anyway, then eventually the SCC approves it, uh, and when it's approved, then it's effective. Uh, and then, uh, then the, uh, then the underwriters can start selling the security. Uh, and at that point, uh, they actually, it depends on say it's a best efforts offering. Then they go around and they try to, they get a buyers of the security lined up. Now you have to understand that there's a problem issuing a new security securities that are already out there and trading. Everybody knows about them and, and there's, there's a market for them. But if you're issuing a new security, uh, especially there's a, if it's a company that is issuing shares for the first time an IPO is an initial public offering, an IPO is the first time that a company issues shares. So the company is not known to the public. Uh, and so it's very hard to get IPOs started because the company is just not known.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       So it's very important that the underwriters are able to get attention and get a market going for the IPO. Um, during the, uh, cooling off period, uh, uh, firms also are allowed to place according to the a sec something called a tombstone. And that is an ad in the newspaper, which we'll announce the, the, uh, security and what it's very dignified ad cause it has to meet with the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But a tombstone will say, Ford Motor Company, uh, uh, you know, 1 million shares, uh, offered, uh, and then it will, um, it will list all of the underwriting syndicate. So it'd be a list of all the investment banks that participated in the issue. Um, and, uh, so, um, so that's the basic process that underwriters go through to issue securities. Now part of the thing is I just wanted to close with, uh, basically I think that, uh, investment banks are very similar to impresarios in what they do.

Speaker 1:          01:06:03       They, but there's what I mean by an Impresario is someone who manages a singer or a musician, uh, in concerts, uh, a, uh, but it's a little different, but, uh, a underwriter is managing the career of a security just like somebody else would be managing the career of a singer. And they're very concerned about the reputation and they're very concerned about getting sold out performances all the time. Now, one thing about Ipos is that, uh, they are very hard to get a new security for a new company going because nobody knows this company. And so, uh, the price movements of an IPO tend to be very volatile. Uh, and it's because of the difficulty in getting IPO is going. Underwriters have peculiar practices, uh, in issuing them. And it tends to go like this. Underwriters tend, and there's been a lot of documentation of this to underprice Ipos that is, they sell them for less than they could get.

Speaker 1:          01:07:20       Uh, and that means that Ipos tend to be oversubscribed. Okay. Uh, and this sounds strange. Why would it work this way? So you, you, you can try this. Call your broker if you have a broker. Does anyone here have a broker? Maybe somebody does, but think about this anyway. You could call a broker and fire and say, Hey, I hear about IPO as I'd like to get in on some. Okay. What do you think the broker will say? Well, the broker will say, okay, let me see what I can do for you. And he doesn't call you back. And You wonder, well, why does this person not want my business? Uh, well, the reason is that you haven't been a good guy yet. You know, you haven't been giving the broker other business, uh, and you hear stories about IPO is that did spectacularly well.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       Uh, yeah, jumped 30% on the first day and you say, Hey, I want that. Um, but um, it becomes sort of a game they're playing. It's a little bit like trying to get tickets to some rare concert. Okay. I mean, people will sometimes, or there's a, someone coming to a toads who's, I don't, I don't go there, but if you know about someone who's very famous is coming to toads, right? And you have trouble getting tickets, is that right? Does anything like this happen here? It happened somewhere anyway. And so you might end up standing in line for hours and the first time the ticket office opens, right? And then it sets up rumors going that, wow, you know, this is a difficult concert to get into. Uh, and then people start trading the tickets afterwards or someone out there asking more money than it says on the ticket.

Speaker 1:          01:09:07       We have to understand that that whole event was staged by an Impresario. Right? So there's someone who responsible for the reputation of this performer. Okay. And this guy says, there's no way that our performance is going to go in and perform to a half empty house. We've got to pack them in and we want people lining up on the streets. Cause it sense, it gives a sense of excitement that this person is a star. But you know this, right? The stars are managed and they're not just spectacularly good singers. They're, the Impresario is critically important in maintaining the career of a singer and the [inaudible]. I was very concerned about appearances. And so you don't want to charge a really high price to get into toads because then it would only be wealthy people from the suburbs would becoming, and it would destroy the whole atmosphere of the place, right?

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       So you've got to charge reasonably low price tickets. Uh, and then a lot of people will come flocking to you. Uh, and then that would create the excitement. The underwriters do the same thing with Ipos. So they under priced them typically, and it creates this huge, uh, excitement about, can I get in on this IPO? Uh, and, um, and that excitement generates more business. So, uh, and it also generates a reputation for the underwriter. People see the tombstone and they know that this, this IPO did extremely well. It jumped up, you know, a high amount in the first day and people think this underwriter is really something I want to get in and other offerings of that underwriter. And so the reputation of the underwriter grows. So it's really a reputation business and these people know something about investor psychology and uh, you, you might consider it some kind of market manipulation, but it's all perfectly legal because the sec allows this kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          01:11:02       But, uh, so anyway, coming back to the problem that we're having now is that I'm emphasizing that investment bankers need reputation there. Their whole business is a reputation business. And so when something happens to bear Stearns, it's critical for the whole industry. And now when it's happening repeatedly to various other banks, uh, it becomes a, uh, a critical turning point. Uh, so the market, the stock market went up a lot yesterday because of the encouraging news that some of these investment banks were able to raise more capital. Uh, and it's an ongoing saga, but it's all Kusamba that's played out in terms of investment. And so I find it difficult to predict what's going to happen next. Uh, it's very hard to know. Um, right now, yes, as of yesterday, we had some encouraging news, but this is something that we'll just have to keep watching. I think this will play out over a years. This thing is not going to be over tomorrow, so we'll have more interesting things to talk about later this semester. And, uh, there'll be things to watch, uh, to follow up on over the years. Okay. So we're going to talk next period about investment management.
