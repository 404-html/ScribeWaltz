Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Next wednesday, we're having David Swensen, uh, lecture to us, uh, and he heads up the Yale and dam or the investment of the Yale endowment. Uh, and, uh, I have, uh, a New York Times article on the syllabus, just like sort of a biography of him. You could read on reserve. I have his, uh, uh, his recent books. Uh, so I hope that you will get a lot from him. Uh, he, uh, I misspoke. He's not a Yale College graduate. He's a yell. He can omics phd is undergraduate, was from University of Wisconsin. Um, but he's been at Yale for a very long time. He came to Yale from Wall Street in 1985. And at that time, the Yale endowment was worth about $1 billion. Uh, it, it is now under his leadership 22.5 billion. Uh, and that, that, uh, that, that explains a lot of the quality of your life.

Speaker 1:          00:01:09       Um, because that means we have about $2 million per student. Uh, and the interest on $2 million is a, what is that? Uh, a hundred. I can't even do division. About a hundred thousand dollars a year. Uh, and so that's why a Yale is more, much more generous with financial aid than other universities and why we have beautiful Chris. This room was built, I believe in the 30s. I don't think David Swensen for this room, but for a lot of other things. Uh, so, uh, Yale I had a 28% return on its portfolio last year, which was number one of all college endowments. Uh, moreover it had a 17.8% average return for the last 10 years, which is number one among a university endowments. Um, we beat Harvard, we beat France, but actually, uh, Princeton was the head of the Princeton endowment is a protege of David Swensen. Uh, and I'm sure that these people get together and talk.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       All of the major university Harvard has been doing very well too. And so has a Duke Mit Amhurst a lot of it seems that universities, uh, managed to invest very well. Uh, at least they have in recent decades. I think that has my theory, that has something to do with the intellectual atmosphere at universities that, uh, investing well in requires a careful study. And the intellectual tradition we have at universities, uh, helps promote the, so, uh, I dunno if David Swinson can continue to do this. I think we're, uh, he's had a spectacular return, but he's getting into a challenging year. This is a year of financial crises, so I'm warning you ahead that don't expect a 28% return and the yell portfolio, uh, for the coming year. Um, you can ask him about that. I don't know if he can do it again in this car and this situation. That will be amazing. Uh, okay. So that, that would be next Wednesday. So, um, meanwhile, uh, I wanted to, uh, talk today about regulation. Uh, and, uh, wow.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       I think we're all right. Um, yeah, something needs more regulation here. I think so, uh, all these wires. So, uh, I wanted to motivate regulation in terms of the last lecture that our previous lecture was about behavioral finance and it was about human failings. Uh, and I think that, uh, we motivate a lot of our regulation of financial markets by the kinds of errors that people make. And I wanted to list a few, uh, uh, a few errors that are well known, uh, and that, uh, are exploited by unscrupulous people in finance. Uh, and so I think they motivate a lot of what a regular itself. I'm going to write a number of principles of behavioral finance down and just mention them briefly and then we'll turn to regulation. So, uh, these are things from the field of psychology,

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       wishful thinking. This refers to the fact that people, uh, this sounds like something you probably already know how, but it's been documented by psychologist. People tend to make the air of believing what they want to believe. All right. Uh, so for example, uh, people tend to believe that their team will win. This has been documented by psychologist. They have a bias. If you ask them, what's the probability that Yale or when the Yale Harvard game, uh, don't expect ELL students or Harvard students to give a, by unbiased probability, you tend to in your mind think that you're going to win. Uh, and this also applies to elections and we just had a primary, uh, uh, yesterday. People tend to assume that the candidate that they believe in, we'll win. So it's well known and this is something that can be exploited by, uh, people selling investments. Uh, second thing, attention anomalies,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       um, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:06:03       these are a human attention, tends to be sporadic. Uh, that is that you, the errors that people naturally make are often errors of inattention. You'll look at certain things and you overly, uh, you pay too much attention to some things and too little to others. Um, this is, uh, uh, this is something that psychologists have been talking about for over a hundred years. Uh, human attention is part of human intelligence. We have to know what to pay attention to and people have who are not good and focusing their attention on the right things. And that talking just about attention deficit disorder and talking about some more high level question of how you know, what you should be paying attention to. Uh, and, uh, under attention there's a social basis for attention. And that is that people tend to pay attention to what other people are paying attention to. And so, uh, uh, it's easy to sweep things under the rug and get people to forget something. Uh, the kinds of things that are naturally talked about yet excessive attention and the details tend to get forgotten. Uh, three is anchoring.

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       This refers to a, uh, a tendency for people in making quantitative judgements to subconsciously have their judgments anchored by some arbitrary stimulus. Uh, and I mentioned overconfidence last period. We then tend to have overconfidence in our anchor judgments. Uh, so, um, the, the, the classic experiment that demonstrated anchoring was caught on an diverse, I'm writing k and t a and a wheel of fortune experiment, which they did in 1974. Uh, what they did is they, uh, they, they got subjects to participate in a psychological experiment. And the experiment consisted of asking the subjects questions that had quantitative answers, which were always numbers from zero to 100. Uh, and then they said, I want to ask you a question about before you answered the question, I'm going to spin a wheel of fortune. You know, he, you know, the wheel of, it's like one of those things on quiz shows.

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       If you spin this big wheel that rotates for awhile and then it stops at one number, obviously a random number because this wheel of fortune head all the numbers from zero to a hundred. Okay? So one of the questions they asked was, what percent of African nations belong to the United Nations? Okay. And, uh, that apparently is a difficult question that most people didn't know in 1974. But they were, they did it. They said, we'll ask you the question and think about while you're thinking about it, don't answer yet. We're going to spin this wheel of fortune. And so it comes up with a random number. Okay. Then they ask for the answer. Well, it turns out that people tended to give an answer close to the number that came up on the wheel of fortune. All right? Now they perfectly well knew that the real, real unfortunate was random.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       Uh, so, uh, the experimenters, after they got the number, they say, hey, your number is almost the same as the number that just came up, uh, and people with. And he said, did you just give me the number that came off? And FIFA would deny it. They would say, oh no, I wasn't influenced by that number. The point of anchoring is that you are subconsciously influenced by numbers, uh, and that it affects your judgment. You think, you know. So for example, in looking at a stock part, if you ask people to predict a stock market price, they think of some number that they saw before, uh, and they are overly influenced by that number. So for example, if in the late 1990s you were to ask a question, I'm hypothesizing, ah, how likely is that the, is that the Dow will be over 10,000 by, by the year 2008. Uh, people might give that a low probability because it had never been over 10,000. And so they just had no psychological anchoring on that number. Um, so, uh, but once it passes 2000, then it seems completely natural. And that's anchoring related to this is, um, the, uh, representativeness heuristic.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       I can't even write this this long. We're representativeness heuristic. It seems to me that if you type this, you'll get a spellcheck error.

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:04       And that's kind of an first ski again. Uh, and it's related to anchoring in some sense. What it means is that, uh, it refers to a human tendency to judge events on the basis of similarity to other events that are prominent in our, in our mind without regard to the actual probability of the event. Uh, I'll give you a, and one of condiment and diversity is examples. People were asked, uh, to, uh, judge the occupation of a young woman, and it had a description of the young woman and the woman was described as sensitive, artistic, et cetera. Uh, and, uh, then the occupation that they were allowed where bank teller sculptress or something else. All right. Uh, many people chose sculptress because they thought, well, if she's a sensitive artistic woman, maybe she's a sculptress. Uh, but that is a, uh, uh, a terrible mistake because we should know that sculptress is a very rare, very few people have the job of a sculptress or a sculptor.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       Um, and so, uh, it's a mistake. So what it means is that people, well, gosh, and being caught here, what it means is that that's the stuff, that's why I ran my pocket. Uh, what it means is that, uh, we sometimes exaggerate in our imagination some rare event and it colors our thinking. Uh, so for example, the stock market crash of 1929 is repeatedly re expected even though it only happened once, but it's just a prominent in our thinking. And people are looking at stock prices to see patterns that they remember that are prominent in their thinking. And then those patterns, uh, are given an exaggerated probability. Uh, so when we looked at the random walk, the series, I think the representativeness heuristic played a role in there as well. When you're, when you look at a random walk, you have the intuitive impression that you can extrapolate it, but it doesn't look like you can't believe. It's really random. But the reason you can't is because you overweight the probability of certain, uh, things that caught your attention. Um, okay. So, um, there's some Maura,

Speaker 2:          00:13:39       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       so a five is gambling behaviors.

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       Anthropologists have found that, uh, gambling is present in all human cultures. Not that everyone gambles, but, uh, there will be you go to any human society and ask about it and there will be some game of chance that they play that, uh, uh, that influences their thinking. So, uh, the problem with, uh, uh, there's a problem with gambling behavior because in a certain fraction of the population, we have pathological gambling. Uh, one study estimated that 1.1% of men and a half a percent of women for some reason, more common among men than women, but in both sexes are pathological gamblers. That means it's like alcoholism. They cannot control themselves and it ruins their lives. They get divorces because the spouse compliance that, you know, my, my husband or wife gambled away the, all of her money and dad, but they can't stop themselves. There's an organization called gamblers anonymous, uh, which helps. It's like alcoholics anonymous. It helps people who are really in trouble. Uh, and this is a problem. Now. I think the financial industry attracts people like that. And so your overrepresented, if people who are not quite pathological, uh, people who are stimulated somehow by chance, uh, uh, and, uh, that is a, um, uh, a problem, uh, magical thinking.

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       Uh, this refers,

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       this actually goes back to BF. Skinner, a psychologist,

Speaker 3:          00:15:52       uh, Hu

Speaker 1:          00:15:54       were asked in the first half of this century, I actually had him as a next door neighbor is a strange thing. I was visiting, uh, uh, Harvard and MIT in Cambridge and I rented a house and this guy was next door. And he and I both used to walk into work together, not together. I never really met him, but I always felt an affinity with him. Now, he must've died 20 years ago now. But anyway, he did it. Famous experiment, uh, with pigeons, uh, which, uh, in the 1940s, uh, uh, 1948, uh, in which he induced strange behavior patterns in pigeons by the following simple experiment. The experiment was the, he would put the pigeon was in a cage, okay. And he'd let the pigeon get pretty hungry, okay. And hungry pigeon. And so not happy patients. And then he had a machine that granted each pigeon one piece of corn every 15 seconds.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       Okay. Uh, and so that's very frustratingly slow for a hungry pigeon. They get it, a feast, one piece every 15 seconds. And then he observed through time, uh, after subjecting pigeons to this torture for some time, they might be not approved by, it's not really torture. It's like dieting or something. You all lived through that, right? But, uh, stem, I torture for a vigil. He noticed that the pigeons were, it started behaving in strange ways. So, uh, and he kept them separate so they couldn't learn from each other. Uh, one patient was jumping up and down a lot, and another one was bobbing it's head. And another one was doing a kind of a little dance. And what he concluded was these pigeons were trying to figure out what makes those pieces of corn calm. And they started to think, well, he had to get the interval between corns, right to make this work.

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       But he started, the pigeons started to think effectively that, what was it I did just before that last piece of corn came, I was bobbing my head. So maybe I'd better Bob my head again. And sure enough, another piece of corn comes and they start assuming that what they were doing, uh, is making the corn calm. Uh, and so, but each one does a different thing. So if they're all in isolation, they would all be doing different things. But I think our financial markets are like that, that people, they develop some investment strategy and through pure chance it does well, but they, because of overconfidence and magical thinking, it starts to go to their ego. They think I'm really a smart investor. I've figured it out. Uh, and uh, it can reinforce the behavior, uh, uh, until they get to maybe some terrible end. And that doesn't necessarily work out as well. Bf Skinner's never let his pigeons starve and they all made it out. All right? Uh, there's something else called quasi magical thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:18:53       Uh, which was a term coined many years later by a Eldar Shafir year. Uh, and Amos touristy shall fear. Here's a young, uh, psychologist out of Princeton who teamed up with the old psychologist, Tversky, uh, and wrote this paper. Um, uh, and what it refers to is, uh, uh, people, uh, get the impression that they can control randomness. Maybe the patients were thinking that maybe not, we don't know, a chauffeur and Torsky referred experiments with people, not Fijians. Okay. And quasi magical thinking is a, a, an illusion, that big document, it occurs regularly and people, uh, which they might deny if asked about, but there's an illusion that I can control randomness to my willpower or my, uh, I won't talk about their experiments, but I just want to mention one by a Harvard psychologist, Ellen Langer.

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       I mentioned this before, but I, I think I mentioned it before. Uh, if you say, I want to ask you to bet on a coin toss, I, there's two different ways of doing it. One is to say how much, how much will you bet? And then I tossed the coin the other way as I tossed the coin first and I can see the outcome. And then I asked how much would you like to bet? And Langer found that people want to bet more if the coin hasn't been tossed yet. Okay, why would that be? Why would you care? It's still the same experiment. It appears that people at some think that they, they can exert willpower over it and control it. Uh, and this gives rise again to overconfidence among investors. It's also another example which is relevant. I don't know if any of you voted yesterday.

Speaker 1:          00:21:02       Um, why do people vote? Because economic theory would say that nobody ever votes if we're all a conventional economic theory says we're all relentlessly selfish and calculating, right? Isn't that what you've learned in economics? And so, uh, well maybe you didn't necessarily, but that is a canonical theory. But if you're relentlessly selfish and calculating, you would say, um, the chances that I decide the election or zero. Right? And so I just don't, I know that's not going to bother. The question is, you must have thought that, right? You know that you're not going to decide the election. Uh, and so what does it matter? And so if you can introspect and ask why is it that I vote, I think that at least for many of us, there is a, there is a sort of logical conundrum we go through and that is a, if good people don't vote, then we'll be in a bad world.

Speaker 1:          00:21:56       Okay? And so I have to vote to approve that good people vote. And then maybe it will happen. If I'm a good person, then other people will be good person. All right? This is magical thinking. Uh, and it, uh, it affects people because it gives them a sense of confidence and power, uh, over events that are thought to be random or uncontrollable. Uh, so, uh, it can also be something that can be exploited by, uh, by, uh, some not so nice people. Okay. I wanted to talk about a regulation that the problem with finance is that, uh, it's a beautiful financial institutions are beautiful structures, uh, but they only, uh, are as good as the people who use them. And so, uh, the problem is that history of finance is the history of a lot of people. Uh, a lot of people being exploited and treated badly.

Speaker 1:          00:23:06       So, uh, there's temptations of the market that, uh, people who, uh, no human psychology now that they can exploit human weaknesses. Uh, and so there's a temptation to oversell a investments that is promised that they will do well. Uh, you see this all the time. I was just seeing yesterdays paper. Someone was selling gold coins, one of the, you know, don't buy gold coins that, you know, that, right? But there were words in there. They said, of course, we cannot guarantee that they won't go up in value, but, uh, but historically they have always done it or something like that. They're trying to oversell, you know, that buying gold coins from some newspaper ad is not a smart investment. Um, but that they know that there will be people out there. Uh, you know, recent example of overselling the National Association of Realtors has been running ads saying that home prices have always doubled every 10 years. Uh, they, they didn't do it. They didn't work that they put it in the present tense home prices double every 10 years. So that's an organization of people who sell real estate and they have ad campaigns trying to convince you that home prices are going to double. That's overselling because we're in a real estate crisis in home, prices are falling. Uh, and, uh, that's the kind of thing that make some people upset. Uh, there's a tendency to hide information.

Speaker 1:          00:24:44       Uh, you, you, you avoid telling people the things that would discourage them. People have attention anomalies, so they don't go out and see all the information and you, you, if, if you don't put it up front, then they'll never find it. Uh, there's a tendency for loyalty to friends. That's your own friends. Uh, and there's this word, other people I think different languages have different, uh, you know, there's, there's friends and then there's all those random people that we don't care about. Uh, and so, uh, investors will have a tendency to try to hide it from people who sell investments. We'll try to channel the good investments to their friends and take her, uh, and, and dump the bad stuff on other people. That's what's been happening a little more than a little bit in the subprime crisis. So we've managed to package subprime loans that we thought some people thought were terrible and sell them off to a unwitting foreigners.

Speaker 1:          00:25:48       I didn't know they thought that they were getting good stuff. Uh, there's also a tendency for churning for commissions. Uh, this is, uh, of of fault that real estate brokers can make a, if they're paid by commission on each trade, they just keep calling you up and coming up with new ideas for new trades. Uh, and so, uh, that's unethical behavior, uh, because it, uh, uh, because if you, if you keep trading too much, then you cannot possibly make money. The trading commissions will eat up all of your profits and professionals know that. So it's, it's bad behavior. So we have, uh, historically developed, uh, regulation regulations that deal with, um, with these problems. The only reason, reason I believe that we have financial markets that work is because we have the regulations. So I'm going to talk primarily about us regulations, uh, and uh, give a little history of it.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       But the U S is actually an important country for regulation because, uh, it has been a model for much of the regulations around the world. So, uh, I need to give a kind of a history of financial regulations in the United States. Uh, it makes it rather a simple story. And the simple story is that regulation, uh, mostly came in with the progressive era, um, at the beginning of the century, uh, and reached its culmination at the time of the Great Depression, uh, and set up a lot of institutions that are still with us today. And then there was deregulation, which started in around the 1970s. Uh, and the events we've seen, whether that we're seeing today is a outcome of both the regulation and the deregulation. So, uh, I wanted to start out with, uh, the origins of securities regulation. Uh, a critical point was a book written by Louis Brandeis. Uh, that's the guy that Brandeis university is named after. He was an author and lawyer then Supreme Court justice. Uh, but he wrote a book in 1914, uh, called other people's money.

Speaker 1:          00:28:27       And, uh, it was very influential. I have it on reserve, but that's not required for the midterm results if you're interested to see it. Uh, and, uh, uh, he believed that, uh, the most important step, uh, for the government in promoting better financial markets is disclosure to force, uh, to force businesses or financial businesses to disclose the truth equally to everybody. Uh, and, uh, his famous quote is, sunshine is the best disinfectant. Sunshine meaning the truth. And, uh, everyone in the financial industry has to just tell people what they're doing. Uh, and he said it has to be really disclosed. And he likened it to a labeling. They were already, uh, in 1914 starting to require that a food packages would show nutritional or ingredients and nutritional information. Uh, I was on the package and he thought that's the kind of model for the financial industry. The disclosure has to be made convenient so that it's not like you can get the information by going downtown to city hall and asking for it. So the, the principle is that you have to require that the information be given to the investor. So that was a very important, um, so in, uh, around the time of this book, state regulators were, um, developing, uh, at the state government level and the United States,

Speaker 1:          00:30:06       uh, what they call blue sky laws.

Speaker 2:          00:30:12       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:13       These were laws regulating how securities are sold. Uh, and it was different theories about why they call it on blue sky laws. I think it was because people were overselling investments and saying there's no limit to this investment, but the blue sky above, uh, so, uh, the problem with the blue sky laws is that they were each state done separately and it was hard for states to manage what we're basically, um, national businesses. So the blue sky lives, we're basically coming in and the teens and the 1920s things changed because the telephone first became wide, widely spread, uh, until the, until around that, until the teens, telephones were very expensive because they didn't have a good amplification technology. But by the tiny is everybody got a telephone in their house. Um, and the average person made hundreds of phone calls a year. So it was a big change in our society. And this led to the, uh, boiler rooms.

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       And if you know that,

Speaker 1:          00:31:22       uh, the so called born, these were businesses that called her on the telephone. And so the stock often bogus stocks, uh, in the 1920s. The reason they call them boiler rooms is, uh, if you are, I'm selling stocks by telephone, there's no reason to rent a nice office. Right? So you get the cheapest. So you put a whole bank of telephones in the cheapest place and that would be the basement of some building where they have the boiler. And so you'd have a whole bunch of people selling securities down there and it could vacate quickly if the authorities challenge you. Uh, so, uh, uh, in the 1920s, a lot of bogus stuff was, so a lot of people were cheated. Uh, and so after the stock market crash of 1929, it led to and Movement for regulation. Uh, and so, uh, the most important thing was the 1934 foundation of the securities.

Speaker 2:          00:32:23       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:23       And Exchange Commission,

Speaker 2:          00:32:30       r s e c,

Speaker 1:          00:32:34       uh, which I think ultimately, um, dates back to really the embodiment of Louis Brandeis principles. So, uh, this, uh, securities and exchange commission was a, a, an organization that I guess you say it's, it's principle structure. It's principle thing was to make sure that disclosure was proper and that people, uh, were found it easy to get the information about securities. Uh, and the SEC was very controversial at first because it was seen as interfering with business. And the u s has been built on principles of, of individual freedom and this seem like unnecessary government intrusion. Uh, so there was a hostile attitude between business and the original sec, uh, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was viewed as very left wing by business and very, uh, uh, uh, contrary to American values. But in fact, the SCC promoted the very free market concepts that were, um, that were widely believed in, in this country.

Speaker 1:          00:33:51       Uh, basically what it did is it made it feel that people won't get cheated. Uh, and so, uh, the sec was a strong regulator, uh, and it, uh, uh, it really did it restore confidence in the financial markets in this country. Other countries in Europe after the 1929 crash, they had a different reaction to the scandals and problems of the twenties, and it wasn't as favorable. The markets is in the u s with the Securities and Exchange Commission from the beginning had it as its mission to make a financial markets work properly. Uh, and that is a wonderful story. So, uh, one of the first chairman of the Sec,

Speaker 3:          00:34:38       uh, was

Speaker 1:          00:34:41       a man named William O. Douglas.

Speaker 3:          00:34:44       Uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:34:50       was actually a Yale law professor. Uh, I guess he influences me, uh, because, um, I have, I have on the reading list, again, it's an optional reading, uh, but, uh, he has a book called

Speaker 3:          00:35:06       democracy and Finance 1940.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       Uh, and, uh, what he advocated again, is that financial markets have to be made to work for, uh, the people. Uh, I guess this influenced me. Uh, you actually am I 2003 book new financial load, or I talked about the democratization of finance as a fundamental principle. We have to make finance work for real people. And so for me, that not understanding human frailties and understanding human psychology to make things work. Uh, he was also a major figure in the legal realism. Um, uh, school, which was a represented, recognized, uh, human failings and human behavior and establishment of laws. We have to realize that people don't read all the fine print, uh, and don't understand if you have a precisely written contract in legal language, maybe they don't get it. Uh, one of the things that came out, uh, and it was firmly embodied into law with the advent of the sec, there were pre precursors to this, but the FCC enforces the difference between public and private securities.

Speaker 1:          00:36:39       This is a very important distinction. Uh, public securities are securities that the sec doc, uh, uh, um, we'll, uh, except as suitable for the general public and private securities or securities that have not been vetted by the sec for the general public. So, uh, uh, the sec, uh, you have to decide, you don't hear about public companies and private companies. If you're a public company, it means that you've gone through the procedure that the sec to be approved as a public company. If you are a public company, the important thing is you have to do all of the disclosure that, uh, Louis Brandeis would have like. So you have to file regular forms with the SEC disclosing information, uh, public companies and these public companies. If you want to get on the sec website, uh, go to sec.gov and then as, uh, there is a tab that you can click, which is Edgar.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       Uh, and uh, if you click on Edgar, you can enter the name of any public company in the United States. Uh, and then all of its filings are online and you can find out incredible amount of information about companies. Uh, it's all there as long as they're public companies. Uh, so public, a lot of companies don't want to be public because you can't keep secrets very well. You've got to regularly put those things up online and they're out there for everybody to see. Um, so why do companies can choose whether to be public or private? Why do they choose to be public? Well, they, it's a balancing. They have to balance. Sometimes they don't like the choice they made, but, uh, the, the advantage to being public is that people trust you more and more over your market is bigger. Uh, and, and, uh, so public companies have an advantage.

Speaker 1:          00:38:49       So, uh, companies don't like to be public. Generally. It's contrary to their instincts. We keep all sorts of secrets in our company. We don't want to be filing all of our information all the time and having it go right up on the website, on standard forms so that everyone can easily process it. Uh, but they, they may swallow their doubts because they have a sense that it will improve the market for their shares. So we have a lot of public companies. Um, now if you are a public or a private company, uh, you are limited to, uh, what, uh, uh, where you can sell your investments. Uh, and let's talk an example of, of, uh, important kind of private company. It's called a hedge fund.

Speaker 2:          00:39:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       If you are, this is not, this is a private investment company.

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       Uh, let's, let's think before we talk about head. Think of, suppose you're right. Public Investment Company, uh, approved by the SEC. The problem with being a public investment company is you have to file quarterly reports about all the things you've invested in. I mean, and so you say, how can I make money beating the market if every quarter I have to tell everybody what I'm doing? Uh, and so a lot of investment companies don't want to be public. They want to be private, so they don't have to hedge funds do not post their investments and Edgar, and so they're private. Um, but if you're a private company, you're subject to regulation that limits a lot of things you can do. Notably, you're not allowed to advertise. Uh, if you're a hedge fund, you're not for the public, you're not approved for investing by the public. So what business do you have to put buy ads in newspapers, announcing yourself as a result?

Speaker 1:          00:40:58       Hedge funds, uh, are, have a very low profile. It's not their choice. They might like to advertise, but they can't without running a foul of the sec. They'll say, you're behaving like a public company and you're not public. Uh, and so hedge funds do not advertise and that's why people don't know about them. And they have a mysterious, uh, uh, they, they sound mysterious. Um, but moreover, very significantly, uh, they're, uh, they are limited in what kind of investors can take a, now there's different kinds of hedge fund. Th there's a lot of legal complexity here, but, uh, a three c one hedge farm, uh, is limited to 99 and investors.

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       Uh, and that's not very many people. Uh, and they must be accredited investors.

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       And so you asked what is an accredited investor? Well, if you want to find out, you can get onto a sec.gov and it will give you the current definition. So I wonder how many of you are accredited investors? I would guess not many of you. Here's how you become an accredited investor. A, you have $1 million in investible. Yeah. That's not including your house. Is it? An investible assets? Okay. Uh, I won't ask for a show of, I don't want any to, you're making at least $200,000 a year, uh, or, uh, you, uh, if you're married, you have to be the couple of making at least 300,000. Uh, so, um, it's supposed to be a fun for rich people. It's done. They haven't raised the definitions of accredited investors for many years. So, uh, last year, the SEC, uh, put out a proposal that, uh, you know, it's getting too easy to be an accredited investor.

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       Uh, and so they put out a proposal that we raised the, uh, wealth level to 2.5 million. Okay. Uh, and I thought they were going to, and that was to protect people who might be naive, innocent people who only have $1 million. They're only half $2 million and don't know what they're doing, uh, from hedge funds. But, uh, it got shot down apparently, cause it never, never happened. I think it's very hard to raise the definition of accredited investors because in that you do that, you're closing large numbers of people out from her ability to invest in hedge funds and they don't like that. They feel insulted. So there was a lot of angry reaction. Uh, there's also another kind of hedge fund, three c seven, uh, which can take 500 investors. Uh, if they, if they register as a three c seven, they can take more investors, but then they're limited to qualified purchasers. And this just an example of their regulations.

Speaker 1:          00:44:09       Uh, and a qualified purchaser a has to have at least $5 million, uh, or if it's an institution at least 25 million, um, that is a natural person. A natural person refers to a human being. Uh, so it's 5 million for natural, uh, and 25 million for institutions. So if you're a small college with only 20 million in a portfolio, you don't come across as a qualified purchases. They're trying to protect innocent small colleges who only have $20 million. The idea is that people who don't have much money can't afford expensive lawyers and they can't figure it out and they really shouldn't be investing in hedge funds. Uh, so that is the, uh, uh, these, these are public, private, uh, uh, distinctions are, anarchists are offensive to some people because it, it's, it seems like the government is acting like a parent and most of the people are, if you're not accredited as an investor, it's like the government doesn't respect you.

Speaker 1:          00:45:23       Uh, right. I mean, it's like they're treating you like children. Why would it be that somebody else is allowed to invest in a hedge fund? And I'm not, uh, so, uh, it rankles but on the other hand, these regulations survive because the reality is that people are victimized all the time and uh, uh, we can't just allow companies to act in secrecy. I, this is something that I believe and not everyone believes in this, uh, but, um, the general principle has been now ever since the 1930s, that the general public is not allowed to invest in things that are not properly documented. Another important distinction and securities regulation is the distinction between insider and outsider.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       And insider is someone who is privy to the secret information of a company. Uh, and um, uh, the, uh, secret information could be used to trade, right? If you know the secrets of a company, if you know some, uh, good news about the company before the public does, you could buy the shares in the company and, and experienced that the profit when the price goes up, you would be exploding insider information and you'd be victimizing the outsiders. Uh, so the idea from the beginning at the sec was that, uh, insiders should not be allowed to trade on information that is, uh, that is not properly disclosed to the public. Um, and, uh, but especially there was an important change. Um, regulation FD, I came in in 2000 FTE stands for full disclosure. This is a, uh, sec regulation, a regulation FD, uh, was I think past and reg in recognition of the internet under, uh, uh, Louis Brandeis.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       Brandeis wanted companies to always present the information, but for him it always met presenting a document. So they had something called a prospectus. For example, you could not sell a security without giving a prospectus to the potential buyers. And the prospectus would be something approved by the sec. Uh, and I don't know if the word is approved, but it's a, you have to run it by the sec and then you always have to give that up. But he was living in a paper age. We now live in the Internet age. Uh, and so regulation FD and now I don't know if it actually mentions the internet, but it's, it's, uh, tends to the regulation FD basically says that whenever a company announces information, it has to be announced a available almost instantly to everybody in the market. And so the way it has worked out in practice is that companies, when they have a major announcement to make, they have some kind of web event and anybody in the world, they would be notified and they can get on and hear it as it's happening.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       So we kind of have meetings, big meetings on the web for a disclosure of important information. Uh, and so, uh, uh, this has made it very clear then there's a, there has to be, if you announced anything, you have to announce it all at once on a certain day and you can't have favored people that you give the announcement too. Uh, so market surveillance is the fastest that dark exchanges and other organizations do to make sure that inside information is not being, uh, uh, is not being mishandled. And so the, the self regulatory organizations SROC, um, which are industry organizations that regulate the industry, that's an American way of doing things rather than have the government, uh, regulate. We have an industry organization that does it so that the government doesn't have to, uh, the SRO is, have complex regulatory equipment, computers that can discuss this discover, um, uh, in insider trading.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       And, uh, the SRO is, uh, we'll catch you or they may catch you if, if you try. So I wanted to give you an example of SRO behavior. Uh, and this is just one news story. Um, it was in 1995, uh, a secretary at Ibm Corporation, uh, was asked to xerox some documents by her boss and the documents described a proposed takeover of Lotus Corporation. I remember Laura say that was the, uh, corporation that produced the first thread sheet program. It's now been replaced mostly by at Microsoft Excel, but at the time it was big. Okay. So this was big news. Ibm is going to take over at Lotus or try to take over Lotus. And, uh, we now know what happened because of the, uh, the surveillance investigation. Uh, she told her husband that she adjusts xerox to this thing about, she'd read what she was xeroxing and she told her husband, who is a beeper salesman about the news.

Speaker 1:          00:51:26       Uh, he did nothing except tell two friends than story. He didn't buy show. He just told two friends. My wife says that IBM is going to take over a lotus. The friends immediately bought a lotus shares. Uh, and uh, uh, then, uh, uh, that was June two. By June five, 25 people had bought, had a half a million dollars to buy on this tip. They included a pizza chef and electrical engineer, uh, bank executive, a dairy wholesaler, a school teacher, and for stockbrokers, stockbrokers get the word faster. Uh, just what happened. Those people are all in trouble because it's illegal to trade on insider information and they tracked them all down. And, uh, uh, uh, so, uh, I give you another example. Uh, and this is the example of, uh, uh, emulex corporate. Maybe this isn't exactly an insider trading. This is more fraud. But, uh, in what year was, this?

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       Was around sometime in the late nineties. Uh, Marc Jacob, uh, uh, his name, he's a guy, he's the criminal here. He's probably out of jail now. Marc Jacob, uh, was upset with, he had done an employee of Emulex, uh, and, uh, uh, had, uh, had access to inside information of the company. Uh, and so he, I guess he was involved in the, um, in the dissemination of information for the company. He kind of knew how they did press releases. So he sent out a fic he bought, he shorted the company and he, uh, the stock in the company and he bought a, he put out a fake press release, uh, saying that there was bad news for the company. Uh, and, uh, he knew how to make it look like one of the Mbox press releases. Um, he also did it from the El Camino community college library because he thought I'd be careful.

Speaker 1:          00:53:35       I want issue this fake press release on my own computer because they might be able to track me back to my own computer. So he went to this community college and got one of their library computers and issue the press release there. He got picked up by all the major news services. A stock plummeted. He's sold immediately and he made a lot of money. But the problem is it didn't work. They, they, they, they track back who sold it, who had shorted and who had sold just before, just at that time. And they also, um, they went back to the El Camino Community College Library and they interviewed the librarians and tried to ask them, do you remember somebody coming here that didn't look like a student? And they identified him and so he was caught. So that's what, uh, what surveillance does. They make markets work because if you didn't have this, they would be all kinds of, there would be all kinds of, uh, uh, crooks and, uh, a bad, a bad actors. Uh, and uh, the thing about these organizations is that they cost money and they cost nuisances. A lot of people in the financial community are annoyed by them because of these regulations are costly to comply with. And, uh, they take a lot of resources, but, uh, I think enlightened view is that these things are absolutely essential, uh, and to trust in the market. Um, another form of, uh, uh, of, uh, regulation is accounting regulation. So for example, we have, uh, in the United States, the financial accounting

Speaker 3:          00:55:20       standards board, this right here in Connecticut. All right? Faas B.

Speaker 1:          00:55:34       This is not a government organization. Uh, it was organized, uh, uh, by the sec in 1973. Uh, but the sec didn't want to do this job. They wanted it to be done privately. Uh, so what FASP does for the United States is it creates what are called generally accepted as a g generally accepted accounting practices. Uh, their rules for how an IT company should keep its books so that, uh, uh, uh, so that there's some regularity and standards and how accounting is done. Uh, and so when, when, uh, the financial accounting standards board to what corporations are saying and, uh, and helps them, uh, uh, it, it adjusts the standards from time to time, but it does have definitions that have to be maintained. Uh, and, um, so a company has a, uh, uh, a profit and loss statement and there is something that, uh, it's called net income, which is a measure of how much the company is making the, the, uh, the profits after expenses of the company called the bottom line.

Speaker 1:          00:57:00       Uh, and, uh, the gap standards are defined. This is also operating income. Uh, now companies can use other definitions of other accounting standards besides these. Uh, and some of these other definitions which are not always gap, other standards and are widely used in the industry are other kinds of, they have what's called core earnings, uh, pro forma earnings, uh, Ebitda, which is earnings, uh, uh, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and Amortization, uh, adjusted earnings. There's all kinds of different definitions. And so, uh, uh, companies like to do it their own way cause they weren't a present themselves in the best way to the public, but, uh, they're not allowed to just do it their own way. They have to do it according to, uh, uh, standards. Uh, and so the gap accounting is standardized. So what a, what a company can do is present things in two different ways.

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       Uh, uh, they, they can present it gap and then that goes to Edgar or, and they can also present it any other way they liked. But the law, uh, the SCC requires that they at least present the standard earnings, uh, definitions for, um, for all these things. Now another, um, let, let me just mention a off balance sheet accounting. Uh, the, uh, one thing that the SEC requires that companies file is there balance sheet, uh, which you can look up for any company. And Edgar, uh, the balance sheet of a company has two columns. It has assets and it has liabilities. Uh, and so on one side is everything that company owns and the other side is everything the company owes. Okay. Uh, and the, uh, uh, the, the net worth of the company is their assets minus their liabilities. Uh, and that represents the value that the company has if they paid off all their liabilities. Uh, what the SEC has to worry about is something called off balance sheet account. Hey,

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       uh, which occurs when companies try to hide some of the, uh, things that they, the, the liabilities they have, but not recording them on the balance sheet. Uh, and, uh, if you can get away with that, then you can do, uh, you, you can conceal maybe some risky investments you've made or some, uh, leverage that you've had. Uh, you might've bought investments in something by borrowing money. And so the investment, the combined investment and liability, it could be very volatile. You don't want people to know that, so you don't put it on the balance sheet. Uh, so, uh, the sec and other regulators have to watch for this. The classic example of a company that did this, uh, it's a classic now was Enron Corporation. Um, and, uh, they had a number of partnerships that they put on, uh, as off balance sheet. So they weren't making risky investments, but they weren't reporting it properly on, uh, on the, uh, SCC forums. And so people didn't know how risky, uh, how risky. And Ron was. Uh, more recently we, uh, this is, it came out last year, uh, the sieves, alright, phone called structured investment vehicles.

Speaker 2:          01:01:24       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:01:26       we're used by banks to cover up investments. They had often in risky subprime loans where they created special entities called sibs. Uh, and, uh, the sieves would be borrowing money on the commercial paper market to buy subprime loans. Uh, and, uh, they were, uh, in a very risky position because subprime loans were already recognized as being risky and they borrowed to buy them, sell off the value of the subprime loans went down just a little bit. The, uh, the sieve would be in trouble. Uh, and so in the Civ contract, there was some language that implied that if the sieve ever went bankrupt, the bank would come back and rescue them. And so the say of really was a liability, but it wasn't visible to, to investors who are investing in the back. So this is another example of off balance sheet accounting. That was frustrating. Um, the rules of the SEC. Um, I wanted to talk about, uh, the, um, uh, another, another instance of regulation that is important in the United States, but it's very poorly known. Uh, we have something called civic. Uh, that's the securities

Speaker 2:          01:02:57       and investor protection corporation,

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       which was created in 1970 a. And this is the securities analog of the FDA. I see. In banking, uh, I don't know if I mentioned, I assume you know about the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. I thought that was better known or, well, let me just mention it by analogy. Uh, in 1934, after the failure was, it was actually created by Congress in 1933 and, uh, uh, went into business in 34 f the, I see Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Speaker 1:          01:03:54       So I'll put it down as 1934 guaranteed for a small depositors, uh, the, uh, savings deposits they have at a bank. And that was to protect depositors. Uh, in the case of bank failure. And it was a very important innovation because at that time there were huge runs on banks. People were pulling money out of banks because they feared that if the bank failed, then they would lose their money. And so it created a huge crisis in 1933. So it's, but it's for a small investors because currently the limit and the sec, uh, it's $100,000, right? So that's not a lot of money. Um, and whenever you think of it as a lot of money, but it's not, uh, if someone saving for their retirement, you better have a lot more than that. $100,000 is only a few years in comment, even for lower income people. But at least, uh, we want to protect the small investors in the saving in bags.

Speaker 1:          01:04:59       So actually if you, if you, if you have more than a hundred thousand dollars in a bank account, you should probably pull it out and spread it around over several banks because each bank is separately insured. So there's effectively no limit if you're just a little bit smart, uh, and you move your accounts around. Uh, so we had, so we had deposit insurance, uh, until, uh, starting in the Great Depression. And that's been very important. Uh, and it's now in every country. Uh, uh, uh, so we had a run on a bank in the UK. Uh, it was called Northern Rock, uh, last year. Um, and it turns out that there was a failure of the UK deposit insurance. I would say it's a failure because a U K deposit insurance insured northern rock only for the first 3000 pounds, uh, up completely. And then for the next, I forget how many thousand pounds you were, 90% insured. Uh, so that was not good enough because people were worried about losing 10% of their deposits. And so there was a big bank run and northern rock would've failed if the Bank of England hadn't come by to rescue them. Uh, so I think these deposit insurance are very important, but we don't, we didn't have anything for a corresponding accounts at brokerage services until 1970. Uh, and, uh, it, uh, this was motivated by a spectacular failure of a brokerage, good body, uh, in, uh, in company, um, in 1970.

Speaker 1:          01:06:40       I hope. You know what I mean? A brokerage service is a, is a place where a stockbrokers work and it stockbroker is somebody that manages your buying and selling of shares. All right? And so if you want to buy stock, you can call a stockbroker. Uh, like Merrill Lynch is a big retail broker and they're right down here on the green. You can go there and say, I want to buy stocks. And the broker will say, fine, we'll set up an account for you. You deposit money in our account. Now he's not a bank. He's a broker. Will have set up a cash account and a securities account, put some money in, and then you think about it and then you call me up and say, do you want to buy some stocks? Uh, then I'll, I'll take money out of your cash account and I'll put it in these securities.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       That's a broker. Okay, good body and company was a broker, but it failed in 1970. It went bankrupt. And then it looked like the people who had money and shares and then we'd lose. Uh, there's two things. You can have a cash account with them. You put money into the cash account and you haven't bought shares with it yet, it's just sitting here. It's like in a bank. Um, you could lose that because good body and company is going bankrupt, right? It doesn't have it anymore. And what about your shares? Where are good body and company is supposed to have your shares, right? But they, they, they, they generally hold them in what's called street name. And that means good body and company owns the shares and you just have a contractual relationship with good body that in principle, some of those shares are yours.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       Um, but the company that you're investing in ultimately doesn't have your money. It's, it's good body that they're dealing with, although they have ways of, for proxy and their ways of finding out who, who's who. But the problem is if your brokerage fee for from fails, you could lose a lot. You could lose your cash account and your security account. So, uh, civic was set up in 1970 a and civic, uh, insurance cash accounts up to $100,000 and, uh, securities accounts up to 500,000. And so, uh, that's another example of government, uh, involvement, uh, in, uh, as a civic was set up by an act of Congress. Uh, and, uh, so, uh, the, um, unfortunately, I don't know if you've ever heard of civic. Most people don't even know it exists. Uh, civic did a survey of the U s population. Uh, and, uh, this is one of the, in 2001, this is one of the questions civic asked.

Speaker 1:          01:09:24       Um, the response were asked to identify the organization that insures you against losing money in the stock market or as the result of investment fraud. Uh, only 16% of investors knew that there is no such company. They make me. It's clear. SIPOC does not. If you, if you invest in some stock and it does badly, you can't go to civic and say, Hey, I, my stocks went down, but please give me my money back. Uh, they won't do it. And Moreover, if you say this stockbroker, he was lying to me. He told me that this was a good investment and he even lied and said something to get me roped in. They won't pay you back. The only thing that civic does is replaced securities. In other words, if you had an account at a brokerage and you thought you had a hundred shares of IBM and now the broker is going bankrupt and the broker won't answer your email anymore and it's just gone, you go to civic and say, I, you know, I had these a hundred chairs civic then returns a hundred shares to you.

Speaker 1:          01:10:31       They don't pay you. Can they give you the hundred shares? And that's all they do. Uh, so you might say that we, our regulation hasn't gone far enough and I think maybe it hasn't gone far enough. Uh, we protect certain kinds of things and people have to pay attention. W the, it's a difficult problem that not everyone is smart. They vary in their ability. So we try to make a world in which, uh, it's pretty safe for the small investor who's not paying attention, but it's never perfect and we can't figure out yet a way to make it perfect. And we still have four small investors who are defrauded, who are treated badly, and the subprime crisis as an example, some people were treated badly in this recent financial crisis. So we just have to keep improving our regulation and trying to make it a deal with all of the problems as they come up. The problems are complex because we're trying to make a system in which people are able to make their own decisions as much as possible and to make them in a way that, uh, in an environment that they trust, but it's just too complicated and too, it's impossible to make it work perfectly. All right, so that will conclude this lecture. So us, I won't be here Monday, but I'll, I, TA's will, uh, will handle the exam and I'll, I'll see you on Wednesday.
