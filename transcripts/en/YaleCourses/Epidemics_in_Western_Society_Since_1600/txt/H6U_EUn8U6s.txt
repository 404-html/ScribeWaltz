Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, as you know, one of the longterm themes and our course has been intellectual history and the impact of epidemic diseases on that this morning and not white. I'm going to be looking at one of the great medical debates in particular, a great medical debate of the 19th century, which was to so called debate between contagion, aneurysm, and anti contagion aneurysm. Now, uh, why would we be interested in it? First of all, if we're going to understand 19th century medicine, we have to realize that if you were to go back, say to re reading the Lancet, one of the major medical journals of the 19th century, or say the account of the proceedings of the French Academy of Medicine, you would see that they were, one of the leading issue was that was being hotly debated, was the rights and wrongs the scientific evidence for and against the idea of contagion, aneurysm and its opponents.

Speaker 1:          01:13          The idea of anti contagion ism. So this was really a hot button topic in 19th century medicine. It consumed the middle decades of the century. So if we're going to, if part of our course is to understand, uh, what was happening in the world of medicine, well, this debate was really crucial in it. Another part is not. Another part of our interest in this debate is that it brings to a conclusion, um, much of our consideration of Asiatic cholera. We've talked about the impact of cholera and we need to recognize that it's impact was partly in the realm of ideas. It's legacy didn't include just death, fear, social tension. It didn't just leave behind it. Sewer lines and water pipes and Britain, the broad boulevards of Paris and [inaudible], the rebuilt lower city of Naples. In addition, it left behind it, a major debate on the causes of disease and epidemic diseases in particular.

Speaker 1:          02:33          And this is the debate between contagion, aneurysm and anti contagion aneurysm. It's useful for us to turn to this debate awesome. Because it helps us to prepare the ground for one of the most important discoveries in the history of science and certainly medical science. And that's the establishment of the germ theory of disease, which is our topic for next week. So, um, what we'll want to do then is we'll be moving towards the victory of contagiousness them. So this is a debate then that really mattered in medical history now and discussing this issue. There are a couple of pitfalls that I think we ought to avoid.

Speaker 1:          03:24          They're distorting and make it difficult for us really to understand history in general and history of science in particular. Uh, let me point out two pitfalls. The first is a possibility of what's been called the wig ish view of history now and its application to science. It sees history of science as a linear upward march of truth moving steadily forward over ignorance and obscurantism. That is a history of constant progress and it's reinforced if our history of science deals and examines exclusively the ideas that finally triumph so that we study only a constant progress. The march from one great idea to the next. Another possible danger and pitfall is what's called presenteeism, which I might define as the rather smug view. That science all along has been striving almost in Lamarche and manner to make the benighted people of the past finally emerge as smart as we are and we get to look back condescendingly on the thinkers of past centuries, giving them marks for how right or how wrong we now know that they were.

Speaker 1:          04:58          So to avoid those pitfalls, but I'd like to do is to approach this in a different spirit. Next time I will take the more traditional path of looking at the victorious germ theory of disease. And at that point we'll pay our respects to the famous trio of 19th century science that you all know of Louie, pastor Robert, call Joseph Lister. And in doing that we'll notice that what triumphed wasn't only disembodied scientific truth. I'm not disputing, let me stress this, I'm not going to be disputing the truth of the germ theory of disease. But what I want to do is something a little more subtle, which is to notice that what triumphed wasn't just disembodied truth, but also a worldview. And that when that worldview one out, there were some losses as well that went with it. The germ theory of disease. It's one of the greatest advances in the history of science.

Speaker 1:          06:10          What we need to argue that although true it perhaps wasn't the entire team of truth and then its establishment as a reigning orthodoxy by the end of the 19th century because it does in fact come to be held by the entirety of the international medical community really after around the 1890s or so. And that brought with it one of its consequences and unintended one was certain negative impacts on understanding of disease that we'll be talking about and to understand and appreciate this fact. I'm going to concentrate this morning not on the victors. You'll know about them already to some extent and we'll be turning to them for the whole of next week. But I'd like to look instead at someone you probably don't know or maybe not know at all. In fact, just out of curiosity, um, had before we talked about him in our course and reading, uh, how many of you had actually heard of mocks fun patent coffer?

Speaker 1:          07:26          See, that's what I suspected. Um, actually no one had heard of mocks von patent coffer. So all the more reason, uh, we're going to, the good news for you is we're going to be dealing with him for the next 40 minutes or so. Um, he's the most sophisticated and scientifically robust of those who were, as we might call wrong. He lived from 1818 to 1901 and one is of the great figures of 19th century medical science, although his scientific defeat was total and humiliating by the 1890s. And indeed that might form part of the background to the fact that he was to commit suicide at the turn of the 20th century when he shot himself. But I'm going to try to understand that he was not just simply wrong, but I'll argue that he was splendidly wrong. That is mistaken ideas actually saved millions of lives and that third defeat how to paradoxical consequence, not only of advancing medical science, but in some ways impoverishing it in ways that are important and that we might want to consider. Well, who was a mock pet Petten coffer and since you hadn't met him before, let me introduce you to him. Uh, and here we use, uh, in splendor and he was a German scientist and physician in particular,

Speaker 2:          09:06          uh,

Speaker 1:          09:10          ah, map of Germany, Patten coffers associated with Bavaria here in the south of Germany. Let's look at that a little more closely. And he was an associated, especially with the city of Munich, and I'm pointing this out to you, not simply so that you'll know where he's from, although that's nice to know, but this is extremely significant in his theories and that he tends to be the defender of localism and the autonomy of Bavaria and Munich against the centralizing tendencies of, um, of Germany as a whole. So it has a political significance that we'll be turning to know what were his social origins? Who was he? He came from a Catholic family of very modest means, but lots of children. And the family that is his nuclear family didn't really have the means to afford him with a higher education. And he gained that because of an uncle.

Speaker 1:          10:15          He had a wealthier uncle who was a prominent apothecary, but alas had no sons and he wanted his nephew mocks to carry on the family business. So Mark's Van Patten coffers started out life by studying pharmacy and chemistry. And this in fact was to have an impact on his medical theories. But he soon discovered that he hated the subjects he had originally enrolled into study and eat, terminally disappointed his uncle when he enrolled in as a medical student. And he gained his medical degree in 1843 from the University of Munich. Thereafter, he had a varied career for a few years, casting about for what he wanted to do in life. Uh, he worked for a while for a mint and even had a field attempt to become a stage actor. But in 1847 he gained appointment to the medical faculty at Munich and became also a professor of organic chemistry. From then on, he enjoyed immediate your career as one of the rising stars of science in Bavaria in Germany and Europe in general.

Speaker 1:          11:39          It became advisor to the Bavarian government and a full professor of medicine in 1853 now 1854 changed his life and it did so in relationship to an outbreak of Asiatic cholera in Germany. And it's interesting that this is the very same epidemic that snow studied in London, but we're as snow was a contagion. Honest patent coffer reached the exact opposite conclusion. Indeed. Thereafter, he became a lifelong opponent of snow's ideas. And what do you referred to with scorn as the English water mania, the English, he said, we're obsessed with water. Well, what was the debate and why was it so passionately held? Now the debate was obviously about the issue of whether diseases are contagious or not, but it didn't involve all disease. No one doubted in the 19th century that syphilis, for example, was contagious.

Speaker 1:          12:54          The debate was about a subset of diseases fall in particular, leprosy, typhus, and then what we might call the big three plague, yellow fever and cholera. In other words, the debates centered on the diseases that were the most feared diseases of the 19th century. And so the debate was passionate because it concerned diseases that were extremely important and it wasn't just a matter of academic disagreement. The decision on whether you defined a disease as contagious or not had a practical importance. It meant what are going to be the public health strategies that you'd devise to combat it. And the European powers were greatly divided as to whether they should defend themselves by quarantine, the great Auntie contagiousness measure or not. Well, the two sides in the debate, then we're contagion ism NMT contagion at them. Let's start with contagent. Awesome. This wasn't a new idea at all in the 19th century, but it was unknown to the Greeks, but it was part of Biblical tradition and you've heard of it's popularization already by the Italian physician for Daca Storto and the 16th century contagion ism had a widespread importance in popular culture as well.

Speaker 1:          14:39          The contagion is an idea by the 19th century was that there were some infectious material, some people thought it was a poison, a chemical and other words, others that it might be. It was pure speculation, a living entity and animal. Cool. You'll see that word in John Snow for example, in one of his speculative moments that was transmitted in some manner, perhaps person to person, perhaps through the pores, perhaps by contact with the sick person, perhaps spine objects that had been in contact with that person. And you've just been reading a very powerful expression of the contagion honest position. And that's the work of Jon snow.

Speaker 3:          15:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:30          But a potent thing to remember was not down to the 1890s contagion ism. And this may surprise you, which primarily the standpoint of popular culture rather than of the medical elite. Whereas anti contagion ism dominated the international medical profession. Most of men of science regarded contagiousness and as a view held by the ignorant on the superstitious. And indeed the irony is that contagion ism reached a nadir in respectability just before the work of call and pastor demonstrated its ultimate vitality take to understand that. Take an example that by now you know extremely well and that is pledge to the layman. The spread of plague seemed to justify the idea that by some means that people still didn't understand it's spread from one person to another, but to little learned physician, the case for contagion still seemed weak. There wasn't a mechanism to explain what it was, how it was transmitted. In many cases, close inspection seem to demonstrate that the disease spread without the direct contact, that the contagion is view seem to postulate people caught the plague who hadn't been an immediate contact with another plague victim. Conversely, where there was such contact, often the plague didn't spread and people who cared for plague victim sometimes didn't fall ill. How could that be explained? Furthermore, epidemics of plague began and ended in the most mysterious manner that no one could plausibly explain

Speaker 1:          17:41          under strength. In their case, the contagiousness would need to discard their theory of inanimate contagion, replacing it with something that was living. Furthermore, there was the need for the idea of transmission of her distance by water, perhaps food supplies, or later we'll see insect vectors. But the debate was also fueled by political contusions, by politics, because major conclusions followed from the position that one adopted contagiousness in their scientific conclusions or people who buttress the power of the state. Because in the name of state power, one could institute the most draconian measures cordons lots of reptoids quarantine. You could see quester sequester and confined individuals. You could limit civil liberty and you could radically control the movement of goods and of trade. So one of the results then of contagiousness them, you can see here, um, the idea here you have cholera, yellow fever and plug trying to enter the citadel at the gates. And here we have quarantine and the draconian measures, uh, that follow from that cleanliness. Uh, you know the film, by now you're experts on the filth theory of disease and the measures to be adopted against it. So the idea of contagion, aneurysm, buttressed. Those ideas have a strong, powerful state interventionism. Now let's turn then to their opponents, the anti contagiousness, the people who were skeptical with regard to the ideas of Jon snow.

Speaker 1:          19:47          These were largely associated with the political left. Why auntie contagion aneurysm implied free trade. It was associated with liberalism and with the defense of individual liberties against arbitrary state bureaucracies. It implied opposition to extreme and sometimes violent plagued measures of public health, so it wasn't a by conclude incidents that it was a good idea to look at a map of Germany because the most important of the contagiousness Robert Call was an icon and promoter of the power of the centralized German state. He worked in Berlin and that wasn't by chance and he defended the centralizing and imperial interests of the German Reich. Worst Petin coffer was a liberal who championed the local interests of Bavaria and Munich and indeed his theories coincided both medically and politically. There was some times referred to as localism. Another way of seeing the stakes in this debate is to remember that Britain long opposed the contagiousness position.

Speaker 1:          21:20          There were big part in part on for political and economic reasons that is to say Britain was ranged in the international conferences largely with Auntie contagiousness in part because it's interest prospered best through free trade and it felt threatened by medical arguments that implied that the state should interfere with commerce impounding British ships and quarantining their crews for 40 days. The Anti contagiousness also had the imprimatur should we like of tradition of the authority of tradition. Their views were sanctioned by Hippocrates and Galen and were buttressed by a whole panoply of ideas that had grown up later. But we're a, if we like a compatible with the traditional practice of medicine with the idea of atmospheric influences of the epidemic constitution as it was called, a bit of jargon for you of the atmosphere and it was compatible with the filth and Maya theory. Let's also remember that anti contagion ism inspired some robust health measures as well and it saved lives.

Speaker 1:          22:48          Anti contagion aneurysm was to view of people like Chadwick commune known now and his associates Southwood Smith. It was the view of [inaudible] and the second empire and it was the official doctrine of Rasaka mental that is the rebuilding of Naples now in the history of medicine and public health and epidemiology, the color of epidemic of 1854 looms large giving rise to two foundational texts of Epidemiology on opposite sides of the debate. On the one side we see John Snow and you've read is on the mode of communication of cholera, the final version of which it was first drafted in 1849. But the, uh, the draft that you have appeared after this event, and this was the classic statement of the contagiousness view to the extent that it could be supported without the definitive evidence later provided by microscopy. So snow did everything that it was possible to do purely on the basis of epidemiological evidence.

Speaker 1:          24:04          There was going to need to be a conceptual shift in order to clinch his view and demonstrate it so that it was broadly accepted. On the other side, we see a book that's been a, it's not even on our own reading list, a book that's been largely forgotten. This is Max von patent coffers work called investigations and observations on the method of spread of cholera published in 1855 and this I should say that pattern coffer was no less rigorous as an epidemiologist than Jon snow. And this was a major foundational texts in epidemiology. It was a study of the 1854 epidemic in Bavaria reaching conclusions that were diametrically opposed to those of snows. So from 1854 cholera became a lifelong preoccupation of mocks Fon Patton coffer. And he devoted himself to the epidemiological study of the disease, staking his reputation on high profile debates with Robert Kaul. He was to write some 200 articles and books during his lifetime on a whole range of scientific topics, but the largest number about 60 we're devoted to cholera and its transmission and costs.

Speaker 1:          25:43          So Petten coffer. And the reason we're dealing with him now is he was the last major and the best defender of the antique contagiousness doctrine of Miasma TISM. In other words, and he defended it until his death. At The dawn of the 20th century, he adopted the traditional doctrine dating back to antiquity, but provided with with the new evidence based scientific underpinning. Well, why was patent coffer not convinced by snow when it came to cholera? Part of the reason, you know, contagion ism patent coffers said, and in this he was right. It didn't produce a really plausible mechanism for the transmission of the disease. It correlated cholera cases with drinking water, but to Petten coffer, there seem no means of explaining exactly what was transmitted or how. Also, as you know, petting coffer had been trained as a chemist and he looked at the traditional idea that the collar a poison with some sort of chemical substance and he argued that it was entirely improbable, improbable that a dcs could be spread. Then in the manor postulated looking at London and the river Thames, how could a poison contaminating the Thames if it was a chemical not be infinitely diluted?

Speaker 4:          27:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:25          Furthermore, he said there was a whole series of what we might call cholera mysteries. That snows position didn't help to aluminate. Why did an epidemic start and why did it end?

Speaker 1:          27:44          Why could doctors provide their services in the midst of an epidemic of cholera and yet not fall? Ill have it themselves? What caused the pronounced seasonality of Colorado? Why was its onset almost invariably in the spring and the summer and why did an outbreak? We seem to ed with the onset of cold weather. And then lastly for the moment there was what we might call the problem of Leon. That is the great second city of France. If cholera is contagious and if it follows the great routes of trade and Population Movement, why is it that there are nonetheless major centers that escaped throughout the 19th century? Leo was the second largest city in France located at the hub of a network of trade and transportation and it had all the earth. It was a great textile center of manufacturing.

Speaker 4:          28:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:55          And with and had all the urban problems of an industrial center at its time. If ever patent coffer would say there was a city that seemed primed to be devastated by Asiatic cholera. It was Leone, and yet her to escape the visitations of this exotic Asiatic outsider. Well, what was Patton coffers theory? And it was his delight to believe that he could provide an apparently clear epidemiologically based explanation for all of those cholera mysteries. Indeed part, another aspect of his theory that Robert Kaul discovered the Vibrio cholerae. You've seen a picture of the Vibrio and he discovered it in 1883 petnin coffer didn't reject the idea of the Vibrio. Instead, he incorporated it elegantly into his larger theory explaining that it played a role in the etiology of cholera, but that its role and its mechanism were completely different from the ones that cock espoused patents. Coffers theory is often referred to as the groundwater theory we've seen. It can be called localism. It can be called the groundwater theory.

Speaker 4:          30:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:36          The simplest approach to his method is a very simple mathematical equation that he was very fond of himself for illustrative purposes. It was perhaps the simple of all mathematical formulas. X Plus y equals z. Uh, what did that mean? Tamoxifen patent coffer? Well, for him, Z was a cholera outbreak. The result then of combining x and y, it's produced, in other words, under certain specific conditions of two other factors, the x factor and the why factor, the x factor, he said was the presence of the Vibrio cholerae. You see, he accepts that the Vibrio plays a role, but for Patton coffer, the Vibrio itself on its own would never make you sick. You could swallow it quite safely and remain entirely healthy. He regarded it as harmless on its own. And as we'll see in a moment, he carried out a famous auto experiment in which he tried to demonstrate conclusively the truth of his view. In other words, he made himself a cocktail of the Vibrio cholerae and drank it, and in fact, he remained healthy and therefore I'm persuaded to the end of his life that the Vibrio on its own was harmless.

Speaker 4:          32:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:12          He was to say that the Vibrio causes disease and an entirely different but orthodox, Maya's Madec manner. The danger around doesn't arise when the [inaudible] contaminates food and drinking water. The problem is different. It happens when the Vibrio gets into the soil beneath a major city and their Petten coffer, a horticultural analogy referring to germination or fermentation. After the Vibrio gained access to the soil under certain conditions, it could germinate like a plant and give off its poison into the air. Above that the population inhaled and those who were susceptible fell ill in large numbers and it was then that an onset that you'd have the onset of an epidemic. So in 19th century medical parlance, cholera was an example of a whole category of diseases that were called Xy modic diseases, diseases caused by fermentation. So that we've see the x factor involves the Vibrio cholerae side.

Speaker 1:          33:29          Then that why factor was simply those local conditions, again, localism that were necessary for fermentation to take place and for poison to be given off into the atmosphere. So what makes up the why factor? So again, let's think of horticulture and the growth of a plant. A plant doesn't need only soil to develop. It also needs nutrients and fertilizer. And here was the critical role of filth and excrement. They were in patent coffers, mind the nutrients for this plant, the Vibrio cholerae. So unsanitary urban conditions literally fed the Vibrio sewage was dangerous, not because it got into the water, but because it's seeped into the soil beneath the city, nourishing the Vibrio and giving rise to fermentation, but there's more to it. And patent coffers epidemiology like a plant fermentation required a number of other preconditions. It needed water. Plants always need water. It needed a warm temperature.

Speaker 1:          34:52          It needed air and porous soil in which to grow. And it was at this point that we see why patents coffers theory is sometimes called the groundwater theory. Groundwater was important to his analysis because he considered variations in the water table beneath the city to be a measure of the capacity of its soil beneath the city to support fermentation and give rise to cholera epidemics to higher water table would be like flooding and that would kill the plant too low a table would be like a drought or a desert. So for cholera epidemic, the was an ebbing water table that left moist, porous soil above it, a condition that was likely to be characteristic of the early summer, and indeed Petten coffer now thought he understood the seasonality of cholera, he could explain it seasonality by reference to the water table of European and other cities. So armed with this theory, Petten coffer proceeded to conduct exhaustive epidemiological studies of the local conditions of localities vulnerable to cholera for Petten coffer.

Speaker 1:          36:21          It seemed obvious why mountainous areas. The Alps, for example, didn't, weren't afflicted with cholera. There. There was such a deep layer of insulation between the groundwater and the population who are therefore protected from the collar poison. Similarly, desert areas provided no conditions for fermentation. Pim Petten coffer also thought that he had solved the Leo problem by investigating and studying Leon, he realized that it was built on a thick layer of impenetrable granted was built on stone and therefore provided no opportunity for fermentation and germination. The best conditions were provided by cities that were built at sea level on a loo, veal porous soil. This could explain why Naples was ravaged Paris, London, Calcutta, and then he decided being an honest scientist that he should also investigate in particular the hard case, the one that seemed to conflict with his theories and that was the island of Malta.

Speaker 1:          37:41          Malta was built on rock but it experienced disaster during recurring cholera pandemics and he thought to his own satisfaction that he could solve the riddle. Malta, unlikely all was not built on impermeable. Granted, it had everything to do with the specifics of the stone itself. Malta was built on porous, soft limestone and not provided infinite air filled cavities that if watered and fertilized and warm conditions would provide wonderful places for germination. You can see patent coffer visiting Malta, which he did and having his Eureka moment. He did core samples. I'm trying to say. The patent coffer was a very conscientious research and a strong epidemiologist and he went further. He argued also that he could explain not only which cities where most afflicted by cholera, but also the very neighborhoods within them, low lying areas close to the water table would be vulnerable to cholera neighborhoods built on hills would be protected.

Speaker 1:          39:00          Naples was a good example. The lower city was ravaged, the opera city was not and Petten coffer thought in you why Neapolitans as you know, in fact agreed with him and patent coffers theories were much admired there. It seemed to explain Neapolitan history and it was his theories that were the very basis for the rebuilding project. So he saw his great achievement of that, of developing a single unified theory with no internal contradictions that could explain all of the known facts of cholera and clarify those puzzling cholera mysteries. Now an interesting point about patent coffers theories there now rejected by modern science, but during the 19th century they provided a major impetus to undertake needed sanitary reform. His ideas therefore can be credited probably with saving hundreds of thousands of lives from a variety of diarrheal illnesses. Cholera of course, but also typhoid gastroenteritis. So this is a case of an idea that we now know not to be robust scientifically that nevertheless produced very practical results that had a major impact on combating epidemic diseases.

Speaker 1:          40:37          Patten coffer was responsible in fat for bringing the sanitary idea to Bavaria. He wanted to install sewer systems to take away waste and fecal matter, but not for the reason that snow would have. He wasn't worried that Bavarians would drink infected water or eat contaminated food. He was afraid that the fecal matter would get beneath the city and would nourish the Vibrio and thereby give rise to poisonous fumes that would poison the people. Soon as idea was to make the soil of Germany cities in fertile, so buy a new could do that by depriving the soil of organic matter and excrement. So he wanted to supply Germany with clean water but not specifically clean drinking water, but he wanted to prevent sewage from gaining access to the groundwater and the soil beneath the city. He also championed the idea of sand filtration of water to ensure clean water.

Speaker 1:          41:50          He thought that snow had been seriously misled. There was a matter of proportion here. Snow he said was really concentrated on the few leaders that a person consumed that water. He argued no matter how contaminated would actually do no harm. The real issue was the massive quantity of water of domestic, industrial or household waste that carried fertilizer to the city soil and they're bred disease now. Petten coffer recognize then the clean water and effective sewage and waste disposal. We're a central public health measures so we had as his legacy Petten coffer was the founder of the sanitary movement in Germany. He was also professor of hygiene at the University of Munich. He founded a journal called the archive for hygiene in 1893 and indeed it's still published as the international journal of Hygiene and environmental health. He was the founder of the Mocks Fun Petten Coffer Institute in Munich or world famous research institute dedicated to the promotion of public health.

Speaker 1:          43:11          He became its director and trained people. It became a center of research and training unique at its time. It was an important figure and the founding of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and along with his opponent John Snow, he was a founding father in the field of epidemiology is arguments though now largely discredited. We're supported by prodigious field work. You could imagine him going around Europe taking core samples of soil and rock and correlating that with measuring measurements of the rise and fall of groundwater levels and correlating all of that information with rainfall, temperature measurements and the history of cholera outbreaks. And Preston coffer was tireless in propagating as ideas as a lecturer, as writer. He was an advisor to the Bavarian government and he became president of the Bavarian Academy of Science. Another factor was not patent coffer was quite interested in something else as well. What made people susceptible and he believed that poor nutrition was important factor in that.

Speaker 1:          44:33          So as public health policies also involved attention to diet and nutrition. Of course some of his recommendations were misguided, but one measure he gave great attention to was also the siting of infectious disease hospitals in cemeteries. A collar or a hospital or a cemetery should be located on a hilltop, far from the city center and down wind of it that would prevent the cholera, a germ from percolating down easily into the soil beneath the city and would ensure that any poisonous miasma that arose, we'd be dispersed from the population. So we can see that he helped the way condition the way Naples for example was rebuilt and where the infectious diseases hospital in not city was located, which was high above the city and downwind from him. And as I said to prove his theory he tried is dangerous auto experiment. Uh, his theory was losing ground by 1892 when there was a major epidemic of cholera at Hom Borg and Germany and patent coffer and Robert call were greatly at odds to prove his case.

Speaker 1:          45:55          Patent coffer challenged caulk to provide him with a collar or a cocktail that he volunteered to swallow Cox collaborator golf key duly dispatched a file filled with vibrios. There's some interesting ethical issues here as coffee scent patent coffer, what he thought was a fatal dose of cholera and fully expected patent coffer to die an agonizing death there. Then various accounts of what happened next one account has it that patent coffers lab assistants intercepted the package and diluted the dose. It's also true that the collar or cocktail was sent in February and it may well be that the cold temperature in transit attenuated the variance of the vibrios. In any case, Petten coffer was a man convinced if his theory, he put his life on the line to prove it and he'd Uli swallowed the file that Cox lab had provided he felt seriously ill, have diarrhea, but didn't develop the symptoms he recognized as Asiatic Colorado.

Speaker 1:          47:12          He rapidly recovered and was convinced that he proved that the Vibrio cholera does not directly cause the disease not by being ingested. Well, there wasn't unhappy sequel for patent coffer caulks microbiology by the 1890s convinced the medical world of the germ theory and miasmatic doctrine of all kinds, including patent coffers own were discredited in 1894 he resigned his university chair in 1899 he resigned from his other offices and the 1890s also three of his five children died and his wife and in February 9th, 1901 patent coffer committed suicide. Well, there's a final aspect I'd like to raise in my last minute and that is to say the defeat of anti contagion isn't may have had some negative legacies that it took time to recognize. One of the strengths of patent coffers ideas was the stress they put on what we would now call the environmental, social and economic determinants of disease for a time.

Speaker 1:          48:32          The germ theory of disease relegated those aspects of medicine to the background leading to a narrow gauge stress on microbes and the attempt to find magic bullets to destroy them. So Patton coffer then was ultimately wrong, but I would argue that his ideas were magnificently wrong. They contained important elements of truth and important and vital measures for public health and for medicine. Next time we'll take the high road and move on to the victors in this debate, uh, pastor call LR and the successful proof of the truth of contagion, aneurysm, and the germ theory of disease. But I thought you needed a moment with mocks Vaughn.
