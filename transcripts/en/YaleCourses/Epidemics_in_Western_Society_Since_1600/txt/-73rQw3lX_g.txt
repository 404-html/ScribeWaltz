Speaker 1:          00:02          Well. Good morning. Our topic for this time and next is another, the really ancient diseases in our course, which is tuberculosis, tuberculosis was present in ancient Egypt. This is known from skeletons and from mummies and it seems that tuberculosis has been with human beings ever since. They first began to gather in substantial settlements, which are essential for its transmission and ways we'll be discussing. It was present in ancient Greece and in Rome and Hippocrates and Galen, clearly new patients suffering from tuberculosis. It persisted in the Middle Ages, so we're dealing not with the new but a very ancient disease. A question that you'll be asking is whether indeed it's an epidemic disease, would it perhaps be better to describe it as endemic and this again, I think as when we dealt with malaria, we see that some diseases are both endemic and epidemic and I think the supplies to tuberculosis as well.

Speaker 1:          01:19          One way of thinking of it might be in terms of its timeframe. If you look at any single generation, it often seems that tuberculosis isn't an epidemic disease. It's present after all year after year. It is contagious, but it's spread slowly from person to person. It's course in the individual body of a patient. It was often very slow and capricious. It's clearly different from bubonic plague from influenza or Asiatic cholera, but if you take a longterm perspective, it might seem that tuberculosis does ebb and flow like an epidemic disease. Perhaps one could think of it in terms of an epidemic that lasts for centuries, perhaps or decades in the case of the body of a single patient and times.

Speaker 1:          02:23          In a sense, one could say that tuberculosis could be an epidemic disease in slow motion. Our concern will be with Europe and North America at a time of a vast upsurge, and here I'm referring to Western Europe that coincided with the industrial revolution. Here there are a number of factors that lie in the background that contributed. Probably one is a large skill pace of indoor urbanization and we'll see the impact of crowded housing and poor ventilation, which are decisive factors, particularly in the case of a disease that's a pulmonary disease above all the rise of sweatshops and the factory system again lead to crowding. This time, not in the home, but in the workplace and poor ventilation. Now during the day as well as in the home at night and thinking of low wages and with that poor diet and a compromised immune system. Another factor that's very important for diseases that are respiratory is pollution of the atmosphere and the smog in cities like London due to sit from the burning of coal or particles due to tobacco from smoking or again, particles in mind, shots or run hygienic workshops all made their contribution.

Speaker 1:          04:02          In any case, it's not by chance that England, the first industrial nation experienced an epidemic wave that crested between the middle of the 18th century and the middle of the 19th and then in the case of England, there was a slow, steady decline from the later decades of the 19th century. And we can see this as well taking place in countries that industrialized a little bit later, say France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the upsurge began later, but did so remorselessly and then a decline set in. But again, slightly later from the beginning of the 20th century. If you look at the geography of tuberculosis in Europe, it would also support this idea of a clear relationship between tuberculosis as a condition and the conditions created by industrial development, especially in it's traumatic early phases. Tuberculosis was a major killer in the northern industrial nations, Britain, Germany and France, and it was less prevalent and less industrial, largely agricultural nations such as Italy and Spain.

Speaker 1:          05:29          So there's this distinction to be made, but also if you look at the pattern of tuberculosis in Italy, in Spain, uh, you would see not only was it less there, but also it respected the distribution of industrial development. Take Italy for example, we already talked in the case of malaria about a major north south divide. This is also true with regard tuberculosis, but in reverse tuberculosis and other words was an affliction above all of Italy's northern cities and it was much less prevalent in the aquacultural south where people worked out doors. Well, let's turn now to the nature of the disease, how it's transmitted, it's different forms and it's symptomatology in the body. The pathogen to begin with was first discovered by someone we know well now and a variety of contracts, and this is Robert Kaul who discovered it in 1882 the micro bacterium tuberculosis, which is

Speaker 2:          06:49          thought.

Speaker 1:          06:51          Now transmission tuberculosis can be spread in more than one way, but we're concerned and will be concerned primarily with its dominant mode of transmission, which is through the air. In other words, uh, suffer from tuberculosis, we'll say cough, sneeze, spit,

Speaker 2:          07:15          okay.

Speaker 1:          07:16          And give off airborne droplets,

Speaker 1:          07:20          which are then inhaled by other people. No, a primary infection by most people who come into contact with mycobacterium tuberculosis, doesn't develop, lead on to symptoms. It usually heals, but in those with compromised immune systems, the disease as the expression was, is disseminated. It can then lie dormant for years. As I've said, one of the things about tuberculosis is it's enormous, uh, capricious quality, enormously capricious quality. Alternatively, it could produce disease within weeks of the primary infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can spread via the bloodstream or the lymph system too. In fact, a variety of organs and produce lesions in virtually any tissue in the body. I'll show you now a number of images of suffers from tuberculosis in various forms and I'm hoping that these images won't be overly distressing to anyone. Uh, first this is squab Phila sometimes called the king's eval which was here we have [inaudible] of the neck are those tuberculosis of the skin called Lupus.

Speaker 1:          08:57          Vulgarness. Tuberculosis can also infect them in NGS of the brain, the bone and joints, the kidneys, the urinary and reproductive system and can in fact the spine leading to severe deformity and hunchback. I'll show you the not form, it's called pots disease and there's a skeleton from a software of pots disease or this would be what it would look like. The disease can also affect the lining of the abdominal cavity or the heart, but overwhelmingly the most common form of tuberculosis is of the lungs and this is what we'll be dealing with primarily in the course pulmonary disease, also known as stasis or consumption. We'll mention in passing that tuberculosis is also a spread and was spread by mill meat or milk of infected animals, but that's a secondary tragedy within the larger dominant pulmonary form of the disease. Now, you know from your reading response questions and from Barnes is book this week that tuberculosis is sometimes referred to as a social disease.

Speaker 1:          10:27          And you'll see in your, in trays that I've just sent you a, um, an email about social diseases and how we might think of them. But just for the moment, you'll note that Barnes doesn't define what he means by social disease by saying that it was a social disease. He's arguing that tuberculosis had a predilection for certain social classes, that it was a disease that was unlike, um, that it didn't affect all classes equally. Now note that cholera for example, um, was a disease that didn't affect all social classes. Tuberculosis did in fact afflict royal families, aristocrats, artists' riders and professionals. And this was an important factor in the social response to the disease. Given the mode of transmission that is through the air, it was inevitable that that would be the case.

Speaker 1:          11:41          So even if we do decide to call tuberculosis a social disease, we need to make major qualifications, but to focus on the rich and famous is distorting because out of all proportion, tuberculosis did. And still a flicks the poor, especially the urban poor. Remember the risk factors we said living in cities rather than the countryside. Crowded unhygienic housing, poor ventilation workplaces that were similar to those of the home child labor on mass lowered resistance due to poor diet or preexisting diseases. Tuberculosis then thrived in slums and tenements among industrial workers and among the inmates of alms houses, prisons, barracks.

Speaker 1:          12:42          Let me give you some illustrations and we'll look at some famous pictures. I think that we have no better ones than the photographs taken by Yaka Reese of tenements and sweat shops in New York City in the 1880s and nineties, some of which were collected and is really famous and influential book. How the other half lives that was published in 1890 and I'd like to show you some of the pictures. This is a slide of a tournament, uh, an ideal place for tuberculosis. We'll be looking first at some pictures of housing. And I'd like you just to, you'd make the imaginative leap of thinking what are the kinds of conditions if you live in these places that facilitate the spread of tuberculosis. Again, this is from Yaka breeze, a tenement in New York City. Uh, here we see the conditions in which people were sleeping. This is what was called 7 cent lodgings and an unhappy street pell street in New York City.

Speaker 1:          14:06          Um, and you can see, uh, how tuberculosis would thrive in conditions like this. But let's also remember the tuberculosis also thrive because of conditions at work. And here's a sweatshop in the garment district in New York City again in the 1890s or here again, another picture. I think you get the point, remember to that prison populations then and now have been seriously affected with consumption because the inmates there have often lived in conditions like those if tenements with ventilation or lighting pervasive down overcrowding, inadequate diet for sanitation and conditions like that. Tuberculosis runs riot. Indeed, The New York Times reported in 1908 but it was a lie. When judges sentenced convicted felons to hard labor, the truth, the paper reported the sentence should be labeled to hard labor and tuberculosis and an inspection in 1905 the New York state superintendent, if prisons declared that sing sing prison in particular, and here I'm quoting from the superintendent of prisons if New York state, he called it a hotbed for the culture and spread of tuberculosis that should be in band and as unfit for human habitation.

Speaker 1:          15:52          Well, even if a person is infected, as I said in the vast majority of people, the immune system of the body contains the disease and the 19th century San Paris or la for probably New York City as well, it's estimated that virtually every inhabitant had encountered microbacterium tuberculosis, but most remained asymptomatic and noninfectious. An active infection was promoted by a compromised immune system, let's say perhaps heredity, alcoholism, malnutrition, drug abuse, the presence of concurrent infections that are immunosuppressive and our own times. One can think of malaria, aids or two diabetes as forming a good substratum for tuberculosis. What are the symptoms of TB? Well, it's extremely variable. One of the mysteries of medicine in fact, is the course of tuberculosis in the human body. It can be fulminant and lead to death and months. This is often called galloping consumption at the time or Miliary tuberculosis. Alternatively, there can be an onset of symptoms followed by recovery or remission and then a relapse and instead of leading to early death, it can lead to a long chronic illness, often punctuated by prolonged remissions and equally mysterious relapses.

Speaker 1:          17:43          Before the age of antibiotics, some 80% of cases were deemed and fatally, but in a time span that varied from up to 1520 years and in every age the respond to serious Tanea secures or parent cures. Let's look at two opposite extremes. Two famous cases, the medical careers of two famous 19th century British riders. The first is John keys who lived from 1795 until his death from tuberculosis and 1821 no 1821 because he fell ill in February, 1820 and died the next year at the age of 26 from galloping and consumption. Kate's in fact became an icon of the relationship of tuberculosis to the arts and to genius and entire century was familiar with the fact that he contracted the disease while tending his diet, dying brother, that he made a desperate departure from Britain to Rome in search of health and it knows the world, knew at the time of his death and burial there after a final period that was widely and romantically regarded as his most productive and brilliant his life was described by romantic riders as not of a meteor, a comment or a candle that rapidly burned itself out.

Speaker 1:          19:30          And this became a focal point. And Keats himself did for the way this disease was construed or socially constructed in the middle of the 19th century as the disease of genius, it was considered to be a disease of sensibility and civilization. Let's look at the disease, um, of a different person whom you all know. Well, this is Robert Louis Stevenson who lived from 1850 to 1,894. This is a picture of him and about 18, 19. Now Stevenson, unlike kicks, battled tuberculosis for decades, he went in and out of health spas and sanatoriums, but he led a long and productive life that was ended in fact, ironically not by tuberculosis, but probably by a stroke. Now in the 19th century, physicians regarded the course of pulmonary disease as passing through three stages as they saw it.

Speaker 1:          20:43          But remember though, before the tuberculin skin test and the development of radiology, tuberculosis was difficult to diagnose as the symptoms mimic those of other common diseases. And even if the diagnosis was accurate, one stage merged imperceptibly into another. But for 19th century physicians, there was still this distinction. Now, the first stage as they described it was marked by a persistent cough. Some difficulty in breathing, especially after exercise. The patient would sweat profusely. There would be an elevated pulse pain in the chest and shoulders, general lassitude, a loss of weight, power, declining performance at work or at school. Then came the second stage when the cough became tormenting and frequent and the patient would begin to cough up a greenish phlegm. He or she would experience intermittent fevers spiking twice daily at copia sweating and a rapid pulse. The patient would suffer from severe fatigability from hoarseness that made it difficult and painful to eat or to speak above a whisper.

Speaker 1:          22:13          There would be extreme shortness of breath on exertion. Pain in the joints of the body. Then came the third stage of advanced tuberculosis, which gave the most common 19th century name to the disease consumption. That is a frightening emaciation in which the body wasted away or seem to be consumed. The face would be hollow. The complexion Pale. Perhaps this was one of the reasons that it was called the white plague. The eyes would be sunken in their sockets and a patient could easily look like this. This is a picture of a consumptive patient in 1892 the cough now seemed like a death rattle and the patient would cough blood. There would be constant pain in the joints. The legs would be swollen, there would be fever, often uncontrollable diarrhea and extreme shortness of breath. At that point, the diagnosis was certain, but at this advanced stage, death was imminent and it's form was unpleasant and painful.

Speaker 1:          23:31          Often asphyxia as the patient virtually drowned on the phlegm in his or her lungs or there could be a sudden and unstoppable hemorrhage with blood rushing from the mouth and nostrils and the patient again suffocating. Well, what was it that happened to the lungs? Well, here's a, some modern ex-ray slide of a TB patient's lungs. And let's look behind the X-ray at a pictures of the lungs. Here are, is a set of healthy lungs, um, hopefully like all of yours. And then I'd like to take you through the drawings and pictures of the process called cavitation in the lungs and what the way in which the mycobacterium tuberculosis consumes the respiratory organs. This is a famous drawing by Renee Lynette, you know, of the Paris School of medicine who was a tuberculosis authority. And he did this drawing of the onset of the cavitation in the lungs. Let's look,

Speaker 2:          24:49          uh,

Speaker 1:          24:50          at a picture of it. Uh, this is the process of necrosis at work in the tissues. And the end result would be the destruction of the lungs, which would look more or less like that.

Speaker 2:          25:09          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          25:09          So this was, uh, an enormously painful, horrible and unpleasant disease. And I want to argue that there are two great eras in the modern history of tuberculosis in which the disease was conceived or thought of quite differently and without much relationship to the reality of the quality of the symptoms. The two periods are divided by the watershed of the germ theory of disease established by Robert Kaul from about 1882 and slowly then accepted thereafter by the medical profession and educated society as a whole, not instantly, but in the decades that follow. Now I'd like to call the first era the era of consumption or perhaps the romantic era of tuberculosis. Let's define it from the end of the 18th century to the middle to the bout. Uh, the time of Robert caughts discovery. It was jolted first by in the 1860s and seventies by the work of Sean Antoine via Ma and France, who first convincingly proposed the idea that TB was contagious.

Speaker 1:          26:35          And then the romantic era clearly came to an end with the work of Robert Call when accepts this new interpretation and the word consumption begins to fade from popular usage. Thomas Men's great book, the Magic Mountain is perhaps the last great artistic expression of the consumptive era and it susceptibilities. Now, what was the idea behind the romantic or consumptive theory? It's most authoritative formulation was fine. The great authority of the Paris School of medicine, when they Lynette, who's drawing you just saw the man who invented the stethoscope and spent his life listening to the lungs of tuberculosis patients. Lynette talked about what he called the essential list theory. Ironically, given the opposition of the parish school to Galen and humorless teachings, we could see a centralism as actually a form of humor. Realism revived a kind of anti contagion aneurysm in classic dress. Now note the irony your friend ackerk necked at is the historian of medicine observed dryly.

Speaker 1:          28:02          After all, things have to be explained somehow. Well, TB was explained and primarily by internal causes due to the inherited essence of the patients, his or her constitution or in Linnex jargon, the patients diathesis which caused him or her to be susceptible to the immediate factors that triggered the actual illness. So you're a diathesis was an inborn inherited defect, precipitated or immediate causes supervened and these were thought to be some irregularity in the patient's life. Very important in the literature or alcoholism and sexual excess. Lunette postulated that two sorts of issues were important to him. One more what he called Lipase on Trieste melancholy sorrow or despair. And again, um, sexual excess, the loss of bodily fluids was thought to weaken the body and lead to illness, but both were almost an aspect of an individual's fade, his or her nature. So consumption, unlike the other great epidemic killer of the 19th century that is cholera was not thought to be contagious but hereditary and therefore its victims weren't feared or thought to be dangerous.

Speaker 1:          29:47          And Tuberculosis was a slow killer, not a cause of sudden death and its symptoms. By the canons of the day, we're deemed to be respectable and not thought to be disgusting or source of unbearable torment. And death was private unlike cholera, not a public spectacle. Furthermore, tuberculosis wasn't so frightening because it was also an [inaudible] endemic disease and was ever present in society. So the effects on society, we're not at all like those of Asiatic cholera. We mustn't think of diseases as interchangeable causes of death that had the same effects on the societies. They afflict tuberculosis, didn't lead to terror, hysteria, xenophobia, revolt, and it's for in its first phase, it didn't lead to stigmatization, but it's opposite. Patients with tuberculosis were thought to be glamorous, sexy, and chic. They were blameless as it was their heredity that was responsible and there weren't outbursts of religiosity. There was a recognition of Lard that in fact, large numbers of the social elite fell victim to the disease. There was no poisoning frenzy. This disease was too slow, too unrelated to digestion, too, associated with the powerful as well as the poor. And it was true that doctors and officials paid their tribute to the disease, but it did have major social effects. And let's think about what some of them were. Uh, first was be the widespread experience of patients. This is the career of invalid ism. Tuberculosis after diagnosis became a lifetime career.

Speaker 3:          31:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:58          The rest of one's life after receiving diagnosis was unknown and unpredictable. And this would affect every possible decision, career choices, whether to marry and have a family, whether to place one's normal responsibilities on hold and to devote life to seeking to recover health.

Speaker 1:          32:28          And so the sufferers tended to undertake and new an all consuming occupation, restoring health, and to accept what would probably be an early death. Let's think for example of um, Antoine Checkoff, who's the men on the left. Pictured here with Leo Tolstoy. Now checkoff who lived from 1860 to 1904 was a sufferer from consumption. It was forced to abandon his own career and is actress, wife in Moscow in the attempt to restore his shattered health to do so, he went to the mild climate of the Crimea. His plays were all written in the period of his illness and all subtly have invalid ism as a hidden but unmentioned theme. The protagonists in checkoffs plays not by chance, seem oddly unable to act. They seem to be waiting and waiting for events beyond their control to unfold. The middle classes tended to go off to what was called taking the cure.

Speaker 1:          33:54          That is they travel in Europe. They would go to a climate that was thought to be favorable spas and health resorts and southern Europe on the French Riviera or an Italy. Those were favorite destinations and the list of distinguished travelers is lengthy. Keats and Shelley went to Rome to buy a smaller, went to nice the Brownings went to Florence, Chopin went to Mayorca. Paul Erlick went to Egypt, but this was also true in our own country. In the United States. People took see journeys to recover their health or they traveled to the West on the South West and here the famous frontier thesis in American history. As you got another meaning, health seekers formed a substantial current that is of the movement West and turned into a large scale movement with the availability of the railroad from the 1870s Colorado Springs and Pasedena or examples of communities that were founded by and for tuberculosis sufferers.

Speaker 1:          35:13          Also popular were other destinations, Florida and the Caribbean, and the cure became a kind of industry. It was stimulated by a flood of medical books by rumor and anecdote by brochures prepared by interested parties such as the railroad companies. There was other exotic but more affordable ways of seeking the cure. One was altitude therapy in which you'd go up high in a hot air balloon. More commonly, people moved out doors simply where they lived in New York City. At the turn of the century, the buildings were dotted with people who had moved to live in tents on the roofs and porches of apartment buildings or in their back yards if they had them. Let me remind you of Professor Irving Fischer of Yale University, who in 1907 promoted health by inventing a tent that he claimed was perfectly ventilated for those who took to the out of doors life and he wanted his tent to make outdoor living affordable for the pure, for the poor.

Speaker 1:          36:36          He himself was a consumptive, but he regained his health after living out of doors and he aimed to make the cure universally available. If you read the New York Times, you would see there were people who move not only to tense but also to tree houses that they constructed in their yards and example being Charles Battersby of rent them Massachusetts, a consumptive who constructed a house between two adjoining pine trees and moved into it full time in the winter of 1906 who knows to what extent the travels, if people were also means to escape the regimens that if they stayed at home their physicians would have subjected them to at home. The treatments weren't especially enjoyable. There was bleeding and cupping to release the noxious agents. There were direct applications to the lesions, poultices ointments, infusions. There was also the spray therapy that is inhalations in which the doctors were attempting to attack the disease at its C as you inhaled gas mixtures, creosote and carbolic acid had a large vogue and these centuries.

Speaker 1:          38:07          Well, what about the effectiveness of the travels? Well, in some cases it's probably safe to say that the travel were beneficial for pulmonary tuberculosis. It probably did help to escape the urban smog of a place like London for Lupus full Garris. The disease of the skin. Sunlight is known to be beneficial and it was probably beneficial just to have hope and to have the belief that you could do something to help yourself that probably did more good than harm. Tuberculosis also clearly had economic and demographic effects. Tuberculosis was the greatest killer of the young at the time and an inevitably limit to the growth of population. It limited the expansion of the economy and caused widespread poverty. There was a new one, awareness and sensitivity to this death with romanticism.

Speaker 1:          39:15          Tuberculosis, I want to say was not the cause of romanticism, but it is true that romantic literature and the arts did fit some qualities about tuberculosis. That is romanticism, stress, the transiency of youth, early death, melancholy life as a femoral, the importance of autumn as a symbol no longer now assemble of the harvest, but as a time of falling leaves, dying flowers as death sets in genius was part of it. The redemptive and ennobling idea of suffering that releases the life of the soul as the gross material body wastes away and there was a poetic quality that was attributed to tuberculosis. It was sad to release genius and creativity.

Speaker 1:          40:25          So one sees this portrayed in romantic works in the century. Emily Bronte, weathering heights, Victor Hugo lame. He said, ah Blah. Alexandre Dumas honoring inertia or the romantic opera, Verdi La Traviata or Puccini's, Labo m. Then I would argue the tuberculosis also, so it had an effect and the effect the causal chain worked in both ways and effect and promoting romanticism and romanticism in turn promoted a certain understanding or social construction of the disease itself had a major impact. Then on literature and was portrayed often in literature and indeed in the opera tuberculosis also had an effect on gender issues. I would argue that it helped to promote a new idea of feminine beauty, thin, elongated to Burke jeweler, short pallor at the time, white powders, not Suntan oil is today where the fashion, let me show you an example. This is a famous painting of a woman at the table by to lose little trek and you'll note that she looks extremely polished and it's quite thin.

Speaker 1:          41:56          Uh, but what I wanted to point out is what she has in front of her, uh, which is a pot of rice powder that she puts on her face to imitate the power of a consumptive one. Can see this also in the paintings of the pre Ralphio lights, whose favorite models were often women with tuberculosis. Elizabeth Siddall for example, was a model for 10 years of and then became the wife of Dante Rosette t and became also a model for molay. Jane burden became the model and also the wife of William Morris and one can see some of the, uh, you can see the long gated, uh, this is Mariana. This is the bay ought to bear tricks.

Speaker 1:          42:53          In any case, then consumption was a fatal, debilitating, and excrutiatingly painful disease. But paradoxically then it was given positive associations in the way it was described at the time tuberculosis was said to make the body beautiful, to make a person spiritual by wasting away the gross flesh. And it was said to enhance creativity and genius. How can this be explained? Well, in the United States, tuberculosis was also thought to be the white plague, partly because it was popularly regarded as a disease that affected the white race and not African Americans who were thought to have a different affliction. In the middle of the 19th century tellingly, it was called the white man's plague and the white men scourge in this country and in Europe. It wasn't associated in the popular mind with the working classes. And people remembered that aristocrats and artistic celebrities often contracted it. And you can see the power of what we might call advertising, the endless stream of novels, poems, operas that extolled the beauty and sensitivity of those afflicted.

Speaker 1:          44:21          In addition, recalling what we said about Gubernick Plagge, tuberculosis did not evoke the fear of Moore's rape and sudden death. So dreaded with bubonic plague or Asiatic cholera with consumption. There was no danger that a person would be caught unaware and not even have time to write his or her will. The disease was spiritual in part because it worn the sufferer of death and ample time to work out one's relationship with God and with the community. And there was also a simple matter of comparison consumption. Death, consumptive death was perhaps construed as beautiful because pulmonary disease didn't disfigure in the manner of smallpox. It's symptoms weren't degrading in the manner of Asiatic cholera. Well, so to make the point, let's turn to a work that probably all of you know, the most influential, best selling novel of the 19th century, which was Harriet Beecher snow uncle Tom's cabin.

Speaker 1:          45:37          You probably know very well that it was a religious novel about Social Justice and God's way with men, that it was about Simon legree and the horrors of slavery and called for abolition. But you've probably forgotten that it was also a major tuberculosis novel and that the heroin at when the child little ava dies of consumption. Let me remind you of how Harriet Beecher Stowe described approaching death and she wrote for so bright and placid was the farewell voyage of the little spirit by such sweet and fragrant breezes was the small bark born towards the heavenly shores that it was impossible to realize that death was approaching. The child felt no pain, only a trend, cool soft weakness daily and almost insensibly increasing. And she was so beautiful, so loving, so trustful, so happy. The one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of innocence in peace that seem to breathe all around her.

Speaker 1:          47:01          Her father found a strange, calm coming over him. It wasn't hope that was impossible. It was not resignation. It was only a calm resting in the present. That seems so beautiful that he wished to think of no future was like that hush of spirit that we feel the mid, the bright mild woods of autumn when the bright, hectic flushes on the trees and the last lingering flowers by the brook and we joy in all the more because we know that it will soon pass away. I would argue that this barest little relationship to the actual extraordinary suffering of tuberculosis at the very end, and I think it makes a good way to have a transition from the consumptive era to what I would call the era of tuberculosis, when the way that disease, this disease was constructed and understood changes radically. And this comes about after the germ theory of disease and the work of Robert Call when the disease was found not to be hereditary and due to one's diaphysis, but to be a nasty, contagious disease. When softwares became objects of fear and stigma attached to them, when the glamor of consumption was stripped away, as was its association with feminine beauty and Mail Genius and poetry and its appeal as a period of spirituality and sexuality disappeared. So that's what I want to talk about next time, which is the movement from the era of consumption to the era of tuberculosis.
