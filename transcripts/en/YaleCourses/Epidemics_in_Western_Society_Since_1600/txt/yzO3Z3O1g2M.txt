Speaker 1:          00:01          Well. Good morning. We can continue with our subject of Asiatic cholera. And I thought we could perhaps frame that discussion by reminding you that in the 1990s, the Nobel Prize winning microbiologist Joseph Lederer coined a term emerging diseases. He used it to describe infectious diseases that are previously unknown, at least two sources of human infection and emerge as it were for the first time too. In fact, human beings, these are diseases in our own day. We can think of Ebola or limes disease, SARS or of course most importantly, HIV aids. Oftenly often, uh, the press, which seems I would argue to suffer chronically from historical Amnesia, it often treats the appearance of new infections is something unprecedented, unnatural that never happened before. But the reality is the Charles Darwin was correct. We live in the midst of a constantly evolving microbial world in which the microbes have an inherent advantage because of the frequency of their mutations and the extremely brief length of a microbial generation compared with the human one.

Speaker 1:          01:38          So new diseases have always been emerging and appearing. And Asiatic cholera is a good example of what we might go. Let's be mindful. It would be historically anocronysms it, we might call it a great emerging disease of the 19th century. There is a scholarly debate on whether cholera had long existed on the Indian subcontinent and whether it went back for centuries or not, especially it clearly by the early 19th century had an endemic home on the Indian subcontinent and particularly the area here in the delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. That's that area. There are accounts of diseases, um, in various writings that are suggestive of cholera well before the 19th century. But that particular debate is exotic for our purposes. And what we want to know is that by the early 19th century, it was endemic in the Indian, in the Indian subcontinent, but it was unknown elsewhere then world until it burst into a major epidemic in 1817 then escaped India and began.

Speaker 1:          03:08          It's devastating international career reaching Europe for the first time in 1830 so cholera for the 19th century was something new, something never before experienced. And that helps to explain a lot. Good. Part of the reaction to the populations that were first afflicted by it as the Great Colorado, uh, we should remember was the great fear disease of the 19th century. We've already seen that plague was the most dreaded disease from the 14th century through the 17th and we know that smallpox succeeded in that role in the 18th cholera though not the great killer of the 19th century was the most feared affliction. It was feared for a number of reasons. It's extremely sudden appearance. It's exotic and unfamiliar character, the agonizing and gruesome nature of its symptoms, its high case fatality rate, and it's predilection for adults and the prime of life rather than children.

Speaker 1:          04:27          It's revealing that a great deal of the discussion surrounding the early experiences with cholera revolved around the question of whether this was in fact the return of the plague. Some of the names that were given to cholera capture, the fear, it inspired. It was known in all kinds of ways. If you read the medical journals of the 19th century and the press, you see it was called Asiatic cholera, cholera, more bus, perhaps very scary, tingly. Cholera asphyxia was known as the gypsy, the monster blue cholera, and king cholera among other names as well. Now, since the 19th century was an era of acute social tensions, it was, as you all know, marked by a series of revolutions and is often dubbed the rebellious century. For that reasons, you know about the revolutions of 1830 the revolutionary wave of 1848 to nine across the continent. When there were something like 50 revolutions within a two year period, Italian independence, the Paris commune one could go on, but due to the fact that cholera frequently accompanied those events and indisputably did heighten social and political tensions, it used to be common to speculate about whether the passage of cholera across Europe was itself a contributary factor and the coming of revolutionary outbursts.

Speaker 1:          06:08          By now, it's pretty clear that the causal chain actually work the other way around. In other words, the outbreak of revolution, war and social order created conditions for cholera to thrive call removed. I would argue in the wake of revolution rather than triggering it, so cholera if it didn't cause the revolutions that mark the 19th century. There has been in recent literature, a swing of the pendulum in a different direction with the views sometimes express that cholera was dramatic. Yes, but not a lasting influence on the history of the West. After all. Some would say that it was dramatic that it led to all sorts of short term sound and fury, but in the longterm that argument runs its legacy was small and clearly know where the near the order of magnitude of plague and small pox. Well, we'll be deciding among those conflicting views, but before we can assess them properly, we should look in our usual way at the etiology of cholera at its epidemiology.

Speaker 1:          07:27          It's symptoms and its course in European and North American history. Then we'll be in a better position to judge its impact. Well, there were seven pandemics of Asiatic Congo row, the first in 1817 to 23 which was an Asian event. The second pandemic was in the 1830s and did Asia, but also Europe for the first time in North America. The third pandemic of 1846 to 62 afflicting Asia, Europe, again, North America, the fourth pandemic from 65 to 75. Again, it was global. The fifth pandemic from 1881 to 96 mainly a matter of Asia and Europe, the sixth pandemic of 1899 to 23. Again, primarily an Asian and European event. And then the seventh pandemic, uh, from 1960 onward that went through Asia, South America, and Africa. The last pandemic, however, has been milder and less variant with a new bio-type, the all tour, which is less dramatic and less fatal than classic cholera, which is our subject and which was the form of cholera from the first pen, dammit, through the sixth.

Speaker 1:          09:01          The endemic home if cholera, it's I've said was the Indian said continent in the delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers and it was confined there until the number of developments enabled it to spread the bacterium that causes cholera is extremely delicate and doesn't travel so easily. So it required a number of factors that enabled the disease to move beyond its original area of endemicity. What were some of those? One was colonialism itself, which meant large scale troop movements, uh, and increasing contact between the sub continent and the outside world. The increase in trade did the same thing in terms of increasing continent contact. Then there was the transport revolution, which was very important because as I said, cholera doesn't travels so well over extended periods of time and it was the railroad, the steam ship, and later in the century, the Suez Canal that radically reduced the traveling time from the sub continent to other parts of the world.

Speaker 1:          10:23          Another major factor was religious pilgrimages and fares in the Indian sub continent itself and very PR most especially from the European perspective. A very important factor was the hodge, the voyage of pious Muslims to Mecca. Now that cholera afflicted Europe and North America in the 19th century wasn't therefore a matter of chance. Epidemic diseases exploit features of societies that are social, political, and economic and environmental. Now, cholera is spread as we'll see exclusively by the oral fecal root that is, it's ingested by food and water contaminated by feces, and it requires, therefore, it clearly is, uh, in among the diseases certainly that we've examined so far. Cholera is clearly different from plague and small pox, and then it's much more a social disease that is to say a disease that has a clear predilection for poverty and for, uh, pathologies of social and economic life. Cholera thrived on chaotic, rapid, unplanned, urbanization with it's overcrowding and teaming slums within adequate and insecure water. This continues to be true with cholera in our own day. It thrives on substandard housing.

Speaker 2:          12:10          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:11          on inadequate and inappropriate diet. It has a predilection for port cities, which are usually the first place is to be affected. This reminds us perhaps of plague a little bit, places in Europe like Marsay onboard Valencia, Naples were among the first and most frequently to be afflicted. Cholera thrives also on filth and the absence of sewage systems. Cholera is among many things a disease of poverty, cholera, also how to pronounce predilection for the poor as I've said. And then that way it exacerbated social tensions.

Speaker 1:          13:00          Colorado, uh, as I said, was associated with revolutions though it followed rather than provoke them. You can see that the revolt in Poland in 1830 the revolutions of 1848 to 49 when cholera is often part of the movement of troops to repress the revolutions rather than being a factor in there cause it was conditioned by the 1860 [inaudible] war between Austrian pressure as well. Well, what about the disease itself? The pathogen is this, the Vibrio cholerae, which was discovered by Robert Call in 1883 helping to establish the germ theory of disease. No. Uh, this will note the flagellum or tail of the Vibrio that plays an important role in the human gut. And we'll talk about that in a moment. It's transmission, you know, uh, pretty well because if you're reading for this week on Jon snow on the mode of communication of cholera, you know that this is one of the foundational texts of epidemiology where he did a brilliant epidemiological job of detective work by finding, uh, the famous broad street pump that the people who drank the water from that particular pump, we're the ones who fell ill and took the disease back to their homes.

Speaker 1:          14:37          Snow did a good job of establishing the Colorado then was ingested in water primarily, although it was also demonstrated later that fish and vegetables that is food contaminated with fecal matter can also play a role. This was, um, the faint. That's Jon snow.

Speaker 2:          15:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:02          And this is the famous broad street pump. Ah, that made such an important moment in the history of medical science and Epidemiology. Though it's important to remember that it may seem odd to you as you read this book and look at all of snow's evidence to remember that in fact it failed to convince the medical profession at the time. By and large, there was a big debate about whether cholera was contagious or not. We'll be coming back to that debate and the reasons for and against. But one of the things was that Jon snow was unable to demonstrate an actual mechanism. There was something in the water, but he wasn't able to establish what it was and therefore he didn't provide a convincing mechanism. And for people who thought that probably it was some chemical factor, if it was anything that snows biggest chance of making an argument was not, it would be something chemical.

Speaker 1:          16:05          Well, if so, and remember this was London, uh, if there was some sort of chemical in the river Thames, surely it would be infinitely diluted. And so how would it be possible that this chemical substance, if that's what it was, ah, was spreading the disease. So there was a big debate about whether snow was actually right. It was proved later in the century conclusively that he was, but it's important to realize that for a long time, his writing was very far from convincing the international medical profession. That didn't happen until the 1880s and 1890s well, what were some of the factors in the transmission of cholera in the West? We've talked about trade and the transport revolution. We've talked about pilgrimages, we've talked about the strategic role of sea ports. We're, once again, as in the case of flag, it would be important the bacterium would gain access to the municipal water supply.

Speaker 2:          17:13          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:13          And there would also be the danger of swimming or if eating shellfish that fed on sewage, especially if the costume was to eat it raw, the disease would then spread along inland transportation networks. We've said to that cholera was a disease of urbanization. And if a defective urban infrastructure infrastructure without sewage systems, and remember in the 19th century, waste in European cities was predominantly thrown into the streets where there would be a seepage downward into tank wells that people would then, uh, drink the water. And it's bacterial bounty. Remember too that the many of the cities of Europe, Naples, that you're reading about, but Paris too and many others, uh, we're surrounded by vegetable gardens and the vegetables would be brought into the city and consumed by the population. But in the growing of the vegetables, uh, use was made of urban sewage, which was collected and transported to the vegetable gardens outside the city.

Speaker 1:          18:34          And then, uh, the sewage was used as fertilizer, which good not to waste anything. And the plants then grew in human sewage and then the vegetables were brought back to town. So we have a wonderful way for the bacterium to make an excellent round trip between the surrounding the hinterland and the city itself. This was the practice of sewerage farming, which was extensive throughout the west. And it was a good trick that market farmers knew very well market gardeners, which was not if you had an open sewer and they were many, if you dipped your head of lettuce and the way to market into the sewer, um, then the ammonia from human urine would make the vegetables look fresh for sale in the market. So that was a good little trick that you might want to remember in any case. Overcrowding was also another important, uh, factor in, uh, in this.

Speaker 1:          19:35          And I just want you to remember housing conditions. These are the fun Daci in Naples that you've been reading about and you can see that this is a place if you use your imagination, that's a wonderful place for cholera epidemic. Uh, not only the, uh, the, uh, the, the fact of [inaudible] lack of sewage and wells, but the fact that it's really dark and it's overcrowded and people, lots of people live in a single room and not single room is used as the sick room, the sleeping room. It's a place also work. Food supplies are stored and with little opportunity to have clean hands and remember that the Vibrio cholera is spread through, um, fecal matter. But this, the point is that in these conditions and in the dark, it's very difficult to see. Um, and therefore, uh, it's difficult to know when contamination was actually taking place or moving from Naples.

Speaker 1:          20:48          These are streets and nodding. Him and England were cholera also caused a major, a couple of major epidemics for similar reasons. And the waste matter was simply hurled into streets like this. And in the center of the street would be the gutter which would carry um, human waste as well. Another source of contamination is flies which carry the, um, the cholera, a bacterium with them, the clothing of victims that is the bed linen, the mattresses, uh, and so forth. We're also sources of infection. And laundresses were people who were particularly likely to fall victim and remember that cholera spread also by asymptomatic carriers, it was possible to have to be spreading, shedding the bacterium without exhibiting symptoms. Well, how was the, what were the symptoms of cholera and that I'm going to argue the symptoms. The symptomatology is an important factor and the social response to this dreadful disease and it's caught captured by such terms as blue, cholera, cholera, asphyxia, and the monster.

Speaker 1:          22:09          This is a picture of a representation of a cholera victim in, um, the agony of the disease. And this is an imaginative idea of how overwhelming it is. This is a cholera, a patient about to be overwhelmed by, um, the disease itself. Well, the bodily defenses are against cholera are numerous. The saliva in the mouth was an important defense. Uh, the digestive juices of the stomach are acidic and tend to kill the bacterium, uh, when it's ingested. So it's quite possible to, in just cholera bacteria without failing falling victim to the disease itself. But there are a number of important variables that condition. What happens next? One would be how great extensive, uh, the infective dose actually was. How much, uh, did you swallow? The diet that you're living on is important because such foods that the poor in particular lived on in European cities as right an overwrite proof and vegetables and other words, the poor, we're likely to buy goods that were beginning, degenerate and deteriorate because they'd be marked down in price.

Speaker 1:          23:49          And those would be the goods that the poor would live on. And this meant that they often suffered from diarrheal illnesses and those reduce the digestive time and therefore deprive the stomach of its defensive capacity to protect you by the acidity of the digestive juices. And the consumption of raw fruit, for example, would be especially common in the summer months. Another factor would be the general health of the person who was exposed to the disease. But let's suppose that you've eaten a very large infective dose and it passes successfully through your stomach, into the small intestine. What happens next? Well, there's an incubation period. Uh, it can be as short as a few hours and this to what's important in the social history of cholera and could last up to three days. The site of infection is the small intestine there. The flagellum at the tail of the bacterium that we've seen propels the Vibrio and it attaches itself to the intestinal wall.

Speaker 1:          25:11          Ironically, they're the, um, uh, immune system of the body is usually capable of killing the bacterium. But when it does, the bacterium dies, it releases a very powerful toxin and enter rotax toxin. That's one of the most powerful poisons in nature and its effect on the intestinal wall is to cause it to work in reverse. That is to drain fluid from the bloodstream into the bowel. And from there it's expelled. So the mechanism by which cholera Kilz, first of all, and predominantly is a sort of hemorrhaging to death in which the blood serum loses its fluid massively. Leaders can be expelled in a matter of a few hours. And the patient hemorrhages to death in effect losing its blood plasma and [inaudible] screening what are called the famous right water, rice, water stools. And the patient goes into hypovolemic shock.

Speaker 1:          26:29          19th century physicians said this is no longer a fashionable term today, but they described cholera as going through two major stages. The first was called the Algebra stage, which was the time of high drama and terror, which had a sudden onset without warning. And this was part of the social tensions that were generated by cholera and other words you could be seized suddenly with this dreadful disease, uh, out in a public place on a tram in a marketplace and the streets itself where you would fall down and start, uh, writhing vomiting and excrete eating rice, water stalls. This was part of the high drama of the disease. And the algae state would last. If you survived normally from eight to 24 hours, it as a patient, you would lose progressively. Your pulse would become fainter, or even almost absent. The body would turn cold and would have a livid appearance. It looked within a few hours, and this was another of the frightening aspects of this disease. Within a few hours, someone who had been healthy that morning by the afternoon looked cadaver rised like a person who had been wasting away from a longterm wasting illness. The breath would turn cold, the hands would look like dishwater hands and very distressing. There would be a very severe cramping, terrible cramps, terrible abdominal pain, nausea, violent vomiting, and the blood itself, uh, and physicians who were trying to treat patients by bloodletting rapidly noticed that the blood itself deprived of its liquid content was transformed into a black tar that refuse to circulate.

Speaker 2:          28:46          Okay?

Speaker 1:          28:46          This could lead to heart failure to a terrible thirst at the patient suffered. And because the blood is no longer providing adequate oxygen, the patient suffers. Has the sense of us fixating a terrible effort to gasping for air?

Speaker 2:          29:10          The,

Speaker 1:          29:12          uh, those are a couple of pictures of contemporary, I said cholera is still with us and so I just wanted to show you a picture of a patient, um, or another child patient today.

Speaker 2:          29:29          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:30          In any case, if the patient survived the Algebra stage, there was then the second stage that 19th fuzzy country physicians called the reaction that might last four or five days. The prognosis isn't really better, but the symptoms are at this time the cold body becomes warmer, there's a fever. Usually the patient suffers terrible headache and is often delirious. The problem is that there were terrible complications that over took patients in the reaction stage. Pneumonia was a frequent complication, so it's kidney failure, uremia, gangrene of the extremities, the ears, the nose, fingers, toes, the penis, and there was a case fatality rate then from Asiatic cholera in the 19th century of something like 50%. Today, as we said last time, uh, there is an effective oral rehydration therapy and the death rate with treatment is less than 2% today. That's partly because of the effectiveness of the treatment and partly because the El tour bio-type is less virulent than classic Vibrio cholerae of the first six pandemics.

Speaker 1:          31:00          In any case then, what were the effects on a community, on a society of an invasion of a disease of this type? Was this the return of the plague? As people speculated, this disease seemed a little bit to resemble that in terms of the terror that it inspired and the social chaos it caused during an outbreak. Now an outbreak, let's imagine a 19th century city, you can pick your own, let it be London or Paris or perhaps Naples. The outbreak would tend to begin with what 19th century medical community termed sporadic cholera. Why that way mount a small trickle of cases. These would be transmitted in a neighborhood, a family, a house. The transmission might be by contaminated clothing or bed linen, contaminated food, hand to mouth transmission from tending a patient and then not washing the hands. Let me give you an example of from Venice in 1885 there, there was a particularly persistent outbreak and a single street before the disease became an epidemic in the city as a whole.

Speaker 1:          32:30          And what happened was that this was traced to a single restaurant and the proprietor terror was a lovely lady who happened to be tending to her own infant child who was sick with cholera and an upstairs bedroom. She would go upstairs and tend to him and then she would go back downstairs without washing her hands and prepare food for her clientele. And that was how the disease was spread in a single street for some time. Now in fortunate instances, the disease, these outbreak, this so called sporadic cholera will just fade away and the community would escape a large scale misfortune. But if the VIP Rio gained access to the city's water supply, then the disease would flare up with epidemic force. And this would be what the 19th century health authorities called epidemic cholera instead of sporadic. And if you made a graph of cases and deaths, there'd be a sudden spike in mortality and morbidity.

Speaker 1:          33:45          Well, what would be the likely magnitude of the disaster that would follow if, let us say a major European city had its water supply contaminated with cholera? Well, the order of magnitude would be different from that of the plague. Cholera was never responsible for the kind of demographic catastrophe that Europe experienced with the black death or later invasions of bubonic plague and the 19th century Europe experience. A major population growth and cholera had little impact on the population surge. Let's take again the example with Naples, a city famous for its overcrowding. It's filled and it's recurring epidemics of Asiatic cholera. Let's compare it also with an earlier experience of bubonic plague. Naples experienced a terrible epidemic of plague and 1656 at that time, the city had about a population of numbering, perhaps half a million people. The state wasn't very good at knowing exactly how many people lived in the city and its statistics for mortality or also to be taken with a grain of salt, but there were estimates that as many as 300,000 people died of Boob onic plague and that single year, let's compare that with cholera.

Speaker 1:          35:22          In 1837 I chose 1837 because that was the worst epidemic of cholera that Naples experienced. The population at that time was still round about half a million people, but in this worst year of Asiatic Cholera, about 12,000 people perished. Now, I don't after our experience of boob plague, I don't want that to be a basis for, uh, insensitivity. This an epidemic in which 12,000 people die is a major disaster, but it didn't have the same long term cultural, philosophical and religious impact, uh, that the plague earlier had. And it didn't seem to convince people that the end of the world had possibly arrived. So color compared with plague is less virulent. The bodily defenses of healthy adults are often effective and it doesn't have those efficient vectors, routes, and fleas that enabled the plague to reach every home. Also, unlike the plague, cholera didn't endure for five centuries returning every generation. Cholera first invaded Europe in the 1830s and by the 1860s the history of cholera in the industrially advanced nations of northern Europe was largely over and for western Europe as a whole.

Speaker 1:          37:00          The 1890s mostly mark the end and 1911 certainly did. So cholera had only six pandemic waves that ever invaded Europe, and each wave was less widespread and claimed fewer victims than the ones proceeding it. That's a very different history than the history of Boob OnDeck plague. Well, how long would an epidemic last? It would normally lasts in a great European city for the length of the warm summer, and perhaps the early fall, it would then recede and fade away with the new onset of cool weather. Now, why would it fade away? We're Robert Koch who discovered the Vibrio cholerae set himself that this was something, a question to which he couldn't give a satisfactory answer. He said that this was one of the great cholera mysteries as he called up. But we can speculate with regard to certain factors that seem important. One would be a change in weather.

Speaker 1:          38:14          Cold Dry weather is hard on the delicate vibrio cholerae so like plague and cholera to in Europe had a very pronounced seasonality. It struck during the warm months. Another factor is an after the disease had struck those people who are most at risk because of their occupations and their personal susceptibility and their living conditions. The epidemic was then like a fire that ran short of fuel. It ran short of people who are most susceptible and at high risk and then communities also, and this was probably important adopted measures of self defense and those to help to cut short the outbreak, especially later in the century when the disease was better understood. It's now I'm known to that the cholera can survive in a spore form in algae blooms off shore of the great port cities and so there is a possibility too that the disease was re-import it'd from the waters off shore. In any case, what were the reactions to cholera in a community here or there was an analogy possibly with Plagge and that cholera to generated terror and fear. This is partly because of the agonizing nature of the symptoms. Of this disease. And the fact too was that the symptoms of cholera suggested were analogous to something that people were already familiar with and that is poisoning the symptoms of cholera, had symptoms that resembled a, someone who had taken strict [inaudible] for example, rat poisoning. And so people were suspicious that perhaps this might be a crime rather than a natural event. Let me show you some images that convey the sense of terror that people felt at the time.

Speaker 1:          40:43          Uh, this is, uh, king cholera. We've said that's one of, it's the terms that it was associated with. And you can see king cholera astride the globe. Uh, and this was clearly a sense of it's [inaudible] or we can look at, uh, this is New York City with cholera approaching. And again, you can see, uh, the kind of terror that was associated with it. Or let's look as well, and you can see cholera, a striding over the defensive bulwarks. Uh, those are the kinds of, this is clearly an Earl, one of the early pandemics. And what you can see is the attempt to control this disease with the plague measures. You can see the troops, sanitary coordinates and all the rest trying to keep out the monster as it was called. But those in fact turned out for reasons we'll be coming to, to be entirely ineffective in dealing with cholera. Unlike the plug or a, we can see and hear the analogy when people's minds that this might be the return of the plague. It's clear because here we can see the grim reaper with his side mowing down the whole population. Or, uh, we can see once again in the 19th century a revival here. This is the danse macabre with death calling people. Um,

Speaker 2:          42:18          yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:19          Uh, and there you can see again the dance macabre. Here's the invitation of death to come downs.

Speaker 2:          42:28          MMM.

Speaker 1:          42:29          So those are switch of graphic illustrations of the kind of fear that this disease caused. Well, it also caused a scapegoating. So imagine for example, let's go back to the first,

Speaker 2:          42:46          okay.

Speaker 1:          42:47          Uh, arrival of cholera in the 1830s and 1830, let's think of the Russian empire.

Speaker 2:          42:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:55          When cholera struck Saint Petersburg in 1830 at that time, Russia was at war with Poland and Russians believed at the time that the disease was an act of terror by Polish agents. So caller gave rise to men hunts or witch hunts find it. The search for scapegoats, foreigners, gypsies, someone newly arriving in town could be suspicious and therefore could be set upon and attacked as a scapegoat. Colorado also led because of its fear to mass flight and some cities experienced almost biblical exoduses with tens of thousands of people evacuating cities and fear for their lives and justice and Defoe's account. It was the wealthier classes you could afford the journey and at some work to go had who went first. A consequence would be that the administration and public services in the city that was being evacuated more in chaos, businesses shut down. There was mass unemployment, there was hunger and shortages of all kinds.

Speaker 1:          44:09          There was also a new strain on class relationships. Cholera was a class disease, I would argue, and then it caused a sharply unequal burden of death and suffering. Unlike Plagge, unlike smallpox polar, my mirror only shows the poor. Now, there are reasons in terms of risk factors that explain that difference. There was normally by this time a pattern of housing segregation that is to say poor, the poor and the wealthy didn't live in uh, next to one another. And the poor suffered from overcrowding, filth, poor diet, lack of light, and the wells they drank from. We're not the same as those used by the wealthy.

Speaker 1:          45:00          A good example of this difference in one that cause a sinister speculations in time of plague. As you know, those who tended the plague, victims, physicians and priests parish in unimaginable proportions during the time of cholera, however, doctors and priests moved among the most sported slumps and yet mysteriously they manage to stay healthy for the most part, while those around them fell ill and died there good epidemiological reasons for this. Doctors didn't eat and sleep and the sick rooms as the poor did. They had better diets. They wash their hands, they drink different water, but to the urban poor, the immunity of the wealthier of classes was highly suspicious. It suggested to some the idea of poisoning, particularly since the poor in the 19th century warrant medicalized. That is to say they had little contact and experience with medical attention. And so on effect, uh, during the cholera years was often violence.

Speaker 1:          46:16          There were assaults on doctors and some places crowds invaded hospitals and lots of directors and the suspicions weren't all in one direction. The wealthy at this time in the 19th century had a fear of those. They called the dangerous classes and they were thinking of the dangerous classes as dangerous politically. This was the rebellious century, dangerous morally and in religious terms, but also they now seem to be dangerous medically. And I think this is a factor in some of the, uh, extreme violence that one sees in 1848, for example, or in the Paris commune, there was a strain on social relationships. Well, what happened in terms of public policy and organized effects? Well, the first thing that happened, uh, was a tendency to revive the plague. Measures to contain it. Collar put unprecedented pressure on authorities to do something, to take some sort of effective action. And it was that the states responded first off, Russia, Austria, pressure for example, by reviving the plague regulations, Len based and maritime quarantine, sanitary cordons lots Sorentos.

Speaker 1:          47:43          One can see this and pictures. This is a cholera Lazzarato or one can see a here is a cholera, the Vibrio are arriving and you can see that the board of health is trying to stop it and there are sanitary coordinates and all the rest. This is a depiction of the early outbreak or the attempt you, this is familiar to you from time of plague to purify the atmosphere by burning sulfur and with fire. These were, or there were funeral regulations and you can see here again the people bring out your dead and transporting uh, the victims to the cemetery for rapid, hasty burial. The funeral regulations, the results, then we're to maximize terror, economic disruption and flight. The plague regulations against cholera caused political effects, but they were counterproductive in terms of the disease, but they taught a dangerous lesson that outsiders could be dangerous.

Speaker 1:          48:47          And so, uh, we see then they don't stop the cholera. They don't stop the cholera because they're asymptomatic carriers. Because the flight of population causes trying to escape the plague measures disperses the disease because cholera can flow and rivers and waterways past the troops who are trying to contain it. So the plague measures weren't effective against cholera, but I'm going to argue there what were the longterm effects, and I'm running rapidly out of time, but just saying that there were, I would argue, not just immediate drama, there were longterm effects. Cholera led to a big debate in the medical profession about contagion, aneurysm, rapid or not. It led to the development of epidemiology as a medical discipline. It contributed to the coming of the germ theory of disease in terms of public health. It led to a new set of measures of sanitary improvements that we'll be talking about next time and even to the refitting and sanitary revolution in cities and even the rebuilding of places like Paris and Naples. Although the color was not the only fact in places like Paris and it caused or mortality revolution in urban cities. We'll be talking more about that. There are reasons then just say that although cholera caused many of the immediate affects of terror like the plague, it didn't lead to the same kind of mortality, and it didn't have the same long term consequences, but it did have a number of longterm consequences that I think it's well to bear in mind. This was the great dreaded disease of the whole, of the 19th century.
