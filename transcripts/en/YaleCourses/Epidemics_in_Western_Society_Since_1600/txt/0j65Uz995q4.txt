Speaker 1:          00:01          Now that we've discussed a smallpox and its impact on the human body, it's symptomatology this morning I want to concentrate instead on the impact, uh, on history and I want to concentrate on three aspects in particular. The first part would be to look at its impact in Europe. The second and much more dramatic story is the impact that you're reading about in Elizabeth Fenn, which is what happened with smallpox in the new world and also in Australia and New Zealand. The third task for the morning is to come to the a very different story, which is smallpox and the development of a public health strategy. In this case, the development of the strategy of vaccine. So those are the three topics I like to deal with this morning. And so let's begin with the impact of smallpox in Europe.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Smallpox, uh, has a legend about it. The legend, it goes like this, that it was brought back to Europe from the Middle East by returning crusaders in the 11th and 12th centuries. As you know, the Crusades lasted from 10 95 to 1291. And those are said to be this time of armies in movement and transit, uh, to be the means of transmitting small pox, uh, back to western Europe. There is no reason for us to accept the truth of that legend as accurate. But there is something interesting about it. First, uh, there's some support, uh, which is that Saint Nikkei's who was a crusader of the order of Saint John, he had an unhappy experience in the Middle East. He was captured and beheaded, but, uh, thereafter he became the patron saint of smallpox suffers a cult of St Nikkei's. Uh, he's from rims is, uh, in particular spread across the continent and churches were devoted to him.

Speaker 1:          02:39          And there were representations of this saint in stain glass, windows in effigies and statues like this. This is Saint Nick case at Reims Cathedral of Saint Nick case. And an angel. There isn't any hard evidence that small parks did return with the Crusaders. Um, although we all know that warfare is a time that favors the spread of infectious diseases. And it's probably true that smallpox had already been present in Europe for centuries. But there's something about this date, which is that what it tells us is not when smallpox actually began, but when it first began to attract attention in any case.

Speaker 2:          03:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:34          We know too that smallpox, although it was present in Europe during the Crusades, the conditions at that time led to it's beginning to have a more important impact that reached its high point in the late 17th and then throughout the 18th century.

Speaker 2:          03:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:58          And that had to do with preconditions that enabled it to flourish, preconditions associated with industrial development, the commercialization of agriculture and rapid unplanned urbanization. And this 18th century, smallpox had clearly replaced plague as the greatest and most filled feared killer of its time.

Speaker 1:          04:32          No. And its history, the fact that a sufferer, and we mentioned this last time, who recovered, possessed a robust lifelong immunity to this disease was important. No one was naturally infected twice with smallpox. So a typical pattern emerged in the cities of Europe. And that was that smallpox became an ever present disease that most people who survived childhood had suffered. The adult population, therefore possessed what we might call an extensive herd immunity to smallpox as a disease. So it became an endemic disease of childhood, but at intervals, perhaps every generation or so, smallpox would erupt as a major epidemic among the general population.

Speaker 2:          05:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:35          A couple of factors came into play to reinforce this pattern. Obviously not every child contracted the disease, and so over time there'd be a slow accumulation of non-immune susceptible adults.

Speaker 2:          05:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Who could fall ill of the, it was also true that European cities in the early modern era where so unhealthy that they sustained or expanded their population, not by growth from within, but by a constant influx of people from without peasants driven off the land, perhaps by hunger or warfare or the search for work, failed harvests, and these newcomers in large numbers to use a contemporary medical jargon or immunologically naive that is, they were susceptible and added to the pool of susceptibles in urban centers. So in every generation, we're so urban centers whose children had already suffered some smallpox as an endemic child to a disease, suffered major epidemics among not only children, but young adults, adolescents, and older people. So smallpox is an example of a disease. And we'll see malaria as another one for which there is no simple distinction between endemic and epidemic.

Speaker 1:          07:17          Smallpox was both endemic year in and year out in Europe, and it was also epidemic sporadically every generation or so. It thrived in crowded urban environments with throngs of people and poorly vented houses and workshops. Now in the 18th century statistics or elusive. But smallpox is commonly thought, and this is just a guesstimate to have caused perhaps a 10th of all deaths in the century in Europe and a third of all deaths among children under 10 years of age. Half the population of the continent is estimated to have been scarred or disfigured by this disease. And smallpox was also the leading cause of blindness across Europe. Perhaps half a million. This is again, only a guesstimate. People died annually from this disease. In other words, it was the equivalent of the largest city in Europe at the time in the 18th century was Naples with half a million people. It was as if a city of that size disappeared from this single disease every year. The 19th century English poet and historian Thomas Babington Macaulay road, this about smallpox, the havoc of plague had been formed more rapid, but the plague has visited our shores only once or twice in living memory. But smallpox was always there filling the church yards with corpses, torn mentoring with constant fear, all limited, not yet stricken and leaving on those whose lives it's spared, the hideous traces of its power, turning the baby into a changeling at which the mother shuttered and making the eyes and cheeks of the patrol maiden objects of horror to her lover.

Speaker 2:          09:38          Okay,

Speaker 1:          09:39          so two of the most famous descriptions of smallpox in the century were those that described it as the speckled monster and the most terrible of all the ministers of death.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Furthermore, like blegh though smallpox was an airborne disease unlike plague, but like influenza, and it was an affliction that was universal and had no predilection for any subset of the population such as the poor. It wasn't really a nonsense, a social disease. Even royal families were scourged, buy small parks. And the 17th and 18th centuries famous sufferers and victims included King Louis, the 14th and Louis, the 15th of Friends, William the second of orange, Peter, the second of Russia, the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph, the first in England, smallpox was even directly responsible for a dynastic change. It extinguished the House of Stuart, the last Stuart heirs to the throne all died of smallpox between the death of Queen Mary in 1694 and the death of 11 year old Prince William also from smallpox in 1700 so this was a clear case in which a disease produced a constitutional crisis and led to the act of settlement of 1701 that prevented another Catholic from being crowned and brought in the house of Hanover.

Speaker 1:          11:28          So small pox had a major impact in western Europe, but it's impact is not as simple repetition of the story of plague. Although it was dreaded. Smallpox did not give rise in Europe to mass hysteria scapegoating and the religious frenzy and their reasons for that can surmise unlike plague. Small pox was not a sudden outside invader that took society by surprise, nor did it maximize its fury by targeting young adults and the middle aged who were the mainstays of families. End of the economy. Smallpox was an endemic disease that was ever present. And so it was considered almost normal, especially because it targeted infants and children as a rule. Although as I've said, it did lead sporadically to broader epidemics. So as a result, everyone had some experience with small polyps and half the people you might meet on the street in a city of western Europe would be pockmarked with as a reminder of its passage so familiar with smallpox, that it bred a kind of fatalism, the belief that it was inevitable in people's lives.

Speaker 1:          13:04          And this attitude was so pervasive that it wasn't uncommon even for parents to expose healthy children intentionally to mild cases and the hope that they could protect them from something much more catastrophic. We could look at this attitude, buy or appreciated by thinking about European literature, particularly British literature, let's say in the 18th century. Let's think for example of Henry fieldings novel, Tom Jones, and not when it was useful to have a change in plot. All the author had to do was to introduce the idea of smallpox because no one would question that that was appropriate or considered that this was a clumsy or artificial advice. Artifice. Everyone expected smallpox, and in fieldings novel Joseph Andrews, we find that there's a heroine who is pockmarked or consider factories. The adventures of Henry Esmond said in the 18th century were smallpox drives the plot. Smallpox quite simply was just there and it came to seem for many people a terrible but everyday part of the human condition.

Speaker 1:          14:30          So smallpox didn't cause great European cities like London to empty of their population. When people took to the road in flight as plague did in the 17th century. And as we shall see that cholera was to do again in the 19th century and there an urge to seek scape goods for what seemed almost natural or normal event. But this is a generalization and there are reports of some who lost their nerve at the approach of smallpox and sought refuge in flight. Let's return to our novel Henry Esmond. There's a heroine lady Castlewood who contract smallpox as an adult in a country village. Her husband, and this was surprising because we were told early on that he was an extraordinarily brave soldier, but he was a man who couldn't bear to face a disease that he couldn't fight and threatened him not only with death, but this seemed to matter perhaps more to him than death itself.

Speaker 1:          15:44          He thought he was extremely handsome and he was afraid that he would be maimed if he survived. So unwilling to put his fair complexion and is even fair hair at risk. Lord Castlewood took to his heels and he deserted his household for the duration, but he wasn't part of a mass exodus. Although factory does have Henry Esmond the hero of the story, uh, tell us himself that smallpox was, in his words, the most dreadful scourge of the world. We also know that as a result of four deal, lady Castlewood lost her beauty and then her gallon husband on his return no longer loved her as he wants did as readers. Then we know that one of the effects with smallpox was that it had a big impact on the marriage market, it disfigured people and made them less likely to succeed in the sweepstakes. We learned that Kelly de Castlewood, according to the author, her beauty was very much injured by the small pox.

Speaker 1:          17:02          When the marks of the disease cleared away, the delicacy of her color and complexion was all gone. Her eyes had lost their brilliancy. Her hair fell and her face looked old. It was as if a course hand to rubbed off the delicate tense of that sweet picture and brought to it a dread color. It also, it must be owned. Her ladies ships nose was greatly swollen and red in any case. As you can imagine, having scars on pockmarks was also a source of great psychological distress and unhappiness. And this too was part of the plot of Thackeray's novel as it unfolds. And part of what we should remember as the impact of smallpox on the terrible 18th century, but that was smallpox in Europe, a major source of anxiety, a major impact on population, uh, source of the cult of the St and e case.

Speaker 1:          18:13          Uh, a major factor in demography, but there's a more dramatic story that we need to come to as we crossed the waters and turns the new world or also Australia and New Zealand. This is the story of what happened when the disease was suddenly introduced to populations and part of the world where it was a new invader. Work arrived from outside, had never been an endemic infection and therefore against which the native or aboriginal population had no immunity at all, then it produced real catastrophes. Events describe as virgin soil epidemics. These were catastrophes that accompanied European expansion to the new world, Australia, New Zealand, and they're smallpox and another child to disease that accompanied it. Measles had a transformative importance in clearing the lend and promoting settlement by Europeans with their robust immunity. The impact of smallpox and measles. Measles was greater than that of gunpowder in the new world.

Speaker 1:          19:42          You'll be reading about this in detail in that wonderful book by Elizabeth Fenn, Pox Americana, and you might want to be reminded of the simple fact that the author was actually a Yalie and that the book that you're reading began life here as a phd dissertation. In any case though, I want to have the division of labor between the lectures and the reading and so I won't repeat the story that phen tells, so movingly and so well, but there were a few points that I would like to highlight as specific examples and a couple of general points. And first the general idea we should remember is not of something sometimes referred to as the Colombian exchange. That is to say that the European and counter with the new world brought about the large scale exchange from one side of the Atlantic to the other and in the reverse direction of fauna and flora.

Speaker 1:          20:55          Certainly as you know, Europeans brought back the potato maze and Quinine for as examples from the Americas and there's been a debate as to whether this also involved in microbial component and there are those who speculate that Columbus and his sailors brought back the disease syphilis as well from the new world. We'll be returning to that argument later in the semester when we come to talk about syphilis as a disease. What's beyond out though is that there was also a terrible movement of microbes in the other direction as Europeans unintentionally introduced smallpox and measles to the Americas. Let's illustrate with a specific example of the Colombian exchange. The exchange phen tells us about by looking at this much travailed island of Hispaniola, the mountainous Caribbean island where Columbus landed in the 1490s he spun Yola. That is what is modern Haiti and the Dominican Republic. And as we know from today's news, Haiti has a long history of natural and manmade catastrophes.

Speaker 1:          22:26          And the arrival of Columbus was certainly one the aboriginal inhabitants, a tribe known as the hour wax, our estimated or guesstimated to have numbered something like a million people in 1492 Columbus described Hispaniola as almost an earthly paradise, a place of great natural beauty. And you reported that the Roi box, we're a welcoming and non war like people who greeted the Spanish warmly and showed them great kindness. But unfortunately for them the kindness wasn't reciprocal. The Spaniards were interested in profit and international power politics and he spun Yolo was strategically located. It also possessed fertile soil, a favorable climate and land at the Spanish crown, coveted for cultivation. So European interest was based on commerce, profit and international power considerations. The Spaniards militarily dispossessed the wraps of their lend and intended to reduce them to slavery first in minds and then on the land. They were assisted in the process up to a point by two great assets, gunpowder and disease.

Speaker 2:          24:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:03          And as you know from hating fen, the aboriginal population of the Americas lacked immunity to European diseases like smallpox and measles.

Speaker 2:          24:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:16          There's no evidence that there was a plot of genocide or bio terror in the intentional use of disease as a means to clear the land and resettled. What happened was spontaneous and not intentional, but the encounter between Europeans and the indigenous peoples of Hispaniola resulted in an extraordinary and terrifying die off between 1492 and 1520 the native population was reduced from a million people to 15,000 disease thoroughly cleared. He Spun Yola for European colonization virtually without resistance.

Speaker 1:          25:03          On the other hand, small pumps forded the Spanish intention and Hispaniola to enslave the aboriginals. They simply died off at two extraordinary, you're raped at therefore led the Spaniards out of necessity to turn to a different source of labor for Mines and plantations. And since Africans and Europeans shared disease reservoirs that were partially overlapping, there are people resistant to many of the sane epidemic diseases that had destroyed the native Americans. So disease was a major factor in the establishment of the African slave trade and the development of new world slavery. The Spaniards hardly delayed 1517 mark, the beginning of the importation of African slaves to Hispaniola son Domingo by 1789 received into which supports every year some 1,600 ships employing 24,000 shalers and it accounted for 11 million pounds of the French total of 17 million pounds of EPC sports. It's trade was the foundation of the wealth of port cities.

Speaker 1:          26:27          Like not we're doe and more say it's cotton. A basis for the French textile mills and Norman date. And the growth was exponential between 1783 in 1789 production doubled. And with it, the importation of slaves, 10,000 a year in 1764 15,017 71 27,017 86 40,017 87 the leading port of Sun Domingo, the prosperous city of look, Cop Fall Swat had 20,000 people and was called the Paris of the West. So the Colombian exchange played a major role in the history of Hispaniola and that was written large in the new world as a whole. A similar story could be told about Aaron Non Cortez and his fellow conquistador Francisco Pizarro with regard to the Aztec Empire of Mexico and the Incan Empire of Peru, which were destroyed not only by gunpowder but also by smallpox. That destroyed agriculture, lead to famine, destroyed the aboriginal military capacity to resist and had were told a tremendous psychological impact because they're gods seemed not to protect them and so there was a wave of conversion to the European God who seemed to protect his own people.

Speaker 1:          28:16          Now you also know from reasoning Elizabeth Fenn that although this process was primarily unintentional, there were moments within it, within the larger catastrophe of occasional act of intentional genocide and one was by a Lord Jeffrey Amherst, whom we're portraying here, who intentionally gave native Americans infected blankets. I thought I perhaps tell you a little anecdote that I won't vouch for historically. I know of it from a oral history, from friends I had at the time who attended Amherst college and told me about a demonstration that I think took place in 1968 but that was that the plates you've just seen, Lord Jeffrey, who actually, uh, intentionally aimed at the die off of aboriginal populations and intentionally gave native Americans, uh, blankets infected with smallpox scabs. Well, the plates at Amherst College at in the 1960s look like this and they show a surge. Jeffery scourging Indian population with a whip on horseback.

Speaker 1:          29:45          And so in 1968, uh, learning about the experience of genocide, uh, there was a demonstration when the students of Amherst college stood up and smashed all the plates and the dining hall. Um, in any case, that was also the case that this sort of tremendous dial off that fat affected the Americas, cleared the land for European settlement was repeated. Again, not intentionally, but with regard in Australia to the aboriginals and in New Zealand with regards to the mayoress. But you have that story told vividly on, on a large canvas by Elizabeth fans, pox Americana. So I'll leave you to read about that and I'd like to turn now to our third point of the morning, which was the development, the importance of smallpox for an entirely different reason. And that is the development of a new and major public health strategy. The strategy of inoculation initially, and that becomes more definitively the strategy of vaccination.

Speaker 2:          30:59          Okay,

Speaker 1:          30:59          well let's begin with inoculation. Oh, what is inoculation? It was an empirical practice, we might call it a folk art and it was developed in various parts of the world as a result of two very simple observations.

Speaker 2:          31:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:22          The first was that small pox was clearly contagious. The second was that those who had recovered from the disease and it was easy to know who had suffered from it because there were scarred and pockmarked or also there were often blind. And it was a simple observation that they never caught smallpox a second time.

Speaker 2:          31:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:51          So the idea developed that it might be a wise measure to induce a mild case of small pox artificially to protect a person or especially a child from the risk of acquiring a naturally occurring but severe and life threatening or maiming case.

Speaker 2:          32:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:14          And the practice that resulted was called variously inoculation, very elation or in a gardening metaphor and grafting. There were variations, but then major technique was it liquid material from a small pox postural. You saw those last time.

Speaker 2:          32:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:35          Of a patient selected for having a very mild was allowed to soak into a thread. The thread was then inserted into a superficial cup made with the Lancet, this sharp instrument that you've seen pictures of and an earlier lecture into the arm of the person to be protected and fastened there for 24 hours. 12 days later, the subject usually fell ill with small punks, hopefully suffered from a mild case for about a month. Convalesced for a further month and then remained immune for a lifetime. Hopefully not park mark marked or blinded. Now. This practice of inoculation was common in places like Turkey in the 18th century but not in western Europe. A major role in bringing this practice to Britain and western Europe was played by this lady, the wife of the British ambassador to Turkey, Lord and Lady Mary Montagu who lived from 1689 to 1762 and she was preoccupied with small parks in part because your own beauty had been compromised by a severe attack of the disease and she elected to protect her own children by having them inoculated by the practice I've just described.

Speaker 1:          34:18          While they were in Constantinople, she returned to England in 1721 and launched a one person or one lady mission to convince society to introduce the practice of inoculation. She devoted herself to propagandizing British society in the practice. She was able to convince the Princess of Wales who had her daughter's inoculated and the practice spread rapidly. Now, this was the first major public health advance in dealing with small punks, and as I tried to suggest last time, I would argue that it had a role note that I'm saying only a role, not the role as part of the background for the coming of the enlightenment. Indeed leading fuel of sof became ardent advocates of inoculation people in France like Voltaire and Charles Dilla Condamine or on this side of the water. People in light also describe as Philo's off like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Inoculation appropriately gain most favor in England, the epicenter perhaps of smallpox in Europe, but it gradually spread also to France, Holland, Germany, Sweden in Russia, the procedure was introduced by Catherine the great who imported an English physician to inoculate her in 1768 after which the nobility rapidly adopted the practice.

Speaker 1:          36:10          The cresting wave then of the smallpox epidemic in the 18th century in Europe was met by the first practical measure of public health against it. Well, why did inoculation work? At least to the extent that it did, and I would say that inoculation was a partial success. Biological processes were at work that are still poorly understood, but there are a couple of relevant factors that we could note. One was not as a matter of practice, this procedure took infected material only from very mild cases. That was this selection then of cases was one reason behind it. Success, the infective matter also was made to enter the body through the skin in a way that doesn't happen in nature and for reasons that aren't understood attenuates the variance of the virus. So the portal of entry into the body also seems to have made a difference.

Speaker 1:          37:28          And lastly, for all at one knows, those who were inoculated were also selected and you were only chosen for inoculation if you are healthy and robust. There were, however, problems. Inoculation was also a partially flawed procedure. All too often, despite all precautions, it failed to produce the desired mild infection, but led and said to severe illness and death, and invariably it caused a month or two of immense suffering. It was also costly since physicians insisted on a lengthy period of preparation when they were performing the procedure, wanting to ensure that those they inoculated, we're an excellent health. They selected patients carefully and then isolated them for a month before the procedure during which they regulated their diet, their fresh air there exercise, and this was obviously an expensive process, so inoculation was simply not accessible to the poor. Another factor was that inoculation could run the risk because it introduced actual smallpox cases and therefore it ran the risk of setting off an epidemic unintentionally that those who contracted the disease would then spread it to others around them.

Speaker 1:          39:12          And to prevent that smallpox inoculation hospitals such as one in London that opened in 1746 we're set up to care for the patients who had been inoculated and to quarantine them so that they were no longer a risk to others. But nevertheless, there was a spirit to debate over the whole issue of rather on balance and knock. Culation saved many more lives than it killed. Well, that brings us to this figure, a decisive figure in the history of medicine and public health. And that is Edward Jenner. It was in the context of this small pox catastrophe of the 18th century and of disappointments and anxieties surrounding inoculation that we see a decisive discovery in the history of medicine and public health associated with this English country doctor. To understand what happened, we need to remember what we said last time. And that is that there were three species of the genus of worth of pox viruses, Vario, Olin Major, Vario, alon minor, and cow pox.

Speaker 1:          40:34          The first two are exclusively infectious to human beings, but the third mainly affects council. But the point is that under the right conditions, cow pox can be transmitted to humans among whom it induces a mild illness. But it provides, and this was the crucial point, a robust crossover immunity to vary all a major now in Britain that people thought most likely to contract cow pox. We're Noke mates and Jenner, and this is why I stress that he was a country doctor. Uh, this is his home in Barkley in Gloucester shirt. I'm in the west of England. He made an observation that could only have been made by a doctor with a rural practice in a dairy county at a time of prevalence of smallpox. And this observation was that milkmaids never seem to come down with a small pumps, gender like others. She wasn't the first to make this observation, but he took it to heart and attempted the next step of an experimentation. A crucial experiment occurred in 1796. The milkmaid, Sarah Nelms contracted cow pox. And this is me. Uh, we'll see the experiment. Edward Jenner, um, chuck the infective material from Sarah Nelms.

Speaker 2:          42:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:18          And vaccinated. The eight year old son of his gardener on his property in 1796 and then after a period of time, had a challenge in vacuum and vaccination with live smallpox virus.

Speaker 2:          42:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:44          And hopefully the experiment was a great success. And Edward Phipps demonstrated that he was immune by this procedure to small pox. And so soon thereafter, Edward Jenner, a whatever one thinks by modern terms of the medical ethics of that particular experiment. In 1798 Edward Jenner wrote one of the most influential pieces, works in the history of medicine inquiry into the causes and effects of the Vario low voc scene. I, his genius was not just to devise the experiment that was scientifically flawed, perhaps in the sense that he extrapolated from a very small vape database, but in any case, the point is that he recognized the significance of what he discovered. He thought that he saw immediately the possibility of eradicating smallpox from the planet, an idea who is important. The British parliament recognized soon afterwards when it declared vaccination. The greatest discovery I'm quoting in the history of medicine general wrote in 1801 that he longed for the annihilation of the smallpox, the most dreadful scourge of the human race.

Speaker 1:          44:17          That must be the final result of this practice. So gender had the genius to see the full implication of his discovery and then he devoted the remainder of his life, single mindedly to the cause of promoting this revolutionary method, not only in Britain, but also globally was also the first example of a new and highly effective style of public health by vaccination. A method that's proved its effectiveness certainly with regard to smallpox, but you could also mention polio, tetanus, rabies, influenza, diptheria, shingles and a host of other diseases and gender soon made influential converts who establish vaccination as a major instrument of public health. Napoleon in France, Pope Pius the seventh in Rome, Benjamin Waterhouse and Thomas Jefferson on these shores. Generous method then was a means to combat smallpox and unlike inoculation vaccination didn't introduce an infection of smallpox itself and therefore had no risk of setting off an unintended epidemic.

Speaker 1:          45:38          It also had a low risk of serious complications for the individual patient and no risk at all for the community. But there were problems with generous method and it was to require a series of subsequent improvements to make vaccination of fully successful procedure. The problems involves such things as he required at the time and arm to arm method and this entailed the risk of spreading other diseases in particular syphilis while trying to present small pumps. There were also failed vaccinations that led to complications and gender made an a crucial mistake. He made it an article of dogmatic faith that the community derive from smallpox vaccination artificially was lifelong, just like the natural immunity that was acquired and he steadfastly refused to consider evidence that ran counter to his dog ma and fact artificial immunity wears off. It's now known after a period that's not quite understood, but 10 1520 years and requires to still be valid revaccinated option.

Speaker 1:          47:01          This blindness on generous part discredit vatted vaccination in some quarters and was one factor. These various limitations. Then for one of the most powerful mass movements of the 19th century and one that's still with us today and that is the anti vaccination movement. Vaccination became one of the contested debates of 19th medicine in Britain and anti vaccination league was founded and became a major political influence. There were various sources of opposition. There was the appear call observation of failure, as I've said, when people who had been vaccinated actually contracted smallpox, there was the opposition of liberals and Libertarians to what they regarded as the excessive power of the state and making vaccination compulsory. And there was religious opposition. People will consider it an an active in piety to introduce material from animals into a human body. And there were sardonic posters featuring people undergoing vaccination while they sprouted horns or turned into counts.

Speaker 1:          48:21          But despite vaccination, there was in Britain an act of 1840 that provided for free infant vaccination. And from that time, the annual tall from smallpox began to plummet despite the fact that the 19th century provided conditions that were, would have been favorable to promoting the disease, improved and speedy transport with steam ships, canals and the railroad crowding with a population that was ever more immobile, massive growth and urbanization and large cities. And those, uh, changes and advances were reproduced across Europe and North America. And there were technological improvements as well. All of which leads me to, uh, the end of this morning, which was to saying in 1959, the World Health Organization undertook the unprecedented step of launching a global smallpox eradication program by means of vaccination. In 1977, the final natural case occurred, and in 1980, smallpox was declared by the WHL eradicated everywhere on the globe. So vaccination then comes with this extraordinary history of public health, of combating a major disease like smallpox, and actually eradicating it. And what we'll want to do as we move through the course is to ask, what are the conditions that make vaccination and appropriate tool for public health? When is it not appropriate? Why are there such difficulties with poliomyelitis as we're speaking today with smallpox, the beginning of a wave of diseases to be eradicated this way, one by one, or was smallpox a an exception, a special case? We'll stay tuned and we'll deal with that.
