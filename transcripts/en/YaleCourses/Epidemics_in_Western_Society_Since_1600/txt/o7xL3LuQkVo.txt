Speaker 1:          00:02          Well, our topic this morning is influenza a, which is timely for today, and I'd like to begin by talking about influence of virus more in general, and we'll concentrate our attention for obvious reasons. On the gray, the Spanish lady, the great influenza of 1918 1919 no influence of virus was isolated in the 1930s by Andrews Wilson and Lud Law and the mechanisms of the disease where then unraveled. Subsequently. As you know, there are three types, a, B, and c, and it's a virus. That's the cause of pandemics among human beings. I was terms of the structure of the virus. As you know, it's RNA wrapped in a protein envelope with protein spikes on the surface. You can see them. Um, and the spikes are of two major types, Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. The hemagglutinin enables the virus to attach itself to a host cell in this case, in the respiratory tract, and it's neuraminidase that enables the fusion of the virus with cells so that the viral RNA can be released into the cell cytoplasm and then migrate to the cell nucleus.

Speaker 1:          01:44          The human gluten and in your amended days have various strains that have been numbered and you have on your handout, um, those that have been identified for the 19th, 20th and 21st century and everyone knows now a h one n one the swine virus that's currently with us and I'm sorry on the handout that I've got 2010, I might to have 2009 to 2011. So if you could make that correction, that would make me feel happy. Uh, the viral RNA then hijacks the cell and transforms it into a viral factory for the reproduction of virus and it eventually destroys the cell itself. This process of reproductions, extraordinarily efficient and nearly instantaneous so that the idea of measuring generations of viruses begins to lose all meaning. We also need to point out about, uh, influence influenza virus that the RNA combines in all sorts of ways making a genetic characteristic of extreme instability or should we say mutability the processes involved that you can study up on science hill and more detail involved things called Antigen drift, antigen shift, mutation, hybridization giving rise to subtypes, strains, and variants.

Speaker 1:          03:26          All of these changes are part of the success story of influenza as a disease, and there is no crossover immunity from one strain to another acquired immunity. That is his strength specific. Well, mutability also explains an epidemiological feature of influenza, and that is that pandemics tend to arrive in waves, each being biologically different with different symptoms and different virulence. And we'll see that the great pandemic after World War One had four major waves. Well, influenza tends to have be reflective of the relationships also of human beings and animals, birds, horses and pigs and not theirs. Interspecies transfer from animals to humans and from humans. And the reverse direction, and this may be the route by which human beings first contracted the disease, and it's known that this, the animal reservoir is a source of new strains. The hypothesis recently has been that there's a reservoir in Asia, perhaps in China or Asiatic Russia, but interestingly, it's not very hypothesis that misled public health responses.

Speaker 1:          05:04          When the swine flu pandemic first got underway and that surveillance was active in the far east, but the disease arrived in stead in Mexico. Well, what's the history of human beings and influencer? The origins simply aren't known. The earliest clear evidence in of a literary kind is in the 15th and 16th centuries, but records are fragmentary and unreliable. So the best we can do is to look at the last few centuries, the 18th 19th 20th and the first years of our own century. In the 18th century, there were major pandemics, 1729 to 30 32 to 33 61 to 62 and then especially 1781 to 1782 and then 1788 to 1789 and the 19th century there were pandemics. 1830 to 31 33 50 to 51 and then the great pandemic of 1889 to 1819 and in the 20th century we've had a number of pandemics, the greatest sping 1918 to 20 the Spanish flu as it was called.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Now, the reason I was reading out the rather grim years of influenza pandemics was to point out first, of course, that they're recurrent and are still with us as you know. But also to note that there seem to be something of a powder and of more or less one major pandemic and every century, well, influenza is a viral infection transmitted person to person and airborne disease, much more contagious than say SARS that we remember from just a few years ago. SARS requires prolonged face to face contact but not influenza. So a notable feature then of the flu is it's rapid communicability. It also has a short incubation period, just 24 to 72 hours. So all of that implies also that epidemiologically it's different from a number of the infectious diseases we've studied. As I said in the email that I sent to you about social diseases, it's really a spectrum, not an absolute when we talk about being a social disease or not. And I would submit to you that influenza is out the far end of that spectrum in not really being a classic social disease. It's not very sensitive to economic conditions, sanitation and diet.

Speaker 1:          08:16          Those features that were hallmarks of malaria say or tuberculosis. It's diffusion occurs wherever human beings move in numbers and breathe. It follows networks of communication where roads, steam ships, airplanes in our time and ports and railroad hub cities or uh, eh. Now we would say airport centers tend to be photo sigh of infection and we're first attacked with lightening speed. So flu was favored by the transportation technology of the industrial revolution and since and once again by urbanization and of course population growth and overcrowding. Let's look at a precursor to the great pandemic of the first World War. And this is the horrible pandemic of the 19th century of eight nine 1889 to 1890. This was the first truly global pandemic of influenza and the most devastating one in history until that time it affected every continent. The reasons without the world was prepared now for pandemic influenza as a result of the transportation revolution, the railroad on the steamship, urbanization and trade, demographic growth and colonialism, vulnerability to influence or then seems to be in part a byproduct of modernization as we've been reminded by recent events studies of 1889 to 1890 demonstrate this in more detail in cities like Moscow, Paris, or London.

Speaker 1:          10:18          The first case is occurred in October to November of 1889 and these tended not to be noticed. There was nothing particular about them that people noted at the time, but they occurred among very particular sectors of the population that we're most involved in trade commerce and the nodes of communication. That is the first people to fall ill tend to to be dockers or post office workers, railway men, policemen. Furthermore, the lesson dust realize the locality, the more remote and agricultural, it was the later, unless severely the locality suffered in 1889 to 1890 the Alps in Europe, Italy, Spain, and Portugal all lagged behind northern Europe and the United States. And even in the great urban centers there were isolated small communities that sometimes survive entirely unscathed. Monasteries and convents for example, in both Moscow and Paris went experienced the pandemic without victims in some cases, and this was sometimes true also of closed institutions like prisons.

Speaker 1:          11:48          Then typically after following the transportation network, and this was true of 1889 to 90 the flu spread along what's called the urban hierarchy. That is, it went first to major cities and from there into the hinterland of those cities and only later to smaller towns, villages and rural areas, and 1918 to 19 in the United States shows this same pattern that is the flu went almost instantaneously from Boston and New York to Cincinnati, Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit, San Francisco, Seattle, and then at greater leisure. It moved into almost every place in between until there was hardly a settlement of any size that had been entirely spared. And whenever it went rich and poor, educated and illiterate men and women, the physically fit and the unfit were similarly infected, but there were circumstances, certain ones that were especially favorable to the disease. A crowded urban environment was clearly one where people were streaming in and out and closely packed Emilio's schools, theaters, barracks, naval ships, tenement buildings, college dormitories, and all the epidemics of influenza except 1918 to 20 there was also a strong predilection of the influenza virus for the infants and the elderly.

Speaker 1:          13:44          They're also tended to be an over representation of people with preexisting respiratory diseases, say tuberculosis or bronchitis or people with immunosuppressive diseases. The great example until the HIV AIDS era was of course, malaria and malarial victims were highly susceptible to influenza, so the tuberculosis and the malarial died massively during influenza pandemics. A typical graph then of the influenza, more tality would show a neat u shaped curve spiked at both ends of the age spectrum of the population, the very young and the elderly. Another common feature of influenza pandemics was pronounced seasonality in the northern hemisphere. Influenza almost invariably peaked in the winter months, November to February, and ended with the coming of warm weather in the spring. The reasons for good epidemiological, uh, explanations have to do partly with human behavior. People tend to congregate indoors in the winter, often in buildings and rooms that are poorly ventilated. The virus itself doesn't survive well in an environment where there's sunlight and high humidity and winter's a time when people tend to sneeze and cough more than at other times.

Speaker 1:          15:32          What are some other features of flu pandemics? One is short duration. This helps to understand societal responses as well. We know that plague and collar attended to lay siege to a locality for months and in the community it felt quite like that, but flu tended to last just a few weeks and then to move on. It was true also that there was a high morbidity that is lots of people would fall ill from influenza, but there was a low case fatality rate. The overall mortality would be large simply because of the large numbers of sufferers. The kill rate was low in the 19th century. Influenza, however, killed far more people than cholera and a stark contrast then, um, could be drawn. Flew seems to be quintessentially a contagious disease. But since you're interested in the debate between, this is one of your favorites, I'm sure, uh, between anti contagion aneurysm and contagion aneurysm, we might point out to you that even, although you think it seems to be self evident that influenza the grip, the flu is contagious, that many of the, in fact the dominant current still and the 1890s was not influenza, was not contagious.

Speaker 1:          17:10          And the eminent British epidemiologists, Charles Creighton still held to anti contagion ism regarding this disease down into the 1890s well, what sorts of things, uh, held Creighton back from accepting influenza as an infectious disease? Well, first he argued the disease would affect the most parts of a country in the same two or three weeks. There simply wasn't time for a contagious disease to a spread without extreme rapidity. He thought he also thought within a smaller radius, it seemed to affect everyone Santa household more or less, I'm Matine Asley everyone would fall ill at once. So it seemed there wasn't time for contagion and it was this simultaneous sudden outbreak of influence that gave it some of its traditional names. It was called the grip, not only in French log go deep, but also in English and the 19th century. It was referred to as grip. And partly that's because it seems suddenly to sees people in its grasp.

Speaker 1:          18:27          Typically, you could be healthy at breakfast, only defined yourself suffering with chills, fever, aching bones and nausea by lunchtime. Similarly bought Moscow seem to physicians to be healthy on the 1st of November, 1889 but by the middle of the month the disease was everywhere. Shops and schools were closed, commerce nearly ground to a halt and this gave, it was part of the reason it got its other name influenza. Um, this was an Italian word, meaning influence and in this case people speculated about the influence of some cosmic factor that would disturb the microcosm as well. Perhaps it was the influence of the stars or the heavens that poisoned or corrupted the atmosphere and lay low whole cities all at once. Well, what about symptoms effects on the individual? I think we can be brief because it's probably very familiar to you from personal experience. That is seasonal influenza. The onset is we've said is normally sudden.

Speaker 1:          19:51          The symptoms then are ones that you know, a high fever, a hundred to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, typically an unproductive cough, aching of muscles in the back, the legs, watery eyes, sometimes nausea and vomiting, general malaise, headache, pain in the joints, sometimes dizziness and a general sense of fatigue and weakness. Typically the acute phase would last three to five days and for a few days more you'd suffer from your cough and from lethargy. And then in the vast number of cases there would be recovery. Well flew for young adults in good health, enjoyed a reputation as a nasty but mercifully short and usually not serious affliction, influenza. And the night, middle of the 19th century that is at least before the cataclysm of 1889 and 1890 was people joked about it, that it was a disease that was so unimportant that the only physicians who gave it much attention were those who simply had too few patients.

Speaker 1:          21:23          And so started treating people with flu as a means of enhancing their income. On the other hand, for infants, for the elderly and those with chronic disease at some sometimes lead to serious and even fatal complications. And it was the complications much more than the flu that tended to kill patients who didn't recover after three or four days, then moved on to serious complications like pneumonia or bronchitis and about once a century, a strain of influenza that was not seasonal, but pandemic appeared. And demonstrated that flu can in fact under certain conditions be one of the most deadly of all diseases. When the what about treatment? Well, today as in the past, there's no specific remedy for influenza as we've been reminded by recent events in the newspapers, the disease is self limiting normally and simply runs its course, so therapy is supportive and symptomatic rest and nursing care more than active medical intervention and the 19th century.

Speaker 1:          22:55          This was also recognized and physicians weren't inclined to try heroic remedies as they did say with Asiatic cholera, but there were certain attempts at therapeutics in the 19th century and even after World War One, people were given aspirin, cinnamon with milk to lower temperature fluids, a nourishment bedrest, quinine was administered to lower the fever. There were worn Babs for hydrotherapy. Oxygen sometimes administered to patients with respiratory complications and some physicians recommended caffeine to raise the flagging animal energy as it was called. Today, the only actual therapeutics is antibiotics, but they don't come back the influence itself, but it's complication of pneumonia. Well against that background. Let's look more closely at the Spanish influenza, the Spanish lady, the Spanish grip as it was called from 1918 to 1920 oh first you probably wonder why the Spanish Association and the reason has actually nothing to do with Spain itself and disease.

Speaker 1:          24:26          It was simply that Spain was not a belligerent and the first world war and therefore was free of censorship of the media. Hence a free press reported the medical crisis there extensively. A popular theory in circulation these days is that perhaps the Spanish lady originated not in Spain at all, but in Kansas. In any event, on the morning of finding the case, zero is a perilous art, but let's say that at least this much as known on the morning of the 11th of March, 1918 at Fort Riley the Cook Albert Getchell reported sick by nearing noon. The camp in from Marie had some 100 cases and these were the earliest known examples of this new influenza. There's some background that helps us comprehend the extraordinary case of 1918 to 1920 as in the past mutations occurred and then this time produced a new strain that turned out to me more virulent than any in influences history.

Speaker 1:          25:52          It's mode of communication was identical to other flu pandemics, but its effects on both the individual and society were radically different. So let's talk about this pandemic as coming in for waves. The first was in the spring of 1918 and was relatively mild in March and April. It soon passed under an attracted little attention. Wartime press. Censorship was partly a factor, but people were simply preoccupied with the war, uh, not with the presence of a mild outbreak of a well known and common disease. The second wave was the of 1918 which was the worldwide disaster. It began in August with simultaneous explosions in places as far apart as Sierra Leon, Boston and this country, breast and France. A common feature being that these were all port cities and had an important role in the movements of troops and supplies. In this case, one could argue that not only the war itself, but also the coming of peace contributed to the spread of the flu armistice day itself produce huge crowds and gatherings, uh, which were not propitious for stopping the spread of the disease.

Speaker 1:          27:36          Then came the spring of 1919, uh, less, much less mercifully less severe wave. And then finally, January, February of 1920 the fourth wave of this Spanish lady, which was mild and limited and it's morbidity even partly of course, because by then so many people were already immune where there are a number of features of this Spanish lady that made her unique. The first was not possessed, an extraordinary mortality and morbidity. Comparing it with normal outbreaks of influenza. It's impossible to generate precise statistics, but there are speculations that this was perhaps in absolute terms, the greatest demographic shock that humanity had ever experienced from infectious diseases. The more people died of influenza than of casualties in the first world war worldwide. Some estimates, the estimates vary widely, so one has to take them with great caution, but they range from 25 million people perishing upwards to the highest estimates or about 100 million in the United States.

Speaker 1:          29:09          It's pretty well known that at least 675,000 people perished more than American casualties and all 20th century wars, 10 times the numbers killed in first world war and a normal, if there is such a thing, influenza outbreak, a case fatality rate might be something like oh 0.1% in the case of the Spanish influenza, the case fatality rate was just above 2.5% and this yielded a vast total bull mortality because indeed as it seemed at the time, almost everyone was infected. Let's look at a slide of the death rates. You can see the influenza, the great wave, and October, November, December of 1918 the black is 1918, uh, rather, sorry, a 1911 as the average, 1911 to 1917 and the gray is 1918. So this compares, uh, influenza then with what we might call normal influenza. You can see the extraordinary near mortality. Another feature of this influenza was the lack of understanding of the disease when it broke out.

Speaker 1:          30:40          Indeed. I'd like to quote Viktor Vaughn who directed public health in the United States army against the Spanish lady and he said, and I'm quoting doctors, no, no more about the flu. Then 14th century Florentines did about the black death and I think it's important to understand this idea of a sense of helplessness facing this medical catastrophe. Some physicians indeed in 1918 termed what they were facing, epidemic pneumonia and then as now there was no effective treatment. The symptoms were distinctive. As you now know from reading Cosby, this influenza was fulminant and post Wharton mortem. Long examinations revealed things that were unlike anything that examining physicians had seen before. Enormous quantities of bloody fluid, like a froth filling the lungs. Some physicians on their first encounter suspected that this was a kind of pneumonic plague right here in new haven and the new haven hospital pathologists wrote the devastation caused to the lungs more than anything else resembled the effects of poisonous gases used in world war one like phosgene or chlorine, whether comparisons that came to their mind.

Speaker 1:          32:27          Furthermore, although other organs of the body could be effected the spleen, for example, the impact of the Spanish lady on the lungs was so overwhelming that not alone was often the cause of death and pulmonary effects. We're almost the only ones that people noticed. Let me read a passage from Katherine Anne Porter, the famous writer, Pale Horse, Pale rider, um, where she was herself a victim of the influencer. And she writes here in the third person, but she's describing her own symptoms and I think it's worth noting how she felt silenced. Miranda's sank easily through deep sip on deeps of darkness until she lay like a stone at the farthest bottom of life knowing herself to be blind, deaf, speechless. No longer aware of the members of her own body, entirely withdrawn from all human concerns, yet alive with the peculiar lucidity and coherence, all notions of the mind, the reasonable inquiries of doubt, all ties of blood and desires of the heart dissolved and fell away from her and there remained only a minute, fiercely burning particle of being that new itself alone that relied upon nothing beyond itself for its strength, not susceptible to any appeal or inducement being itself composed entirely of one single motive.

Speaker 1:          34:14          The stubborn will to live this fiery, motionless particle set itself unaided to resist destruction, to survive and to be in its own madness of being motiveless and plan lists. Beyond that one essential end, she felt without warning a vague tremor of apprehension, some small flick of distrust and her joy, a thin frost touch the edges of this confident tranquility. Something somebody was missing, she'd lost something she had left, something valuable than another country. What could it be? There are no trees, no trees here. She said in fright, I've left something unfinished. A thought struggled at the back of her mind came clearly as a voice in your ear where the dead, we've forgotten the dead, the dead. Where are they at? Once as if a curtain had fallen, the bright landscape faded. She was alone in a strange stony place of bitter cold, picking her way along the steep path of slippery snow.

Speaker 1:          35:23          Calling out, oh, I must go back, but in what direction? Pain returned. A terrible, compelling pain running through our veins like heavy fire, the stench of corruption filled her nostrils, the Swedish sickening smell of rotting flesh and pos. She opened her eyes and saw appeal light through course, white cloth over her face and she knew that the smell of death was in her own body and she struggled to lift her hand. There are also pictures of um, this is a famous painting of Ed Voir monk after the influence in 1919 or this is also in fact, this is called after the flu painted in 1919. A doctor wrote that his patients died struggling to clear their airways of a blood tinge froth that gushed from their noses and mouths. The fluid then filled the respiratory system from the trachea to the tiniest Avo lay and bronchioles and it post mortem examination.

Speaker 1:          36:42          The lungs were greatly acts distended and when pressed even lightly oozed with blood tinge, fluid and yellow pus. The walls of the Avo lie collapsed under the pressure leaving the formless mass where neither blood nor air could flow freely and the patient died of his fix sia or the blockage of pulmonary circulation. Let me show you two pictures of the lungs of a young woman who died of the Spanish lady at the new haven hospital. Um, and I think you can see the enormous and terrifying destruction of the lungs that occurred. Well in addition, there were important sequoia. One feature of this Spanish lady was the distinctive length of convalescence and also there were neurological aftereffects, protracted depression. And there is speculation that throughout the 1920s there was an outbreak of neurological afflictions that Oliver Sacks deals with and his famous book awakenings. There's some dispute about whether this was an authentic amongst the authentic Kweli of the Spanish influenza, but it is at least plausible.

Speaker 1:          38:09          Another feature that made this pandemic distinctive was the age profile of the victims. We've seen how normally an influenza Thursday u shaped curve, it does what seems normal to people attacking the very young and the elderly. The Spanish lady instead had a preference for adults and the 20 to 40 age group and so it produced something that seemed highly unnatural, a w shaped curve with a spike in the middle afflicting the people in the prime of life. Viktor Vaughn again observed that the Spanish flu imitated the war itself and then it killed young adults like war. He said this infection kills young, vigorous, robust adults. The reasons are still mysterious, but one could point to a couple of partial factors. Perhaps the elderly had some immunity leftover from the great pandemic of 1889 to 19 and it was the young of course, epidemiologically who most directly experienced the war and military service and close crowded conditions, just the young population most at risk.

Speaker 1:          39:36          And for those of you who think that working out at the gym protects you from influenza pandemics, I would point out that the physically fit also fell ill in comparable numbers. John Hellem, the u s pentathlon champion, that is someone who did the broad jump discuss Java Olin 200 meters and 1500 meters died in October of 1918 of the flu as did Jackie O'shaughnessy who was the u s national quarter mile champion. So physical fitness had nothing to do with survival from the influencer. Let me show you a graph. This is the notorious u shape curve of the influenza and you see the two curves together. The dotted line is normal influencer and this solid line with the terrible w in the middle is the more comedy from the Spanish lady. Well meanwhile, what happened with public health and here a major feature is to point out, and we should think of this in terms of lessons for preparedness today was the way that the public health service was overwhelmed.

Speaker 1:          41:02          It was overwhelmed and part because of the extreme rapidity with which this disease through it's airborne transmission was spread by the speed of transportation and the short incubation period of the disease too is also true that there is a percentage, perhaps 10% in the Spanish lady of people who are asymptomatic carriers. Influenza also was not a reportable disease. It was maximized also because of the unavoidable and uncontrollable movement of troops because of the war. But in addition there was a lock and we might think about this of preparation for just such an emergency, a shortage of doctors, nurses, hospital beds and space one hospital wards. Influenza also has the terrible feature, unlike cholera for example, that it creates chaos within the health system itself by striking down caregivers who are among those who are most vulnerable. And then there was the war itself in which doctors and nurses were mobilized to deal with the victims of the conflict.

Speaker 1:          42:35          So there were a drastic shortages of healthcare personnel available to the civilian population. Roofer glue, whom you will remember from the Barbary Plagge who was the director of public health services during the crisis. And he was forced to lure doctors and nurses out of retirement to help deal with the emergency, to recruit even from old age homes. Well, what were the measures adopted to deal with the crisis? Antiflu measures by this time were based on the premise that this was a contagious disease and the understanding that influenza was spread somehow through the air. So our first major goal was to prevent those who are healthy from inhaling the contaminated air of the infected. So in that, and to that end, public gatherings and assemblies of large numbers of people at close quarters were banned. Public institutions were closed, schools, dance halls, movie theaters, bars, churches in this country were allowed to remain open, but the number of services was greatly reduced.

Speaker 1:          44:02          And many cities, people seen by the police to be coughing and sneezing without covering their faces were stopped and find. The New York City Department of Health posted some 10,000 plaque cards around the city bearing a message that was familiar to the public because of its similarity to the urgings of the campaign against tuberculosis. So one can see the anti-tuberculosis campaign preparing people in a sense for dealing with influenza and in New York City, the placards said to prevent the spread of Spanish influenza, sniff costs or expect to rate if you absolutely must into your own handkerchief. You're no, no danger if everyone should heed this warning. Another widespread measure was a of practical application. Also one was masking with gauze masks and some municipalities require their whole populations to put on masks. San Francisco did so and so did San Diego. Another was disinfection practices applied in hospital wards, sick rooms and ambulances. Trains too were washed down with antiseptic solutions. You can see a picture of the properly mass, uh, police, I think this is San Francisco. Um, wind here you can see the general mass gain of the whole population. And this was a public notice of public health poster from Kingston, New York or,

Speaker 2:          45:55          yeah.

Speaker 1:          45:56          Oh and it says about the measures I've told you about theaters, churches, schools, hospitals and so forth. Or um, you can see here another poster for public health. Well, state boards of health also isolated. The ill through quarantine are as far as possible. And the military tried to quarantine it's training camps on hospital wards. Sheets were hung between beds. Ambulance trains were washed down with antiseptic. People were urge to avoid nervous and physical exhaustion. You can see a long legacy of this idea. You remember Lynette talking about the posse on Triste, the sad, um, uh, passions and their influence on your constitution. So these, some of the advice had a really long history that you'll recognize. And he also, they also cautioned you are to avoid chills. They urged people to gargle with warm water and salt and just spray say line solutions up their nose to where gauze masks and legislation was passed to prevent the use of common drinking cops.

Speaker 1:          47:15          Some people sprayed their nostrils with carbolic acid spray and some towns set up fines to punish people. They called. This was one of the jargons at the time. The open face sneezer well, New York City modified the opening hours of stores and businesses in order to stagger rush hour so that subway trains and trems would not be so crowded and not be so dangerous. Congress voted special funds to an agent, able as surgeon general Rupert blue to recruit thousands of doctors and hundreds of nurses. But as I said, the war effort complicated his task and he turned to people who'd retired.

Speaker 1:          48:05          Um, those were other, I wanted to show you, um, a camp, a fact that it was wartime, made it easy for the government to induce people to accept rigorous measures. People by this time had grown use by 1918 too invasive and restrictive measures. They already knew all about the draft or rationing or daylight savings time, but existing facilities were inadequate to cope with a sudden surge. And so the general public one can see, um, uh, suffering as a result of that. And I wanted to mention that there were also popular remedies that people adopted and especially in rural areas, recourse to folk remedies and magic onion soup was thought to be a preventative people stuff salt up their nostrils to ward off danger. They wore garlic around their neck as they had in Florence and the time of Boob onic plague. They burned heart charcoals with sulfur or brown sugar to give off for reassuring protective aroma.

Speaker 1:          49:14          You can recognize this too from the plague. There were rumors that the disease perhaps was inactive bioterror. There were thoughts that there were mysterious German agents who landed on new boats and started the epidemic. There were suspicions to that poisonous gasses associated with the war effort had escaped and caused the disaster. Well, I will run out of time now and just say that one of the things to think about then or what, or possible lessons, and I just wanted to leave us to think as we deal with our own h one n one and possibly whatever its successor is that clearly in 1918 and 19 there's a collective memory in the public health service of the vulnerability of a society of critically ill patients turn away from hospitals that were full to bursting with no care available because the system was overwhelmed. And there's a fear then of what about the effects now of the impact of organized care medicine on a managed care basis with cutting costs, cutting search for savings in our system. The commitment to reading hospitals have excess capacity and spare beds. And so this approach raises the question of what would happen and another time when the system might once again be tested.
