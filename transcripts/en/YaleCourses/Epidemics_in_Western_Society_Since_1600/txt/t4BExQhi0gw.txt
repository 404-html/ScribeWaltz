Speaker 1:          00:01          Our subject this morning and next time is the age pandemic and all start this morning dealing in a sense by popular demand because I know from visiting sections that people were particularly concerned with bringing the study up today and talking about where we are at the moment. So I'll be concentrating largely on the global pandemic and where we are today. Then next time we'll look more conventionally, uh, the history of the aids epidemic focusing on this country and the experience or the United States is how I'm proposing to do it. Uh, we'll start with the uh, sort of run through if things that you probably know very well, but that we really ought to discuss a bit as background, the nature of the disease, it's course in the body and its symptoms. And then we'll move on to the epidemiology of where the pandemic is today and some of both the worrying aspects about this pandemic and also a couple of the, uh, rays of hope, that of progress that has been made, especially in the last couple of years.

Speaker 1:          01:28          So that's where we're headed this morning. First of all, in terms of the disease, um, you know already because we've talked about viruses, in this case, a retrovirus. And here we have a slide, a schematic picture of the HIV virus, you know, um, about it. That is so core containing two strands of genetic material, RNA in case to, in a membrane with two glyco proteins on the surface. The glyco protein, particularly this one, one 20, is crucial for allowing the virus to target certain cells. In the case of this virus, it targets the t four cells in the body, which are the ones that regulate antibodies and are the regulators of the body's immune system. Well, once attached to the t four cell, the RNA penetrates the host cell and for a time it's inactive even for years there then occurs a trigger or detonator, which may be this is a little speculative and infection that activates the t four cells. And then the RNA is converted into DNA that penetrates the chromosomes of the host cell and turns it into a factory for the reproduction of the virus and the killing of the cell. So the retrovirus is an absolute power site. It takes over the controls of living t cells and turns them into factories to reproduce virus.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Now this we can see also and a picture. This is a slide of an infected t cell and this is

Speaker 2:          03:50          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:50          An image of a cell reproducing HIV. And finally, let me show you.

Speaker 2:          04:00          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:01          this is a picture of an HIV particle budding from an infected t cell. So this is how the part of the mechanism of the disease and let's talk about what happens to the body in terms of symptoms. First, there's an incubation period of some six to eight weeks after which you occur. There occurs. The primary infection symptoms at that stage in the majority of cases are flu like that is to say fever, night sweats, muscular aches and pains, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, headache, sore throat, sometimes diarrhea, sometimes around cash. Then the symptoms disappear after a few weeks and in many cases there's a prolonged period that's entirely asymptomatic. This is a period of latency which can last months and has been known to last even as long as 10 years or more. The time being entirely unpredictable, but during this period the virus continues to multiply and destroy the cells of the immune system. Then there comes the period of active aids when their direct lesions caused by the retrovirus carried in some sell cases to the brain. Sometimes there's neurological damage known as age dementia or loss of motor control memory, sometimes reasoning power, but the characteristic as you know of age, different from most infections is not, it's not the symptoms that it

Speaker 3:          05:58          causes itself, but rather its ability to give rise to opportunistic infections by switching off the body's immune system, making it vulnerable to an exotic variety of infections that the body is unable to fight. This is immunosuppression. Later in the disease, the victim experiences weight loss, lethargy, recurrent yeast infections, rashers are sowers, fevers and night sweats. Active aids develops when a patient has fewer with HIV than 200 t cells per microliter of blood. The normal count is 800 to 1200 so from this point, the average untreated and I stress untreated age. Patient has about two or three years to live. Sometimes other symptoms develop difficulty in swallowing, loss of memory, cough, shortness of breath, sometimes seizure, nausea or impaired vision. But death is usually caused by a whole array of opportunistic infections with names familiar to you like candidiasis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma, cytomegalovirus, cryptococcal meningitis, but above all tuberculosis, which is the most important of the opportunistic infections of aids and globally at least the most common immediate cause of death.

Speaker 3:          07:55          So note this characteristic of aids, it's course is not just a direct result of the virus itself on the body, but those pathologies which are substratum are combined with those of a series of other diseases super imposed on the aids virus because of the progressive destruction of the immune system. And note how well adopted the virus is to its ecological niche and the human population. It's a lethal disease, but one that avoids killing its hosts too quickly. A major evolutionary advantage begins with the lengthy, a symptomatic latent period as HIV when it's contagious, but the infected patient almost certainly doesn't know that he or she harbors the virus in his or her body

Speaker 1:          08:57          and then full blown aids can last for long years while again, the patient remains infective. Well. What about transmission? Transmission can occur in a variety of ways. As you know, it's transmitted sexually. Everyone knows that we need to remember there was a myth about aids and the outset in this country in the 80s that it was a gay plague, that it spread homosexually and you all know about the moral majority and Reverend Jerry Falwell who welcomed Aids is God's sword to destroy homosexuality. Apart from blast for me and the arrogance of the claim to know God's will, what's most striking about fall was comment is his complete ignorance of the facts of the epidemiology. The virus is present in bodily fluids, blood, semen, vaginal secretions, breast milk. So one means is certainly sexual intercourse, especially intercourse involving and infected partner where there are lesions that allow the virus to penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream.

Speaker 1:          10:22          Hence sex, heterosexual or homosexual where there's a preexisting venereal infections such as herpes, it's particularly dangerous or sex that causes abrasions such as anal intercourse. So the risk factor is not homosexuality but promiscuity by which I would define as sex outside the context of a loving relationship, whether heterosexual or homosexual and Africa. Today it has been established epidemiology logically that multiple partner sex behaviors account for two thirds of all new infections but age can be transmitted in other ways despite what Jerry Falwell said. It can be transmitted through the blood by shared needles and syringes. For example, needles that haven't been sterilized but our shared one thinks of injecting drug users. One can think also have patients in resource poor health systems in which needles are scarce and not routinely sterilized. One can think also of unsafe blood supplies, blood that isn't screened and it's supplied to people by people who were in are remunerated.

Speaker 1:          11:53          Their buying, making every transfusion a risk for HIV transmission for patients who have surgery or for homeopathy, hemophilia acts. Another factor of course is the sex industry where the disease spreads rampantly among sex workers and their clients. And then there's vertical transmission. A real shock to Jerry Falwell. The disease can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to fetus or from mother to infant via breast milk. This is one of the drivers of the present day pandemic. In 2008 the latest statistics children constituted just under 20% of all new infections and nearly the same percentage of age related mortality. Well, what about the epidemiology of this pandemic? We're now a quarter of a century and to the global AIDS epidemic, and I would argue that age is a good example of one of the themes with which we began our course. Whether epidemic diseases are part of the big picture of history.

Speaker 1:          13:19          And I would argue that you wouldn't be able in the future to write the history of the late 20th and 20th first centuries without devoting an ample space to the AIDS pandemic. And it's consequences from the standpoint of the industrial world, western Europe, North America. Some people have a comforting illusion that the emergency's been controlled for a couple of reasons. One is the fact that the number of cases in the developed world has leveled off except that in the last few years there've been some troubling signs including right here in the United States and secondly, there's been the development of expensive drug cocktails that have reduced mortality significantly with many patients experiencing the disease as a chronic illness, but we need to be very careful about complacency and there are only seven countries in the world that have more cases of HIV infection than the United States. In 2006 there were 1.2 million people living with HIV in the United States and the number is not declining at all.

Speaker 1:          14:47          Furthermore, we need to remember that living with HIV as a chronic disease is itself enormously problematic. It means an expensive and complicated regimen of pills and the medication itself is toxic and has unpleasant side effects. The evidence seems to suggest too that patients with HIV AIDS undertreatment experience, nevertheless a significantly higher incidence of other diseases and that they die at a significantly lower age. And then very disturbingly since 2004 there's been a real spike in HIV infections among men who have sex with men. Meanwhile, worldwide, the pandemic continues and the words of the UN aids report for 2008 it was continuing at a staggering level. At the end of 2007 the World Health Organization reported globally, the 33 million people were affected by HIV aids, that there were 4.5 million new infections during that year and during that dreadful year, nearly 3 million aids deaths. That's something like 8,200 people a day.

Speaker 1:          16:22          2006 also witnessed 4.3 million new infections in 2007 and eight the number of deaths decreased and that was partly due to the increased access to therapy, antiretroviral therapy that lowered mortality in 2010 for the first time. UNH suggested some reasons for optimism, but optimism of a strictly limited kind, not that progress was being made to controlling and decreasing the epidemic, but that it seemed to have leveled off. That was one of the hopeful stories of the UN report of this year. It remains true though that most people in resource poor countries who need retroviral therapy still don't receive it. But let's look at some of the graphs of this was HIV at the end of 2005 and it shows the total of 40.3 million people with HIV aids. And below that it shows the numbers of newly infected people and the number of AIDS deaths for 2005. Yeah. And this gives you some idea of the dramatic inequality of the burden of HIV aids. That it's enormously a burden in sub Saharan Africa, which has more than half of the total number of aids, uh, people in the world. Or let's look at this picture, which just gives a clear indication of where the epicenter of the AIDS is, which is in southern Africa, countries such as Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, South Africa, Sim, Bob Way and Gola Mozambique there the w h o reported in 2006 and again in 2008 that the epidemic was still rampant,

Speaker 1:          18:48          that the trend still offers no comfort and in the sub region as a whole, life expectancy has actually declined because of aids to below 50 plunging to levels not seen indeed since the 1950s Swazi lend in Botswana have the unhappy distinction of having the world's highest prevalence of the Aids Hiv aids. And here you see the worst case scenario. 26% of people are infected with HIV, the highest levels ever recorded as our 20% of pregnant women. Those are rates of prevalence that the center for disease control once thought to be impossible and life expectancy at birth dropped below 40 years and several countries in the region with nearly 6 million people living with HIV in 2008 South Africa has the sad record of processing the largest HIV epidemic in the world in absolute numbers, not the per capita now epidemia logically, it now seems that there are two great dis virgin patterns in this terrible epidemic in the industrial world. It's primarily an affliction of high risk groups. We'll talk about them in a moment. Men who have sex with men, sex workers, injecting drug users out. This is what the World Health Organization calls concentrated epidemics in which the pandemic is confined above

Speaker 3:          20:48          overwhelmingly to certain high risk groups, but there's a second and more devastating pattern, clearly evident in southern Africa. We're HIV AIDS is a leading cause of death and we're transmission among high risk groups certainly occurs, but it's overwhelmed by transmission and the general population. Their transmission is primarily through heterosexual sex and significantly more women are infected than men and it's also true as I've said, the transmission occurs on a large scale vertically from mother to unborn child so that significant numbers of children are born with congenital aids. Now, why women, and this is again a none of the themes of our course and while be dealing in part here with poverty and not just poverty but in a quality women in part because of biology, the disease is more easily transmitted from men to women then vice versa. It's also true, clearly true and sub Saharan Africa that sexual activity tends to start earlier for women, young women in many parts of sub Saharan Africa also frequently have sex with much older partners.

Speaker 3:          22:24          Sexual inequality also fuels the sex industry as does the epidemic is our prime also by violence against women and often the inability of women in many situations to negotiate safe sex practices and many parts of the world. Girls are simply severely discriminated against in terms of education and therefore did not acquire sex education and knowledge necessary to take effective measures to protect themselves and control their reproduction. Girls who have not received primary school education are twice as likely to be infected with HIV as those with higher educational attainments and as I said, violence against women is a major factor in the epidemic. It's also true that we need to mention cultural norms in these areas where notions of masculinity are important determinants of male behavior patterns that increase the risk of aids, the idea that it's meritorious to have multiple partners and unmanly to use condoms well.

Speaker 3:          23:48          This is an epidemic that can serve also as a review for some of the themes of our course. We see this epidemic being primed by a number of factors that by now we're familiar to you and comparative discourse. There's a clear link with poverty. The countries with uncontrolled epidemics are among the poorest nations in the world and poverty is directly linked with the epidemiology of HIV. AIDS. Poverty prevents national governments from building effective public health structures or educational infrastructures and studies of sectors most at risk from the epidemic in southern Africa that is sexually active young people in the 15 to 25 age group. Those studies reveal that large numbers of people of that age group still do not have an accurate understanding of the mechanisms of aids transmission. Local studies also showing some places that disturbingly large numbers of sexually active young people, 25% have been discovered in places, still have no idea of what a condom is.

Speaker 3:          25:12          Poverty prevents people from having access to means to defend themselves. Education, medical care and treatment for those already infected. It drives recruitment into the sex industry. Another major driver of the pandemic, it leads to unemployment, demoralization and alien nation, all of which fuel high risk behavior including intravenous drug use, and that in turn leads to further unsafe sex practices. Then there's the social and economic impact which is maximized by the age profile of the victims themselves. That is young men and women in the prime of life who should be the main stays of families and their economies and some places. Poverty even destroys the effects of sex education itself and Uganda for example, the newspaper, the Uganda Monitor reported two years ago that condoms remained so far beyond the means of many people that a widespread practice was to boil them after use and reuse them. Then another theme in our course, we've talked about urbanization and its role with certain diseases.

Speaker 1:          26:44          Not all malaria was clearly very different, but it's no coincidence that southern Africa where the pandemic is rampant is also rapidly, rapidly urbanizing and that indeed 20% of the global burden of HIV AIDS falls on 15 cities in southern Africa. Another theme of our course is represented by age and that's the impact of glow of conflict and war. The movement of troops once again has proved to be ideal for sexually transmitted diseases and for prostitution and the spread of other STDs, syphilis, gonorrhea and herpes actually furthers the spread of aids. The lesions that they cause like genital ulcers provide ideal portals for entry of HIV into the body. Trade and modern means of transport have been important. One can't understand the AIDS epidemic without roads, railroads, the airplane. Societal neglect is a theme we've talked about and national governments in some cases, nations that are poor and underdeveloped and have virtual status as almost failed.

Speaker 1:          28:18          States have been incapable of taking major initiatives on their own in terms of improving the health of other pop that their populations, but in some cases they also have other priorities. There's the siren song of military spending. There's corruption or let's take the case of the former president of South Africa Amiki who refuse to take science seriously and rejected the idea that the HIV virus causes AIDS. He calls on people not to use condoms, but simply to drink a mixture of olive oil and garlic as a prophylactic of choice. So there's been a current of aids dissidents who relink reject the link between the virus and the disease. Fortunately that situation has changed. Then there's stigmatization which is a cause of the spread of the epidemic. It causes people at risk not to seek medical attention and that in turn undermines surveillance and active understanding of the epidemiology of the disease and the inequality of women who are stigmatized has a number of structural consequences.

Speaker 1:          29:51          That is in terms of inheritance laws that dis and franchise them unequal jobs in the economy, violence, early sexual debut and large spread practices of what Unh cause calls transactional sex in Kenya for example, teenage girls are three times more likely to be infected with HIV than boys of the same age and the differential instead of decreasing increases with age. There is also the displacement of people and aids. Hiv Aids thrives on migrant labor, on disrupted families, on refugee status were and in industries where migrants live, for example, among minors in compounds at vast distances from their homes and families. A situation that leads to convert the thriving of commercial sex. Mobile populations are at high risk of infection. And then one of the vicious factors of HIV AIDS is the burden of the disease itself, which causes the burden of poverty to increase and poverty furthers the epidemic.

Speaker 1:          31:30          So age then leads to a vicious downward spiral in which Fokker d creates favorable conditions for aids, aids breeds poverty and so on. In the words of the UN aids report for 2008 HIV causes a greater loss of productivity than any other disease and is likely to push an additional 6 million households into poverty by 2015 HIV has inflicted the single greatest reversal and human development and modern history. That was the UN report and then there is super infection that is multiple infections with different strains of aids. And one of the most tragic factors of all is the phenomenon of AIDS orphans. The who reports staggering numbers of them. It turns it a crisis of Gargantuan proportions already in Subsaharan Africa, 11 million children under 15 are orphans, a number that's expected given current and projected prevalence of HIV infection to reach the staggering figure of 25 million in a few years and worst affected cases.

Speaker 1:          33:05          It could be if this actually materializes that one child and five could be an aids orphan. Well, what are the effects of this dreadful pandemic on societies? Again, we see the functions almost as a review of themes of our course. Clearly you will, no one would be able to write the history of the present moment and southern Africa without giving a central place to HIV aids. HIV AIDS prevents education and literacy at the heart of the epidemic in Botswana is the fact that the disease kills teachers more rapidly than they can be replaced. That poor families with a member ill from aids can't afford to send children to school. The fact that it destroys healthcare systems and many countries in southern Africa, 50% of all hospitalizations are due to HIV AIDS and nearly all other healthcare interventions and programs have therefore been erased or radically downscale. It destroys productivity and creates a crippling burden of disease, destroys families and communities, thereby trapping whole countries and under development and international dependency. It destroys civil society and undermines democracy. It's a substratum for a lethal epidemic that follows in its wake, the reemergence of tuberculosis, the classic opportunistic infection complicating HIV AIDS and TB is rising at a rate of 6% per annum and southern Africa where 2 million cases of TB or diagnosed year businesses find that they're crippled their high rates of absenteeism. There's a real shortage of skilled workers available. There are high rates of turnover and it's extremely expensive to train new workers and of course the rocketing healthcare expenses that they face. So major cultural

Speaker 3:          35:38          impact on societies. Clearly this undermines any confidence sense that our society is protecting one it, um, there's a demographic impact. We've already seen the way in which HIV AIDS is altering the age structure of whole populations. And transforming life expectancy and there's even the possibility of failed states as a direct result of disease with enormous implications for security, political stability and democracy. But this last fact paradoxically has also opened a ray of hope. The realization that I last mentioned affected the national security estimate of our own government, which recommend that in fact HIV AIDS was a major threat to the security of the United States the first time that disease was recognized by the CIA and the security community as a threat to our country. And this was reinforced by studies by, for example, the Rand Corporation and the result of this realization that we are indeed a global community and that what's happening in southern Africa and other places is of enormous impact throughout the world. Led to Uracil Ras of investment of funds. And I'd most like to mention Pepfar, the president's emergency plan for AIDS relief that was established by President Bush in 2004 it now target's 15 countries has been extended under President Obama. And those countries are primarily though not exclusively and southern Africa. And it's initially it was $15 billion over several years. And has been renewed since and it became the largest commitment of funding to an international health effort ever recorded.

Speaker 3:          38:10          So this is lead with them. There's also funds through the gates foundation, particularly directed at research and through the Global Fund for HIV, AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. One of the conclusions is that there's been, that we could reach is that in the last years under this massive new investment of effort and funding that the world health community is developing much more sophisticated strategies for dealing with this epidemiology, that it has much more data and information and that it's learned a number of important indeed vital lessons. What are some of the conclusions that provide us with them at least a measure of hope? One of them is that in campaigns against this disease, one size definitely does not fit all. And here we see another theme of our course that information hard data is absolutely crucial to any effective public health strategy. Public health needs to be based on a solid basis of information.

Speaker 3:          39:34          And in this case we see a rapid upscaling of testing and surveillance as one of the key components of the global effort to combat the disease that's necessary because it establishes the clear idea that the epidemiology of this disease and each society is distinctive and that in turn enables the campaign to concentrate resources to change tactics depending on the actual results of the interventions so far. So you need to be able to meet in order to have sound public health scientifically to assess what you've done today and to change course if it's not working properly. So in one of the hopeful signs in the age, Penn Dem aids pandemic is that the campaign is become more sophisticated and focused and has been realized that strategies that fit one phase in the history of the epidemic may not be effective at another stage. And so the response has continually to be updated and adapted. The priority now is to clearly identify high burden areas as a priority and to saturate them with prevention efforts. The slogan of Pepfar for this reason is know your epidemic.

Speaker 1:          41:07          In the past, for example, anti AIDS programs failed to target married couples and in people in longterm relationships, couples in which one part particular partner in particular is HIV positive, while the other is not in the jargon of the World Health Organization discordant couples. Another lesson that the commitment cannot be short term, that it must be sustained. That short term interventions that are then scaled back can be useless and counterproductive. A good illustration is Uganda, which a few years ago was one of the bright spots in Africa when the government invested heavily in sex education, in the provision of condoms and the fostering of new and healthy sexual behaviors. The results were highly successful until funding was scaled back and favor of other priorities and since then the epidemic and Uganda has resurged with a vengeance and one could say something similar about Thailand. There are also new strategies. Let me give you a couple of examples.

Speaker 1:          42:26          One is the need to abolish the distinction in this pandemic between prevention and treatment as a false dichotomy because treatment with antiretroviral therapy is in fact a valid and essential preventive strategy in particular, antiretroviral therapy radically lowers the incidents of vertical transmission from mother to child. It's also true that antiretroviral treatment lowers the viral load and therefore reduces transmission. Antiretroviral therapy is a prophylactic because it prolongs the life of parents thereby decreasing the number of orphans and vulnerable children, the very people who fuel the sex industry and are most likely to indulge and unsafe sex practices because they locked education resources and access to medical care. So pepfar has concentrated recently on making generic antiretroviral therapies available and focused countries at an affordable price and the FDA in this country has established fast track approval to allow antiretrovirals to be rapidly reviewed and cleared. By the end of 2008 antiretroviral therapy had been extended to 10 million people with HIV AIDS and especially to pregnant women who are HIV positive. Another hopeful sign. At first, pepfar was ideologically motivated and stipulated that one third of its funding had to go to abstinence only education, but this has been demonstrated by to be counter productive and so has largely been dropped and funding has been direct, redirected towards other aspects of the program. Another stress has been on gender inequality and here I want to stress that it's not only poverty but in a quality that drives this epidemic forward. Let me give you the example of Swazi lend, which is at the epicenter of this pandemic.

Speaker 1:          45:05          One third of women in the 18 to 24 age group were found to have experienced sexual violence as had one quarter of girls under 15 so providing education and reeducation, stressing the dangers of power differentials and intimate relationships has been important in demonstrating the devastating consequences of sexual entitlement and also offering adolescent women vocational training so that they would have the skills necessary in the marketplace and hence the economic independence. That was a major determinant of public health until recent years. HIV AIDS programs avoided what might be called social economic and cultural determinants of the pandemic. Concentrating on generic awareness but not confronting the specifics of local situations that fueled the epidemic. Let me give you an example of targeting specific high burden groups and areas. One of them has been in recent years the targeting of intravenous drug users and removing ideological blinkers and simply talking in terms of epidemiology and hard science leading to such innovations as needle exchange programs to make blood safe and indeed in a couple of countries to opioid substitution treatments to remove or at least to downscale heroin addiction thereby once again lowering the rates of transmission.

Speaker 1:          47:01          Another major intervention has been on establishing safe blood supplies, combating what we might call the medical transmission of HIV AIDS through the establishment of laboratories when with them the screening of all blood and the recruitment of donors from low risk sectors of the population on a non remunerated basis or there's been the awareness of the utility of male circumcision as a prophylaxis dick measure in this app pandemic. Let me then just contrast the situation in sub Saharan Africa where the epidemic is in the population, the general population with a couple of other worrying places in the world and I'll, and then on a slightly more somber note, um, some places that are currently sources of concern outside of Africa. There's eastern Europe and the former areas of the Soviet Union where Unh has talked about an emerging epidemic. Unlike that of southern Africa. The epidemic is a d has a different profile.

Speaker 1:          48:24          It's a concentrated epidemic showing prevalence among high risk groups like intravenous drug users in Saint Petersburg, 30% of intravenous drug users are under 19 years of age and the sharing of needles is the norm and it's also driven by the sex industry and by the collapse of the healthcare system and fueled also by some religious attitudes which scorn sex education and the use of condoms or devote resources to a practice of abstinence education which has drawn monster bubbly, not worked or there's East Asia and the Pacific again and directing drug use, sex industry, low condom use and sexual tourism. All of these risk factors that are cumulative. And I'll conclude just with a couple of worrying points about our own country. The outbreak began in the 80s as far as we know, peaked around 1993 and then declined steeply until proximately the year 2001 since which time there's been an upturn and a surprising degree of misinformation has abounded new infections.

Speaker 1:          49:54          We can see demonstrate that the epidemic has transformed, been transformed unlike, and the, uh, the epidemic in the United States is totally unlike what's happening in southern Africa. New Infections are overwhelmingly among men, 718,000 males affected and 160,000 women. And it tends to be among concentrated groups, men who have sex with men, drug users, and ethnic minorities, African Americans who have half of the new cases in the last few years. And Hispanics, a transformation occurred. AIDS in the 1980s was primarily a disease among the white population. It has since declined among whites and spread disturbingly among minorities, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians. So at that point, I'll refer you to Wednesday when we'll talk about the United States in greater detail. And I just conclude since I've run out of time by saying at the pandemic at the moment is extremely active. The most hopeful thing I could say to you is not that it's being controlled, but that it seems to be globally stabilized, but there are a number of really worrying places in the world and some very worrying developments.
