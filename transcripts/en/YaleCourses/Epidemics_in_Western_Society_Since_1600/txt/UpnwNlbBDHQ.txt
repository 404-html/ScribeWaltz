Speaker 1:          00:01          Well. Good morning. You'll remember that last time we talked about dividing tuberculosis into two major errors in terms of the way that it was understood and experienced by human society. The first era we talked about last time was what I chose to call the age of consumption. At that time only the lungs were known to be affected by the disease as all other forms of tuberculosis as it's now understood where then thought to be instead different diseases at the time. The theory of anti contagion aneurysm that by now is familiar to all of him was still dominant on the tuberculosis patient was deemed to be a, should we say blameless and harmless as he or she had a disease thought to be primarily hereditary. The treatments in fashion, we're still traditional remedies of 19th century medicine, well familiar to you Veena section or bloodletting. Poultices were applied and people were given medications with an aim of increasing their appetite to combat the wasting away creosote was administered.

Speaker 1:          01:30          We know it now primarily as a wood preservative, but it was in fact in the 19th century, one of the chief medications used to treat tuberculosis and it was administered sometimes internally, sometimes by inhalation to relieve the call. It was applied topically to the lowerings to ease the coughing and alleviate ulceration and sometimes there were submucosal injections. Sometimes quinine was administered with the strategy of lowering a patient's fever and we've talked about gases that were administered to combat the infection directly in the lungs. Sometimes carbolic acid spray opiates like Louden them were sometimes given to relieve symptoms and patients were advised to travel to more salubrity as climates to visit the sea, the mountains, the dry American southwest, the Mediterranean, and then we moved on from not period the age of consumption and saw the beginning of the age as a, I'd like to call it this morning, the age of tuberculosis from around the 1880s and this was marked by a number of factors that came together to foster new attitudes, new treatments, and new public health strategies to deal with tuberculosis.

Speaker 1:          03:14          The first, and this man is by now extremely famous to you. Uh, and that's Robert Caulk. Once again, his theory of the germ theory of disease and the discovery as you know, of the bacterium. That's the causative agent and tuberculosis in 1882 but that wasn't sufficient to launch what we call the age of tuberculosis. In addition, I would say that it was influenced by international politics, a gathering of international tensions, clashing imperialisms with colonial expansion. Remember than that, this is a time when population growth was held to be essential to military strength, indeed to national survival, to industrial production and economic power. This was the age when Social Darwinism was at its height. And in that context, tuberculosis was held to be a real national danger. It was an internal danger. And because of that, patients came to lose their glamor. There were no longer regarded as creative, spiritual, sexy, and in no bold, but were thought to be a danger to health and to society.

Speaker 1:          04:47          So that was a second, should we call it the social economic diplomatic context in which tuberculosis was situated. And then there were epidemiological studies that went along in the period. Public health became much more cognizant through statistics of the ravages of tuberculosis. There were studies of its transmission and society and knowledge, statistically based. Now we're placed anecdote and the implication was not, although tuberculosis did indeed affect the elites of society and the arts, it was in fact disproportionately a disease of the poor, of the dangerous classes and in the American context of unsavory, impoverished immigrants, a disease of Irish and Italians. And so tuberculosis slowly becomes more stigmatized and more shameful. Well, the result of all of these converging factors was from about 1880 to 1940 an age of tuberculosis, certainly, but also a war on tuberculosis with new strategies of public health to combat what was seen to be a major national and international menace.

Speaker 1:          06:24          So let's look at the weapons in the new war in anti-tuberculosis public health. The first chronologically was also the most distinctive. And in some ways the most interesting and creative. And this was the establishment of Sanatoria or sanitary or if you prefer, which gave rise to an international sanatorium movement, the prototype. And the world's first TB. Sanatorium was founded in 1859 but the movement then slowly gathered momentum towards the ends of the century and then continued down to about the 1950s when antibiotics led to the closing of the Sanatoria and for a time or you fork view that tuberculosis was about to be eradicated. A view that unfortunately has turned out not to be the case. The founding father of the sanitorium movement was a German Herrmann Bramer. He was a physician and fell ill with tuberculosis, not something at all unusual and expecting to die.

Speaker 1:          07:48          He traveled to take the cure in the Himalayas to a surprise, though he recovered and he attributed his improved health to fresh air climate and rest and he thought that he could generalize that to treating patients. And an 1859 he founded the world's first sanatorium in Cy Leesha. This was followed by Peter Date filer, who founded in 1876 the second major sanatorium at Falkenstein. But despite those two examples, the sanatorium idea didn't really take off to become a major movement until the 1880s. And the decisive influence was that of the American physician who has, uh, through his offspring a Yale connection. And that's Edward Livingston Trudeau who lived from 1848. Um, and is well known, the true day of name to all of you as the great grandfather of Gary Trudeau of Doonesbury fame. Let me just have a couple dots. Edward Livingston, True Dome, let's remember a moment about his life and how he came to play a major role in the sanatorium movement.

Speaker 1:          09:20          He was a physician educated at the Columbia Medical School in New York. His brother had tuberculosis and he died of it. He himself was diagnosed with tuberculosis and the 1870s. And, um, this is a story that you've heard more than once. He too thought that he was going to die, but he followed medical advice and went to an outdoor climate to take the cure. In his case, his preferred definition, a destination was the Adirondack mountains and specifically sadder, Saranac Lake and Upper New York state at Saranac Lake. Which was at the time, uh, not a town at all. It was the wilderness and true doves spent his time largely resting and he would hunt from fixed positions in a canoe on Saranac lake or behind the blind. And as far as possible, he stayed out doors expecting to die. Instead, he realized that he was starting to feel better and he to attributed his recovery to this fresh air and rest.

Speaker 1:          10:50          And he too, felt that this was an experience that could be generalized. He became increasingly interested in the medical literature on tuberculosis, and he read about Bramer and his sanatorium. But in the 1870s, there had been little interest in the medical profession, in the disease or in framers idea, the 1880s because of caulks major epic making discovery, however, created an entirely different and more susceptive climate to the whole idea. And Trudeau became an early convert to the idea of contagion, aneurysm, and the germ theory of disease with specific reference to tuberculosis. So in 1884 this is a statue of Edward Livingston Trudeau at Saranac Lake and he established little red, which was the beginning of the sanitorium. This was in 1884 which is the beginning then of the establishment of a small rest cottage, little red for the treatment of tuberculosis patients. This is a picture of little red, the first building in what becomes a much larger sanatorium and that's a picture of the inside of the sanatorium.

Speaker 1:          12:32          There were several ideas that Trudeau embodied in the sanatorium and the first was not the sanatorium was a means of treatment. And let's look at the treatment ideas that Trudeau had in mind. The first was what he called the Wilderness Cure, the one that he had experienced himself. That is to say that you should live outdoors in all weather taking the cure on cottage porches. And so there was a document called the rules for patients at the sanitorium at Saranac Lake, and it said the following, patients are expected to lead an outdoor life to her in Maine, eight to 10 hours in the open air every day. Each patient is required to be out of doors from 9:00 AM to 12:45 PM and again from 2:00 PM to five 45 every day and sleeping out is considered a no way to affect the requirement. So the outdoor life was compulsory.

Speaker 1:          13:46          Second was rest. The patients at Saranac Lake, we're to have no exercise. A patient with a temperature of 99.5 degrees was allowed half an hour of exercise a day and exercise included standing up and getting dressed or walking to the refectory for a meal and even getting in and out of bed was thought to be exercise. So there was very little that you were allowed to do. The third thing that was part of the sanitorium regimen at Saranac Lake, and I'm choosing Saranac Lake because this was the model sanitorium that really became the ideal for an entire international movement. Thousands of Sanatoria. We're founded on this model. The third treatment idea was a solid substantial diet to combat the consumption, if you like, the wasting away of the body and to build resistance. So in pursuit of that goal, patients, it's sour. Now, clay had for compulsory hardy meals a day with milk served in between with a strong emphasis on meat and carbohydrates. The goal was for the patient to consume 4,000 calories a day. Another point about the treatment regimen is that the sanatorium was what we might call a total institution.

Speaker 2:          15:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:31          Unlike the old idea of taking the cure at the sanitorium at Saranac Lake, patients were under constant vigilance. That was one of the reasons that you kept them on the porches on a porch. You were constantly in view and visitors. We're strictly regulated. The patient's mail was censored. The idea being that they should be sheltered from distressing news and emotional shocks. Those were not conducive to recovery. The roles therefore stipulated that you weren't allowed as a patient at Saranac Lake to discuss your disease, even with fellow patients at the sanatorium.

Speaker 1:          16:27          The rules also stated that there was to be no alcohol or tobacco, that there was to be no socializing for more than an hour a day and there were to be no indoor visits from members of the opposite sex. You also, I'm not sure if the medical purpose of this, but, uh, these rules were enforced by expulsion. If you violated the rules, you couldn't stay. And the rules also said that you couldn't practice profanity. You weren't allowed to gamble. Oh, those were part of the cure as well. And the next idea of this was segregation. That is, I'm not meaning racial segregation now. I mean that isolation, there were individual rooms with porches were patients were always out of doors. This is the polar opposite of crowded conditions in tenements that were thought to be the great means of spreading the tuberculosis epidemic. And, um, so Trudeau carried out there was an island.

Speaker 1:          17:42          If you visit Saranac Lake, you'll notice that there's an island which is called rat fondly Robben Island in the center. We're Trudeau during his, um, I am self imposed exile for the cure had gone hunting and so on. But he also conducted an experiment on rabbit island and the experiment consistent, I'm not sure what you think of the robust scientific quality of it, but it certainly convinced Edward Livingston Trudeau himself. He took I think 10 rabbits on to rabbit island and five of them were allowed to live free in a good outdoor conditions. The other five work put in, uh, artificial, uh, facsimiles of tenement conditions. That is they were confined to insalubrious, unsanitary crowded cardboard boxes. And at the end of a certain period, a Trudeau notice that the five confined rabbits had died of tuberculosis and the other five who were leading the hardy outdoor life.

Speaker 1:          18:57          We're a good advertisement for a sanitorium and the outdoor cure. Well, let's, um, take a little tour of the sanatorium and we saw it started at little red in very humble beginnings, but then I say this was the total life. Um, this was the library. As you got better, you are allowed to do a little bit more and you could progress to the point where you'd be allowed the strenuous exercise of reading books in the Sanatorium Library. There was also the idea that this would be an educational experience and you would take back skills and knowledge that would be essential to you after you had been discharged from the sanatorium. And this is a plot, the workshop where you would learn skills or craft that you could exercise, remember that you might still be a something of an invalid and it would be important that you would have those sorts of skills that you were capable of a craft that you could carry out. There was the chapel out the sanitorium.

Speaker 3:          20:15          Okay,

Speaker 1:          20:16          here is one of the cure cottages and you'll note a proliferation of porches at Saranac Lake. And these, uh, are more of the buildings. Those are, this is the central administration. And here are, we actually see a patient's doing what they did most of the time at Saranac Lake. And this is taking the cure, um, in the horizontal position and, uh, being you are also educated, uh, to use this little, uh, x fashion accessory, which is your sputum comp. In other words, uh, your sputum was thought to be extremely dangerous and contagious and therefore you were not to spit on the ground, uh, but in this little cup. So the education of patients then in contagiousness theory was a part of the experience they were issued with sputum comps, with handkerchiefs, spitting was strictly forbidden at Saranac Lake, on pain of expulsion, and patients had severe instructions to suppress their coughs whenever possible and to cover their faces when they did.

Speaker 1:          21:38          So. Saranac Lake then was not just for its own patients. It was also conceived of to spread the idea of the sanitorium as a model. And Trudeau, and this was one of his great assets, he was really skilled at publicity. He became a full time agent for his own humanitarian project. Well, the Saranac Lake sanitorium than was a place of treatment and a place of education. It was also a place of scientific research featuring the science of tuberculosis at Saranac Lake Trudeau founded the world's first laboratory devoted to the study of tuberculosis and caulks techniques of microscopy that Trudeau so much admired were followed and taught. Medical students were taught staining the culturing of bacteria diagnosis. And there was a six week course for already qualified physicians to uh, for an internship, if you like, in the Saranac Lake Laboratory and at the sanatorium. And there were courses for nurses as well. Well, what were the results? We'll Trudeau himself was very optimistic that this institution had positive results for the health of his patients. He argued that normally an active case of tuberculosis was almost universally fatal, but Trudeau by contrast, claimed that he achieved a recovery rate of about 30% and so he adopted for Saranac Lake, a little slogan of his own, which was cure sometimes relief, often, and comfort always.

Speaker 1:          23:54          So those were parts of the mission of the center, Knock Lake Sanatorium. We should also see it though, as an instrument of public health, based on the idea of the isolation of the contagious, Trudeau estimated that each tuberculosis patient in a year, if he or she continued to live in an urban environment, would on average, in fact another 20 people. So we could see the sanitorium as a kind of quarantine. And its particular idea was not. This was to move, remove working people and people of modest means. In other words, this first American sanatorium was a work of philanthropy patients. At most, there was a sliding scale of expense and patients were charged at most half the cost of their stay and their treatment and the endowment of the sanitorium because Trudeau was very effective at gaining approaching donors and getting financial support for this idea and so the endowment of the sanatorium made up the difference.

Speaker 1:          25:20          So there was a considerable number then of patients with no funds who were subsidized by the institution. Well, this went on as well. We can see a relationship between tuberculosis also and should we say economic development in that the sanitorium became the center piece also for the development of a town that is Saranac lake as a town which was based on tuberculosis and Edward Livingston. Trudeau and fact was also the mayor of the town will initially those what should remember that if you think getting into Yale was difficult for you getting a place at the Saranac Lake sanitorium if you had tuberculosis was even more difficult. There was a rate of about 2000 people applying for every place. Um, and so the city of or town of Saranac leg sprang up as a place where people could be taken care of who weren't admitted to the sanitorium itself.

Speaker 1:          26:40          In other words, the town was filled with cottages, with boarding houses, with cure porches and the local board of health of the town supervised and regulated. What went on in these cottages, there were district nurses who gave advice and monitored conditions and there was a bureau of information in the town to assist patients to find suitable arrangements. And then there were so called reception college cottages for patients so ill that they would be rejected by the sanitorium and by the boarding houses. Even. Um, one of the features of the sanatorium, it's difficult at Saranac Lake to determine the effect because there was considerable triage among those who were admitted. And one of the features of it was that Trudeau did wish to take people into the sanatorium whom he considered so ill that nothing more could be done for them. He wanted people who would actually benefit from his cure.

Speaker 1:          27:55          So in that sense, this statistics were a little bit, um, massaged by the fact that the most serious cases of tuberculosis didn't figure in them. Well, the idea of the sanitorium spread and spread rapidly. It wasn't long before every state in the nation had a network of Sanatoria and some of them were specialized, some for the indigent and the poor that is the poor. Some for women, some for African Americans. The abroad, there were also Sanatoria, the most famous in Switzerland and Dave [inaudible], you can read about it. And Thomas Mann's the magic mountain and that was clearly a sanatorium that wasn't subsidized but wasn't fat for the social elite. So there were also Sanatoria of various types for various social classes and um, social groupings. There were also distinctions within the movement in the sanatorium idea in England for example, they shared the idea of the importance of the outdoor life, diet and surveillance, but they differed and that they thought that the kind of rest regimen that Trudeau had in mind was counter productive and that this would ruin working people who would get used to a life of idleness. And so in England, the Sanatoria instead practiced what was called exercise and instead of the rest treatment we have the work treatment. And um, those of you who are skiers, no about the slopes are given color codes. You're blocked diamonds, your blue and your green for example. Well, at the British Sanatoria, um, there were walks for the patients and they were also color coded according to difficulty and how much it was going to make you breathe and you inmates. Then as you got well, you were encouraged to take walks of progressive difficulty.

Speaker 1:          30:23          Well, in the interwar period, there were some additional, um, innovations in the treatment of tuberculosis. One was, and this is still before the age of antibiotics you've seen, and one was a surgical approach and this was practiced at Saranac Lake as well. The idea being to extend rest, to have real total rest of the lungs. This was termed artificial pneumothorax and that means that air was injected or another gas like nitrogen into the pleural cavity to collapse the lung or the lungs by subjecting it or them to external pressure. That procedure was developed in the 1890s and came into vogue and after World War One, especially in this country very invasively, some surgeons even decided to make the collapse permanent by removing patient's ribs to paralyze the diaphragm. Let me show you. Um, this is, uh, a patient undergoing neumothorax the artificial collapse of the lung.

Speaker 1:          31:46          And this is a diagram of the neumothorax apparatus. The remark of one surgeon was this in a burst of surgical optimism. He said, physicians who have treated tuberculosis for 2000 years and without effect, it's time now for us surgeons to show the way the analogy was that of the resting of a broken limb and a cast. Unfortunately. However, statistics seem to indicate that the results were deeply disappointing and the procedure was almost totally abandoned by 1940 fortunately. However, there were other weapons in the war on tuberculosis. One was another institution in addition to this Sanatoria and knots, the dispensary's and cities to which patients returned after discharge from hospitals and Sanatoria. They needed follow up care and the dispensary's were designed to provide that in the community. They also taught hygienic education, reminding patients that even after discharge from the Sanatoria, they still weren't allowed to spit and they should cover up their faces when coughing or sneezing and they should tell everyone in their families to do the same.

Speaker 1:          33:26          So these were in part health education facilities. They also performed what we might call social work services. They helped recovering patients define jobs that were suitable for their condition. Sometimes they provided loans or cash grants or food to tide patients over while they attempted to get back on their feet after a prolonged period of being unemployed. There were also, these were joined by campaigning, voluntary associations. And so we see a proliferation of what we might now call angios. And England was the National Association for the prevention of consumption and other forms of tuberculosis founded in 1898 and there were similar associations in France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Japan, Norway, Australia. And in our country there was the national tuberculosis association that's now called the American Lung Association. And I wonder if you could guess who its first president was. Well, your friend Edward Livingston Trudeau, I said he was a propagandist of genius.

Speaker 1:          34:49          The mission of these associations again was to educate the public about the disease, to help teach people and how they could protect themselves from it and also protect those around them. And they spent a lot of time attacking the social construction of tuberculosis from the first half of the 19th century. That is the romantic idea of tuberculosis. They stressed in pamphlets and in lectures, the tuberculosis was neither romantic, newer, poetic. One pamphlet wrote, and I think it laid it on a bit heavy. It said TB is of course, common vulgar disease, bread and foul breath in dirt and squallor the beautiful and the rich receive it from the unbeautiful and from the poor. I think we're a million miles away from La Blm. And then he case, the idea then was to frighten people in order to reform their habits. And these are associations produced pamphlets, they sponsored lectures, there are traveling exhibits.

Speaker 1:          36:10          Later on there were films and radio broadcasts, newspaper articles, and the propaganda blanketed schools and hospitals, offices and shops, factories, town halls, billing, uh, places, public squares, city walls, bulletin boards at schools and universities and particular targets where the habit of spitting and alcoholism. You would've noted not too many years ago that if you boarded a, um, a boss say in Paris or in Rome, that the back of the bus would have a sign they false to crush shed. No spitting in French or VA Tostitos with Todd and Italian spitting was really something that this campaign heavily focused on. In addition, there were other messages, the outdoor life and exercise that wasn't unrelated, that this was the time when the scout movement gets going to give people outdoor experience so that there'll be more healthy. It's sponsored playgrounds, it's schools and parks and cities and urban areas and also the movement funded research.

Speaker 1:          37:33          In the basic sciences related to tuberculosis. So that was part of this campaign, the war on tuberculosis. In addition, there were government measures. One was a campaign. I said that a secondary way in which tuberculosis was spread was through milk. And so in this period we see the attempt to screen herds to prevent disease, milk and meat from reaching the market. And it was the time when the pasteurization of milk took off as a practice. Tuberculosis also by states, municipalities and nations was made a notifiable disease. The pioneer here was New York City in 1897 Manchester in England followed suit in 1899 and then there was a cascade of other places. We're physicians, we're obligated to report cases to the authorities. Now a result, this clearly is a positive thing in that public health depends on accurate information and you can only get information through statistics.

Speaker 1:          38:50          So I don't want to argue that this was anything but positive except as many positive measures have. It also had a small undertone. In other words, this increased the fear of the disease. People feared being reported because they might lose their jobs, they would lose all standing in the marriage market. They might be shunned by anxious friends, neighbors and relatives. Another idea was vaccination and this was followed, um, from 1925 and while eight, 19, oh eight and particular, but especially after 1925 with the BCG first and vaccination with attenuated bacteria thereafter. Um, not with a very successful result, but this was part of the policy as well. And then there was mass screening through radiology and this tuberculosis skin test. Well, how effective was the war on tuberculosis with this set of tools used to combat the disease? Well, interestingly, I think one could argue that the war on tuberculosis really gathered speed, not at the very height of the tuberculosis epidemic.

Speaker 1:          40:23          When there was the most suffering, morbidity and mortality. The decline probably began spontaneously, somewhat earlier, maybe reflecting the sanitarian movement and improved urban living conditions, improved wages and diet, improved housing, things that were done spontaneously and lead to a recession of the disease by those sorts of means. But everyone agrees that Sanatoria and isolation did reduce infection that dispensary's and TB campaigning organizations provided those at risk with means to protect themselves. So they undoubtedly did have a, an important effect on tuberculosis. And we can see a decline in the disease in the early decades of the 20th century. But the real massive decline began in what we might call the antibiotic era from 1940 to 1980 roughly. And here a major event, a new magic bullet, was devised by some and Weissman and 1943 at Rutgers university. That is the development of streptomycin and the first patient to be treated with it.

Speaker 1:          41:56          Tuberculosis patient was 1944 when a critically ill TB patient made a full, we're covering what seemed truly a miracle cure and this led immediately after world war two to a confident expectation. And we'll see this repeated in a number of different fields. And with regard to a series of diseases, the idea that worldwide eradication was just around the corner and there was in fact it was fueled by a constant decline from the 1950s to the 19 mid 1980s and tuberculosis. And the USA, there was a 75% decline. There were 80,000 cases in 1954 20,000 only in 1985 and the government confidently predicted eradication by 2010 something that you know didn't happen and worldwide by 2025 unfortunately a troubling problem rapidly emerged. First there was mono therapy that is strapped to son and soon it happened. It was discovered that bacteria are becoming resistant to it for a time.

Speaker 1:          43:23          The problem was overcome by combination treatments. Two, three medications at once instead of monotherapy. I saw Niacin was developed in 1952 rifampicin in 1963 but then the problem increased with multiple drug resistant tuberculosis and in 1985 there was a hole and the decline. 1986 and seven a slight rise and after 1987 arise in the u s nine states, but even more troubling a pandemic in eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and sub Saharan Africa. Indeed. In 1993 the World Health Organization took the step for the first time or for claiming the TB pandemic of world emergency and warned that the disease might spiral out of control. Today there are perhaps worldwide 8 million people who develop, AH, give infections every year and a million over a million people die. Well, what are some of the factors in this resurgent emergency? One of course, is poverty. Tuberculosis thrives in the conditions promoted by poverty and worldwide. The nations with the highest incidents of TB, not by accident or those with the lowest gross national product.

Speaker 1:          45:03          Okay. If we look at in the United States, we can confirm this picture and that 70% of cases in the United States occur among racial and ethnic minorities, 40% among immigrants from abroad or what we might call marginal groups, intravenous drug users, prisoners, the homeless people in nursing homes for the elderly or people with compromised immune systems due to HIV aids. And remember of course that in an era of air travel, our country isn't an island and can't reduce its own burden of tuberculosis without also dealing with the global emergency. There were other factors that have fed into this upsurge. The displacement of people due to war or economic disaster or environmental catastrophes. Remember of course that refugee camps are wonderful for propagating tuberculosis and then there's the HIV aids pandemic and the upsurge in malaria. Both of those diseases are immunosuppressive and both act as powerful sub straight up for the emergence of tuberculosis.

Speaker 1:          46:29          Indeed, TB is the leading immediate cause of death among age surfer sufferers. Tuberculosis is the perfect opportunistic disease. Then there's the problem of the emergence of drug resistance that we referred to and that has fed the [inaudible] high rates of incarceration feed the pen, dammit. That's been clearly demonstrated in Russia, the former Soviet Union and in our own country and in Russia, the collapse of medical services in eastern Europe. And then of course there's the availability of mass air travel. Well, I just wanted to close with the fact that we're then in the midst of this world pandemic and I wanted to say also that there are a number of issues about tuberculosis historically in medically that still need to be worked out. It's and not understood what factors cause it to pass from the dormant state to an active infection. It's not known why in some people it's a four minute disease, but in others a slow wasting process.

Speaker 1:          47:52          It's not known why it chooses to invade certain tissues and organs rather than others. It's not really clear why in the middle decades of the 19th century it disproportionately affected women were as from the late 19th century. It tended to favor men and it's not entirely clear what were the factors that caused this major recession of the disease between the 1890s and 1985 although we've dealt with quite a number of them, spontaneous economic advance improvement in living conditions, government and Ngo campaigns, the reporting of the disease, the sanitorium movement, and then finally the development of antibiotics. So that's the tuberculosis story. From the age of consumption down to where we are today, which today we find ourselves in a very problematic situation.
