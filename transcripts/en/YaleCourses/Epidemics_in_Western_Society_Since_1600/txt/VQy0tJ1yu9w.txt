Speaker 1:          00:01          Well. Good morning. I think we should get started and what we'll be talking about this morning is the germ theory of disease and a sense it's taken us half a course to reach a period when we begin to see the development of what you would probably recognize as a scientific modern medicine to appreciate the enormity of what happened with the germ theory of disease. I think it's worth casting our eye back to a point we had already reached, let's say we compared the year 1789 with 1900 before 1789 and the developments with the Paris School of medicine, you'll remember that the conceptual framework was dominated still by that of Hippocrates Galen and humoral medicine humor Elysium was in retreat. As doctors, we're absorbing ideas about the circulatory system and the nervous system, but the medical philosophy, the vocabulary, therapeutics and medical education. We're still cast in the old framework supplemented by other developments.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Astrology, for example, an epidemic diseases were thought to be explained by the doctrine of Miasma. That is the corruption or poisoning of the air or malaria as it was called at the time. By 1900 I think it's clear that more change had occurred. Then all of the centuries since Hippocrates combined and a medical science who's basic principles were recognizably similar to our own today had emerged. Furthermore, the speed of change was gathering momentum. As a 19th century progressed, the closing decades of the century witnessed a wholesale revolution with the germ theory of disease as its central feature. This theory, I'm going to argue was as important or revolution as medicine in medicine as for example, Galileo's theory of the rotation of the earth was to astronomy or perhaps Darwin's theory of natural selection was to biology or gravitation to physics. So what I would like to begin with then it's looking at what is the germ theory?

Speaker 1:          02:45          What words preconditions? Who were the decisive figures? What were the decisive events associated with that famous trio of Louie, Pastor Joseph, Robert Caulk? What were the implications? Let's avoid the idea of a single genius coming up with a great idea. Let's question the vision behind the idea of the Nobel prize. I'm going to be arguing that these discoveries that culminate in the germ theory had a long gestation period and we're a collective process that required a long train of preconditions. Let's look at the preconditions first. I'll argue that their conceptual, technological and institutional. Let's look at conceptual preconditions. The germ theory of disease didn't arise directly out of hospital medicine on the Paris school, but I think it's inconceivable without the background of that development was crucial to have a no zoology. That is disease classification. The idea of disease specificity that they were specific entities and without the idea of localism that is lesions and also essential was the new development of pathological anatomy, a [inaudible] from the post mortem and the Paris hospitals.

Speaker 1:          04:27          The idea of specificity was critical. Any further progress to the idea of a microbial disease depended on the view that diseases didn't transform from one into another. Before the Paris school, it was common to believe, for example, that cholera to take one disease was simply a heightened form of endemic summer diarrhea. It wasn't a specific disease and it grew out of another preexisting condition. Their germ theory dependent instead on the conviction that they're stable, unchanging disease entities that each one is specific and has this specific microbial cause, but the followers of Louie Pr Louis that is in Paris, we'll carefully distinguishing one disease from another and classifying them didn't advance much towards the idea of the causative pathogens behind them. Now, when we've talked about the Paris school, I don't want to give you the idea that all of the crucial figures in disease specificity and no zoology, we've French, there were other crucial figures as well.

Speaker 1:          05:53          William Gerhard who distinguished typhus from typhoid, he had studied in Paris with Louie for a couple of years and then returned to his native Philadelphia during an epidemic of typhus. He dissected hundreds of cadavers and discovered that there are lesions had no resemblance whatsoever to typhoid. There was William Bud who wrote an important book called typhoid fever. It's nature, mood mode of spreading and prevention in 1873 and you referred to the unchanging specific nature of the disease. Let's listen to what he said. He said this to propagate itself and no other and not on a series of indefinite progressions constitutes the very essence of the relation on which the idea of species is founded. How much this implies in the animal and plant world. We all know it is strange that what it implies in the case of diseases should be so seldom recognized until now or there was Pierre.

Speaker 1:          07:11          But I to know who believed that there were more bid seeds that caused special diseases just as every seed and the natural history that is, it gives rise to a determined species. And he applied that idea to diptheria just saw as um, apples don't turn into wheat. Apple seeds into wheat, so to uh, and Dominik diarrhea doesn't transform itself into Asiatic Cholera. There was an important transitional figure to Claude bed nod of the power school. One of its stars who lived from 1813 to 1878 and an 1865 wrote an important book called an introduction to the study of experimental medicine where he presented a critique of the Paris school. He argued that diseases were dynamic processes. They weren't static in the way that the Paris idea of nosy optinose ology seem to suggest. And he argued the thing hospitals displayed the end stages of diseases, not their beginnings. And he argued the hospitals and clinics had an excess of variables that wasn't helpful for the further development of medical science. So we proposed an alternative that was embodied in his title that is experimental medicine. And by that he meant laboratory medicine. So he is one of the people who suggest a new epistemology from medicine, which isn't the hospital ward, but the lab where you can have the experimental testing of single variables in controlled settings. Here was a new source of medical knowledge

Speaker 1:          09:13          done there. If not, then provides conceptual preconditions. There were also institutional ones. And here I'm thinking of the rise of the laboratory of the university that is full time professional scientists, research institutions and Germany leading the way rather than friends in this development. There were also technological foundations. It's impossible to think of the rise of the germ theory of disease without microscopy.

Speaker 2:          09:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:54          And so it was indebted to Anton von Living Hope who lived from 1632 to 1723 and develop the simple microscope. And then in the 1820 [inaudible] and thereafter there were major improvements. The development of the compound microscope and higher magnification, the work of the Zeiss company and the development of lenses. There was also for a fourth precondition, a lonely neglected pioneer, and that was a Hungarian gynocologist who lived in Vienna called Ignacio Filipe Semmelweiss, who's crucial idea would states from the 1840s some advice noted that the infection rate in childbirth was much lower on obstetrical wards, where women were delivered by midwives rather than on wards where they were delivered by physicians. The reason had nothing to do with their training or relative degree of benevolence and malevolence. The point was that the physicians were just returning from postmortem examinations from autopsies after which at that time they didn't wash their hands.

Speaker 1:          11:26          And so they were transmitting disease to their patients from autopsies. There were performing in an adjacent building. So Semmelweis suspecting, you know, though he didn't know the mechanism that this was the case established. Elaborate handwashing rituals using a chlorinated lime solution a little bit. The first hand sanitizer we might say, and he noted that mortality plummeted from 20% to 1%. Unfortunately, his own career was not a happy one. He was mocked by his colleagues as a charlatan and was actually demoted in his own hospital. Well then there's a fifth precondition and that's the development of the basic sciences and it's hard to imagine as we'll see in a minute, the rival of the germ theory without chemistry in particular. The specific issue that gave rise to the germ theory of disease was fermentation. And pastor after all was originally a chemist who in the 1860s became a biologist and we should not that he wasn't a physician.

Speaker 1:          12:44          This is, um, to introduce you to Louie pastor. The immediate background to the germ theory of disease involved the dominant theory of the day, which was called design Monique theory of disease. That is that it was a form of ferment. A little bit like Patton coffer had asserted caused by some fermentation of dirt or gang or sorry, decaying organic material under the right conditions of soil temperature and moisture. This fermentation would give off a poison into the environment. Also quite widespread was the idea of spontaneous generation that diseases arose somehow spontaneously in a particular locality weren't brought in or imported from the outside. There was a famous experiments, um, about this from the eight s the 17th century. It was radius maggot experiment. The idea was that if you could have rotting meat and you could cover it, you wouldn't develop maggots, but if you didn't cover it, uh, then you would find that it was fill it full of maggots.

Speaker 1:          14:11          So the maggots didn't appear in the rotting meat by some internal, um, mechanism of spontaneous generation but were imported from outside. And pastors we'll see in a minute, takes up this very idea to the idea that germs to like the maggots aren't imported from outside. The immediate issue for pastor wasn't fact fermentation. He began by studying the fermentation of wine and beer and in particular their spoilage. At the time. This was thought when he took up his work to be a chemical process. And remember that pastor was not a physician but a chemist originally. Well, what he did was to discover that the fermentation was caused instead by living microorganisms, bacteria that he identified through the microscope. Now this was a high profile investigation in the 1860s for the simple reason, there's a production of wine and beer involved to a Francis major economic activities,

Speaker 1:          15:29          no poster. And this was part of his genius, immediately made a far reaching connection. And his estimate, the fermentation that he saw in wine and beer now caused by bacteria was analogous to putrefaction and infection in wounds, for example. So we began to regard no disease as a process involving microorganisms living things. This was work that posture conducted in the late 1850s and 1860s and it marked the first transformation in his career from that of a chemist into a biologist or we might say today a microbiologist. He examined not only wine and beer, he then turned his attention to milk and it's souring and he wrote a book on that. And then a study on wine and a study on beer now of great importance was the fact that pastors discovery that abnormal fermentation leads to spoilage. Along with that one to another discovery he made, which was that this process could be controlled by heat.

Speaker 2:          16:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:50          Here was a major public health discovery and the led to the process. We now know as pasteurization, so already in the 1860s pastor was busily transforming biology. Even if how do you stop? Then his discoveries were already those of a fully productive life's work, but then in the 1860s came return imposters interests from biology more specifically to medicine and public health and he began to study spontaneous generation.

Speaker 1:          17:32          Now, followers of pastor believed instead in biogenesis with regard to call a road that we already set examined. What about which there was a debate? The idea was that cholera was imported from outside. It didn't arise spontaneously. It wasn't the transformation of some other disease that already existed into cholera. Rather, it was a specific disease that could not arise as a heightened form of a preexisting condition. Posture also devised and well, caulk didn't think this was so elegant, but it certainly convinced pastor and his followers of famous swan neck flask experiment that is he sterilite a flask with a swan's neck and found that if the culture is boiled and the flask prevents air from gaining access to it, then there was no development inside of organisms that we would call bacteria. A culture of them could grow in the flask only if germs were allowed to enter it, but if the neck of the flask is broken and errors admitted, um, you can see the neck broken out the bottom, then you get a luxurious development of life and this has enormous implications for diseases and wounds.

Speaker 1:          19:11          Pastor wrote simply, there is no known circumstance in which it can be confirmed that microscopic beings came into the world without germs, without parents similar to themselves. Now postures success was partly based on the fact that he was aware of the full range of the scientific implications of his work and he selected carefully topics with high profile, philosophical and biological interest. He was an expert at cultivating the media. That was one reason that spontaneous generation had led to so much excitement, but most decisive imposters work was what he did in the 1870s as he turned to diseases demonstrating the full implications of his ideas on fermentation in the previous decade. This new phase of discovery dispute occurred despite the fact that in 1868 he suffered a major cerebral hemorrhage that left him paralyzed on his left side. Now, what did pastor doing the 1870s that was so crucial?

Speaker 1:          20:31          Well, first of all, I'll look at two major things that he did. One is work with silk worms and the other is work with chicken, cholera and anthrax. Uh, the first thing was a major contribution to the germ theory of disease accomplished by the work with an unexpected experimental animal. That is the silkworm. And again, let's look at the fact that fosters success. His influence and his genius was in part the fact that he took on really high profile research topics. That is to say disease of silk worms were these diseases. We're decimating one of France's leading industries that is silk through a meticulous and painstaking research posture demonstrated that there were two major diseases at work affecting Frances silkworms. He called them play bean and flushed it. You need to remember them for our purposes and asserted that both were specific diseases caused by bacteria and he immediately realized that there were enormous implications not only for silkworms but for human beings as well.

Speaker 1:          21:56          He isolated then to germs affecting silkworms and demonstrated that they were responsible for specific contagious diseases. Pastor isolated a germ and convincingly linked it with a specific disease and the concept of specificity was at the basis then of the whole idea of the germ theory of disease. Now you know, pastor didn't invent the idea of contagion. You've seen it with Frauca steroidal, you've seen it in John Snow who talked about the possibility of animal qls and there were other scientists, Kazimir de Vein and France, the English physician, John Sanderson, who were also advancing a hypothesis that they were finding microscope microbes with their microscopes and hypothesizing that they might be the agents of disease, but pastor was the first to provide a demonstration and a specific case proving that microbes were the causative agents of specific diseases and he provided a methodology for further experimentation and discovery poster then turn from silkworms two diseases, the diseases of chicken, cholera and anthrax.

Speaker 1:          23:22          Neither is responsible for extensive human disease as both are causes of diseases of animals. But what was critical was the process is work on anthrax help to establish a model for investigating infectious diseases and establishing the claims for the germ theory of and putting that on solid foundation. At the same time, he made another major development. His vision went beyond simply demonstrating the germ theory, although he did that. In addition, he developed a public health practice that is vaccination, which had been pioneered a hundred years before and he helped now to found the discipline of experimental immunology. Now let's, we've seen vaccination and the work of Edward Jenner. Let's define vaccination is the introduction into the bonding of either the whole or part of a disease causing microorganism in order to teach the immune system to attack that same organism should it reappear in the body through natural processes?

Speaker 1:          24:45          The mechanism is that the vaccine primes the immune system to produce antibodies or teachers and mean immune cells to recognize and attack the organism that we now know perhaps to be a virus, a bacterium, or a parasite of a different kind. The problem of course, was how to stimulate immunity without causing disease. Jenner benefited from the crossover immunity from cow pox to smallpox. Posture did something else. He used the concept of attenuation genders, the father of immunology in a sense poster, the founder of experimental immunology. The idea he had was that live pathogens could be introduced in the body, but only after being treated in some way. Heat for example, or passage through a different host. First was another in such a way then that there are varying lengths is diminished, then they'll stimulate the immune response without causing disease at all or only a mild disease.

Speaker 1:          26:04          This discovery was made during his work with the bacterium that causes chicken. Cholera made sort of by chance, serendipity player to roll. He left a batch of bacteria untouched for a week or so while he went on vacation during the hot summer months on returning. He found initially to his frustration that the culture no longer produce the disease when he attempted to infect other chickens, so he got a fresh batch of bacterium and injected the same chickens with it as well as a lot of new chickens and made a surprising discovery that the original chickens injected with the old vaccine remained healthy and our terms, they were immune. While the new and previously untreated chickens sickened and died. He repeated the experiment several times with the same results and concluded that the summer heat had changed or attenuated. The culture of the bacterium. Later techniques expanded the repertoire, demonstrating that he could kill vaccines.

Speaker 1:          27:19          Have chicken cholera but still induce immunity. There were other vaccines that could employ live but attenuated bacteria or viruses. Some used killed microorganisms, some Muse subunit vaccines and the processes of attenuation or not only heat, but let's say for polio could be the passage through formaldehyde and various, there are other means attenuation though what's critical to the development of vaccine as a public health strategy. But let's return to pastor having discovered attenuation with chicken. Cholera pastor applied the same principle to the different disease of anthrax. The passage and responsible was the bacillus [inaudible] that had recently been isolated by Robert Call and if you see the film, the story of Louie Pastor, you'll see what he did in 1881 with the bacterium. In a famous experiment, he vaccinated 24 sheep within an attenuated that is heated bacterium after which he challenged the original 24 sheet with live unattended weighted anthrax injections as well as 24 control sheep that had not been vaccinated.

Speaker 1:          28:43          The vaccinated sheep remained healthy, the non-vaccinated all died. Then came the 1880s and pastor turned to another high profile disease and that is rabies. Having discovered attenuation by heat with chicken, cholera and anthrax pastor extended the principle of attenuation by other means. This involved further famous experiments. Rabies, as it turns out, was not another bacterial disease, but a disease caused by what we now know to be a virus. In this case, he attenuated the virus by isolating it from foxes and then passing it through an unnatural host of a different species. In this case, the rabbit, so passing the virus through a series of rabbit bodies, he succeeded in a variant that would no longer caused the infection and foxes, but which serve to protect against the natural occurring rabies. Rabies was not a high impact disease in terms of numbers of people. It affected, but it was a disease of high drama and one that was then and still is universally fatal.

Speaker 1:          30:08          So it was ideal for attracting media attention. The great human trial occurred in July, 1885 with the famous case of the nine year old boy, Joseph Meister, who had been severely bitten by a rabid dog and was thought to be certain to die an agonizing death, but taking advantage of the incubation period for rabies posture, vaccinated the boy with his attenuated rabies virus. Joseph meister survived and became a celebrity patient. The first person ever known to survive after being severely writ bitten by a rabid animal. And my store remained loyal for the rest of his life to pastor. He returned as an adult to parish to work as a gatekeeper at the posture institute. We're posture and self was buried in the crypt. The Apocryphal story, I won't assert it's true. The story is that he was killed in 1940 as an elderly men when he tried to prevent occupying German troops from desecrating postures grave, the grave of the natural icon national icon of an enemy power. We're slightly less poignant, but better documented narrative is that he committed suicide in despair at the German occupation. Well, the Posture Institute, um, that's the vaccination of Joseph Meister. It's not pastor doing the actual vaccination because as I said, he wasn't a physician.

Speaker 1:          31:53          And this is the posture institute founded in 1887 with Louis posture himself. It's its first director committed to biomedical research and Paris and to a series of satellites, institutes elsewhere in the world. It followed the public health strategy of vaccination pioneered by pastor and now by gender and now consolidated by pastor the founding of this institute. You'll notice size unimposing nature gives us the opportunity to noting note in passing another aspect of 19th and 20th century science, the way in which it became a focal point for competing nationalisms and a way familiar to us from the Cold War competition between the US and the u s a star. In any case, there is a clear case in the 19th century with the rivalry between Louie pastor and Robert call the embodiments and icons of French and German medical science of to hostile national powers. The Pasta in institute in Paris rivaled the caulk institute in Berlin and that brings us, uh, we'll also note the crypt where a pastor, uh, is buried.

Speaker 1:          33:16          There's a kind of, um, what should I say, a worship of posture almost and of French medical science. But let's move on to Robert Caulk who lived from 1843 to 1910. The second great figure in the establishment of the germ theory of disease. The German scientist who was 20 years younger than pastor. Now if pastors hallmark was the imaginative Breck to his scientific vision, caulks distinctive feature, which is scientific rigor, is more rigorous techniques of microbiology. He had to critique a famous critique of the whole swan flask experiment. He argued that pastor had been lucky because Penn town in the nation was possible. He developed the plate technique using the petri dish and solid culture and he developed staining techniques for microscopy. Would I'd particularly like you to note is his methodology, which he embodied in, uh, what are called Koch's postulates. This was the methodology for determining that a suspected microbe is the causative agent of a particular disease.

Speaker 1:          34:50          He said, you could know this under four conditions. First, the organism suspected as a pathogen must be found in all animals suffering from the disease. In other words, it has to be universally present where the disease is present and then the organism must be isolated from a diseased animal and grown in culture. Third, the cultured organism must cause the disease when introduced into a healthy animal. And lastly, the organism must be re isolated from the experimentally infected animal. Now these postulates are some of the most famous in medical science and more the model for establishing germs as pathogens for other diseases,

Speaker 1:          35:46          no calls. Microscopy had a number of immediate implications. His staining raised the idea that if you could stain, you could also have an idea of magic bullets, what later became antibiotics, but core didn't pursue that particular interest. The other was this led to reliable differential diagnosis and therefore a more properly based node Zala gene. It could lead also to major public health measures and ultimately to developments in therapeutics. It furthered the sanitary idea and gave it a firm scientific basis and in irrefutably proved the raw truth of contagion, aneurysm rather than anti contagion aneurysm as patent coffer learn to its cost, but immediately there wasn't. It didn't employ and I think we should not this, the understanding of disease did not immediately lead. There's therapeutic advances. Remember what happened in Naples during the cholera of 1894 caulks idea was used for a very negative therapeutic method that is acid animus that were administered to patients well call also moved forward on other diseases applying the methods he had developed that pastor had developed in the 1870s and applying his own rigorous postulates in 1882 the most famous of all, he isolated the bacterium that causes tuberculosis.

Speaker 1:          37:40          The most, um, prevalent disease of the time. The paper that cork presented in 1882 was one of the most dramatic and important moments in the history of medicine. Tuberculosis was not feared in the same way color was, but it was unquestionably the greatest killer of the 19th century. And until 1882 it was shrouded in mystery. Suddenly call cast a new shaft of life revealing to the world that he and Rau unraveled the entire mystery of a TD ology. Then in 1883 he followed up this discovery with another that was almost equally influential. In 1883 he isolated the vibrio cholerae call, then had discovered and demonstrated the role of pathogens, the ones responsible for two of the most prevalent and feared 19th century diseases. This marked, as I said, the definitive triumph of contagion. Assam and the 1880s and nineties were a golden age of microbiology with the pathogens for being discomfort for a whole range of other diseases.

Speaker 1:          39:05          This was an extraordinary period and medical science. The pathogens were discovered for gonorrhea, bubonic plague, dysentery, tetanus, the common bacteria have wound infections, staph infections and others. The power of docs. Of course there were still few benefits for patients until the turn of the new century. The quip was made that the main beneficiaries at first of the germ theory of disease work physicians rather than patients, but there was a major exception and that was not in medicine but in surgery. And this introduces the third major figure of our trio establishing the germ theory of disease. And that's Joseph Lister, who lived from 1827 to 1912 and made his major contributions in Scotland. He was professor of surgery at Edinboro University where he was appalled by the numbers of patients who died after otherwise successful operations. You know the old joke about the operation being successful, just too bad, the patient died well, postures idea immediately struck him for it's lifesaving practical implications.

Speaker 1:          40:28          That is he made practical use of postures, discovery about the role of airborne germs and causing wound infections in surgery. Now, surgery before lister had a number of major limits. There was pain itself and the need for speed. There was blood loss and there was septicemia. The result was that the major body cavities remained off limits the abdominal cavity, the thoracic cavity, the cranial cavity, and there was a high rate of death from infection. The idea was thought by physicians at the time that the infection was arose through spontaneous generation as tissue dot died, they gave off toxins that caused infection and saw infection was simply accepted as inevitable. Normal part of surgery. Lister's surgical revolution occurred with the work he published on the antiseptic principle and the practice of surgery in 1864 the implications of postures work on fermentation without, you could have an analogy.

Speaker 1:          41:45          If posture was right, there was no spontaneous generation and airborne micro organism penetrated the wound and caused infection or septicemia. The remedy was to prevent the penetration of the microorganism, the idea of antisepsis. So lister accepted postures, insight that infections, we're not a chemical reaction caused by oxidation when air touched a wound. Instead infection was the result of contamination from the outside of the wound by microorganisms is solution. We'll first was this the carbolic spray device that he invented. What you did was to spray the air around the patient, applying carbolic acid also directly to the wound, and lister also washed his hands before operating and sterilized is interests. Instruments. There's a stylized, uh, idea of a lister type surgical technique at work. We'll, until listers, revolutionary innovation surgery had been an emergency, a treatment of last resort because of the wound infection after 1866 it became a normal procedure.

Speaker 1:          43:10          There were other innovations as well that went with it. His contemporaries improved on lister, you'll see that here. They aren't wearing masks for example or gowns. Those were introduced and gloves made from vulcanized rubber were introduced in the 1890s but really became a part of best practice only from about the time of the first world war. This also revolutionized obstetrics with the conquest of poor pro fever with hospital and clinical procedures. Then we're transformed by the antiseptic idea. So by the 1890s, you have the consolidation of the germ theory of disease revolutionizing medicine and becoming accepted throughout the international medical profession. I'd like to mention a, the impact also on culture and this particular book, um, which is by Bram Stoker, which is Dracula published in 1897 that gives us, I would argue, expression and it really dramatic and I just read it again and really scary. I sure you, uh, uh, idea of anxieties about infection.

Speaker 2:          44:41          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:42          No. Dracula is really for its time a high tech novel and it, you see all about the latest scientific and medical inventions and ideas. It contains the phonograph, the telephone, stenography, railroads, the two wheeled bicycle and in medicine it deals with the latest inventions in psychiatry and blood transfusion, infectious diseases. And indeed I would argue it also involves what was the cutting edge scientific idea in Madison at the time, the possibility of vector borne diseases like malaria and full area it pre then it's just at the time when we're going to see tropical medicine. We'll look at next time becomes the cutting edge of late 19th century, early 20th century medical science. Now you know the drill about Dracula, how Count Dracula, the Word Dracula comes from the Romanian word draw cool, which means a devil, a little devil. Um, and you know how he lived the count in a, the evil count in Transylvania, in Romania, in the Carpathian mountains.

Speaker 1:          46:00          And the point and point is he is traveling by ship from the Black Sea port aboard a Russian vehicle through the Mediterranean and up along the coast of Spain and France work you lands by ship and Britain at the port of Whitby. Then he travels by train and is transported by railroad from Whitby to London. Where his plan is to ravage the huge population of London. Now what does that remind you of? Doesn't that reminds me? I'm going to argue that Dracula is many things in the literature. You'll see that Dracula is a metaphor and this has often said for repressed sexuality in the Victorian era, you'll find interpretations of it as expressing also a repressed homoeroticism.

Speaker 2:          47:03          Okay?

Speaker 1:          47:04          In it we also find expression of the battle of good and evil. No, that's our friend, uh, Dracula. And you'll see love never dies. The idea of this actual idea is clearly some 200 films have been made of Dracula and you can see clearly a possible sexual ideas in films such as this and they're clearly also here. But what I want to argue, it's what's been neglected so often, and I think it's really important as I want to argue the Dracula is also an allegory of infectious disease, not a specific disease, but diseases like plague and cholera that originated in eastern Europe and traveled just as Dracula did by ship and by railroad that they had count Dracula's goal of ravaging industrial cities, huge population centers like London. And it's interesting that the vampire hunters in the novel are doctors, physicians whose mission is to destroy the invading the empire.

Speaker 1:          48:16          Also involved, we see is the seasonality. It's not by chance that Count Dracula arrives in late August, September, justice cholera would have, or bubonic plague. And we see miasma autism in the novel, the flowers, the garlic, the mis surrounding Dracula. And I would argue that Dracula as a composite of many infections, here's the handsome count again, and I'd like to show you one more handsome picture of him. Um, and that's not one. Uh, and I would argue that this clearly makes me think also of a vector borne disease and possibly is this a million miles removed from malaria and film area, which we'll be talking about next week. So I urge you, uh, also to read Dracula. I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
