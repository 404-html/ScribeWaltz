Speaker 1:          00:01          And so without more do, then we'll turn to our topic of the morning, which is about the first embodiment of a rational scientific medicine, which is rather an extraordinary one because it lasts from the fifth century BC down to the 19th century as a dominant, not exclusive, but a dominant medical scientific paradigm. Now that was associated with, uh, this idea of the first form of irrational secular, naturalistic form of medicine with, um, ancient Greece in the fifth century and in particular with the so called father of medicine. And that's our figure, whoops, who seems to have gone off. Ah, there he is. Hippocrates, um, who lived from about four 60 to three 77 BC. Now there's some debate about whether he was one person or a school, a group of people. There was, uh, there is a corpus of hippocratic Craddick writings that consists of about 60 works, perhaps by multiple hands, but not issue, won't really concern us.

Speaker 1:          01:28          We're concerned with Hippocrates as either this composite or a single figure. Uh, and with the various schools that followed in his name. Now the 60 works. Some of them are very famous to you already. You know about the hippocratic oath we'll be talking about such other works on as on the sacred disease on human nature, epidemics on airs, waters, places, and he also had a collection of aphorisms. One would note the variety of the hippocratic corpus. It consists of a whole series of things he invented. He, they invented case histories and they're included. Their lecture notes, their memory around a of all sorts writings on every form of medical practice at the time, surgery, obstetrics, diet, the environment, therapeutics, all of that. It forms part of the hippocratic Corpus, so enormous variety in terms of what Hippocrates accomplished. I'd like to make a contrast and that is with the supernatural view of disease and the first form we could think of that and drawing our contrast, the contrast to what Hippocrates accomplished.

Speaker 1:          03:00          We can see it in terms of the breakthrough from something that proceeded it and went alongside it down to our own day. And this would be first of all, the supernatural view of disease that epidemics and pestilence are divine punishment sent by an angry God for sin and disobedience. You can see this and many parts of our culture, it's embodied in the Bible. For example, in Genesis, you know that Adam and eve lived happily and enjoyed eternal life in the garden of Eden until they committed the sin of eating the forbidden tree of the fruit, of knowledge, of good and evil. And as a result, this was original sin and they were kicked out of the garden of Eden. From then on, poor things they had to work. Um, they also became subject to disease and to death. They were in mortal until that time.

Speaker 1:          04:06          So we see in genesis the embodiment of this idea that diseases are punishment of sin. This was also clear, you can read further in the Bible and the book of Exodus where you learn about the bondage of the Israel lights in Egypt and God asking through Moses and Aaron for the Pharaoh to release his chosen people. But the Pharaoh's heart was hardened and so the Egyptians were punished with the series of terrible plagues that are all in, in exodus. Another way of the embodiment of this was in psalm 91. And this is of particular importance to us. And let's move to, um, share this with you. Um, this is the text of a psalm 91. This is particularly important because it embodies the idea of plague and pestilence as a punishment by God, but also in terms of our historical experience. As you're reading Daniel Defoe, you'll realize that it's psalm 91 that was read out from the Christian churches during times of epidemic.

Speaker 1:          05:28          This was the great plague Psalm. It embodies hope and an interpretation of what the experience of plague was all a about. So let me read part of it here. They'll show up, not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the Arrow that flies by day, nor for the pestilence that Walketh in darkness, nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday. 1,000 shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand. But it's shown not come Nivea only with Thein eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most high by habitation, there shall no evil befall thee. Neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. So if you renounce sin, the pestilence won't come near you. Well, let me turn also to another embodiment and culture. Our Western culture.

Speaker 1:          06:38          And this is the opening scene of Homer's Iliad, which is, you know, is all about the Trojan war. And it begins just before this scene with, uh, Achilles anger. That is to say Achilles was the greatest of the Greek warriors. But the Greek King Agamemnon had taken his concubine for his own. And as a result in raged Achilles withdrew from combat and soaked in his tent. Now he had a friend who was a priest of the god Apollo. And this friend tried to intervene and besieged Agamemnon to right the wrong and return the woman. But Agamemnon rebuffed Apollos priest, or as we might say, he dissed him. And so what we have here is this tremendous and terrifying scene at the beginning of the Elliott. So let me just quote from the beginning then over and over, the old man that is the priest prayed as he walked in solitude to King Apollo, hear me, Lord of the silver bow bring to pass this wish.

Speaker 1:          07:55          I pray for, let your hours make the Denay ans pay for my tears shed. So he spoken prayer and Phoebus Apollo heard him and strode down along the pinnacles of Olympus, angered in his heart, carrying across his shoulders, the bow and the hooded quiver and the shafts clasped on the soldier shoulders of the God walking. Angrily he came. Ms. Knight comes down and knelt down apart and opposite the ships and let go. And Arrow terrible was the clash from the bow of silver. First he went after the mules and the circling hounds then let go, uh, tearing Arrow against the men themselves and struck them. The corpse fires burned everywhere and did not stop burning. So that was Apollo punishing the on behalf of his priest or let me also mention something example that's more recent and closer to home. That is, I want to talk for a minute about a Yalie.

Speaker 1:          09:07          And this is our friend here, John Humphrey, noise of the 19th century who was at the Yale divinity school. And he read the pieces we've just talked about and thought about disease as a punishment for sin and decided, well, there was a remedy. And so in all modesty, he and a group of his friends decided that they were going to renounce sin all together and they called themselves the perfectionists and they founded an ideal community, first in Putney, Vermont, and then an Oneida in New York state. It's part of the history of American Utopian communities in which they renounce sin. And we're going to live together, uh, and harmony and peace forever as a people. And every morning began with a mutual criticism in which they pointed out each other's faults. This must have been a lot of fun, uh, in order that they not fall by the wayside and lops once again into sin.

Speaker 1:          10:14          Well, I'm sorry to tell you, this was the 1840 [inaudible] by the 1890s, the ideal community had become instead of joint stock company and you still have Oneida pottery and silverware, and I'm very sorry to report that all of the members of the community have been buried. Uh, I don't know if that was because they couldn't stick the pace or if the concept was wrong from the outset. In any case, uh, this was an embodiment then of the idea of disease as a punishment for sin. But if we view this view of pestilence as divine punishment, it does at least imply a log governed comms. Mus Disease exists for an intelligible reason, and it implies a rational therapeutics, which is repentance, propitiation of God amendment of conduct, and renewed obedience to the laws. There's another variation of a supernatural view, which is more capricious. And let's call that the demonic theory of disease.

Speaker 1:          11:25          This pop stipulates that the world is populated by powerful, arbitrary and evil spirits who cause disease through their Maniape influence. These may be evil persons such as witches or poisoners, the disembodied spirits of the dead super human beings or the devil himself. We'll see this view throughout the course, the idea that epidemic diseases or diabolical plot, not natural events. There's some a colt secret crime caused by the poisoning of witches or scapegoats, and this gives rise to witch hunts to hunt down and punish the guilty. We know this famously in the 17th century and in our own country at Salem, but the idea was clearly expressed in Europe by Martin Luther who declared I would have no pity on the witches. I would burn the mall. Alternatively, that was a good therapeutic idea. Alternatively, a person could be deemed to be inhabited or possessed by an evil spirit, and in that case to cure was to cast out the devil through exorcism.

Speaker 1:          12:45          And this cosmology survives in our own language. When we talked today about someone acting like someone possessed or out of his mind and healers pursuing these sorts of ideas would invoke magic or have incantations. They'd prescribed special concoctions, chance, sacred rites and spells, and in European history, and relatively recent illustration of that idea was the idea of the healing power of the royal tach. Charles, the second of England, for example, administered this treatment in the 17th century to about 100,000 people. So healers could do that. They could also recommend magic practices, offerings and sacrifices, magic charms to ward off the evil spell where they could recommend escaping by taking flight or invoking the power of a powerful ally as in the Christian cult of saints that we'll be talking about later. So if you hold that up, those two views then of supernatural interpretations of disease, then you can understand the breakthrough that was made in fifth century Greece.

Speaker 1:          14:03          This was in contrast to the supernatural, divine and demonic theories. And that's in contrast to them that we can see the importance of a new idea, the idea that disease instead, as a naturalistic event that can be understood by natural causes. Examples of this new naturalistic secular view abounded in the fifth century. You can see it in through city ds and his account of the Peloponnesian war, the famous plague of Athens that may have been typhus or more recently it was thought to have been typhoid, but in any case it was a natural event and is described as such by through cities with no reference to the occult or the supernatural. You can see it in Hippocrates discussion on epidemics in which diseases epidemic diseases are caused by a corruption of the year. But let me talk about this very famous example and dramatic one of Hippocrates on the sacred disease by the sacred disease.

Speaker 1:          15:15          He meant epilepsy and it looks, I guess if you wanted any disease that looks like a possession by a demon, it is epilepsy and Hippocrates wants to tell us that this is not a supernatural event or a possession. He says instead something extremely different. Uh, what he tells us is that, um, it is thus with regard to the disease called sacred, it appears to me to be no wise, more divine or sacred than other diseases, but has a natural cause like other afflictions, men regard it's nature and cause as divine from ignorance and wonder. And this notion of its divinity is kept up by their inability to comprehend it. Neither truly do I count it as a worthy opinion to hold that the body of man is polluted by God, the most impure by the most holy for war, the body defiled, it would be likely to be purified and sanctified rather than polluted.

Speaker 1:          16:28          Those who first referred this malady to the gods, you appear to me to have been just such persons as the conjurers mount banks and charlatans are such persons. Then using the divinity as a pretext and screen for their own inability to afford assistance have given out that the disease is sacred. This was a very major breakthrough conceptually, the beginning of the foundation of a scientific medicine. So therapeutics then got rid in a naturalistic view of chance, potion spells and sacrifices and exorcism, appeasement of the gods. The importance of this momentous step in human consciousness was expressed by a Yale professor of epidemiology in the 1940s, Charles Edward Winslow who wrote, and let me quote a sentence or two from him. If disease is postulated as caused by gods demons or demons, scientific progress is impossible. If it is attributed to hypothetical humors, the theory can be tested and improved.

Speaker 1:          17:47          The conception of natural causation was the essential first step. It marks incomparably the most epochal advance in the intellectual history of mankind. That perhaps is putting it a little strongly, but you certainly get the point now, why perhaps was there a rational scientific medicine in fifth century Greece here? I think the main part of the answer has to be imponderable factors such as the inspiration of Hippocrates himself and his associates. But there were influences we could point to as important, the absence of a priestly bureaucracy with the power to sanction heretics. Decentralized city states the legacy of Greek natural philosophy, um, the work of Plato and Aristotle in particular a culture of individualism. And I think we also need to remember that hippocratic position, physicians, although they were known to treat the poor and slaves, their care was not buying large available to the masses. The primary clientele consisted of educated, prosperous elites in ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

Speaker 1:          19:09          And this was a medical philosophy that suited them. The educated doctor and the educated patient spoke the same language and the therapies that the physician proposed, such as a special diet or rest were remedies the wealthy could afford. Now, we should say that hippocratic medicine is still with us. We can see it in the return to holistic medicine. We can see it also in the Muslim world in, you can still be treated in new noni medicine by a hippocratic style medicine. And you can see it in certain popular cultural precepts such as the one feed a cold and starve a fever. Well, if that's it's important, let's look at its content. What was the content then of this first embodiment of scientific medicine? And it was humorous realism. Here, let's talk about what that is. The fundamental assumption was that there's a correspondence between the macrocosm of the universe and the microcosm of the Individual Bondi. Both are composed of the same materials, subject to the same laws and disorder can occur in one and be followed by disease in the body. Now according to Aristotle and natural philosophy, the macrocosm consisted of four elements that you can see here. They were

Speaker 1:          20:52          earth, water, air and fire. And each of the elements is associated with four qualities which they can be dry and hot like fire or dry and cold or cold and wet or wet and hall. So the elements embody also four qualities in different proportions of course. And this went on over the centuries and there were four seasons, four wins later on for evangelists. But the point for us is there was also a microcosm and one can see the theory expounded on human, on human nature in which there are four humors which are blocked, bile, phlegm,

Speaker 1:          21:41          phlegm, black bile, yellow bile and blood. And each of those also, um, the body is composed of these and each has qualities of as being wet and cold or hot and dry. Uh, this also determines the balance of these humors in the body. The four temperaments, whether you're a melancholic, flameouts, cleric or sanguine, those words survive in our culture there for ages of men, for principle, organs of the body, the spleen, the brain, the liver and heart. You'll see the importance of four. And the system is axiomatic. It's based on deductive reasoning from first principles. Central of course, to all of it was the climate of Greece with its seasonal patterns and it's specific patient population. Many were malarial victims with the complications of pneumonia. And Hippocrates indeed was the world's first malaria. Ologist. No health consisted what's called you crazy, huh? Which meant a balance or equal Librium of the humors and therefore have the qualities and variations are possible.

Speaker 1:          23:01          Uh, we're up to a certain threshold and at various times in your life or from one person to another, the balance among the four humors can change. But once you cross a certain threshold in variation that is one humor becomes overly dominant or one humor is lacking in sufficient supply. That's an inbound. Once that's dis crazier an excess or deficiency of one of the humors and that is disease. So we know what diseases, then it's an imbalance of the humors. So note that there is no single, that is to say there aren't discrete individual diseases as in modern medicine that is diseases classified as typhoid, cancer, pneumonia and all the rest. Disease instead was a holistic phenomenon of Bondi equilibrium. There was an esense only one disease. Now what were the causes? The causes were said to be what we might call in monitoring jargon, environmental insults that gay lung later on was to codify as the six non naturals, the human body and constitution then had contact with the air which might be corrupted or my asthmatic as it was called later.

Speaker 1:          24:29          Uh, motion or what we might call exercise was the second not or it's lack non-natural sleep or wakefulness excretion or retention of whatever was ingested and the passions of the soul. These were the non naturals that could tip the body into disease. Now, restoring health was based in part on nature itself. That is to say there's a teleology ology of the body embodied in the phrase, these matey cut treats not to die, which is the healing power of nature and the means to restore the body, in other words, strives to restore equilibrium through [inaudible] or through the elimination of excess humors. When you sweat, you sneeze or you vomit for all of that is your body's attempt to get rid of the humor that's making you sick because of its excess. So this led then to a humoral therapeutics, and let's talk about that. The basis of medical strategy was that the physician was the ally of nature and of the body.

Speaker 1:          25:49          The body was trying to restore itself to help to health and the physician would join it and doing battle against disease. He would read the signs to decipher the underlying process would take a case history would practice close observation, taking the pulse, listening to the body and would examine the urine. It's color, it's density. Ah, he would smell it and taste it and see whether it contained blood or was frothy as all of those work worrying prognostic signs. It was a holistic treatment where you didn't treat individual symptoms but the whole constitution and it also had an idea of the individual realism of the patient. Treatment should be tailored to the constitution of the individual. There are no disease entities because disease is not a thing but a process. So this was a medicine that was round. They're indifferent to diagnosis or classification. What it stressed instead was the answer to the patient's eternal question and I going to be all right, doc.

Speaker 1:          27:06          Prognosis was what really mattered to the hippocratic physician. The therapeutic principle was that opposites treat opposites. So if you have an excess of a dry and cold humor like the block Boyle, um, if that's the humor that's causing your illness, then you would like to perhaps to give the patient a food to ingest that would be wet and hot and hot. In this case. Think of it and not simply as the touch we think of it when we talk about spicy food is being hot, so all the elements that you have also have qualities and so diet is very important to this therapeutics, so the tools available to the physician then our first of all diet. In some sense the hippocratic physicians thought we are what we eat and all foodstuffs had qualities, hot, cold, moist, dry to balance an opposite defect or excess in the human body.

Speaker 1:          28:17          Exercise was also important. A change of environment in modern terms going to a spa or a sanatorium, a moderation in the emotions. Moderation in Saks and medication was important because the, they did practice hippocratic physicians, internal medicine examples were to promote evacuation by providing emetics sue terrifics, purgatives or diuretics and most uh, important perhaps was a primacy of Venus section, by which I mean bloodletting or phlebotomy, that became the hallmark of the Orthodox physician. Medicine in other words, was conceived as a process of addition and subtraction, adding what is wanting and subtracting what is an excess. Now you may have your doubts about Venus section. Let me just mention some of its advantages in the eyes of hippocratic physicians. It was systematic like disease itself. It's effects were immediate and you could control them. It was speedy. It's limits were also self evident to the experienced doctor.

Speaker 1:          29:38          Perhaps the patient fainted, the pulse disappeared, or the color of the blood altered. There were how are for, of course, contrary indications to bloodletting old age and deficiency of blood. The summer heat evacuation already occurring by other means or extreme cold. So the Lancet, the instrument for a bloodletting, uh, there we have real lancets, uh, became the symbol of the orthodox position down through the 19th century. Now note that there is no real humoral physiology, no idea of the circulation of the blood. The heart is not a pump, but a furnace drawing air from the lungs, heating it and distributing as in it as innate heat in the body. So this was the first embodiment of scientific medicine. I want to talk about an alteration that it went through through the second father of medicine. And this is another Greek physician who lived, however, in ancient Rome and not is Galen.

Speaker 1:          30:53          And that's a picture now, his personal, he lived in the second century, a d from one 30 to about two oh one with his formative years being lived out in Rome. His personal qualities are important. He was very different from Hippocrates. Hippocrates was a great observer and empiricists. Galen instead prided himself above wall on his knowledge of the texts of Hippocrates. He almost worshiped to pocker teas, but regarded himself as the authorized interpreter if it parked at it worse, which he turned into a dogma. Now in Rome, Galen was physician to the gladiators. His personal position, uh, helps explain his influence. He then became private doctor to the emperor and he regarded himself as the ideal physician, philosopher and scientist. He was a man of overweening self confidence who had nothing but withering scorn for his opponents and colleagues whom he called murderer's amateurs, unversed in hippocratic wisdom as he called them, more ignorant than animals.

Speaker 1:          32:15          It was true also that Galen had an encyclopedic knowledge, and we can only understand his influence if we remember that he was a man of immense knowledge of all branches of the medicine that existed at his time, and only half of his written works survive, but they alone fill 12 volumes of about a thousand pages each. In other words, he was extraordinary and his productivity, and that too is important on his influence. Now, Galen had a view that was foreign to us of the meaning of scientific progress. To him, Hippocrates was the permanent foundation of medical science and the main tenants of that science could never be overturned or revised. Instead. There was no room in his thinking for scientific revolutions. The writings of Hippocrates were valid forever that could only be completed and perfected. And in fact, that was gay. Lynn's view of himself, he was the person who perfected hippocratic ideas.

Speaker 1:          33:25          So in fact, further progress was probably unnecessary and perhaps impossible. So Galen became the authoritative interpreter of Hippocrates. So this is what we might call gala Newsom. And then his hands. Hippocrates became a cult figure, an object of veneration, enormous worship, apoc Ortiz about whom so little was known in his personal life, was now endowed with all manner of apocryphal virtues. He was idealized as a model of wisdom, courage, temperance, humanity and honesty. Mythologies developed about his religious piety, his heroism, and his hard work. There was a legend that he was descended on his father's side from the God Asclepius and on the maternal side from Hercules. He was said to be a great patriot who saved Athens from the plague. A man who scorned money and was perfectly wise and perfectly just so he became one of the greatest cultural figures of antiquity and equivalent in a different way of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.

Speaker 1:          34:48          Now, probably some of you are wondering, we've talked about humor, realism, and its advocates and you'll want to know, well, that's all very fine. Did it work? I'd like to say that humor realism had a number of strengths. It was a quantum leap from magical thinking to naturalistic explanations of disease. It appealed because it was accessible to educated layman contemporaries with an education. Understood everything that hippocratic can galenic doctors said and prescribed. It was consonant with contemporary understandings. We also need to know that hippocratic and galenic physicians practice therapeutic modesty. They did not participate in surgery except for example for setting bones, Lansing abscesses and practicing Vena section. But then your internal cavities of the body they knew were off limits. It was based on observation. They took case histories. And we ought to remember in terms of medical effectiveness that uh, my wife for example, who is a primary care physician, says that about 75% of patients who present themselves in a clinic have self limiting illnesses or psychosomatic ones and mostly need reassurance that everything will be alright.

Speaker 1:          36:25          So the point about hippocratic medicine was that experienced physicians accustomed to seeing ill people would be pretty good at prognosis and reassurance. They would refuse to treat cases they regarded as hopeless and hopeless cases. They also had a referral system will refer to in a minute, which was to temples. I'll come back to that in just a second. There were, however, a number of weaknesses. So hippocratic galenic medicine had a number of powerful strengths. It provided a lot in terms of reassurance and prognosis and the answer to that eternal question, will I be all right doc? And the other question, what can I do to help myself? There were a number of weaknesses. It was a closed system. It was based on deductive reasoning and came to be a bound up in the authority of the ancients with empiricism fading away. And indeed in later centuries it comes to be called library medicine.

Speaker 1:          37:31          It was anchored in a cult of personality, the cult of Galen, and through him of Hippocrates and practice a cult of antiquity with knowledge almost becoming a form of revealed truth. So gala, Nazism involved authority and tradition and elite medicine of university trained physicians who were involved, particularly in their training and studying the classics. So how do you train a physician? You have them read Hippocrates and Galen in the original languages. Now, I don't want to say however, that there were no challenges. It's extraordinary to reflect that humor realism as a dominant medical philosophy persists into the 19th century. But I don't want to think that it was unchallenged. We know there were demonic and religious views that ran along side. But in addition, there were a series of scientific challenges that in a number of major shocks to the system that slowly weakened its hold and gave rise to doubters, but did not thoroughly dismantle humor realism until the late 19th century.

Speaker 1:          38:49          And even then, it persists in popular culture and some forms of alternative medicine. What were some of these challenges? I don't expect you to remember these at this point. We'll come back to them later in their course, but just so that you'll understand that it wasn't as though this system never had challenges. Protestantism was a challenge with the challenge to authority and established text and Paracelsus whose dates are on your handout was called the Martin Luther of Madison, who rejected, um, galenic and hippocratic medicine. Altogether. William Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood that overthrew or challenged Galen his anatomy and his physiology, uh, which were approved not to correspond to the observed results of dissection and pathology. So the discovery of the circulation of the blood was a major blow, although oddly enough, Harvey himself never rejected humoral. Listen, Hippocrates and Galen. Then there was the scientific revolution and in particular one can think of the chemical revolution associated with men like Joseph Priestley and Antoine Love was they destroyed the Aristotelian notion of elements.

Speaker 1:          40:20          Earth and air for example, were found themselves to be composed of a great number of modern elements that go to make up what we know as the periodic table and more generally the scientific revolution mark to Democratic turn from authority to empirical evidence and it visioned scientific and medical knowledge as infinitely expandable and not bounded by set texts. And then from the point of view of our course, the experience of epidemic disease as we'll see, made the idea of discretion improbable as a mechanism needed to explain epidemic disease because it's fairly flimsy as a basis for explaining why so many people and a single place at a single moment of time had their echo lebree all unbalanced at the same moment. So the experience of epidemic disease is important and we'll see the physician for Daca, Stuart came up with the idea of contagion and many centuries ago and the 19th century.

Speaker 1:          41:30          We'll see also with the development of the idea of disease specificity. And finally in the late 19th century, the germ theory of disease, which offers an entirely different paradigm for disease. So that's the journey will be taking to the time when humor realism is replaced. And we'll look at various embodiments, uh, along the way of what people considered to be scientific medicine. But here are a number of you will be thinking that I've involved myself and an important contradiction, and you'll be thinking about a Asclepius and the fact that I talked about temples and uh, God, uh, and in particular, let's look at,

Speaker 2:          42:21          oh,

Speaker 1:          42:24          that's the God Asclepius and this is the, uh, I'll talk about who he is. Hippocrates and Galen, we're both pious and devout. Uh, that is to say, although they believed in a naturalistic medicine, it wasn't that they didn't also believe in the gods and prove the gods they found in temple medicine what we might call the world's first referral system. Asclepius who was he? He was first to moral hero who became half human and half divine, and then entirely a god. He was thought to be the kindest of the God's the one who loved humanity enough to sacrifice himself for their sake. His father was the god Apollo. His daughters were interestingly named the goddesses panacea and Hygieia and physicians in the ancient world might call themselves as sleepy ads, meaning the sons of Asclepius who regarded their father as a patron saint. By the time of Alexander the Great Greece possess three to 400 temples dedicated to Asclepius, Asclepius was said to have been killed by Zeus because he taught mortals the art of healing.

Speaker 1:          43:52          And Zeus feared that men and women would compete with him and no longer being subject to death, but Asclepius never practiced magic. He was merely the most skilled of physicians using the same principles that Asclepius ads like Hippocrates and Galen would use as well. Note, of course there similarities to the story of Christ and Asclepius was in fact a major competitor with Christianity for a number of centuries. Unlike Christ after death, he said to have risen and to be present to eternally in the temples. So the temples were shrines to Asclepius at places like Athens. I'll show you hope. A couple of examples. That's cause where, uh, Hippocrates was from and this is, these are the temple at Pergamum. Um, I just want to there, it's a whole, this is more than just a temple, although it is a temple. It's a, almost a compound. Now, the usefulness of identifying yourself with Asclepius was that there was, it's was provided positions with the badge of identity, a source of authority.

Speaker 1:          45:14          There were wandering peripatetic healers, but now they're recognizable as members of the same guild. This gave them a collective presence and authority and Asclepius also vouched for their ethical conduct. Remember, these are peripatetic physicians whom you invite into your home. And so they needed to have someone vouch for them and he vouches that there are good doctors and that they have special care for the poor who can't pay him. But again, there is no contradiction with naturalistic medicine. The temples were precursors in a way to health, spas, Sanatoria or hospitals there they provided care for the poor and the seriously ill patients could enter them. The precincts of these compounds after a period of preparation in which they bathed, fasted, prayed, and offered sacrifice. But the therapeutic strategy comes to them in a particular way, which is called an incubation, which is to say that it night after the prepared yourself carefully and the way I just mentioned when you then the priest will help you and when you fall asleep at night, you'll have a dream.

Speaker 1:          46:36          This is the incubation and the God Asclepius will appear to you and tell you the throttle you pursued pursue in order to become well again. But the strategy was nothing other than what a skilled physician would have prescribed had he been skillfully skillful and wise enough to have known. There was never a retreatment prescribed by Asclepius by magical means or a miracles or by practices that weren't accessible to the ordinary doctor. So this is humoral medicine, the first embodiment of scientific medicine. And I want us to look for the next several sessions at the way in which it was used as a lens to view the experience of terrible epidemic catastrophes. And we'll look also at the way in which the experience of bluebonnet plague and other epidemics challenged or raised major questions about humoral theory and helped propel the scientific medical elite towards a different view of disease and what it was. So we'll see epidemics beginning next time as a process. And we'll also want then to explain it and we'll look at bluebonnet plague as the first of our major epidemics in our course.
