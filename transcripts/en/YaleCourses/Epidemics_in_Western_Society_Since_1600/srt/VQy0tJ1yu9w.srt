1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,663
Well.
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,760
I think we should get started and what
we'll be talking about this morning is

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:13,431
the germ theory of disease and a sense
it's taken us half a course to reach a

4
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:20,481
period when we begin to see
the development of what you
would probably recognize

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,300
as a scientific modern
medicine to appreciate the
enormity of what happened with

6
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,480
the germ theory of disease.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,310
I think it's worth casting our eye
back to a point we had already reached,

8
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:40,311
let's say we compared the year 1789 with
1900 before 1789 and the developments

9
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:49,650
with the Paris School of medicine,

10
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,770
you'll remember that the conceptual
framework was dominated still by that of

11
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:59,730
Hippocrates Galen and humoral medicine

12
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,950
humor Elysium was in retreat.
As doctors,

13
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,750
we're absorbing ideas about the
circulatory system and the nervous system,

14
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,470
but the medical philosophy,
the vocabulary,

15
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,290
therapeutics and medical education.

16
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,380
We're still cast in the old framework
supplemented by other developments.

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,440
Astrology,
for example,

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,560
an epidemic diseases were thought to
be explained by the doctrine of Miasma.

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,440
That is the corruption or poisoning of
the air or malaria as it was called at

20
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,304
the time.

21
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,060
By 1900 I think it's clear
that more change had occurred.

22
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,490
Then all of the centuries
since Hippocrates combined
and a medical science who's

23
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:55,911
basic principles were recognizably
similar to our own today had emerged.

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,460
Furthermore, the speed of
change was gathering momentum.

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,740
As a 19th century progressed,

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,760
the closing decades of the century
witnessed a wholesale revolution with the

27
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:15,000
germ theory of disease
as its central feature.

28
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,970
This theory,

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm going to argue was as important or
revolution as medicine in medicine as for

30
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,034
example,

31
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,070
Galileo's theory of the rotation of
the earth was to astronomy or perhaps

32
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,430
Darwin's theory of natural selection was
to biology or gravitation to physics.

33
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
So what I would like to begin with then
it's looking at what is the germ theory?

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
What words preconditions?

35
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,630
Who were the decisive figures?

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,720
What were the decisive events associated
with that famous trio of Louie,

37
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:01,030
Pastor Joseph,
Robert Caulk?

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,310
What were the implications?

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,960
Let's avoid the idea of a single
genius coming up with a great idea.

40
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,230
Let's question the vision behind
the idea of the Nobel prize.

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,160
I'm going to be arguing
that these discoveries that
culminate in the germ theory

42
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,950
had a long gestation period and we're a
collective process that required a long

43
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,960
train of preconditions.

44
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,750
Let's look at the preconditions first.
I'll argue that their conceptual,

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,450
technological and institutional.

46
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,740
Let's look at conceptual preconditions.

47
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,310
The germ theory of disease didn't arise
directly out of hospital medicine on the

48
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,700
Paris school,

49
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,790
but I think it's inconceivable without
the background of that development was

50
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:02,650
crucial to have a no zoology.
That is disease classification.

51
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,770
The idea of disease specificity that they
were specific entities and without the

52
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:14,581
idea of localism that is lesions and
also essential was the new development of

53
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,960
pathological anatomy,

54
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,660
a [inaudible] from the post
mortem and the Paris hospitals.

55
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,980
The idea of specificity was critical.

56
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,910
Any further progress to the idea of a
microbial disease depended on the view

57
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,780
that diseases didn't transform
from one into another.

58
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,740
Before the Paris school, it was
common to believe, for example,

59
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,830
that cholera to take one disease was
simply a heightened form of endemic summer

60
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,963
diarrhea.

61
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:04,380
It wasn't a specific disease and it grew
out of another preexisting condition.

62
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,960
Their germ theory dependent instead
on the conviction that they're stable,

63
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,050
unchanging disease entities that each
one is specific and has this specific

64
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:17,680
microbial cause,

65
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,940
but the followers of Louie
Pr Louis that is in Paris,

66
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,360
we'll carefully distinguishing one
disease from another and classifying them

67
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,150
didn't advance much towards the idea
of the causative pathogens behind them.

68
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,990
Now,
when we've talked about the Paris school,

69
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:46,110
I don't want to give you the idea that
all of the crucial figures in disease

70
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:49,600
specificity and no zoology,
we've French,

71
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,590
there were other crucial figures as well.

72
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,550
William Gerhard who distinguished
typhus from typhoid,

73
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:04,300
he had studied in Paris with Louie for
a couple of years and then returned to

74
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:09,650
his native Philadelphia
during an epidemic of typhus.

75
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,890
He dissected hundreds of cadavers and
discovered that there are lesions had no

76
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,930
resemblance whatsoever to typhoid.

77
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,250
There was William Bud who wrote an
important book called typhoid fever.

78
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,970
It's nature,

79
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:31,090
mood mode of spreading and prevention in
1873 and you referred to the unchanging

80
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,140
specific nature of the disease.
Let's listen to what he said.

81
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:41,141
He said this to propagate itself and no
other and not on a series of indefinite

82
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:49,391
progressions constitutes the very essence
of the relation on which the idea of

83
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,030
species is founded.

84
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,590
How much this implies in
the animal and plant world.

85
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,620
We all know it is strange that what it
implies in the case of diseases should be

86
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:07,550
so seldom recognized until now

87
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,210
or there was Pierre.

88
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,210
But I to know who believed that there
were more bid seeds that caused special

89
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:21,551
diseases just as every seed and
the natural history that is,

90
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,410
it gives rise to a determined species.

91
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,980
And he applied that idea to
diptheria just saw as um,

92
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,960
apples don't turn into wheat.
Apple seeds into wheat,

93
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,370
so to uh,

94
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:42,371
and Dominik diarrhea doesn't
transform itself into Asiatic Cholera.

95
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,480
There was an important transitional
figure to Claude bed nod of the power

96
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:50,900
school.

97
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,900
One of its stars who lived from 1813 to
1878 and an 1865 wrote an important book

98
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:04,061
called an introduction to the study of
experimental medicine where he presented

99
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,820
a critique of the Paris school.

100
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,500
He argued that diseases
were dynamic processes.

101
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,560
They weren't static in the way that the
Paris idea of nosy optinose ology seem

102
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:19,220
to suggest.

103
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,360
And he argued the thing hospitals
displayed the end stages of diseases,

104
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,690
not their beginnings.

105
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,980
And he argued the hospitals and clinics
had an excess of variables that wasn't

106
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:41,450
helpful for the further
development of medical science.

107
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,700
So we proposed an alternative that
was embodied in his title that is

108
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:48,380
experimental medicine.

109
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,830
And by that he meant laboratory medicine.

110
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,580
So he is one of the people who suggest
a new epistemology from medicine,

111
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,590
which isn't the hospital ward,

112
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,620
but the lab where you can
have the experimental testing
of single variables in

113
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,920
controlled settings.

114
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,640
Here was a new source of medical knowledge

115
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,150
done there.
If not,

116
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:19,620
then provides conceptual preconditions.

117
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,080
There were also institutional ones.

118
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,860
And here I'm thinking of the rise of
the laboratory of the university that is

119
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,090
full time professional scientists,

120
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,900
research institutions and Germany leading
the way rather than friends in this

121
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:45,930
development.
There were also technological foundations.

122
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,080
It's impossible to think of the rise
of the germ theory of disease without

123
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,670
microscopy.

124
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,740
Okay.

125
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,740
And so it was indebted to Anton von Living
Hope who lived from 1632 to 1723 and

126
00:10:04,581 --> 00:10:06,770
develop the simple microscope.

127
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,170
And then in the 1820 [inaudible] and
thereafter there were major improvements.

128
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,360
The development of the compound
microscope and higher magnification,

129
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,280
the work of the Zeiss company
and the development of lenses.

130
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,230
There was also for a fourth precondition,

131
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,830
a lonely neglected pioneer,

132
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,760
and that was a Hungarian gynocologist
who lived in Vienna called Ignacio Filipe

133
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,443
Semmelweiss,

134
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,630
who's crucial idea would states from
the 1840s some advice noted that the

135
00:10:50,061 --> 00:10:55,061
infection rate in childbirth was
much lower on obstetrical wards,

136
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,110
where women were delivered by midwives
rather than on wards where they were

137
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:04,490
delivered by physicians.

138
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,100
The reason had nothing to do with
their training or relative degree of

139
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:11,870
benevolence and malevolence.

140
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,960
The point was that the physicians
were just returning from postmortem

141
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:23,291
examinations from autopsies after which
at that time they didn't wash their

142
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:25,814
hands.

143
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:31,430
And so they were transmitting disease
to their patients from autopsies.

144
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,130
There were performing
in an adjacent building.

145
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,820
So Semmelweis suspecting,
you know,

146
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,870
though he didn't know the mechanism
that this was the case established.

147
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:46,871
Elaborate handwashing rituals using a
chlorinated lime solution a little bit.

148
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:51,380
The first hand sanitizer we might say,

149
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,130
and he noted that mortality
plummeted from 20% to 1%.

150
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,080
Unfortunately,
his own career was not a happy one.

151
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,710
He was mocked by his colleagues as a
charlatan and was actually demoted in his

152
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,600
own hospital.

153
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,260
Well then there's a fifth precondition
and that's the development of the basic

154
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:21,370
sciences and it's hard to
imagine as we'll see in a minute,

155
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,690
the rival of the germ theory
without chemistry in particular.

156
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,130
The specific issue that gave rise
to the germ theory of disease was

157
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,180
fermentation.

158
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,810
And pastor after all was originally
a chemist who in the 1860s became a

159
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:46,230
biologist and we should not that
he wasn't a physician. This is, um,

160
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,980
to introduce you to Louie pastor.

161
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,870
The immediate background to the germ
theory of disease involved the dominant

162
00:12:58,151 --> 00:12:59,830
theory of the day,

163
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,280
which was called design
Monique theory of disease.

164
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,020
That is that it was a form of ferment.

165
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,370
A little bit like Patton
coffer had asserted caused
by some fermentation of dirt

166
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,680
or gang or sorry,

167
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:22,681
decaying organic material under the
right conditions of soil temperature and

168
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:24,580
moisture.

169
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,810
This fermentation would give off
a poison into the environment.

170
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,010
Also quite widespread was the idea of
spontaneous generation that diseases arose

171
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,120
somehow spontaneously in a particular
locality weren't brought in or imported

172
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,980
from the outside.
There was a famous experiments,

173
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,020
um, about this from the
eight s the 17th century.

174
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,050
It was radius maggot experiment.

175
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,170
The idea was that if you could have
rotting meat and you could cover it,

176
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,890
you wouldn't develop maggots,

177
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,010
but if you didn't cover it,
uh,

178
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,800
then you would find that it
was fill it full of maggots.

179
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,890
So the maggots didn't appear in
the rotting meat by some internal,

180
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,650
um,

181
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,480
mechanism of spontaneous generation
but were imported from outside.

182
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,880
And pastors we'll see in a minute,

183
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,910
takes up this very idea to the idea
that germs to like the maggots aren't

184
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,070
imported from outside.

185
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,040
The immediate issue for pastor
wasn't fact fermentation.

186
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,150
He began by studying the fermentation
of wine and beer and in particular their

187
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:50,410
spoilage.
At the time.

188
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,770
This was thought when he took up
his work to be a chemical process.

189
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,600
And remember that pastor was not a
physician but a chemist originally.

190
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,010
Well,

191
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:06,010
what he did was to discover that the
fermentation was caused instead by living

192
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,010
microorganisms,

193
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,240
bacteria that he identified
through the microscope.

194
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,260
Now this was a high profile investigation
in the 1860s for the simple reason,

195
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,230
there's a production of wine and beer
involved to a Francis major economic

196
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:30,920
activities,
no poster.

197
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,080
And this was part of his genius,

198
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,920
immediately made a far
reaching connection.

199
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,170
And his estimate,

200
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,350
the fermentation that he saw in wine
and beer now caused by bacteria was

201
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:50,021
analogous to putrefaction
and infection in wounds,

202
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,440
for example.

203
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:57,130
So we began to regard no disease as a
process involving microorganisms living

204
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,103
things.

205
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,100
This was work that posture conducted in
the late 1850s and 1860s and it marked

206
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,210
the first transformation in his career
from that of a chemist into a biologist

207
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
or we might say today a microbiologist.

208
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,780
He examined not only wine and beer,

209
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:25,781
he then turned his attention to milk
and it's souring and he wrote a book on

210
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:27,710
that.

211
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,710
And then a study on wine and a study
on beer now of great importance was the

212
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:38,981
fact that pastors discovery that
abnormal fermentation leads to spoilage.

213
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,050
Along with that one to
another discovery he made,

214
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,320
which was that this process
could be controlled by heat.

215
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,240
Okay.

216
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Here was a major public health
discovery and the led to the process.

217
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,280
We now know as pasteurization,

218
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,150
so already in the 1860s pastor
was busily transforming biology.

219
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,940
Even if how do you stop?

220
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:12,941
Then his discoveries were already those
of a fully productive life's work,

221
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,280
but then in the 1860s came return
imposters interests from biology more

222
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:28,001
specifically to medicine and public
health and he began to study spontaneous

223
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,910
generation.
Now,

224
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:37,911
followers of pastor believed instead in
biogenesis with regard to call a road

225
00:17:42,091 --> 00:17:46,920
that we already set examined.
What about which there was a debate?

226
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,760
The idea was that cholera
was imported from outside.

227
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,050
It didn't arise spontaneously.

228
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,110
It wasn't the transformation of some
other disease that already existed into

229
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,430
cholera.
Rather,

230
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:07,490
it was a specific disease that could
not arise as a heightened form of a

231
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:09,930
preexisting condition.

232
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,670
Posture also devised and well,

233
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:17,040
caulk didn't think this was so elegant,

234
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,600
but it certainly convinced pastor and
his followers of famous swan neck flask

235
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,760
experiment that is he sterilite a flask
with a swan's neck and found that if the

236
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:36,381
culture is boiled and the flask
prevents air from gaining access to it,

237
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:43,310
then there was no development inside of
organisms that we would call bacteria.

238
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,520
A culture of them could grow in the
flask only if germs were allowed to enter

239
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:50,724
it,

240
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:56,100
but if the neck of the flask is
broken and errors admitted, um,

241
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,710
you can see the neck
broken out the bottom,

242
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,240
then you get a luxurious development of
life and this has enormous implications

243
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,230
for diseases and wounds.
Pastor wrote simply,

244
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,860
there is no known circumstance in which
it can be confirmed that microscopic

245
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:23,160
beings came into the world without germs,

246
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,060
without parents similar to themselves.

247
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,830
Now postures success was partly based on
the fact that he was aware of the full

248
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:39,921
range of the scientific implications
of his work and he selected carefully

249
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:43,050
topics with high profile,

250
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,140
philosophical and biological interest.

251
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,440
He was an expert at cultivating the media.

252
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,370
That was one reason that spontaneous
generation had led to so much excitement,

253
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,620
but most decisive imposters work was
what he did in the 1870s as he turned to

254
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:11,211
diseases demonstrating the
full implications of his
ideas on fermentation in the

255
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,670
previous decade.

256
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,670
This new phase of discovery dispute
occurred despite the fact that in 1868 he

257
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:26,871
suffered a major cerebral hemorrhage
that left him paralyzed on his left side.

258
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,010
Now, what did pastor doing the
1870s that was so crucial? Well,

259
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:33,090
first of all,

260
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,320
I'll look at two major things that he did.

261
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,970
One is work with silk worms and
the other is work with chicken,

262
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:45,060
cholera and anthrax.
Uh,

263
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:49,660
the first thing was a major contribution
to the germ theory of disease

264
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,720
accomplished by the work with an
unexpected experimental animal.

265
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,600
That is the silkworm.
And again,

266
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:02,710
let's look at the fact
that fosters success.

267
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,770
His influence and his genius was in part
the fact that he took on really high

268
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,390
profile research topics.

269
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,350
That is to say disease of silk
worms were these diseases.

270
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:21,991
We're decimating one of France's leading
industries that is silk through a

271
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:28,041
meticulous and painstaking research
posture demonstrated that there were two

272
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:33,481
major diseases at work
affecting Frances silkworms.

273
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,060
He called them play bean and flushed it.

274
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,870
You need to remember them for our purposes
and asserted that both were specific

275
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:49,561
diseases caused by bacteria
and he immediately realized
that there were enormous

276
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:56,020
implications not only for silkworms
but for human beings as well.

277
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:01,170
He isolated then to germs affecting
silkworms and demonstrated that they were

278
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:07,090
responsible for specific
contagious diseases.

279
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,140
Pastor isolated a germ and convincingly
linked it with a specific disease and

280
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:19,891
the concept of specificity was at the
basis then of the whole idea of the germ

281
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:23,290
theory of disease.
Now you know,

282
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,740
pastor didn't invent
the idea of contagion.

283
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,630
You've seen it with Frauca steroidal,

284
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,040
you've seen it in John Snow who talked
about the possibility of animal qls and

285
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:41,110
there were other scientists, Kazimir de
Vein and France, the English physician,

286
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,430
John Sanderson,

287
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,490
who were also advancing a hypothesis that
they were finding microscope microbes

288
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:54,090
with their microscopes and hypothesizing
that they might be the agents of

289
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:54,964
disease,

290
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,600
but pastor was the first to provide a
demonstration and a specific case proving

291
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,320
that microbes were the causative agents
of specific diseases and he provided a

292
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:13,621
methodology for further experimentation
and discovery poster then turn from

293
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:20,320
silkworms two diseases,
the diseases of chicken,

294
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:22,300
cholera and anthrax.

295
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,450
Neither is responsible for extensive
human disease as both are causes of

296
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:31,060
diseases of animals.

297
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,390
But what was critical was the process
is work on anthrax help to establish a

298
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:42,871
model for investigating
infectious diseases and
establishing the claims for the

299
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:48,680
germ theory of and putting
that on solid foundation.

300
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,320
At the same time,
he made another major development.

301
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,810
His vision went beyond simply
demonstrating the germ theory,

302
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,660
although he did that.
In addition,

303
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:07,661
he developed a public health
practice that is vaccination,

304
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,660
which had been pioneered a hundred years
before and he helped now to found the

305
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:18,050
discipline of experimental immunology.
Now let's,

306
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:21,620
we've seen vaccination and
the work of Edward Jenner.

307
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,740
Let's define vaccination is the
introduction into the bonding

308
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,250
of either the whole or part of a disease
causing microorganism in order to teach

309
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:40,331
the immune system to attack that same
organism should it reappear in the body

310
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,940
through natural processes?

311
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,200
The mechanism is that the vaccine primes
the immune system to produce antibodies

312
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,950
or teachers and mean immune cells to
recognize and attack the organism that we

313
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:01,640
now know perhaps to be a virus,
a bacterium,

314
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,550
or a parasite of a different kind.

315
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,460
The problem of course,

316
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,440
was how to stimulate immunity
without causing disease.

317
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,670
Jenner benefited from the crossover
immunity from cow pox to smallpox.

318
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,160
Posture did something else.

319
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,850
He used the concept of attenuation

320
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,460
genders, the father of
immunology in a sense poster,

321
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:34,280
the founder of experimental immunology.

322
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:39,370
The idea he had was that live pathogens
could be introduced in the body,

323
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,970
but only after being treated in some way.

324
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,920
Heat for example,
or passage through a different host.

325
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:53,921
First was another in such a way then
that there are varying lengths is

326
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:54,920
diminished,

327
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,820
then they'll stimulate the immune
response without causing disease at all or

328
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:03,440
only a mild disease.

329
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,660
This discovery was made during his work
with the bacterium that causes chicken.

330
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:12,110
Cholera made sort of by chance,

331
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:14,000
serendipity player to roll.

332
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,120
He left a batch of bacteria untouched for
a week or so while he went on vacation

333
00:26:20,691 --> 00:26:24,110
during the hot summer months on returning.

334
00:26:24,111 --> 00:26:29,111
He found initially to his frustration
that the culture no longer produce the

335
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:34,220
disease when he attempted
to infect other chickens,

336
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,180
so he got a fresh batch of bacterium and
injected the same chickens with it as

337
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:45,971
well as a lot of new chickens and made
a surprising discovery that the original

338
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,430
chickens injected with the old vaccine
remained healthy and our terms,

339
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,940
they were immune.

340
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,250
While the new and previously
untreated chickens sickened and died.

341
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,570
He repeated the experiment several times
with the same results and concluded

342
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,630
that the summer heat had
changed or attenuated.

343
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,750
The culture of the bacterium.

344
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,590
Later techniques expanded the repertoire,

345
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,790
demonstrating that he could kill vaccines.

346
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,190
Have chicken cholera but
still induce immunity.

347
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,850
There were other vaccines that could
employ live but attenuated bacteria or

348
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:32,970
viruses.
Some used killed microorganisms,

349
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:38,030
some Muse subunit vaccines and the
processes of attenuation or not only heat,

350
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:44,391
but let's say for polio could be the
passage through formaldehyde and various,

351
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,300
there are other means attenuation though
what's critical to the development of

352
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:53,070
vaccine as a public health strategy.

353
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,200
But let's return to pastor having
discovered attenuation with chicken.

354
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:03,201
Cholera pastor applied the same principle
to the different disease of anthrax.

355
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,680
The passage and responsible
was the bacillus [inaudible]
that had recently been

356
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:14,190
isolated by Robert Call
and if you see the film,

357
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,960
the story of Louie Pastor,

358
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,110
you'll see what he did in
1881 with the bacterium.

359
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,670
In a famous experiment,

360
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:29,060
he vaccinated 24 sheep
within an attenuated that is
heated bacterium after which

361
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:36,621
he challenged the original 24 sheet
with live unattended weighted anthrax

362
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,350
injections as well as 24 control
sheep that had not been vaccinated.

363
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,020
The vaccinated sheep remained healthy,

364
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,870
the non-vaccinated all died.

365
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:55,070
Then came the 1880s and pastor turned
to another high profile disease and that

366
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:58,140
is rabies.

367
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,700
Having discovered attenuation
by heat with chicken,

368
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:07,701
cholera and anthrax pastor extended the
principle of attenuation by other means.

369
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,490
This involved further famous experiments.
Rabies,

370
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,970
as it turns out,
was not another bacterial disease,

371
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,510
but a disease caused by what
we now know to be a virus.

372
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,190
In this case,

373
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:28,250
he attenuated the virus by isolating it
from foxes and then passing it through

374
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,530
an unnatural host of a different species.
In this case,

375
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,483
the rabbit,

376
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,720
so passing the virus through
a series of rabbit bodies,

377
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,990
he succeeded in a variant that would no
longer caused the infection and foxes,

378
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,970
but which serve to protect against
the natural occurring rabies.

379
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,590
Rabies was not a high impact disease
in terms of numbers of people.

380
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,490
It affected,

381
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,580
but it was a disease of high drama
and one that was then and still is

382
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,450
universally fatal.

383
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,650
So it was ideal for
attracting media attention.

384
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,790
The great human trial occurred in July,

385
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,780
1885 with the famous case of the
nine year old boy, Joseph Meister,

386
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,590
who had been severely bitten by a rabid
dog and was thought to be certain to die

387
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,970
an agonizing death,

388
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:34,140
but taking advantage of the
incubation period for rabies posture,

389
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:38,410
vaccinated the boy with his
attenuated rabies virus.

390
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,330
Joseph meister survived and
became a celebrity patient.

391
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,840
The first person ever known to survive
after being severely writ bitten by a

392
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:50,260
rabid animal.

393
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,300
And my store remained loyal for
the rest of his life to pastor.

394
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,720
He returned as an adult to parish to
work as a gatekeeper at the posture

395
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:04,510
institute. We're posture and
self was buried in the crypt.

396
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,250
The Apocryphal story,
I won't assert it's true.

397
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,950
The story is that he was killed in
1940 as an elderly men when he tried to

398
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:19,630
prevent occupying German troops
from desecrating postures grave,

399
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,240
the grave of the natural icon
national icon of an enemy power.

400
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,330
We're slightly less poignant,

401
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:33,331
but better documented narrative is that
he committed suicide in despair at the

402
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:38,260
German occupation. Well,
the Posture Institute,

403
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,060
um,
that's the vaccination of Joseph Meister.

404
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,010
It's not pastor doing the actual
vaccination because as I said,

405
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,300
he wasn't a physician.

406
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,040
And this is the posture institute founded
in 1887 with Louis posture himself.

407
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,200
It's its first director committed to
biomedical research and Paris and to a

408
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:09,400
series of satellites,
institutes elsewhere in the world.

409
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,580
It followed the public health strategy
of vaccination pioneered by pastor and

410
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:20,881
now by gender and now consolidated by
pastor the founding of this institute.

411
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:28,021
You'll notice size unimposing nature
gives us the opportunity to noting note in

412
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:34,120
passing another aspect of
19th and 20th century science,

413
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:39,840
the way in which it became a focal point
for competing nationalisms and a way

414
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:45,221
familiar to us from the
Cold War competition between
the US and the u s a star.

415
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,300
In any case,

416
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,360
there is a clear case in the 19th century
with the rivalry between Louie pastor

417
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,390
and Robert call the embodiments and icons
of French and German medical science

418
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,260
of to hostile national powers.

419
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,880
The Pasta in institute in Paris rivaled
the caulk institute in Berlin and that

420
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:16,020
brings us, uh, we'll also note
the crypt where a pastor, uh,

421
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:19,940
is buried. There's a kind of, um,

422
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,720
what should I say,
a worship of posture almost

423
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,920
and of French medical science.

424
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,100
But let's move on to Robert Caulk
who lived from 1843 to 1910.

425
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,240
The second great figure in
the establishment of the
germ theory of disease.

426
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,380
The German scientist who was
20 years younger than pastor.

427
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Now if pastors hallmark
was the imaginative Breck
to his scientific vision,

428
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,730
caulks distinctive feature,
which is scientific rigor,

429
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,110
is more rigorous
techniques of microbiology.

430
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:09,070
He had to critique a famous critique
of the whole swan flask experiment.

431
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,320
He argued that pastor had been lucky
because Penn town in the nation was

432
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:18,740
possible.

433
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:24,910
He developed the plate technique using
the petri dish and solid culture and he

434
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:29,480
developed staining
techniques for microscopy.

435
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:34,100
Would I'd particularly like
you to note is his methodology,

436
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,520
which he embodied in,
uh,

437
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,590
what are called Koch's postulates.

438
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,490
This was the methodology for determining
that a suspected microbe is the

439
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:50,510
causative agent of a particular disease.
He said,

440
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:53,700
you could know this under four conditions.
First,

441
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,710
the organism suspected as a pathogen must
be found in all animals suffering from

442
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:02,540
the disease.
In other words,

443
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:07,630
it has to be universally present where
the disease is present and then the

444
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:13,151
organism must be isolated from a
diseased animal and grown in culture.

445
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,280
Third,

446
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,280
the cultured organism must cause the
disease when introduced into a healthy

447
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:25,130
animal.
And lastly,

448
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:30,370
the organism must be re isolated from
the experimentally infected animal.

449
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:36,970
Now these postulates are some of the most
famous in medical science and more the

450
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:45,111
model for establishing germs as
pathogens for other diseases,

451
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,100
no calls.

452
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,000
Microscopy had a number
of immediate implications.

453
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,860
His staining raised the idea
that if you could stain,

454
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,670
you could also have an
idea of magic bullets,

455
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,610
what later became antibiotics,

456
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,330
but core didn't pursue
that particular interest.

457
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:14,430
The other was this led
to reliable differential
diagnosis and therefore a more

458
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:18,490
properly based node Zala gene.

459
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,280
It could lead also to major public
health measures and ultimately to

460
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:26,440
developments in therapeutics.

461
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:31,890
It furthered the sanitary idea and
gave it a firm scientific basis and in

462
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,730
irrefutably proved the
raw truth of contagion,

463
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:44,181
aneurysm rather than anti
contagion aneurysm as patent
coffer learn to its cost,

464
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,520
but immediately there wasn't. It didn't
employ and I think we should not this,

465
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,660
the understanding of disease
did not immediately lead.

466
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:57,460
There's therapeutic advances.

467
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Remember what happened in Naples during
the cholera of 1894 caulks idea was used

468
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,710
for a very negative therapeutic
method that is acid animus that were

469
00:37:11,951 --> 00:37:16,951
administered to patients well call also
moved forward on other diseases applying

470
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,920
the methods he had developed that pastor
had developed in the 1870s and applying

471
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,860
his own rigorous postulates in
1882 the most famous of all,

472
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:38,550
he isolated the bacterium
that causes tuberculosis.

473
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,500
The most,
um,

474
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,580
prevalent disease of the time.

475
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:52,630
The paper that cork presented in 1882 was
one of the most dramatic and important

476
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:55,400
moments in the history of medicine.

477
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,530
Tuberculosis was not feared
in the same way color was,

478
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,760
but it was unquestionably the
greatest killer of the 19th century.

479
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,360
And until 1882 it was shrouded in mystery.

480
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,990
Suddenly call cast a new shaft of life
revealing to the world that he and Rau

481
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,720
unraveled the entire
mystery of a TD ology.

482
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Then in 1883 he followed up this discovery
with another that was almost equally

483
00:38:26,781 --> 00:38:27,830
influential.

484
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:33,310
In 1883 he isolated the
vibrio cholerae call,

485
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,980
then had discovered and
demonstrated the role of pathogens,

486
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,820
the ones responsible for two of the
most prevalent and feared 19th century

487
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:49,870
diseases. This marked, as I said,

488
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,400
the definitive triumph of contagion.

489
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:57,401
Assam and the 1880s and nineties were
a golden age of microbiology with the

490
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:04,801
pathogens for being discomfort for
a whole range of other diseases.

491
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,890
This was an extraordinary
period and medical science.

492
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,750
The pathogens were discovered
for gonorrhea, bubonic plague,

493
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:19,270
dysentery, tetanus, the common
bacteria have wound infections,

494
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,140
staph infections and others.
The power of docs.

495
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:28,141
Of course there were still few benefits
for patients until the turn of the new

496
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:29,734
century.

497
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:36,450
The quip was made that
the main beneficiaries at
first of the germ theory of

498
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:40,210
disease work physicians
rather than patients,

499
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,080
but there was a major exception and
that was not in medicine but in surgery.

500
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:51,270
And this introduces the third major
figure of our trio establishing the germ

501
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:55,090
theory of disease.
And that's Joseph Lister,

502
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,690
who lived from 1827 to 1912 and made
his major contributions in Scotland.

503
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,200
He was professor of surgery at Edinboro
University where he was appalled by the

504
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:12,760
numbers of patients who died after
otherwise successful operations.

505
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:17,200
You know the old joke about the
operation being successful, just too bad,

506
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,840
the patient died well,

507
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,870
postures idea immediately struck him for
it's lifesaving practical implications.

508
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:31,360
That is he made practical use of postures,

509
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:36,361
discovery about the role of airborne
germs and causing wound infections in

510
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:38,650
surgery.
Now,

511
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:43,030
surgery before lister had
a number of major limits.

512
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,170
There was pain itself
and the need for speed.

513
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,810
There was blood loss and
there was septicemia.

514
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:57,750
The result was that the major body
cavities remained off limits the abdominal

515
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:01,930
cavity, the thoracic
cavity, the cranial cavity,

516
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,260
and there was a high rate
of death from infection.

517
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,970
The idea was thought by physicians at
the time that the infection was arose

518
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,530
through spontaneous
generation as tissue dot died,

519
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:22,710
they gave off toxins that caused infection
and saw infection was simply accepted

520
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,490
as inevitable.
Normal part of surgery.

521
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,440
Lister's surgical revolution occurred
with the work he published on the

522
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:38,441
antiseptic principle and the practice
of surgery in 1864 the implications of

523
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:44,240
postures work on fermentation without,

524
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,210
you could have an analogy.
If posture was right,

525
00:41:47,211 --> 00:41:52,211
there was no spontaneous generation and
airborne micro organism penetrated the

526
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:56,570
wound and caused infection or septicemia.

527
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:02,060
The remedy was to prevent the
penetration of the microorganism,

528
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,700
the idea of antisepsis.

529
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,590
So lister accepted postures,
insight that infections,

530
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:14,591
we're not a chemical reaction caused
by oxidation when air touched a wound.

531
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,550
Instead infection was the
result of contamination from
the outside of the wound

532
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,830
by microorganisms is solution.

533
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,720
We'll first was this the carbolic
spray device that he invented.

534
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,280
What you did was to spray
the air around the patient,

535
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,720
applying carbolic acid
also directly to the wound,

536
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,800
and lister also washed his hands before
operating and sterilized is interests.

537
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,940
Instruments. There's a stylized, uh,

538
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,950
idea of a lister type
surgical technique at work.

539
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:00,620
We'll, until listers, revolutionary
innovation surgery had been an emergency,

540
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:05,830
a treatment of last resort because of the
wound infection after 1866 it became a

541
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,050
normal procedure.

542
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,730
There were other innovations
as well that went with it.

543
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,630
His contemporaries improved on lister,
you'll see that here.

544
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,870
They aren't wearing masks
for example or gowns.

545
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,990
Those were introduced and gloves made
from vulcanized rubber were introduced in

546
00:43:26,511 --> 00:43:31,511
the 1890s but really became a part of
best practice only from about the time of

547
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:33,590
the first world war.

548
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:39,250
This also revolutionized obstetrics
with the conquest of poor pro fever with

549
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:43,610
hospital and clinical procedures.

550
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:47,030
Then we're transformed
by the antiseptic idea.

551
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,410
So by the 1890s,

552
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,740
you have the consolidation of the
germ theory of disease revolutionizing

553
00:43:57,171 --> 00:44:02,171
medicine and becoming accepted throughout
the international medical profession.

554
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,830
I'd like to mention a,

555
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,860
the impact also on culture
and this particular book,

556
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,710
um,
which is by Bram Stoker,

557
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,950
which is Dracula published
in 1897 that gives us,

558
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,050
I would argue,

559
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:30,940
expression and it really dramatic and
I just read it again and really scary.

560
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,800
I sure you, uh, uh,

561
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:39,801
idea of anxieties about infection.

562
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,210
Okay.

563
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,020
No.

564
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:48,020
Dracula is really for its
time a high tech novel and it,

565
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,720
you see all about the latest scientific
and medical inventions and ideas.

566
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,650
It contains the phonograph,
the telephone, stenography,

567
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,880
railroads,

568
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,180
the two wheeled bicycle and in medicine
it deals with the latest inventions in

569
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:10,500
psychiatry and blood transfusion,
infectious diseases.

570
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,100
And indeed I would argue it also involves
what was the cutting edge scientific

571
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,050
idea in Madison at the time,

572
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:24,230
the possibility of vector borne diseases
like malaria and full area it pre then

573
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:31,260
it's just at the time when we're
going to see tropical medicine.

574
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,320
We'll look at next time becomes the
cutting edge of late 19th century,

575
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,090
early 20th century medical science.

576
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,750
Now you know the drill about Dracula,
how Count Dracula,

577
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:46,800
the Word Dracula comes from
the Romanian word draw cool,

578
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:50,310
which means a devil, a little devil. Um,

579
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,440
and you know how he lived the count in a,

580
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,960
the evil count in Transylvania,
in Romania,

581
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,880
in the Carpathian mountains.

582
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,150
And the point and point is he is
traveling by ship from the Black Sea port

583
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:11,661
aboard a Russian vehicle through the
Mediterranean and up along the coast of

584
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:18,831
Spain and France work you lands by
ship and Britain at the port of Whitby.

585
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,640
Then he travels by train and
is transported by railroad
from Whitby to London.

586
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,780
Where his plan is to ravage
the huge population of London.

587
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,590
Now what does that remind you of?
Doesn't that reminds me?

588
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,680
I'm going to argue that Dracula
is many things in the literature.

589
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:48,230
You'll see that Dracula is a metaphor
and this has often said for repressed

590
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,270
sexuality in the Victorian era,

591
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,530
you'll find interpretations of it as
expressing also a repressed homoeroticism.

592
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:04,380
Okay?

593
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,850
In it we also find expression
of the battle of good and evil.

594
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:12,960
No, that's our friend, uh, Dracula.

595
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,780
And you'll see love never dies.

596
00:47:15,781 --> 00:47:20,781
The idea of this actual idea is clearly
some 200 films have been made of Dracula

597
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,950
and you can see clearly a possible
sexual ideas in films such as this and

598
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:33,550
they're clearly also here.
But what I want to argue,

599
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,890
it's what's been neglected so often,

600
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,780
and I think it's really important as
I want to argue the Dracula is also an

601
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:42,940
allegory of infectious disease,

602
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,060
not a specific disease,

603
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:51,180
but diseases like plague and cholera
that originated in eastern Europe and

604
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:56,521
traveled just as Dracula did by ship
and by railroad that they had count

605
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:02,080
Dracula's goal of ravaging
industrial cities,

606
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,930
huge population centers like London.

607
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:09,760
And it's interesting that the vampire
hunters in the novel are doctors,

608
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:15,330
physicians whose mission is to
destroy the invading the empire.

609
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,600
Also involved,
we see is the seasonality.

610
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:24,601
It's not by chance that Count
Dracula arrives in late August,

611
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,790
September, justice cholera
would have, or bubonic plague.

612
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,860
And we see miasma autism in the
novel, the flowers, the garlic,

613
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:35,950
the mis surrounding Dracula.

614
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,300
And I would argue that Dracula as
a composite of many infections,

615
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:42,610
here's the handsome count again,

616
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:47,800
and I'd like to show you one
more handsome picture of him. Um,

617
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,630
and that's not one.
Uh,

618
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:54,690
and I would argue that this clearly
makes me think also of a vector borne

619
00:48:55,661 --> 00:49:00,661
disease and possibly is this a million
miles removed from malaria and film area,

620
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:07,010
which we'll be talking about
next week. So I urge you, uh,

621
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,320
also to read Dracula.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
