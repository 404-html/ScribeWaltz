1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,040
Uh, what I want to do this
morning is first of all,

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:10,041
begin by recapitulating a couple
of points that we made last time.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,460
Uh, you'll recognize our friend here, um,

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,590
having her blood feast.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,010
And last time we talked about
the importance of malaria
in human history for a

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:27,450
little bit from ancient times
to the contemporary world.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,720
And we tried to suggest that malaria
contingent to impose an extraordinary

8
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,510
burden of suffering and death.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,410
And along with those consequences
that follow and it's trained poverty,

10
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,760
low productivity illiteracy,

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,160
a low level of political,

12
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,370
social and educational participation.

13
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,800
We also talked does,

14
00:00:55,801 --> 00:01:00,801
you'll remember about the transmission
of the disease with the complex life

15
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:05,190
cycle of plasmodium and an
awfully lean mosquitoes.

16
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,790
We talked about the effect of the disease
on the human body of the patient and

17
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,310
the symptoms that result from malaria.

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,970
And we tried to deal also with the great
years of discovery at the end of the

19
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:25,461
1890s between 1898 and 1901 when the
great mysteries of this disease or largely

20
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,650
unraveled in two different places.

21
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,010
First in India with the collaboration
of Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson,

22
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,280
they demonstrated the
mosquito of transmission of
malaria with regard to avian

23
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:46,170
malaria that is among birds.

24
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,230
And then the other place where the,
um,

25
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,830
even more importantly was Italy,

26
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:57,831
where Giovanni Battista Grassy and other
scientists have what was called the

27
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:03,561
Italian school or the room school proved
the mosquito theory of transmission for

28
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:05,940
human beings.

29
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,110
And I hope that in that discussion it was
apparent to all of you that malaria is

30
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:19,371
by far the most complex of
all the diseases that we've
studied or we'll study in

31
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:25,971
our course and not points important and
underlies the fact that we spent a lot

32
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:32,430
of time talking about the
complexity of the disease.

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,560
It's important because it helps us to
understand a great deal of the history.

34
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,790
One point is that if we understand that
we're in a position to understand also

35
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,440
why research on malaria generated such
intense intellectual excitement and the

36
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:57,561
1890s it was then that malaria ology
became the center piece for the medical

37
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:03,340
discipline of tropical medicine here.

38
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,340
What's one of the world's most oldest and
most important public health problems?

39
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,880
And suddenly it was yielding at secrets.

40
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,700
There was a tremendous excitement
intellectually and malaria.

41
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:23,701
Ology attracted some of the world's
leading scientists and public health

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
officials.

43
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,550
We also wanted to talk about
the complexity of malaria
because a second reason

44
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,110
is that it helps us to understand why
the public health strategies that we've

45
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:45,250
examined so far haven't worked
in dealing with malaria.

46
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,060
If we think, for example,
what are the main, uh,

47
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,620
public health strategies
that we've discussed so far?

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,530
One was plagued measures, you
know, the drill by now, sanitary,

49
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:03,010
cordons, quarantines, isolation.

50
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,440
These however,

51
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,470
proved to be powerless against a disease
that's born by vectors as efficient and

52
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:16,321
mobile as an awfully mosquitoes and
high malarial and Dennis city areas.

53
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,460
Mosquitoes are infinitely numerous and
infinitely mobile plagued measures would

54
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:26,170
be no help at all.

55
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,160
We can understand also why another
form of public health was useless.

56
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,710
The sanitary movement was irrelevant.

57
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,100
Malaria is not like cholera.

58
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,370
It's not a disease of filth or
the bacteria that thrive in it.

59
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Places that are immaculately clean can
be lethally infested with mosquitoes and

60
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:55,540
the plasmodium that they bear.
Furthermore,

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,020
malaria is a disease of rural areas.

62
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Primarily an urban cleanups
where therefore largely
irrelevant in combating it.

63
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,430
So a second strategy of public health
that we've confronted so far was powerless

64
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,080
in dealing with this disease.

65
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,310
Another public health strategy that
we've examined was the strategy of

66
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:25,561
vaccination and we've seen that pioneered
by Edward Jenner and developed much

67
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:28,720
more by Louie Pastor.

68
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,380
And this to thus far has proved
unavailing with regard to malaria.

69
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,940
Let's think for a moment about vaccines,

70
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,540
and I'd like to argue that
they're effective primarily
under certain conditions,

71
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,170
that they aren't universal
panaceas for all diseases.

72
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,670
They're helpful primarily,
first of all,

73
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,700
in combating diseases against the body
develops a robust acquired immunity.

74
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,120
Smallpox is a perfect example.

75
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,470
A patient who has once suffered from
smallpox but then recovers is then immune

76
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,330
for the rest of his or her life.

77
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,740
And so the strategy for vaccination
is to produce artificially the same

78
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,860
effective immune response that was
generated by the naturally occurring

79
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,520
infection.

80
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,760
The strategy then is to reproduce
what nature does on her own.

81
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,010
But in malaria,
the immune response of the body is limited

82
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,630
and it takes multiple infections and
recovery there from to inquire a partial

83
00:06:55,191 --> 00:07:00,020
immunity. And that immunity
even then is short lived.

84
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,090
It's partial and short lived.

85
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:06,470
If you have painfully acquired
an immunity for malaria,

86
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,530
and then you move away from the
malarial area in a couple of years,

87
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,820
your immunity, uh, fades away.

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,060
And if you return to the malarial area,

89
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,620
you're susceptible all over again.
So that's,

90
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,860
this is one factor that
makes vaccine development.

91
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,450
So very complicated.

92
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Another point about sin about vaccine
development is not vaccines haven't so far

93
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,820
been developed against a pathogen with
the lifecycle as complex as that of a

94
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,230
plasmodium

95
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,630
and targeting a virus or bacterium.

96
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,950
A vaccine is always dealing quite
simply with the virus or the bacteria.

97
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,710
But the point about studying,

98
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:05,711
one of the points about investigating
the lifecycle of the plasmodium is that

99
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:06,740
they're different.

100
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,260
They go through a series
of complicated life stages.

101
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,830
Sometimes they're sporozoites,

102
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,780
sometimes they're marazonal ice,
sometimes they're gametocytes.

103
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,940
And the problem with the vaccine
is that in order to be viable,

104
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,120
it has to be effective against all of
those phases in the life cycle of the

105
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:33,920
plasmodium.

106
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:38,660
And then also another feature as I said,

107
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,140
is that malaria is not a single disease.

108
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,150
It's a family of four
different parasitic diseases.

109
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,290
And the vaccine has to be
effective against not simply one,

110
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,310
but against numerous therefore,
um,

111
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,030
species of parasite.
Now,

112
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:05,031
I don't want to argue that therefore
the development of a vaccine against

113
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:10,530
malaria is impossible. In
fact, as we're speaking,

114
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,970
scientists are hard at work
trying to develop such a vaccine.

115
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,030
And indeed they have come
up with one the most sick.

116
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,690
You read some rather
silly things in the press.

117
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,020
The vaccine developers came up with
a vaccine in the last few years.

118
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,400
That's about 30% effective.
Uh,

119
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,140
I remember reading in places like
The New York Times that malaria would

120
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:41,340
therefore be eradicated
globally in five to seven years.

121
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:44,010
This sort of rather silly prediction.

122
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,810
And even the people I know because I've
talked to them who are developing the

123
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:52,860
vaccine,
have no such illusion about its efficacy.

124
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,860
They're thrilled because
it's 30% effective,

125
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,450
but that means that it's
70% not effective. Well,

126
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:05,451
in order to understand the evolution of
public health strategies against malaria

127
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,330
and the problem facing the world
today in dealing with this disease,

128
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,030
then we need to note that the
very complexity of malaria
has led to a wide array

129
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:23,691
of different strategies to combat it as
well as to an ongoing debate on which

130
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:31,131
course is likely to be most effective
and does yet there's no consensus in the

131
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:37,641
international health community on the
best and most effective strategy despite

132
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,780
the fact that since the turn of
the 20th century at the least,

133
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,110
malaria is a disease paradoxically that
has such extraordinary ravages on the

134
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:51,270
global population.

135
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,360
And yet paradoxically it's a disease
that's both treatable and preventable.

136
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,720
There is an amazing paradox this morning.

137
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:07,290
Then I want to talk about not the effects,
uh,

138
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,950
the nature of the plasma Modia
the nature of mosquitoes,

139
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,510
the life cycle or
symptomatology of malaria.

140
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,630
But I'd like to look instead
at the disease from the
societal point of view and

141
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:26,841
in particular on efforts to develop
a successful anti-mullerian strategy.

142
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,370
But developing a strategy or thinking
about the proper strategy against malaria

143
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,730
is easier if we think of a number of
how ways in which this disease might be

144
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:43,710
characterized,

145
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,900
the ways in which it has been
seen by leading scientists,

146
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,650
physicians and public health
officials who've dealt with it.

147
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,010
So I'm

148
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,440
wondering if we could think of malaria,

149
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,530
we might ask a number
of questions about it.

150
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,070
How should we describe this disease?

151
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,450
Is it a disease of poverty?

152
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,350
And what's the evidence for that that
would entail dealing with an a particular

153
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:19,750
way that might be different
from other ways? Is it a,

154
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,810
and one of the leading World Malaria
Ologists in the early 20th century defined

155
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:30,430
malaria as a house disease?
In other words,

156
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,580
it's primarily defined by poor housing
conditions in which people are crowded,

157
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,060
uh, in order to work in
agricultural occupations.

158
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:45,210
And those houses are porous to insects
and it's in the House that the disease is

159
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:50,590
transmitted and both mosquitoes
and human beings are infected,

160
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,920
or should we see it instead
as an occupational disease.

161
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,640
We've talked about the relationship of
malaria to agriculture and it's quite

162
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:10,051
clear that certain forms of agricultural
production create and generate high

163
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:17,941
risk for those who practice them and
malaria is contracted overwhelmingly by

164
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:24,541
people who work in fields under
certain conditions or should we?

165
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,930
Another way of thinking about it is,
and not case,

166
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,080
one way of attacking a malaria then
would be to have occupational improve the

167
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:39,811
conditions of farming of agriculture to
regulate rice fields and all the rest of

168
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:45,160
it. That would be what you
would do perhaps if you
define it as an occupational

169
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:46,000
disease,

170
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,740
should we think of it instead
as an environmental disease,

171
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,160
that it's a disease that flourishes work.

172
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,020
The environment has been degraded
where there's been deforestation,

173
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,160
for example,

174
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,520
where the hydrology of
rivers has been undermined,

175
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,360
where there's flooding of places where
there are swamps and impounded water.

176
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,920
In that case,

177
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,750
the way of dealing with malaria you might
think might be to have land drainage

178
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,810
reclamation,
environmental sanitation,

179
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,460
quite a different strategy
for dealing with the disease.

180
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,510
What should we call this
particular disease is in an
endemic disease or is it an

181
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:38,560
epidemic disease?
And here.

182
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:43,561
I think that the malaria is one of those
diseases that we're studying in our

183
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,670
course.
That's actually both.

184
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,250
That is to say in a particular locality,

185
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,770
it is an endemic disease.

186
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,680
Uh,
for example,

187
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:02,510
if you were to go to the
tropical areas of Africa today,

188
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,090
malaria is present throughout the year.

189
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,120
It's highly even hyper endemic,

190
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,380
but it's also capable of
being an epidemic disease.

191
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,671
First of all,

192
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:21,671
that's easiest to see perhaps in temperate
zones where malaria has also been

193
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:27,401
prevalent because then it's seasonal
and you have the winter when,

194
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,570
uh, the diseases, it's too cold for
the plasmodium to be transmitted,

195
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,950
but you have an annual summer epidemic.
But in addition,

196
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,780
under certain conditions,

197
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,100
we would say that the epidemic
is intensified in conditions,

198
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:43,940
for example,

199
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,840
of years of exceptionally
heavy rainfall or uh,

200
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,290
in say in tropical Africa,

201
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,350
it becomes an epidemic disease when
something happens to the environment.

202
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,050
When there are complex emergencies like
warfare that cause or famine that causes

203
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:08,891
people to move in large numbers from
who or unlock immunity to move to areas

204
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,800
where the disease is prevalent.

205
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,460
So malaria can cause extraordinarily
intense epidemics against a background of

206
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:24,470
being also an endemic disease.

207
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,530
So I would like to argue and I will be
arguing in a moment that part of the

208
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,130
complexity of malaria and if
I were asked the question,

209
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:38,750
although you may want to disagree with
me because people are still arguing about

210
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,320
how one defines a malaria
and how one deals with it,

211
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,920
but I'd like to suggest that
perhaps it's all of those.

212
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,780
It's a disease of poverty.
This is part of its complexity,

213
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,130
its biological,
social and environmental complexity.

214
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,360
It is a disease of poverty.
It's also a house disease.

215
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,710
It's an occupational disease,
it's an environmental disease,

216
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,480
it's an endemic disease and it's
an epidemic disease as well.

217
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,870
Well,

218
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,870
what are the kinds of strategies that
have been deployed against this dreadful

219
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:17,840
disease?

220
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,160
One was since we now know that
it's transmitted by vectors,

221
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Ronald Ross who was one of the
people who won the Nobel prize,

222
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,860
in fact for establishing that
very idea developed very quickly.

223
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,300
The idea then if it's a disease that's
caused that soprano admitted by vectors,

224
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,890
perhaps the right course for dealing
with malaria is vector control,

225
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,090
kill mosquitoes by insecticides or
remove their breeding grounds by

226
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,650
environmental sanitation,

227
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,770
by dealing with an unregulated
hydrology of an area by land drainage,

228
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,510
by removing, um, uncovered water.

229
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,070
A different strategy would be to deal
with not the mosquito but with the

230
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:24,240
plasmodium.
And so there have been,

231
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,420
and here I've talked about the Italian
School of Malaria Ologie and Giovanni

232
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,610
Battista Ganassi um,

233
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,820
had the idea that you would be able to
eradicate malaria by the use of anti

234
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:45,510
plasmodium, uh, that is Quinine,

235
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,470
one of the first effective magic bullets.

236
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,590
He thought the idea was that if we know
what causes malaria and we're is an

237
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:58,080
effective treatment for it,

238
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:03,410
if you can use it prophylactically to
prevent people from being infected for a

239
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:07,860
number of seasons in a
particular geographical area,

240
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,480
or if you can destroy the plasmodium,

241
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,940
the bloodstreams of all of the sufferers,

242
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,030
then you can prevent mosquitoes from
being infected for the following year.

243
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,870
And if you do that for several seasons,

244
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:30,110
then you could break the cycle of
transmission and eradicate malaria.

245
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,840
And both of the people who discovered
the mosquito theory of transmission very

246
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:41,550
quickly came to the idea
of malarial eradication.

247
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Ross did so and Grossey immediately
thought that malaria had what he called,

248
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,000
um, feet. It was the
colossus with feet of clay.

249
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,690
And that ply nine would be the instrument
that would enable the world to around

250
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:00,804
a kid.

251
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,760
But if you think of it
as a disease of poverty,

252
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,140
you might think instead and a disease
of housing and an occupational disease,

253
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,640
then you might think of a different
strategy of social uplift.

254
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,180
That what you need to do to deal with
malaria is to practice social medicine,

255
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,930
to deal with poor diet,
poor wages,

256
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,820
child labor,
um,

257
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,710
those whole series of
complex factors that have,

258
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,740
that create the substratum
in which malaria thrives.

259
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,720
And then there is another
strategy which is quite common.

260
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,230
Uh, Lee thought of it has
not made much progress,

261
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:55,210
at least today. So who knows,
maybe it will in the future.

262
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,330
And that's the gender postural Ian
Strategy of hoping to develop an effective

263
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,630
anti malarial vaccine.

264
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,930
So a vaccine development is one of the
great hopes in the anti malarial struggle

265
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,210
and um,

266
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,360
enormous amounts of resources
are being invested in Vacs,

267
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:24,490
anti malarial vaccine
development as we speak.

268
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,440
Well, I want to give an
example of a particular place.

269
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:32,500
It's the one you're reading
about this week. Um,

270
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,570
which was the impact of malaria
on a particular country.

271
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,500
And I've chosen Italy
for particular reasons.

272
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,840
One is not, Italy had a special
relationship to malaria.

273
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:52,650
It was the only European western European
country where it wasn't a colonial

274
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:54,640
issue,

275
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,640
but rather the most important
domestic public health problem.

276
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:06,930
It was also the international center of
Malaria Ology from about 1900 and till

277
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,930
the Second World War.
In other words,

278
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:18,931
we've talked about the hegemony of Paris
in international medicine in the early

279
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,150
19th century,

280
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:27,151
down to the middle of the 19th century
in the smaller domain of malaria.

281
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:33,391
Ology Italy was the center of the
action from 1900 until World War Two.

282
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,520
This is the place where people went
to be trained in malaria ecology.

283
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,620
It was people traveled,

284
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,300
physicians from all over the
world to study with those who,

285
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:54,160
people who were called the Rome school
or the Italian School of malaria,

286
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:57,910
Ology Giovanni Battista Glossy,
most prominent,

287
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:02,760
but other names were extremely
prominent also like Angelo Chelsie.

288
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,320
And we could list a
whole series of others.

289
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:10,410
And it was Italians primarily who were
responsible for unraveling the mysteries

290
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,030
of malaria. Um, and finally,

291
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,320
Italy was a place that did
something quite extraordinary.

292
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,410
It was the first place to have a
successful strategy of anti-malarial

293
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,690
campaigning.
In other words,

294
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:36,810
a campaign began in 1900 and was
successful in eradicating malaria by 1962.

295
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,950
The last indigenous case of malaria
in Italy was in Sicily in 1962.

296
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,730
So this means that Italy has lessons and
there are not many places where there

297
00:23:55,491 --> 00:24:00,491
have been campaigns that have succeeded
when intentionally in eradicating the

298
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:02,384
disease.

299
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,450
So this leads to a message of hope.

300
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,400
What can be accomplished by doing it.

301
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,490
And it also means that I think it's
useful to look at this successful campaign

302
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,260
in order to draw lessons from it.

303
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,670
But to be aware also of
the misuse of history,

304
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,790
because a lot of what I think are the
wrong lessons have also been drawn from

305
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:31,730
it. Well, in any case,
let's look just very,

306
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:35,690
very quickly at the Italian experience.
As you know,

307
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,750
Italy was United in the middle of the
19th century and by the 1880s they're what

308
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:45,380
they became the new rich liberal regime,

309
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,300
became aware of the prevalence of
the disease throughout the country.

310
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,390
And this is the map that was not the
best map artistically or even in terms of

311
00:24:56,631 --> 00:25:00,890
clarity or I would even
say in terms of accuracy.

312
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,690
And so you're wondering why do I show
you this map of malaria in Italy when

313
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:09,140
they're actually better maps that
are more colorful and all the rest?

314
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,040
But this is for historians.

315
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,060
This is the important one because this
is the one that shook Italians up and

316
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:21,310
convinced them of the enormity
of the problem on their country.

317
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,080
And one of the things that's quite clear,

318
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,520
even in looking at this map is that
malaria was present everywhere.

319
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:31,610
Virtually. There are areas
that are yellow, pink,

320
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:35,860
and red of prominence or
extreme prominence, uh,

321
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,370
of malaria.

322
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:43,090
And it was the case also
that after unification,

323
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,160
instead of the problem unification seen
as a foundational moment for this new

324
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:50,660
regime that's supposed to deliver

325
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,060
economic betterment,
progress and also public health.

326
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,270
But instead the years at
the end of the 19th century,

327
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,620
see the malarial problem already intense,
getting worse,

328
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,080
worse because of things like
deforestation of the opera nines,

329
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,410
the railroad area era actually had a
devastating impact because it led to the

330
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,730
demand for trees to make the railroad
ties and the stations and all the rest and

331
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:30,431
therefore led to massive deforestation
and deregulation of the hydrology of the

332
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:36,170
entire peninsula,
which was turned topsy turvy.

333
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,350
It was also a time then of, um, uh,

334
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:47,351
of economic difficulties and crises
and malaria feeds on human misfortune.

335
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,860
And it did so in the late 19th
century. Well, in any case,

336
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,840
it'll be also provided. We've talked
about malaria as a housing disease.

337
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,960
I thought I'd just show you
a representative type of
peasant housing and even

338
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:09,870
down to the 1930s and forties.

339
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,160
And when you live in places
like this and a malarial area,

340
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,810
you're highly vulnerable be because this
is almost like being outdoors. In fact,

341
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:22,700
it's probably worse in terms
of mosquitoes. You're there.

342
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:27,790
It's entirely vulnerable
and open to flying in stacks
and having numerous people

343
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:31,230
sleeping in conditions like this,
uh,

344
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,370
helps to promote the disease
and transmission. Similarly,

345
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:39,990
we talked about it being an r uh,
an occupational disease.

346
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:45,110
It wasn't by chance that Italy is also
a place of rice fields and rice fields

347
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:50,811
are actually wonderful places for
mosquitoes and the rice workers were among

348
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:56,661
those people who are most vulnerable and
became symbolic as the victims of the

349
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:02,510
plasmodium. So in any case then, uh,

350
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,620
there was an epidemic and endemic
condition in Italy and Italy showed all of

351
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:13,470
those terrible consequences of
malaria that we've been talking about,

352
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,440
absenteeism in agriculture,

353
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,710
waste whole areas that weren't cultivated
because there were so dangerous and

354
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:27,891
those who did work on them sickened
and died an area of low productivity of

355
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:33,900
illiteracy,
the under development of civil society,

356
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,060
low participation in politics,
mass emigration.

357
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,950
And I would argue in deed that one of the
features of Italy is that we've talked

358
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:45,420
about north and south.

359
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:50,421
And I talked about agriculture being
a determinant of malaria and that the

360
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:55,461
global north had advanced forms of
agriculture that were intensive and not

361
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:59,880
conducive to malaria.
And the south,

362
00:28:59,881 --> 00:29:03,210
the global south had the opposite.
Well,

363
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:08,211
this was reproduced in a microcosm in
Italy in that the north of Italy was much

364
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:14,010
less, uh, vulnerable to malaria.

365
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,870
And the form of malaria was
the milder via vacs, malaria,

366
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,020
while the south of Italy was riddled
with malaria and it was malaria that was

367
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:30,591
predominantly falciparum that is the
most devastating and lethal form of the

368
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:36,810
disease. Well, the,

369
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,980
there was a time of great scientific
discoveries that we've talked about.

370
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,350
Oh,
this is a famous picture just to show you,

371
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,830
this is a pick painting called malaria.

372
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,510
And as you see it sort of like a PA
ta or a deposition from the cross.

373
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,460
And I think it conveys a,
in a moving emotional way,

374
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,670
the reaction of a society to
intense malarial transmission.

375
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,040
Uh, this is the prime minister
at the turn of the century.

376
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,070
Until the first world war under whom
the malaria anti malarial campaign gets

377
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:21,640
started.
And this is Giovanni Battista Canarsie.

378
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:26,641
I tried to show him last time who was
the person who proves the mosquito

379
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,620
transmission, uh, among human beings.

380
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,810
The leading representative of the room,
School of Malaria Ology,

381
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,440
uh, and his work was, we've
talked about institutions.

382
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:43,450
This is the Santo speedy to hospital
where he conducted his research because

383
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,190
there were an enormous,

384
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:49,000
almost unending supply
of malarial patients.

385
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,180
And it was here that he first successfully
infected human beings with malaria,

386
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,940
with the number of scientific experiments
that you might consider ethically

387
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:02,410
problematic.
But in any case,

388
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,560
there weren't our rules about such things.
Um,

389
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,650
at the turn of the 20th century,
well,

390
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,500
the pillars of the eradication program,

391
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,270
the pillar of it was
initially going to be quinine.

392
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,230
And so Italy passed a series of Quinine
laws from 1900 to 1907 with support from

393
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:26,830
the liberal prime minister.

394
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,950
And the idea was that you could kill
the plasmodium break the cycle of

395
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:35,110
transmission and eradicate the disease.

396
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:39,340
Grosse seek thought it would be merely
a matter of a few years. In fact,

397
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:44,341
it then turned out to be impossible to
eradicate the disease so easily that

398
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,900
people were not used to
contact with physicians.

399
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,170
There weren't, uh, there, there
wasn't access, in other words,

400
00:31:56,171 --> 00:32:01,120
to medical care distributing quinine,
which tremendously problematic.

401
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:06,180
It also has to be followed according to
a very complex regimen and it has to be

402
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:09,310
followed for months at a time.

403
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,110
And you can't get people to do that
unless they understand the disease.

404
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,340
And so it actually,

405
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:19,150
to have an effective anti
malarial program turned out,

406
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:23,710
you have also to deal with
poverty and with illiteracy,

407
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,390
which are the allies of the
mosquito and of malaria.

408
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,380
And so it was important to
teach people then it the,

409
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,490
a discipline of quinine
and the reasons for it.

410
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,150
So very quickly and,
and also health access was important.

411
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,160
And so new parts of the,

412
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,610
the program turned out to be,
um,

413
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,220
rural health stations.

414
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:54,250
It's expanding now beyond quinine
to include rural health stations,

415
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,260
education and rural schools.
In other words,

416
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,430
a whole plan plea of things that
we might call social medicine,

417
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,440
improved housing.

418
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,040
The actually Chelsie argues the trade
unions were powerful anti malarial tool

419
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,610
because they do help deliver better wages
and with that better diet and better

420
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:22,220
clothing and child labor laws.

421
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,340
And we know that children are particularly
susceptible to malaria and the

422
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:33,071
regulation of occupations that were
particularly dangerous such as working in

423
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:37,850
rice fields. Well, the results
of the liberal program,

424
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:42,800
which has expanded well
beyond distributing quinine.

425
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,640
And in other words,

426
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,640
it starts with the vision of a magic
bullet and moves very quickly to a whole

427
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:54,941
panoply of things that we
might for shorthand call
social uplift with have to do

428
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,500
with access to medical care,
improved housing,

429
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,830
civil liberties, education, um,

430
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,380
and all of those sorts of measures.

431
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,210
The results of the liberal program by
the eve of the first world war were a

432
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:14,300
massive decline in mortality at least,

433
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:19,750
but still the persistence of the
disease and then comes world war one,

434
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,580
which was an extraordinary
setback from malaria.

435
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,700
And I've talked about the way that
malaria is a disease that thrives on human

436
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:36,461
misfortune and there is no misfortune
that is better for malaria than war.

437
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:45,130
And I thought I would show you a few
paintings of the first world war to show

438
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:52,361
you the kinds of conditions that lead
in Italy that destroyed almost the first

439
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,161
15,

440
00:34:55,161 --> 00:35:00,161
16 years of anti malarial efforts and
created this huge explosion of epidemic

441
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:05,270
malaria during the first world war.

442
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,850
And this is a famous painter,

443
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,940
US sartorial is his name who was a
competent and the first world war,

444
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:18,140
but then was wounded and returned
to the front as a painter.

445
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,940
I are rather as a
photographer. And he did, uh,

446
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,980
he took photographs of the conditions
at the fighting front and then he did

447
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:29,870
paintings for,
from his photographs.

448
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,840
And these are some of the most impressive,

449
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,870
I think moving pictures of the sorts
of conditions you can see exactly how

450
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,410
mosquitoes would thrive and
conditions of this sort. Um,

451
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,250
this is not dead soldiers,

452
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,490
these are soldiers
bivouacking after a battle.

453
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,670
And I think you can imagine them being
from non malarial areas and not having

454
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:53,874
resistance.

455
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,910
And you can see that they are a wonderful
feast for an awfully big mosquitoes.

456
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,820
And the soldiers from non malarial
areas felt sick and died in enormous

457
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:05,970
measures.

458
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,920
Or we've talked about malaria
as a housing disease will also,

459
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,660
the destruction of housing
renders people vulnerable.

460
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,250
If you have to move into tenths or
into the open fields to Bivouac,

461
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,920
to move from area to area,

462
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,520
from cities to the rural
areas and all the rest of it,

463
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,550
you'll become extraordinarily vulnerable
and saw the destruction of housing and

464
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:34,770
the housing stock was extremely important.

465
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,860
So there was this tremendous upsurge
of malaria during the first world war,

466
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,070
after the first World War in
1922 we have a new regime,

467
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:51,420
um, and this was the fascist
regime of Benito Mussolini.

468
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,910
We won't talk about the,
uh,

469
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,910
conditions that brought
Molly Salini to power,

470
00:36:56,911 --> 00:37:01,230
but we now have a totalitarian
one party dictatorship,

471
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,760
the end of elections,
police, repression, violence,

472
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:10,850
the secret police and the foreign policy
of expansion to restore an umpire and

473
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:17,640
to pursue broad European
and African conquest.

474
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:22,440
By the end of the 1920s,

475
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,630
Mussolini is fully in power.

476
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,810
And he institutes some anti malarial
measures that became extremely famous and

477
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:35,370
he's often thought as the hero of the
Anti Malarial Movement because of what he

478
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,220
did in this area,
the Pontine Marsha's,

479
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,420
which is just outside of Rome.
And you'll be reading about that.

480
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,010
This was done however,

481
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:49,070
for political purposes more than for
medical ones because the point about the

482
00:37:50,161 --> 00:37:55,161
pontine marshes was not only a couple of
thousand people live there in 1930 and

483
00:37:56,701 --> 00:38:01,701
this became the height of the
regimes anti-mullerian measures,

484
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,160
which were to drain the swamps,

485
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,420
to build new housing
and to settle the land.

486
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,720
But it doesn't actually confront malaria
and the parts of Italy where the most

487
00:38:15,121 --> 00:38:18,780
numerous people were
getting ill and dying.

488
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,160
It was an enormous propaganda
effort, uh, to show,

489
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:26,100
to demonstrate a more than health,

490
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,420
the power of the regime that
most Salini could succeed,

491
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,950
where liberals had failed,

492
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,580
where the pope's had failed and the
sorts of measures that were undertaken.

493
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,300
This is the kinds of
conditions that he found. Uh,

494
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:45,130
the swamps conditions,
I guess I'm overdoing it,

495
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:48,040
but I'm showing you there was plenty
of water and there were plenty of

496
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:48,874
mosquitoes.

497
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,940
And it was estimated that you had an
80% chance of contracting malaria if you

498
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:59,590
spent a single night in
this area in the summer, um,

499
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,900
before the drainage of the swamps.
Well,

500
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:06,901
this is the construction of something
modestly called the Mussolini can know.

501
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:12,940
And we'll see. Also when
pumping stations, land drainage,

502
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,400
you see canals being constructed,

503
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,460
what are being raised to be a harmlessly
diverted to the sea went with it as

504
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:26,830
well. The distribution of Quinine,
I'm showing quinine being distributed,

505
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,873
um,

506
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,940
education and literacy and the
teaching about the mosquito theory of

507
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:36,130
transmission. All of
that was important. Um,

508
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,400
there we see a fascist boy scouts learning
about larva and their collection and

509
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:47,161
taking that information home to their
families was part of the idea here where

510
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:52,060
they're doing the same thing.
Um, there were Sanatoria, um,

511
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,710
and you'll see the improved housing.
These are sturdy houses.

512
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,660
They have screened windows and all the
rest of it you'll see screens going up on.

513
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,520
So this was really a
huge, huge project. Uh,

514
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:10,360
it also included things that weren't so,
uh,

515
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,070
the building of new cities suddenly
then an area that was a swamp,

516
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,690
you see modern cities going up,
the display of power is enormous.

517
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:22,270
So this was really an,
uh,

518
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:27,070
idea that had as much to do
with the power of the regime,

519
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,260
uh,
as with public health.

520
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:34,290
So I'm not saying that it's my view that
fascism is in fact bad for your health

521
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,210
rather than good for it.
Um,

522
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:41,310
here are some of the propaganda pictures
of the first peasant of Italy here

523
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,400
among his smiling happy
crowds and all the rest of it.

524
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,230
So this was used in that way.
Well then part of fascism,

525
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:50,651
however,

526
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:55,651
you can't understand it without its
impetus to expansion and to war.

527
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,910
And the Second World War again led to,
um,

528
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:06,010
a major destruction,
uh, and to devastation,

529
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:11,070
repeating even a worse scale what had
happened during the first world war.

530
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,990
So I won't talk about that.
I won't talk either.

531
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,140
And this morning about a war crime that
I do discuss in the book that we'll see

532
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,440
the use of malaria as an
instrument of bioterrorism.

533
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:34,380
But my theme this morning is what are the
tools for dealing with malaria and the

534
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:38,030
lessons that can be learned.

535
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,600
And so I'd like to look then with the
downfall of fascism and another terrible

536
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,380
upsurge of malaria during
the Second World War,

537
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:53,500
there is a campaign to eradicate
malaria that gets underway,

538
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,550
1945,

539
00:41:55,551 --> 00:42:00,551
1946 and succeeds by 1962 and
it's done with allied cooperation,

540
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,730
the leadership of, uh, with a, um,

541
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,080
of the Rockefeller Foundation
and money from this country.

542
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,320
And it involves the idea of that a
powerful new weapon to destroy mosquitoes,

543
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:23,130
a technological weapon, Ddt, uh,

544
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,360
was discovered during the war and is
now used as an instrument of powerful

545
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,470
insecticide, uh, to destroy malaria.

546
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,100
And this is thought in fact to be
and becomes a premise if we like.

547
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:47,020
The lesson is drawn that malaria was
eradicated in Italy after the use of DDT.

548
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,810
And so DDT is thought to be the
cause of the destruction of malaria,

549
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,090
the successful campaign.

550
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:04,040
And this becomes the premise
for an international campaign,

551
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:09,100
a global campaign of the World Health
Organization from 1955 until 1969 to use

552
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,300
DDT worldwide to eradicate
malaria globally.

553
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,960
And I want to argue that this is in fact
misleading because the wrong lessons

554
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,520
were drawn from what happened
in Italy and actual fact,

555
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:33,670
the eradication after World War Two was
possible in part because at Wa mark,

556
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,400
not only the use of DDT,

557
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:42,490
but it also meant a massive investment
of American aid to provide food,

558
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,630
clothing,

559
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,630
housing and employment that becomes first
UNRRA and then the Marshall aid plan.

560
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:56,350
And so there is an enormous campaign
to improve housing and conditions if

561
00:43:57,531 --> 00:44:02,090
people, in other words, there's a
massive social uplift if we like,

562
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,920
that's going along at the
same time as the use of DDT.

563
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,120
At the same time,

564
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:13,210
you have the reestablishment of healthcare
services and rural health stations

565
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,120
and the massive distribution of quinine
and anti an artificial quinine developed

566
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,310
during the war,
outer brin and chloroquine.

567
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,440
So it's not a simple unit
dimensional program that succeeds.

568
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,020
Uh,
and so by 1962,

569
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,750
Italy becomes malaria free.

570
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,020
And I think that's one of the factors
that led to the possibility of the

571
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:47,361
economic miracle and it'll
becoming after by our day,

572
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,890
the world's seventh industrial power.

573
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,980
So there's an amazing measure of hope of
what can be done when you auratic Kate

574
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:02,010
Malaria, you unleashed productivity
and the and development.

575
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,570
But in addition,

576
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,690
this example then becomes the basis for
the post World War Two program of global

577
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:17,751
eradication that believed that it would
be possible simply to have a panacea,

578
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,460
a technological intervention with DDT.

579
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:28,550
And this is an experiment that
by 1969 collapses and failure.

580
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:34,430
And I would like to argue that this ought
to lead us to enormous questions about

581
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:40,050
today's anti malarial program of
the World Health Organization,

582
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,640
rollback malaria.

583
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:45,120
And very often it's thought that vaccine,

584
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:50,121
that the development of using some
sort of magic bullet would be adequate.

585
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:56,270
And I want to argue that this was partly
based on a misunderstanding of the

586
00:45:56,971 --> 00:46:01,410
Italian lesson. And I think we're
dealing with in our own world,

587
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,850
the consequences of that
in the form now of, of,

588
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,540
uh,

589
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,540
either DDT or insecticide treated bed
nets as being the most useful instruments.

590
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,350
And I think the campaign is
having enormous difficulties.

591
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:24,530
And I think we need to think
about how we define this disease.

592
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,410
What are,
what is its substratum,

593
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:33,740
what conditions promoted and what kinds
of strategies are effective in combating

594
00:46:35,521 --> 00:46:37,650
it.
So thank you.
