1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,360
And so without more do, then we'll
turn to our topic of the morning,

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,660
which is about the first embodiment
of a rational scientific medicine,

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,830
which is rather an extraordinary one
because it lasts from the fifth century BC

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,750
down to the 19th century as a dominant,

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,700
not exclusive, but a dominant
medical scientific paradigm.

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,880
Now that was associated with,
uh,

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,890
this idea of the first
form of irrational secular,

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,550
naturalistic form of medicine with,

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,683
um,

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,690
ancient Greece in the fifth century and
in particular with the so called father

11
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:56,300
of medicine. And that's our figure,
whoops, who seems to have gone off. Ah,

12
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,830
there he is. Hippocrates, um,

13
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,760
who lived from about
four 60 to three 77 BC.

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,030
Now there's some debate about whether
he was one person or a school,

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,670
a group of people. There was, uh,

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,700
there is a corpus of hippocratic Craddick
writings that consists of about 60

17
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,190
works, perhaps by multiple
hands, but not issue,

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,050
won't really concern us.

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,290
We're concerned with Hippocrates as
either this composite or a single figure.

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,990
Uh, and with the various schools
that followed in his name.

21
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,330
Now the 60 works. Some of them
are very famous to you already.

22
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,420
You know about the hippocratic oath we'll
be talking about such other works on

23
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,590
as on the sacred disease on human nature,

24
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,150
epidemics on airs, waters, places,

25
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,810
and he also had a collection of aphorisms.

26
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,610
One would note the variety
of the hippocratic corpus.

27
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,630
It consists of a whole series
of things he invented. He,

28
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:16,860
they invented case histories
and they're included.

29
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,630
Their lecture notes,

30
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,870
their memory around a of
all sorts writings on every
form of medical practice at

31
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:30,840
the time, surgery, obstetrics,
diet, the environment,

32
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,030
therapeutics,
all of that.

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,090
It forms part of the hippocratic Corpus,

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,120
so enormous variety in terms of
what Hippocrates accomplished.

35
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,290
I'd like to make a contrast and that is
with the supernatural view of disease

36
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,520
and the first form we could think
of that and drawing our contrast,

37
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,790
the contrast to what
Hippocrates accomplished.

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,880
We can see it in terms of the breakthrough
from something that proceeded it and

39
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:12,040
went alongside it down to our own day.
And this would be first of all,

40
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,070
the supernatural view of disease that
epidemics and pestilence are divine

41
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:24,061
punishment sent by an angry
God for sin and disobedience.

42
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,460
You can see this and many parts of our
culture, it's embodied in the Bible.

43
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,040
For example,
in Genesis,

44
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:38,041
you know that Adam and eve lived happily
and enjoyed eternal life in the garden

45
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:44,671
of Eden until they committed the sin of
eating the forbidden tree of the fruit,

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,650
of knowledge, of good and
evil. And as a result,

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,940
this was original sin and they were
kicked out of the garden of Eden.

48
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,410
From then on, poor things
they had to work. Um,

49
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,750
they also became subject
to disease and to death.

50
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,460
They were in mortal until that time.

51
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,520
So we see in genesis the embodiment of
this idea that diseases are punishment of

52
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,890
sin.
This was also clear,

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,920
you can read further in the Bible and
the book of Exodus where you learn about

54
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:26,281
the bondage of the Israel lights in Egypt
and God asking through Moses and Aaron

55
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,740
for the Pharaoh to
release his chosen people.

56
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,160
But the Pharaoh's heart was hardened and
so the Egyptians were punished with the

57
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:43,300
series of terrible
plagues that are all in,

58
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,980
in exodus.

59
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:50,670
Another way of the embodiment
of this was in psalm 91.

60
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,980
And this is of particular importance
to us. And let's move to, um,

61
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,280
share this with you.
Um,

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,230
this is the text of a psalm 91.

63
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,710
This is particularly important because
it embodies the idea of plague and

64
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:14,320
pestilence as a punishment by God,

65
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,920
but also in terms of our
historical experience.

66
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,930
As you're reading Daniel Defoe,

67
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,050
you'll realize that it's psalm 91 that
was read out from the Christian churches

68
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,060
during times of epidemic.
This was the great plague Psalm.

69
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,150
It embodies hope and an interpretation
of what the experience of plague was all

70
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,980
a about. So let me read part
of it here. They'll show up,

71
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,720
not be afraid for the terror by night,

72
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,050
nor for the Arrow that flies by day,

73
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,170
nor for the pestilence
that Walketh in darkness,

74
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,430
nor for the destruction
that wastes at noonday.

75
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,730
1,000 shall fall at thy side
and 10,000 at thy right hand.

76
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,560
But it's shown not come Nivea only with
Thein eyes shall thou behold and see the

77
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:12,200
reward of the wicked because
thou hast made the Lord,

78
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,700
which is my refuge,
even the most high by habitation,

79
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,030
there shall no evil befall thee.

80
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,900
Neither shall any plague
come nigh thy dwelling.

81
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,680
So if you renounce sin,

82
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,300
the pestilence won't come near you.
Well,

83
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:36,410
let me turn also to another
embodiment and culture.

84
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:37,790
Our Western culture.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,350
And this is the opening scene
of Homer's Iliad, which is,

86
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:45,530
you know,
is all about the Trojan war.

87
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,510
And it begins just before this scene with,
uh,

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,370
Achilles anger.

89
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,710
That is to say Achilles was the
greatest of the Greek warriors.

90
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,980
But the Greek King Agamemnon had
taken his concubine for his own.

91
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,680
And as a result in raged Achilles withdrew
from combat and soaked in his tent.

92
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,080
Now he had a friend who was
a priest of the god Apollo.

93
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,410
And this friend tried to intervene and
besieged Agamemnon to right the wrong and

94
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:23,690
return the woman.

95
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,040
But Agamemnon rebuffed Apollos priest,

96
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,710
or as we might say,
he dissed him.

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And so what we have here is this
tremendous and terrifying scene at the

98
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,130
beginning of the Elliott.

99
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,990
So let me just quote from the
beginning then over and over,

100
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:49,991
the old man that is the priest prayed
as he walked in solitude to King Apollo,

101
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,970
hear me, Lord of the silver
bow bring to pass this wish.

102
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,020
I pray for,

103
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,150
let your hours make the Denay
ans pay for my tears shed.

104
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,720
So he spoken prayer and Phoebus Apollo
heard him and strode down along the

105
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:11,450
pinnacles of Olympus,
angered in his heart,

106
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,090
carrying across his shoulders,

107
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:19,210
the bow and the hooded quiver and the
shafts clasped on the soldier shoulders of

108
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:23,780
the God walking.
Angrily he came.

109
00:08:23,781 --> 00:08:28,781
Ms. Knight comes down and knelt down
apart and opposite the ships and let go.

110
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:34,280
And Arrow terrible was the
clash from the bow of silver.

111
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,880
First he went after the mules and
the circling hounds then let go,

112
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,270
uh, tearing Arrow against the
men themselves and struck them.

113
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,880
The corpse fires burned everywhere
and did not stop burning.

114
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,630
So that was Apollo punishing the on behalf
of his priest or let me also mention

115
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:04,620
something example that's more
recent and closer to home. That is,

116
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,290
I want to talk for a minute about a Yalie.

117
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,520
And this is our friend here,
John Humphrey,

118
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:16,521
noise of the 19th century who
was at the Yale divinity school.

119
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,040
And he read the pieces we've just talked
about and thought about disease as a

120
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:25,740
punishment for sin and decided,
well, there was a remedy.

121
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,110
And so in all modesty,

122
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:33,111
he and a group of his friends decided
that they were going to renounce sin all

123
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:38,281
together and they called themselves the
perfectionists and they founded an ideal

124
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,640
community, first in Putney, Vermont,

125
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,130
and then an Oneida in New York state.

126
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,160
It's part of the history of American
Utopian communities in which they renounce

127
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,350
sin. And we're going to live together, uh,

128
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,940
and harmony and peace forever as a people.

129
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:02,210
And every morning began with a mutual
criticism in which they pointed out each

130
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,300
other's faults. This must
have been a lot of fun, uh,

131
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,330
in order that they not fall by the
wayside and lops once again into sin.

132
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,720
Well,
I'm sorry to tell you,

133
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,260
this was the 1840
[inaudible] by the 1890s,

134
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:24,470
the ideal community had become instead
of joint stock company and you still have

135
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:27,990
Oneida pottery and silverware,

136
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,210
and I'm very sorry to report that all of
the members of the community have been

137
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:34,390
buried.
Uh,

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I don't know if that was because they
couldn't stick the pace or if the concept

139
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:43,690
was wrong from the
outset. In any case, uh,

140
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,720
this was an embodiment then of the idea
of disease as a punishment for sin.

141
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,030
But if we view this view of
pestilence as divine punishment,

142
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,540
it does at least imply
a log governed comms.

143
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:04,410
Mus Disease exists for
an intelligible reason,

144
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,940
and it implies a rational therapeutics,
which is repentance,

145
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
propitiation of God amendment of conduct,

146
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,090
and renewed obedience to the laws.

147
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,020
There's another variation
of a supernatural view,

148
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,640
which is more capricious.

149
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,570
And let's call that the
demonic theory of disease.

150
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,370
This pop stipulates that the
world is populated by powerful,

151
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:34,371
arbitrary and evil spirits who cause
disease through their Maniape influence.

152
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,940
These may be evil persons
such as witches or poisoners,

153
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,210
the disembodied spirits of the dead
super human beings or the devil himself.

154
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,320
We'll see this view throughout the course,

155
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,410
the idea that epidemic
diseases or diabolical plot,

156
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,380
not natural events.

157
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,560
There's some a colt secret crime
caused by the poisoning of witches or

158
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,450
scapegoats,

159
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,590
and this gives rise to witch hunts
to hunt down and punish the guilty.

160
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,130
We know this famously in the 17th
century and in our own country at Salem,

161
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:23,370
but the idea was clearly expressed in
Europe by Martin Luther who declared I

162
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:27,910
would have no pity on the witches.
I would burn the mall.

163
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,380
Alternatively,
that was a good therapeutic idea.

164
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,300
Alternatively,

165
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,460
a person could be deemed to be inhabited
or possessed by an evil spirit,

166
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,500
and in that case to cure was to
cast out the devil through exorcism.

167
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,250
And this cosmology survives
in our own language.

168
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:53,370
When we talked today about someone acting
like someone possessed or out of his

169
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:58,741
mind and healers pursuing these sorts
of ideas would invoke magic or have

170
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:04,840
incantations.
They'd prescribed special concoctions,

171
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,940
chance, sacred rites and
spells, and in European history,

172
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,060
and relatively recent illustration of
that idea was the idea of the healing

173
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:20,830
power of the royal tach. Charles,
the second of England, for example,

174
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,950
administered this treatment in the
17th century to about 100,000 people.

175
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,570
So healers could do that.
They could also recommend magic practices,

176
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,730
offerings and sacrifices,

177
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,970
magic charms to ward off the evil spell
where they could recommend escaping by

178
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:45,631
taking flight or invoking the power of
a powerful ally as in the Christian cult

179
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:51,990
of saints that we'll be talking
about later. So if you hold that up,

180
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,060
those two views then of supernatural
interpretations of disease,

181
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,610
then you can understand the breakthrough
that was made in fifth century Greece.

182
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,820
This was in contrast to the supernatural,

183
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:09,370
divine and demonic theories.

184
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,070
And that's in contrast to them that we
can see the importance of a new idea,

185
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,090
the idea that disease instead,

186
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:23,170
as a naturalistic event that can
be understood by natural causes.

187
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Examples of this new naturalistic secular
view abounded in the fifth century.

188
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,250
You can see it in through city ds and
his account of the Peloponnesian war,

189
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:41,370
the famous plague of Athens that may
have been typhus or more recently it was

190
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,360
thought to have been typhoid,

191
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,190
but in any case it was a natural event
and is described as such by through

192
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,790
cities with no reference to
the occult or the supernatural.

193
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:58,150
You can see it in Hippocrates discussion
on epidemics in which diseases epidemic

194
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,830
diseases are caused by a
corruption of the year.

195
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,430
But let me talk about this very famous
example and dramatic one of Hippocrates

196
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,860
on the sacred disease
by the sacred disease.

197
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,530
He meant epilepsy and it looks,

198
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:23,390
I guess if you wanted any disease that
looks like a possession by a demon,

199
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,420
it is epilepsy and Hippocrates wants to
tell us that this is not a supernatural

200
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:31,550
event or a possession.

201
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,720
He says instead something
extremely different. Uh,

202
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:39,290
what he tells us is that,
um,

203
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,930
it is thus with regard to
the disease called sacred,

204
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,170
it appears to me to be no wise,

205
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,470
more divine or sacred than other diseases,

206
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,880
but has a natural cause
like other afflictions,

207
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,120
men regard it's nature and cause as
divine from ignorance and wonder.

208
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,810
And this notion of its divinity is kept
up by their inability to comprehend it.

209
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Neither truly do I count it as a worthy
opinion to hold that the body of man is

210
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:21,510
polluted by God,
the most impure by the most holy for war,

211
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:22,970
the body defiled,

212
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,950
it would be likely to be purified
and sanctified rather than polluted.

213
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,670
Those who first referred
this malady to the gods,

214
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,780
you appear to me to have been just such
persons as the conjurers mount banks and

215
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:39,650
charlatans are such persons.

216
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:44,651
Then using the divinity as a pretext
and screen for their own inability to

217
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:49,730
afford assistance have given
out that the disease is sacred.

218
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,580
This was a very major
breakthrough conceptually,

219
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:00,620
the beginning of the foundation
of a scientific medicine.

220
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,850
So therapeutics then got rid in
a naturalistic view of chance,

221
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:13,250
potion spells and sacrifices and exorcism,

222
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,200
appeasement of the gods.

223
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,530
The importance of this momentous step in
human consciousness was expressed by a

224
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:25,460
Yale professor of
epidemiology in the 1940s,

225
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,280
Charles Edward Winslow who wrote,

226
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,100
and let me quote a
sentence or two from him.

227
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,520
If disease is postulated as
caused by gods demons or demons,

228
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,220
scientific progress is impossible.

229
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,270
If it is attributed to
hypothetical humors,

230
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,180
the theory can be tested and improved.

231
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,900
The conception of natural causation
was the essential first step.

232
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,400
It marks incomparably the most epochal
advance in the intellectual history of

233
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:03,450
mankind. That perhaps is
putting it a little strongly,

234
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:06,060
but you certainly get the point now,

235
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:11,061
why perhaps was there a
rational scientific medicine
in fifth century Greece

236
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,051
here?

237
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:18,051
I think the main part of the answer has
to be imponderable factors such as the

238
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:23,430
inspiration of Hippocrates
himself and his associates.

239
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,240
But there were influences we
could point to as important,

240
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,810
the absence of a priestly bureaucracy
with the power to sanction heretics.

241
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,570
Decentralized city states the
legacy of Greek natural philosophy,

242
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,100
um,

243
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,100
the work of Plato and Aristotle in
particular a culture of individualism.

244
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,780
And I think we also need to
remember that hippocratic position,

245
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:56,160
physicians, although they were
known to treat the poor and slaves,

246
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,750
their care was not buying
large available to the masses.

247
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,920
The primary clientele
consisted of educated,

248
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:09,120
prosperous elites in ancient
Greece and ancient Rome.

249
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,140
And this was a medical
philosophy that suited them.

250
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,890
The educated doctor and the educated
patient spoke the same language and the

251
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:22,140
therapies that the physician proposed,

252
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,410
such as a special diet or rest were
remedies the wealthy could afford.

253
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,390
Now, we should say that hippocratic
medicine is still with us.

254
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,230
We can see it in the return
to holistic medicine.

255
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,610
We can see it also in the Muslim world in,

256
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:46,611
you can still be treated in new noni
medicine by a hippocratic style medicine.

257
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,780
And you can see it in certain popular
cultural precepts such as the one feed a

258
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:59,010
cold and starve a fever. Well,
if that's it's important,

259
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,720
let's look at its content.

260
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,870
What was the content then of this first
embodiment of scientific medicine?

261
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,830
And it was humorous realism.
Here,

262
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,960
let's talk about what that is.

263
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,190
The fundamental assumption was that
there's a correspondence between the

264
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:24,531
macrocosm of the universe and the
microcosm of the Individual Bondi.

265
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,140
Both are composed of the same materials,

266
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:33,350
subject to the same laws and disorder
can occur in one and be followed by

267
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:36,570
disease in the body.

268
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,340
Now according to Aristotle
and natural philosophy,

269
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,980
the macrocosm consisted

270
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,530
of four elements that you can see here.
They were

271
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,250
earth, water, air and fire.

272
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,460
And each of the elements is associated
with four qualities which they can be dry

273
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:08,151
and hot like fire or dry and cold
or cold and wet or wet and hall.

274
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,480
So the elements embody also four qualities
in different proportions of course.

275
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,450
And this went on over the centuries
and there were four seasons,

276
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,960
four wins later on for evangelists.

277
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,140
But the point for us is there was also
a microcosm and one can see the theory

278
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:31,680
expounded on human,

279
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:36,681
on human nature in which there
are four humors which are blocked,

280
00:21:37,441 --> 00:21:41,840
bile, phlegm, phlegm,

281
00:21:41,841 --> 00:21:44,660
black bile,
yellow bile and blood.

282
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,360
And each of those also,
um,

283
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,730
the body is composed of these and each
has qualities of as being wet and cold or

284
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,060
hot and dry.
Uh,

285
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,790
this also determines the balance
of these humors in the body.

286
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,140
The four temperaments, whether
you're a melancholic, flameouts,

287
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,940
cleric or sanguine,

288
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,950
those words survive in our culture
there for ages of men, for principle,

289
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:19,790
organs of the body, the spleen,
the brain, the liver and heart.

290
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,890
You'll see the importance of four.

291
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,950
And the system is axiomatic.

292
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,630
It's based on deductive
reasoning from first principles.

293
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,220
Central of course,

294
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:36,221
to all of it was the climate of Greece
with its seasonal patterns and it's

295
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,360
specific patient population.

296
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Many were malarial victims with
the complications of pneumonia.

297
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,860
And Hippocrates indeed was the
world's first malaria. Ologist.

298
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,040
No health consisted what's
called you crazy, huh?

299
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,130
Which meant a balance or equal Librium
of the humors and therefore have the

300
00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:01,820
qualities and variations are possible.
Uh,

301
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,770
we're up to a certain threshold and at
various times in your life or from one

302
00:23:06,771 --> 00:23:11,300
person to another, the balance
among the four humors can change.

303
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,390
But once you cross a certain threshold
in variation that is one humor becomes

304
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,540
overly dominant or one humor is
lacking in sufficient supply.

305
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,600
That's an inbound.

306
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:29,601
Once that's dis crazier an
excess or deficiency of one
of the humors and that is

307
00:23:31,281 --> 00:23:34,780
disease.
So we know what diseases,

308
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,060
then it's an imbalance of the humors.

309
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:41,660
So note that there is no single,

310
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,990
that is to say there aren't discrete
individual diseases as in modern medicine

311
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,940
that is diseases classified as typhoid,
cancer,

312
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:54,560
pneumonia and all the rest.

313
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,740
Disease instead was a holistic
phenomenon of Bondi equilibrium.

314
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,560
There was an esense only one disease.

315
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,170
Now what were the causes?

316
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,320
The causes were said to be what we
might call in monitoring jargon,

317
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,480
environmental insults that gay lung
later on was to codify as the six non

318
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:19,610
naturals,

319
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,210
the human body and constitution then
had contact with the air which might be

320
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:29,880
corrupted or my asthmatic
as it was called later. Uh,

321
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,700
motion or what we might call exercise
was the second not or it's lack

322
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,890
non-natural sleep or wakefulness excretion
or retention of whatever was ingested

323
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,370
and the passions of the soul.

324
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,520
These were the non naturals that
could tip the body into disease.

325
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:52,910
Now,

326
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,440
restoring health was based
in part on nature itself.

327
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,720
That is to say there's a teleology ology
of the body embodied in the phrase,

328
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,650
these matey cut treats not to die,

329
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:10,930
which is the healing power of nature
and the means to restore the body,

330
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:12,584
in other words,

331
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,620
strives to restore equilibrium through
[inaudible] or through the elimination of

332
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:22,190
excess humors.
When you sweat,

333
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:27,370
you sneeze or you vomit for all of that
is your body's attempt to get rid of the

334
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:32,630
humor that's making you
sick because of its excess.

335
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,940
So this led then to a
humoral therapeutics,

336
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,250
and let's talk about that.

337
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:46,030
The basis of medical strategy was that
the physician was the ally of nature and

338
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:48,974
of the body.

339
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,070
The body was trying to restore itself to
help to health and the physician would

340
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:57,740
join it and doing battle against disease.

341
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,460
He would read the signs to decipher the
underlying process would take a case

342
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:08,810
history would practice close observation,
taking the pulse,

343
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,280
listening to the body and
would examine the urine.

344
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,310
It's color, it's density. Ah,

345
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:21,311
he would smell it and taste it and see
whether it contained blood or was frothy

346
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,600
as all of those work
worrying prognostic signs.

347
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,410
It was a holistic treatment where you
didn't treat individual symptoms but the

348
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:37,550
whole constitution and it also had an
idea of the individual realism of the

349
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,384
patient.

350
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,740
Treatment should be tailored to
the constitution of the individual.

351
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,990
There are no disease entities because
disease is not a thing but a process.

352
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,920
So this was a medicine that was round.

353
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:57,780
They're indifferent to
diagnosis or classification.

354
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,470
What it stressed instead was the answer
to the patient's eternal question and I

355
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,180
going to be all right,
doc.

356
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,700
Prognosis was what really mattered
to the hippocratic physician.

357
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,580
The therapeutic principle was
that opposites treat opposites.

358
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,910
So if you have an excess of a dry
and cold humor like the block Boyle,

359
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:25,643
um,

360
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,910
if that's the humor that's
causing your illness,

361
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,060
then you would like to perhaps to give
the patient a food to ingest that would

362
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:41,130
be wet and hot and hot.
In this case.

363
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,810
Think of it and not simply as the touch
we think of it when we talk about spicy

364
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:47,220
food is being hot,

365
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:52,310
so all the elements that you have also
have qualities and so diet is very

366
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:55,410
important to this therapeutics,

367
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,030
so the tools available to the
physician then our first of all diet.

368
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:05,930
In some sense the hippocratic physicians
thought we are what we eat and all

369
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,400
foodstuffs had qualities,
hot, cold, moist,

370
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:16,430
dry to balance an opposite defect
or excess in the human body.

371
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,010
Exercise was also important.

372
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,250
A change of environment in modern
terms going to a spa or a sanatorium,

373
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,100
a moderation in the emotions.

374
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,220
Moderation in Saks and medication
was important because the,

375
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,160
they did practice hippocratic physicians,

376
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:43,250
internal medicine examples were to promote
evacuation by providing emetics sue

377
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,290
terrifics,

378
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,670
purgatives or diuretics and most uh,

379
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,660
important perhaps was a
primacy of Venus section,

380
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:57,990
by which I mean
bloodletting or phlebotomy,

381
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,920
that became the hallmark
of the Orthodox physician.

382
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,200
Medicine in other words,

383
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,370
was conceived as a process
of addition and subtraction,

384
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,470
adding what is wanting and
subtracting what is an excess.

385
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:17,700
Now you may have your
doubts about Venus section.

386
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,820
Let me just mention some of its
advantages in the eyes of hippocratic

387
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,030
physicians.

388
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,080
It was systematic like disease itself.

389
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,130
It's effects were immediate
and you could control them.

390
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,690
It was speedy.

391
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,580
It's limits were also self
evident to the experienced doctor.

392
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,550
Perhaps the patient fainted,
the pulse disappeared,

393
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,870
or the color of the blood altered.
There were how are for, of course,

394
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,960
contrary indications to bloodletting
old age and deficiency of blood.

395
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,450
The summer heat evacuation already
occurring by other means or extreme cold.

396
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,600
So the Lancet,
the instrument for a bloodletting,

397
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,930
uh, there we have real lancets, uh,

398
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:12,931
became the symbol of the orthodox
position down through the 19th century.

399
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,940
Now note that there is no
real humoral physiology,

400
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,920
no idea of the circulation of the blood.
The heart is not a pump,

401
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,310
but a furnace drawing air from the lungs,

402
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:32,430
heating it and distributing as
in it as innate heat in the body.

403
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:37,390
So this was the first embodiment
of scientific medicine.

404
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,540
I want to talk about an alteration
that it went through through the second

405
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,380
father of medicine.

406
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,760
And this is another Greek
physician who lived, however,

407
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:51,760
in ancient Rome and not is Galen.

408
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,130
And that's a picture now,
his personal,

409
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,380
he lived in the second century,

410
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:04,381
a d from one 30 to about two oh one with
his formative years being lived out in

411
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:09,580
Rome.
His personal qualities are important.

412
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,400
He was very different from Hippocrates.

413
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,660
Hippocrates was a great
observer and empiricists.

414
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Galen instead prided himself above
wall on his knowledge of the texts of

415
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:28,310
Hippocrates.
He almost worshiped to pocker teas,

416
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,420
but regarded himself as the authorized
interpreter if it parked at it worse,

417
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,070
which he turned into a dogma.
Now in Rome,

418
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,370
Galen was physician to the gladiators.

419
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,470
His personal position, uh,
helps explain his influence.

420
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,530
He then became private doctor to the
emperor and he regarded himself as the

421
00:31:53,171 --> 00:31:56,830
ideal physician,
philosopher and scientist.

422
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,220
He was a man of overweening
self confidence who had
nothing but withering scorn

423
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,110
for his opponents and colleagues
whom he called murderer's amateurs,

424
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,190
unversed in hippocratic
wisdom as he called them,

425
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,290
more ignorant than animals.

426
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,060
It was true also that Galen
had an encyclopedic knowledge,

427
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,480
and we can only understand his influence
if we remember that he was a man of

428
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:29,641
immense knowledge of all branches of
the medicine that existed at his time,

429
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,580
and only half of his
written works survive,

430
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,680
but they alone fill 12 volumes
of about a thousand pages each.

431
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,530
In other words,
he was extraordinary and his productivity,

432
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,460
and that too is important
on his influence. Now,

433
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:51,461
Galen had a view that was foreign to us
of the meaning of scientific progress.

434
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,773
To him,

435
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,780
Hippocrates was the permanent foundation
of medical science and the main tenants

436
00:32:59,691 --> 00:33:03,620
of that science could never
be overturned or revised.

437
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,180
Instead.

438
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,410
There was no room in his thinking
for scientific revolutions.

439
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,190
The writings of Hippocrates were valid
forever that could only be completed and

440
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:20,930
perfected. And in fact, that
was gay. Lynn's view of himself,

441
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,450
he was the person who perfected
hippocratic ideas. So in fact,

442
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:31,451
further progress was probably
unnecessary and perhaps impossible.

443
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,960
So Galen became the authoritative
interpreter of Hippocrates.

444
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,590
So this is what we might call gala Newsom.

445
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,570
And then his hands.
Hippocrates became a cult figure,

446
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,110
an object of veneration,
enormous worship,

447
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,630
apoc Ortiz about whom so little
was known in his personal life,

448
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,280
was now endowed with all
manner of apocryphal virtues.

449
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:06,290
He was idealized as a model of wisdom,
courage,

450
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,440
temperance,
humanity and honesty.

451
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,780
Mythologies developed about his
religious piety, his heroism,

452
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,100
and his hard work.

453
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,280
There was a legend that he was descended
on his father's side from the God

454
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,670
Asclepius and on the
maternal side from Hercules.

455
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:31,010
He was said to be a great patriot
who saved Athens from the plague.

456
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:36,610
A man who scorned money and was perfectly
wise and perfectly just so he became

457
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:43,210
one of the greatest cultural figures of
antiquity and equivalent in a different

458
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:47,600
way of Socrates,
Plato and Aristotle.

459
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,800
Now,
probably some of you are wondering,

460
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,050
we've talked about humor,
realism,

461
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:58,250
and its advocates and you'll want to know,
well,

462
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,740
that's all very fine.
Did it work?

463
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,930
I'd like to say that humor
realism had a number of strengths.

464
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:11,650
It was a quantum leap from magical
thinking to naturalistic explanations of

465
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:14,450
disease.

466
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,140
It appealed because it was accessible to
educated layman contemporaries with an

467
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,280
education.

468
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:27,370
Understood everything that hippocratic
can galenic doctors said and prescribed.

469
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,610
It was consonant with
contemporary understandings.

470
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,240
We also need to know that hippocratic
and galenic physicians practice

471
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,240
therapeutic modesty.

472
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,840
They did not participate in surgery
except for example for setting bones,

473
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:50,160
Lansing abscesses and
practicing Vena section.

474
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,570
But then your internal cavities of
the body they knew were off limits.

475
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,700
It was based on observation.
They took case histories.

476
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:05,120
And we ought to remember in terms
of medical effectiveness that uh,

477
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,360
my wife for example,
who is a primary care physician,

478
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,450
says that about 75% of patients who
present themselves in a clinic have self

479
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:22,041
limiting illnesses or psychosomatic
ones and mostly need reassurance that

480
00:36:23,221 --> 00:36:24,780
everything will be alright.

481
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:30,620
So the point about hippocratic medicine
was that experienced physicians

482
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,300
accustomed to seeing ill people
would be pretty good at prognosis and

483
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:37,290
reassurance.

484
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,560
They would refuse to treat cases they
regarded as hopeless and hopeless cases.

485
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:46,770
They also had a referral system
will refer to in a minute,

486
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,790
which was to temples.
I'll come back to that in just a second.

487
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,450
There were, however, a
number of weaknesses.

488
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,430
So hippocratic galenic medicine
had a number of powerful strengths.

489
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
It provided a lot in terms of reassurance
and prognosis and the answer to that

490
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:09,390
eternal question, will I be all
right doc? And the other question,

491
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,130
what can I do to help myself?
There were a number of weaknesses.

492
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,570
It was a closed system.

493
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:21,090
It was based on deductive reasoning and
came to be a bound up in the authority

494
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:26,160
of the ancients with
empiricism fading away.

495
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,280
And indeed in later centuries it
comes to be called library medicine.

496
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,540
It was anchored in a cult of personality,
the cult of Galen,

497
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,570
and through him of Hippocrates
and practice a cult of
antiquity with knowledge

498
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,020
almost becoming a form of revealed truth.
So gala,

499
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:52,021
Nazism involved authority and tradition
and elite medicine of university trained

500
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:56,130
physicians who were involved,

501
00:37:56,131 --> 00:38:00,180
particularly in their training
and studying the classics.

502
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,250
So how do you train a physician?

503
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,400
You have them read Hippocrates and
Galen in the original languages.

504
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,240
Now, I don't want to say however,
that there were no challenges.

505
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,510
It's extraordinary to reflect that
humor realism as a dominant medical

506
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:21,270
philosophy persists into the 19th century.

507
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,510
But I don't want to think
that it was unchallenged.

508
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,600
We know there were demonic and
religious views that ran along side.

509
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,080
But in addition,

510
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:36,170
there were a series of
scientific challenges that in
a number of major shocks to

511
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:42,991
the system that slowly weakened
its hold and gave rise to doubters,

512
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:49,080
but did not thoroughly dismantle humor
realism until the late 19th century.

513
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,560
And even then,

514
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:55,620
it persists in popular culture and
some forms of alternative medicine.

515
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,570
What were some of these challenges?

516
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,810
I don't expect you to
remember these at this point.

517
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,390
We'll come back to them
later in their course,

518
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,040
but just so that you'll understand that
it wasn't as though this system never

519
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,240
had challenges.

520
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:15,390
Protestantism was a challenge with the
challenge to authority and established

521
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:22,110
text and Paracelsus whose dates are on
your handout was called the Martin Luther

522
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,340
of Madison, who rejected, um,
galenic and hippocratic medicine.

523
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,360
Altogether.

524
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:37,050
William Harvey discovered the circulation
of the blood that overthrew or

525
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:41,900
challenged Galen his anatomy
and his physiology, uh,

526
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,950
which were approved not to correspond to
the observed results of dissection and

527
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:50,260
pathology.

528
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,030
So the discovery of the circulation
of the blood was a major blow,

529
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:59,930
although oddly enough,
Harvey himself never rejected humoral.

530
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,560
Listen,
Hippocrates and Galen.

531
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:08,190
Then there was the scientific revolution
and in particular one can think of the

532
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:13,261
chemical revolution associated with men
like Joseph Priestley and Antoine Love

533
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,920
was they destroyed the
Aristotelian notion of elements.

534
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,240
Earth and air for example,

535
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:27,270
were found themselves to be composed of
a great number of modern elements that

536
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:32,581
go to make up what we know as the
periodic table and more generally the

537
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,431
scientific revolution mark to Democratic
turn from authority to empirical

538
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:43,981
evidence and it visioned scientific
and medical knowledge as infinitely

539
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:48,730
expandable and not bounded by set texts.

540
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,730
And then from the point
of view of our course,

541
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,240
the experience of epidemic
disease as we'll see,

542
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,360
made the idea of discretion improbable
as a mechanism needed to explain epidemic

543
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:07,081
disease because it's fairly flimsy as a
basis for explaining why so many people

544
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,860
and a single place at a single moment
of time had their echo lebree all

545
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:16,570
unbalanced at the same moment.

546
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,590
So the experience of epidemic disease
is important and we'll see the physician

547
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,960
for Daca,

548
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,960
Stuart came up with the idea of contagion
and many centuries ago and the 19th

549
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:30,820
century.

550
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,820
We'll see also with the development
of the idea of disease specificity.

551
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,690
And finally in the late 19th century,
the germ theory of disease,

552
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,550
which offers an entirely
different paradigm for disease.

553
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,120
So that's the journey will be taking to
the time when humor realism is replaced.

554
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:55,440
And we'll look at various embodiments,
uh,

555
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,440
along the way of what people
considered to be scientific medicine.

556
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,160
But here are a number of you will be
thinking that I've involved myself and an

557
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:08,030
important contradiction,

558
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:14,020
and you'll be thinking about a Asclepius
and the fact that I talked about

559
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:19,160
temples and uh, God,
uh, and in particular,

560
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,180
let's look at,

561
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,793
oh,

562
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:29,590
that's the God Asclepius and this is the,

563
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:34,600
uh, I'll talk about who he
is. Hippocrates and Galen,

564
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:39,100
we're both pious and
devout. Uh, that is to say,

565
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,100
although they believed in
a naturalistic medicine,

566
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,160
it wasn't that they didn't also believe
in the gods and prove the gods they

567
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:53,251
found in temple medicine what we might
call the world's first referral system.

568
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,470
Asclepius who was he?

569
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:02,220
He was first to moral hero who
became half human and half divine,

570
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,320
and then entirely a god.

571
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,800
He was thought to be the kindest of the
God's the one who loved humanity enough

572
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,320
to sacrifice himself for their sake.

573
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:17,440
His father was the god Apollo.

574
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,650
His daughters were interestingly named
the goddesses panacea and Hygieia and

575
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:29,650
physicians in the ancient world
might call themselves as sleepy ads,

576
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:34,830
meaning the sons of Asclepius who
regarded their father as a patron saint.

577
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:41,580
By the time of Alexander the Great Greece
possess three to 400 temples dedicated

578
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:44,410
to Asclepius,

579
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:50,010
Asclepius was said to have been killed
by Zeus because he taught mortals the art

580
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:51,670
of healing.

581
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,240
And Zeus feared that men and women would
compete with him and no longer being

582
00:43:58,451 --> 00:44:03,340
subject to death,
but Asclepius never practiced magic.

583
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,180
He was merely the most skilled of
physicians using the same principles that

584
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,290
Asclepius ads like Hippocrates
and Galen would use as well.

585
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,111
Note,

586
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:22,111
of course there similarities to the story
of Christ and Asclepius was in fact a

587
00:44:23,021 --> 00:44:27,670
major competitor with Christianity
for a number of centuries.

588
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,610
Unlike Christ after death,

589
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:35,280
he said to have risen and to be
present to eternally in the temples.

590
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:40,750
So the temples were shrines to
Asclepius at places like Athens.

591
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,900
I'll show you hope. A couple of
examples. That's cause where,

592
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,100
uh,
Hippocrates was from and this is,

593
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:53,890
these are the temple at Pergamum.
Um,

594
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,200
I just want to there, it's a whole,
this is more than just a temple,

595
00:44:58,201 --> 00:45:02,790
although it is a temple. It's
a, almost a compound. Now,

596
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:07,791
the usefulness of identifying yourself
with Asclepius was that there was,

597
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,600
it's was provided positions
with the badge of identity,

598
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:17,640
a source of authority.
There were wandering peripatetic healers,

599
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,960
but now they're recognizable
as members of the same guild.

600
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:27,110
This gave them a collective presence
and authority and Asclepius also vouched

601
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,570
for their ethical conduct.
Remember,

602
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,680
these are peripatetic physicians
whom you invite into your home.

603
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,900
And so they needed to have someone vouch
for them and he vouches that there are

604
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:44,901
good doctors and that they have special
care for the poor who can't pay him.

605
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,850
But again, there is no contradiction
with naturalistic medicine.

606
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:56,010
The temples were precursors
in a way to health, spas,

607
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:01,070
Sanatoria or hospitals there they provided
care for the poor and the seriously

608
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,310
ill patients could enter them.

609
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:10,370
The precincts of these compounds after
a period of preparation in which they

610
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:15,030
bathed, fasted, prayed,
and offered sacrifice.

611
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,740
But the therapeutic strategy
comes to them in a particular way,

612
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,990
which is called an incubation,

613
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:27,410
which is to say that it night after the
prepared yourself carefully and the way

614
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:33,261
I just mentioned when you then the priest
will help you and when you fall asleep

615
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:36,180
at night,
you'll have a dream.

616
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,840
This is the incubation and
the God Asclepius will appear
to you and tell you the

617
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,711
throttle you pursued pursue
in order to become well again.

618
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,160
But the strategy was nothing other than
what a skilled physician would have

619
00:46:56,221 --> 00:47:01,221
prescribed had he been skillfully
skillful and wise enough to have known.

620
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:07,250
There was never a retreatment prescribed
by Asclepius by magical means or a

621
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:12,651
miracles or by practices that weren't
accessible to the ordinary doctor.

622
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,230
So this is humoral medicine,

623
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,860
the first embodiment
of scientific medicine.

624
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,040
And I want us to look for the next several
sessions at the way in which it was

625
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:31,461
used as a lens to view the experience
of terrible epidemic catastrophes.

626
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,520
And we'll look also at the way in which
the experience of bluebonnet plague and

627
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:44,611
other epidemics challenged or raised
major questions about humoral theory and

628
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:51,301
helped propel the scientific medical
elite towards a different view of disease

629
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,430
and what it was.

630
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:59,431
So we'll see epidemics beginning
next time as a process.

631
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,770
And we'll also want then to explain it
and we'll look at bluebonnet plague as

632
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:09,640
the first of our major
epidemics in our course.
