1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Our subject this morning and next time
is the age pandemic and all start this

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,250
morning dealing in a sense by popular
demand because I know from visiting

3
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:21,591
sections that people were particularly
concerned with bringing the study up

4
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:25,920
today and talking about
where we are at the moment.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,160
So I'll be concentrating largely on the
global pandemic and where we are today.

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,720
Then next time we'll look
more conventionally, uh,

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,820
the history of the aids epidemic focusing
on this country and the experience or

8
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:50,190
the United States is how
I'm proposing to do it. Uh,

9
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,680
we'll start with the uh,

10
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:57,330
sort of run through if things
that you probably know very well,

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,630
but that we really ought to
discuss a bit as background,

12
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:02,250
the nature of the disease,

13
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,090
it's course in the body and its symptoms.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,300
And then we'll move on to the epidemiology
of where the pandemic is today and

15
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:17,631
some of both the worrying aspects about
this pandemic and also a couple of the,

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,070
uh, rays of hope, that of
progress that has been made,

17
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,860
especially in the last couple of years.

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,870
So that's where we're headed this morning.
First of all,

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,650
in terms of the disease,
um,

20
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:41,760
you know already because
we've talked about viruses,

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,910
in this case,
a retrovirus.

22
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,790
And here we have a slide,

23
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:52,791
a schematic picture of the HIV virus,

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,480
you know, um, about it.

25
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,290
That is so core containing two
strands of genetic material,

26
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,190
RNA in case to,

27
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:12,030
in a membrane with two glyco
proteins on the surface.

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,280
The glyco protein,
particularly this one, one 20,

29
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,910
is crucial for allowing the
virus to target certain cells.

30
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,530
In the case of this virus,

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,120
it targets the t four cells in the body,

32
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,510
which are the ones that
regulate antibodies and are
the regulators of the body's

33
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,630
immune system.
Well,

34
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:46,260
once attached to the t four cell,

35
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,440
the RNA penetrates the host cell and
for a time it's inactive even for years

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,590
there then occurs a trigger or detonator,

37
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,340
which may be this is a little speculative
and infection that activates the t

38
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:07,300
four cells.

39
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,350
And then the RNA is converted into DNA
that penetrates the chromosomes of the

40
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:21,241
host cell and turns it into a factory
for the reproduction of the virus and the

41
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,310
killing of the cell.

42
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,800
So the retrovirus is
an absolute power site.

43
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,410
It takes over the controls of living t
cells and turns them into factories to

44
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,940
reproduce virus.

45
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,660
Now this we can see also and a picture.

46
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,750
This is a slide of an
infected t cell and this is

47
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,510
okay.

48
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,510
An image of a cell reproducing HIV.

49
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,120
And finally,
let me show you.

50
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,090
Okay,

51
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:06,090
this is a picture of an HIV particle
budding from an infected t cell.

52
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:13,470
So this is how the part of the mechanism
of the disease and let's talk about

53
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,680
what happens to the body
in terms of symptoms.

54
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,361
First,

55
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:24,361
there's an incubation period of some six
to eight weeks after which you occur.

56
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,590
There occurs.

57
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,620
The primary infection symptoms at that
stage in the majority of cases are flu

58
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,320
like that is to say fever,
night sweats,

59
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,600
muscular aches and pains,
fatigue, swollen lymph nodes,

60
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,140
headache, sore throat, sometimes diarrhea,

61
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,040
sometimes around cash.

62
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,990
Then the symptoms disappear after a
few weeks and in many cases there's a

63
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:59,560
prolonged period that's
entirely asymptomatic.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,640
This is a period of latency which can
last months and has been known to last

65
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,120
even as long as 10 years or more.

66
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,570
The time being entirely unpredictable,

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,440
but during this period the virus continues
to multiply and destroy the cells of

68
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:21,940
the immune system.

69
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,910
Then there comes the period of active
aids when their direct lesions caused by

70
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:36,861
the retrovirus carried in
some sell cases to the brain.

71
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:42,380
Sometimes there's neurological damage
known as age dementia or loss of motor

72
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:47,850
control memory,
sometimes reasoning power,

73
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,810
but the characteristic as you know of age,

74
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,130
different from most infections is not,

75
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,040
it's not the symptoms that it

76
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,480
causes itself,

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,320
but rather its ability to give rise to
opportunistic infections by switching off

78
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,620
the body's immune system,

79
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,980
making it vulnerable to an exotic variety
of infections that the body is unable

80
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,190
to fight.
This is immunosuppression.

81
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,940
Later in the disease,

82
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,130
the victim experiences weight loss,
lethargy,

83
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,900
recurrent yeast infections,
rashers are sowers,

84
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,480
fevers and night sweats.

85
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,380
Active aids develops when a patient
has fewer with HIV than 200 t cells per

86
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,520
microliter of blood.

87
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,390
The normal count is 800 to
1200 so from this point,

88
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,830
the average untreated and
I stress untreated age.

89
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,880
Patient has about two
or three years to live.

90
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,910
Sometimes other symptoms develop
difficulty in swallowing,

91
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,870
loss of memory, cough,
shortness of breath,

92
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,700
sometimes seizure,
nausea or impaired vision.

93
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,900
But death is usually caused by a whole
array of opportunistic infections with

94
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:30,110
names familiar to you like candidiasis,

95
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,350
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,

96
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,390
Kaposi's sarcoma,
cytomegalovirus,

97
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,670
cryptococcal meningitis,
but above all tuberculosis,

98
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,270
which is the most important of
the opportunistic infections
of aids and globally

99
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:54,350
at least the most common
immediate cause of death.

100
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,370
So note this characteristic of aids,

101
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,580
it's course is not just a direct
result of the virus itself on the body,

102
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,670
but those pathologies which are substratum
are combined with those of a series

103
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:16,811
of other diseases super imposed on the
aids virus because of the progressive

104
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,060
destruction of the immune system.

105
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,080
And note how well adopted the virus is
to its ecological niche and the human

106
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:30,830
population.
It's a lethal disease,

107
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,520
but one that avoids killing
its hosts too quickly.

108
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,070
A major evolutionary advantage
begins with the lengthy,

109
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,110
a symptomatic latent period
as HIV when it's contagious,

110
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,490
but the infected patient almost certainly
doesn't know that he or she harbors

111
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,220
the virus in his or her body

112
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,360
and then full blown aids can
last for long years while again,

113
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,950
the patient remains infective.
Well. What about transmission?

114
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,900
Transmission can occur
in a variety of ways.

115
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,980
As you know,
it's transmitted sexually.

116
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,010
Everyone knows that we need to remember
there was a myth about aids and the

117
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:28,230
outset in this country in the
80s that it was a gay plague,

118
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,440
that it spread homosexually and you
all know about the moral majority and

119
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:39,291
Reverend Jerry Falwell who welcomed
Aids is God's sword to destroy

120
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,730
homosexuality.

121
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Apart from blast for me and the arrogance
of the claim to know God's will,

122
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,800
what's most striking about fall was
comment is his complete ignorance of the

123
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,090
facts of the epidemiology.

124
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,060
The virus is present in
bodily fluids, blood, semen,

125
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,430
vaginal secretions,
breast milk.

126
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,720
So one means is certainly
sexual intercourse,

127
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,500
especially intercourse involving and
infected partner where there are lesions

128
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,940
that allow the virus to penetrate
the skin and enter the bloodstream.

129
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,120
Hence sex,

130
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,360
heterosexual or homosexual where there's
a preexisting venereal infections such

131
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:31,950
as herpes,

132
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,580
it's particularly dangerous or sex
that causes abrasions such as anal

133
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,200
intercourse.

134
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:46,010
So the risk factor is not homosexuality
but promiscuity by which I would define

135
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,800
as sex outside the context
of a loving relationship,

136
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,870
whether heterosexual or
homosexual and Africa.

137
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:02,871
Today it has been established epidemiology
logically that multiple partner sex

138
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:09,711
behaviors account for two thirds of
all new infections but age can be

139
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:16,290
transmitted in other ways
despite what Jerry Falwell said.

140
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,980
It can be transmitted through the
blood by shared needles and syringes.

141
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,060
For example,

142
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,630
needles that haven't been sterilized but
our shared one thinks of injecting drug

143
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:31,584
users.

144
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,100
One can think also have patients in
resource poor health systems in which

145
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:41,070
needles are scarce and
not routinely sterilized.

146
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,270
One can think also of
unsafe blood supplies,

147
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,600
blood that isn't screened
and it's supplied to people
by people who were in are

148
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,780
remunerated.
Their buying,

149
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,790
making every transfusion a risk for
HIV transmission for patients who have

150
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:05,260
surgery or for homeopathy,
hemophilia acts.

151
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Another factor of course is
the sex industry where the
disease spreads rampantly

152
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,940
among sex workers and their clients.

153
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,870
And then there's vertical transmission.

154
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,500
A real shock to Jerry Falwell.

155
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:29,010
The disease can be transmitted
transplacentally from
mother to fetus or from

156
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,820
mother to infant via breast milk.

157
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,260
This is one of the drivers
of the present day pandemic.

158
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,070
In 2008 the latest statistics children
constituted just under 20% of all new

159
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:52,621
infections and nearly the same
percentage of age related mortality.

160
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,620
Well, what about the
epidemiology of this pandemic?

161
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,280
We're now a quarter of a century
and to the global AIDS epidemic,

162
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,640
and I would argue that age is a good
example of one of the themes with which we

163
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:13,840
began our course.

164
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Whether epidemic diseases are part
of the big picture of history.

165
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,930
And I would argue that you wouldn't be
able in the future to write the history

166
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,060
of the late 20th and 20th first centuries
without devoting an ample space to the

167
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:35,890
AIDS pandemic.
And it's consequences

168
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,070
from the standpoint of the
industrial world, western Europe,

169
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,390
North America.

170
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,350
Some people have a comforting illusion
that the emergency's been controlled for

171
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,060
a couple of reasons.

172
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,150
One is the fact that the number of cases
in the developed world has leveled off

173
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:03,090
except that in the last few years there've
been some troubling signs including

174
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,480
right here in the United
States and secondly,

175
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,510
there's been the development of expensive
drug cocktails that have reduced

176
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,940
mortality significantly with many patients
experiencing the disease as a chronic

177
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:24,970
illness, but we need to be
very careful about complacency

178
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,620
and there are only seven countries in
the world that have more cases of HIV

179
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,450
infection than the United States.

180
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,350
In 2006 there were 1.2 million people
living with HIV in the United States and

181
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:47,080
the number is not declining at all.

182
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,880
Furthermore,

183
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
we need to remember that living with
HIV as a chronic disease is itself

184
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,120
enormously problematic.

185
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,140
It means an expensive and complicated
regimen of pills and the medication itself

186
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:07,250
is toxic and has unpleasant side effects.

187
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:13,210
The evidence seems to suggest too that
patients with HIV AIDS undertreatment

188
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,123
experience,

189
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,190
nevertheless a significantly higher
incidence of other diseases and that they

190
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:24,710
die at a significantly lower age.

191
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:30,790
And then very disturbingly since
2004 there's been a real spike in HIV

192
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:37,580
infections among men
who have sex with men.

193
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,600
Meanwhile,
worldwide,

194
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,870
the pandemic continues and the words
of the UN aids report for 2008 it was

195
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:53,180
continuing at a staggering level.

196
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,990
At the end of 2007 the World Health
Organization reported globally,

197
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,400
the 33 million people
were affected by HIV aids,

198
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:10,210
that there were 4.5 million new infections
during that year and during that

199
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:16,460
dreadful year,
nearly 3 million aids deaths.

200
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,810
That's something like 8,200 people a day.

201
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,310
2006 also witnessed 4.3 million new
infections in 2007 and eight the number of

202
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:37,121
deaths decreased and that was partly
due to the increased access to therapy,

203
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,870
antiretroviral therapy that lowered
mortality in 2010 for the first time.

204
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,920
UNH suggested some reasons for optimism,

205
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,800
but optimism of a strictly limited kind,

206
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,430
not that progress was being made to
controlling and decreasing the epidemic,

207
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,160
but that it seemed to have leveled off.

208
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,520
That was one of the hopeful stories
of the UN report of this year.

209
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,010
It remains true though that most people
in resource poor countries who need

210
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:21,140
retroviral therapy still don't receive it.

211
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,260
But let's look at some of the graphs of
this was HIV at the end of 2005 and it

212
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:34,751
shows the total of 40.3
million people with HIV aids.

213
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,370
And below that it shows the numbers of
newly infected people and the number of

214
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,870
AIDS deaths for 2005.

215
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,623
Yeah.

216
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,930
And this gives you some idea of the
dramatic inequality of the burden of HIV

217
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:03,020
aids.
That it's enormously

218
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,220
a burden in sub Saharan Africa,

219
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,460
which has more than half of
the total number of aids,

220
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,710
uh, people in the world. Or
let's look at this picture,

221
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,800
which just gives a clear indication
of where the epicenter of the AIDS is,

222
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,540
which is in southern Africa,

223
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,120
countries such as Botswana,
Lesotho, Swaziland,

224
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,730
Namibia, South Africa, Sim,

225
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:40,731
Bob Way and Gola Mozambique there the w
h o reported in 2006 and again in 2008

226
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,340
that the epidemic was still rampant,

227
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,950
that the trend still offers no comfort
and in the sub region as a whole,

228
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,260
life expectancy has actually declined
because of aids to below 50 plunging to

229
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:07,731
levels not seen indeed since the 1950s
Swazi lend in Botswana have the unhappy

230
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:17,061
distinction of having the world's
highest prevalence of the Aids Hiv aids.

231
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,750
And here you see the worst case scenario.

232
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,150
26% of people are infected with HIV,

233
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,630
the highest levels ever recorded
as our 20% of pregnant women.

234
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,230
Those are rates of prevalence that the
center for disease control once thought

235
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:45,201
to be impossible and life expectancy at
birth dropped below 40 years and several

236
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:54,111
countries in the region with nearly 6
million people living with HIV in 2008

237
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,660
South Africa has the sad record of
processing the largest HIV epidemic in the

238
00:20:04,111 --> 00:20:06,510
world in absolute numbers,

239
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,630
not the per capita now epidemia logically,

240
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,820
it now seems that there are two great
dis virgin patterns in this terrible

241
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:22,050
epidemic
in the industrial world.

242
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,130
It's primarily an affliction
of high risk groups.

243
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,360
We'll talk about them in a moment.
Men who have sex with men,

244
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,320
sex workers,
injecting drug users

245
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:37,851
out.

246
00:20:37,851 --> 00:20:42,851
This is what the World Health Organization
calls concentrated epidemics in which

247
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,040
the pandemic is confined above

248
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,610
overwhelmingly to
certain high risk groups,

249
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,850
but there's a second and
more devastating pattern,

250
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,210
clearly evident in southern Africa.

251
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,200
We're HIV AIDS is a leading cause of
death and we're transmission among high

252
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:07,990
risk groups certainly occurs,

253
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,970
but it's overwhelmed by transmission
and the general population.

254
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,140
Their transmission is primarily through
heterosexual sex and significantly more

255
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:26,941
women are infected than men and
it's also true as I've said,

256
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,640
the transmission occurs on a large scale
vertically from mother to unborn child

257
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,210
so that significant numbers of
children are born with congenital aids.

258
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,040
Now,
why women,

259
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,880
and this is again a none of the themes
of our course and while be dealing in

260
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:53,611
part here with poverty and not just
poverty but in a quality women in part

261
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:57,520
because of biology,

262
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,150
the disease is more easily transmitted
from men to women then vice versa.

263
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,160
It's also true,

264
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,220
clearly true and sub Saharan Africa that
sexual activity tends to start earlier

265
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:13,983
for women,

266
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,980
young women in many parts of sub Saharan
Africa also frequently have sex with

267
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:23,710
much older partners.

268
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,940
Sexual inequality also fuels the sex
industry as does the epidemic is our prime

269
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,840
also by violence against women and
often the inability of women in many

270
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:45,781
situations to negotiate safe sex
practices and many parts of the world.

271
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,010
Girls are simply severely discriminated
against in terms of education and

272
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:59,521
therefore did not acquire sex education
and knowledge necessary to take

273
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:05,191
effective measures to protect themselves
and control their reproduction.

274
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Girls who have not received primary
school education are twice as likely to be

275
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:17,671
infected with HIV as those with higher
educational attainments and as I said,

276
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,190
violence against women is a
major factor in the epidemic.

277
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,900
It's also true that we need to mention
cultural norms in these areas where

278
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:36,751
notions of masculinity are
important determinants of
male behavior patterns that

279
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,730
increase the risk of aids,

280
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:45,270
the idea that it's meritorious to have
multiple partners and unmanly to use

281
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,680
condoms well.

282
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,680
This is an epidemic that can serve also
as a review for some of the themes of

283
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:55,520
our course.

284
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,640
We see this epidemic being primed by
a number of factors that by now we're

285
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:05,090
familiar to you and comparative discourse.

286
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,000
There's a clear link with poverty.

287
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,030
The countries with uncontrolled epidemics
are among the poorest nations in the

288
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:19,031
world and poverty is directly
linked with the epidemiology of HIV.

289
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,104
AIDS.

290
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,570
Poverty prevents national governments
from building effective public health

291
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:31,571
structures or educational infrastructures
and studies of sectors most at risk

292
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:39,071
from the epidemic in southern Africa that
is sexually active young people in the

293
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:42,440
15 to 25 age group.

294
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:48,010
Those studies reveal that large numbers
of people of that age group still do not

295
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:53,930
have an accurate understanding of
the mechanisms of aids transmission.

296
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:00,130
Local studies also showing some places
that disturbingly large numbers of

297
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:02,930
sexually active young people,

298
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,470
25% have been discovered in places,

299
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,710
still have no idea of what a condom is.

300
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:17,290
Poverty prevents people from having
access to means to defend themselves.

301
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,030
Education,

302
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,380
medical care and treatment
for those already infected.

303
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,400
It drives recruitment
into the sex industry.

304
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,850
Another major driver of the pandemic,

305
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,120
it leads to unemployment,

306
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,360
demoralization and alien nation,

307
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,450
all of which fuel high risk behavior
including intravenous drug use,

308
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,060
and that in turn leads to
further unsafe sex practices.

309
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Then there's the social and economic
impact which is maximized by the age

310
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,850
profile of the victims themselves.

311
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That is young men and women in the prime
of life who should be the main stays of

312
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:07,460
families and their economies

313
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,500
and some places.

314
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,620
Poverty even destroys the effects of
sex education itself and Uganda for

315
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:20,100
example,
the newspaper,

316
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:25,130
the Uganda Monitor reported two years
ago that condoms remained so far beyond

317
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:32,601
the means of many people that a widespread
practice was to boil them after use

318
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,920
and reuse them.

319
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,850
Then another theme in our course,

320
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,360
we've talked about urbanization
and its role with certain diseases.

321
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,960
Not all malaria was
clearly very different,

322
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,680
but it's no coincidence that southern
Africa where the pandemic is rampant is

323
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,320
also rapidly,

324
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,350
rapidly urbanizing and that indeed 20%
of the global burden of HIV AIDS falls on

325
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:10,200
15 cities in southern Africa.

326
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:16,670
Another theme of our course is represented
by age and that's the impact of glow

327
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,950
of conflict and war.

328
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,640
The movement of troops once again
has proved to be ideal for sexually

329
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:31,251
transmitted diseases and for prostitution
and the spread of other STDs,

330
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,260
syphilis,

331
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:39,180
gonorrhea and herpes actually
furthers the spread of aids.

332
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:45,140
The lesions that they cause like genital
ulcers provide ideal portals for entry

333
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,460
of HIV into the body.

334
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,920
Trade and modern means of
transport have been important.

335
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,630
One can't understand the
AIDS epidemic without roads,

336
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,670
railroads,
the airplane.

337
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,410
Societal neglect is a theme we've talked
about and national governments in some

338
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:11,310
cases,

339
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:16,310
nations that are poor and underdeveloped
and have virtual status as almost

340
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:18,510
failed.

341
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:23,510
States have been incapable of taking
major initiatives on their own in terms of

342
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:28,200
improving the health of other
pop that their populations,

343
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,480
but in some cases they
also have other priorities.

344
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,980
There's the siren song
of military spending.

345
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,580
There's corruption or let's take the
case of the former president of South

346
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Africa Amiki who refuse to take science
seriously and rejected the idea that the

347
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:55,350
HIV virus causes AIDS.

348
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,680
He calls on people not to use condoms,

349
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:03,890
but simply to drink a mixture of olive
oil and garlic as a prophylactic of

350
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:05,814
choice.

351
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:11,750
So there's been a current of
aids dissidents who relink
reject the link between

352
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:15,420
the virus and the disease.

353
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,610
Fortunately that situation has changed.

354
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,530
Then there's stigmatization which is
a cause of the spread of the epidemic.

355
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,680
It causes people at risk not to seek
medical attention and that in turn

356
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,620
undermines surveillance and active
understanding of the epidemiology of the

357
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,750
disease and the inequality of women
who are stigmatized has a number of

358
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:51,580
structural consequences.

359
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,730
That is in terms of inheritance laws that
dis and franchise them unequal jobs in

360
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,050
the economy,
violence,

361
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,380
early sexual debut and large spread
practices of what Unh cause calls

362
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,840
transactional sex in Kenya for example,

363
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,360
teenage girls are three times more likely
to be infected with HIV than boys of

364
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:29,221
the same age and the differential
instead of decreasing increases with age.

365
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,690
There is also the displacement
of people and aids.

366
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,540
Hiv Aids thrives on migrant labor,

367
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,240
on disrupted families,

368
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,380
on refugee status were and in
industries where migrants live,

369
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:55,661
for example,

370
00:30:55,661 --> 00:31:00,661
among minors in compounds at vast
distances from their homes and families.

371
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,710
A situation that leads to convert
the thriving of commercial sex.

372
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:13,210
Mobile populations are at
high risk of infection.

373
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:19,560
And then one of the vicious factors of
HIV AIDS is the burden of the disease

374
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:22,780
itself,

375
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,620
which causes the burden of poverty
to increase and poverty furthers the

376
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,304
epidemic.

377
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:35,550
So age then leads to a vicious downward
spiral in which Fokker d creates

378
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,650
favorable conditions for aids,

379
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,650
aids breeds poverty and so on.

380
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,830
In the words of the UN aids report
for 2008 HIV causes a greater loss of

381
00:31:49,901 --> 00:31:54,901
productivity than any other disease
and is likely to push an additional 6

382
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:02,190
million households into poverty by 2015
HIV has inflicted the single greatest

383
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:10,270
reversal and human development
and modern history.

384
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,440
That was the UN report and then there
is super infection that is multiple

385
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:21,550
infections with different strains of aids.

386
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,600
And one of the most tragic factors of
all is the phenomenon of AIDS orphans.

387
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,220
The who reports staggering
numbers of them.

388
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,880
It turns it a crisis of Gargantuan
proportions already in Subsaharan Africa,

389
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,070
11 million children under 15 are orphans,

390
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
a number that's expected given current
and projected prevalence of HIV infection

391
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,820
to reach the staggering figure
of 25 million in a few years

392
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,210
and worst affected cases.

393
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,450
It could be if this actually materializes
that one child and five could be an

394
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:14,870
aids orphan.
Well,

395
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:19,871
what are the effects of this
dreadful pandemic on societies?

396
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,620
Again,

397
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,620
we see the functions almost as a
review of themes of our course.

398
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,650
Clearly you will,

399
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,220
no one would be able to write the history
of the present moment and southern

400
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:38,450
Africa without giving a
central place to HIV aids.

401
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,540
HIV AIDS prevents education and
literacy at the heart of the epidemic in

402
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:50,441
Botswana is the fact that the disease
kills teachers more rapidly than they can

403
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:52,430
be replaced.

404
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,660
That poor families with a member ill from
aids can't afford to send children to

405
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:00,254
school.

406
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:06,370
The fact that it destroys healthcare
systems and many countries in southern

407
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:07,724
Africa,

408
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,120
50% of all hospitalizations are due to
HIV AIDS and nearly all other healthcare

409
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,100
interventions and programs have therefore
been erased or radically downscale.

410
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,440
It destroys productivity and creates
a crippling burden of disease,

411
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,990
destroys families and communities,

412
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:38,180
thereby trapping whole countries and
under development and international

413
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,230
dependency.

414
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,720
It destroys civil society
and undermines democracy.

415
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,830
It's a substratum for a lethal
epidemic that follows in its wake,

416
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,560
the reemergence of tuberculosis,

417
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,920
the classic opportunistic
infection complicating HIV
AIDS and TB is rising at a

418
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:07,721
rate of 6% per annum and southern
Africa where 2 million cases of TB or

419
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:15,011
diagnosed year businesses find that
they're crippled their high rates of

420
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,290
absenteeism.

421
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,480
There's a real shortage of
skilled workers available.

422
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,820
There are high rates of turnover and
it's extremely expensive to train new

423
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:34,151
workers and of course the rocketing
healthcare expenses that they face.

424
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,100
So major cultural

425
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,290
impact on societies.

426
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,650
Clearly this undermines any confidence
sense that our society is protecting one

427
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,980
it, um, there's a demographic impact.

428
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,220
We've already seen the way in which HIV
AIDS is altering the age structure of

429
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:00,870
whole populations.

430
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,990
And transforming life expectancy and
there's even the possibility of failed

431
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:12,591
states as a direct result of disease
with enormous implications for security,

432
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,940
political stability and democracy.

433
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,420
But this last fact paradoxically
has also opened a ray of hope.

434
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,950
The realization that I last mentioned

435
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,600
affected the national security
estimate of our own government,

436
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:41,690
which recommend that in fact HIV AIDS
was a major threat to the security of the

437
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:48,801
United States the first time that
disease was recognized by the CIA and the

438
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:54,750
security community as a
threat to our country.

439
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,460
And this was reinforced by studies by,
for example,

440
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,520
the Rand Corporation and the result of
this realization that we are indeed a

441
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:11,751
global community and that what's happening
in southern Africa and other places

442
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,770
is of enormous impact
throughout the world.

443
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,300
Led to Uracil Ras of investment of funds.

444
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,900
And I'd most like to mention Pepfar,

445
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,260
the president's emergency plan for AIDS
relief that was established by President

446
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:39,321
Bush in 2004 it now target's 15 countries
has been extended under President

447
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:44,790
Obama.

448
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,360
And those countries are primarily though
not exclusively and southern Africa.

449
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:56,730
And it's initially it was $15
billion over several years.

450
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,030
And has been renewed since and it became
the largest commitment of funding to an

451
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:06,930
international health effort ever recorded.

452
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,890
So this is lead with them.

453
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,820
There's also funds through
the gates foundation,

454
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:22,821
particularly directed at research
and through the Global Fund for HIV,

455
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,970
AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.

456
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,560
One of the conclusions
is that there's been,

457
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:36,561
that we could reach is that in the last
years under this massive new investment

458
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:43,171
of effort and funding that the world
health community is developing much more

459
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:51,250
sophisticated strategies for
dealing with this epidemiology,

460
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,120
that it has much more data and information
and that it's learned a number of

461
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:59,440
important indeed vital lessons.

462
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,620
What are some of the conclusions that
provide us with them at least a measure of

463
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:05,944
hope?

464
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,960
One of them is that in
campaigns against this disease,

465
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,430
one size definitely does not fit all.

466
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:21,150
And here we see another theme of our
course that information hard data is

467
00:39:24,071 --> 00:39:28,450
absolutely crucial to any
effective public health strategy.

468
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,110
Public health needs to be based
on a solid basis of information.

469
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,420
And in this case we see a rapid upscaling
of testing and surveillance as one of

470
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:46,681
the key components of the global effort
to combat the disease that's necessary

471
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:53,490
because it establishes the clear idea
that the epidemiology of this disease and

472
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:59,641
each society is distinctive and that in
turn enables the campaign to concentrate

473
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:06,541
resources to change tactics depending on
the actual results of the interventions

474
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,780
so far.

475
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,030
So you need to be able to meet in
order to have sound public health

476
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:21,060
scientifically to assess what you've done
today and to change course if it's not

477
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:26,800
working properly.
So in one of the hopeful signs in the age,

478
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:31,801
Penn Dem aids pandemic is that the
campaign is become more sophisticated and

479
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:37,561
focused and has been realized
that strategies that fit
one phase in the history

480
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:42,970
of the epidemic may not be
effective at another stage.

481
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:48,310
And so the response has continually
to be updated and adapted.

482
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,510
The priority now is to clearly identify
high burden areas as a priority and to

483
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:59,530
saturate them with prevention efforts.

484
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,920
The slogan of Pepfar for this
reason is know your epidemic.

485
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,840
In the past,
for example,

486
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:14,250
anti AIDS programs failed to target
married couples and in people in longterm

487
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,300
relationships,

488
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,900
couples in which one part particular
partner in particular is HIV positive,

489
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:28,870
while the other is not in the jargon of
the World Health Organization discordant

490
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,523
couples.

491
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,570
Another lesson that the
commitment cannot be short term,

492
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:38,300
that it must be sustained.

493
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,780
That short term interventions that are
then scaled back can be useless and

494
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:48,650
counterproductive.
A good illustration is Uganda,

495
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:54,010
which a few years ago was one of the
bright spots in Africa when the government

496
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:59,240
invested heavily in sex education,

497
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,710
in the provision of condoms and the
fostering of new and healthy sexual

498
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:04,580
behaviors.

499
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,820
The results were highly successful until
funding was scaled back and favor of

500
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,820
other priorities and since then the
epidemic and Uganda has resurged with a

501
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:20,810
vengeance and one could say
something similar about Thailand.

502
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,000
There are also new strategies.
Let me give you a couple of examples.

503
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,570
One is the need to abolish the distinction
in this pandemic between prevention

504
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,100
and treatment as a false dichotomy because
treatment with antiretroviral therapy

505
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:46,900
is in fact a valid and essential
preventive strategy in particular,

506
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:53,230
antiretroviral therapy radically lowers
the incidents of vertical transmission

507
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,540
from mother to child.

508
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:03,010
It's also true that
antiretroviral treatment lowers
the viral load and therefore

509
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,830
reduces transmission.

510
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:12,790
Antiretroviral therapy is a prophylactic
because it prolongs the life of parents

511
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:19,520
thereby decreasing the number of
orphans and vulnerable children,

512
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:24,580
the very people who fuel the sex industry
and are most likely to indulge and

513
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:30,851
unsafe sex practices because they
locked education resources and access to

514
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:33,380
medical care.

515
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,890
So pepfar has concentrated recently on
making generic antiretroviral therapies

516
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,570
available and focused countries at an
affordable price and the FDA in this

517
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:53,081
country has established fast track
approval to allow antiretrovirals to be

518
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:58,070
rapidly reviewed and cleared.

519
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,640
By the end of 2008 antiretroviral therapy
had been extended to 10 million people

520
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,900
with HIV AIDS and especially to
pregnant women who are HIV positive.

521
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,910
Another hopeful sign.
At first,

522
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:22,150
pepfar was ideologically motivated and
stipulated that one third of its funding

523
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,650
had to go to abstinence only education,

524
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,880
but this has been demonstrated by to be
counter productive and so has largely

525
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:38,340
been dropped and funding has been direct,

526
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,670
redirected towards other
aspects of the program.

527
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:48,110
Another stress has been on
gender inequality and here
I want to stress that it's

528
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:54,741
not only poverty but in a quality
that drives this epidemic forward.

529
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:59,460
Let me give you the example of Swazi lend,

530
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,180
which is at the epicenter
of this pandemic.

531
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:10,580
One third of women in the 18 to 24 age
group were found to have experienced

532
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,180
sexual violence as had one quarter of
girls under 15 so providing education and

533
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,120
reeducation,

534
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,540
stressing the dangers of power
differentials and intimate
relationships has been

535
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:34,941
important in demonstrating the devastating
consequences of sexual entitlement

536
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,530
and also offering adolescent
women vocational training
so that they would have

537
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:48,501
the skills necessary in the marketplace
and hence the economic independence.

538
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:54,410
That was a major determinant of
public health until recent years.

539
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,580
HIV AIDS programs avoided what might
be called social economic and cultural

540
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:05,370
determinants of the pandemic.

541
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:11,210
Concentrating on generic awareness but
not confronting the specifics of local

542
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:14,910
situations that fueled the epidemic.

543
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,080
Let me give you an example of targeting
specific high burden groups and areas.

544
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:28,370
One of them has been in recent years the
targeting of intravenous drug users and

545
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,940
removing ideological blinkers and simply
talking in terms of epidemiology and

546
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:41,391
hard science leading to such innovations
as needle exchange programs to make

547
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:48,830
blood safe and indeed in a
couple of countries to opioid
substitution treatments

548
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:56,360
to remove or at least to downscale heroin
addiction thereby once again lowering

549
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,050
the rates of transmission.

550
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:06,950
Another major intervention has been
on establishing safe blood supplies,

551
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:13,100
combating what we might call the medical
transmission of HIV AIDS through the

552
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:19,671
establishment of laboratories when with
them the screening of all blood and the

553
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:25,551
recruitment of donors from low risk
sectors of the population on a non

554
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,980
remunerated basis or there's been
the awareness of the utility of male

555
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:36,961
circumcision as a prophylaxis
dick measure in this app pandemic.

556
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,910
Let me then just contrast the situation
in sub Saharan Africa where the epidemic

557
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,150
is in the population,

558
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:54,180
the general population with a couple of
other worrying places in the world and

559
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,780
I'll, and then on a slightly
more somber note, um,

560
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:06,360
some places that are currently
sources of concern outside of Africa.

561
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:13,230
There's eastern Europe and the former
areas of the Soviet Union where Unh has

562
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:21,130
talked about an emerging epidemic.
Unlike that of southern Africa.

563
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,430
The epidemic is a d has
a different profile.

564
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,520
It's a concentrated epidemic showing
prevalence among high risk groups like

565
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:34,120
intravenous drug users
in Saint Petersburg,

566
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:39,330
30% of intravenous drug users are under
19 years of age and the sharing of

567
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:46,021
needles is the norm and it's also driven
by the sex industry and by the collapse

568
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,970
of the healthcare system and fueled also
by some religious attitudes which scorn

569
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:02,340
sex education and the use of condoms
or devote resources to a practice of

570
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:07,120
abstinence education which
has drawn monster bubbly,

571
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:12,210
not worked or there's East Asia and the
Pacific again and directing drug use,

572
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:18,670
sex industry,
low condom use and sexual tourism.

573
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,420
All of these risk factors
that are cumulative.

574
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,580
And I'll conclude just with a couple of
worrying points about our own country.

575
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,370
The outbreak began in the
80s as far as we know,

576
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:39,390
peaked around 1993 and then declined
steeply until proximately the year 2001

577
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:48,060
since which time there's been an
upturn and a surprising degree of

578
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:50,710
misinformation has abounded

579
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,520
new infections.

580
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,730
We can see demonstrate that
the epidemic has transformed,

581
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:02,490
been transformed unlike, and the, uh,

582
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:07,750
the epidemic in the United
States is totally unlike
what's happening in southern

583
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:11,590
Africa. New Infections are
overwhelmingly among men,

584
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:17,790
718,000 males affected and 160,000 women.

585
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:23,020
And it tends to be among
concentrated groups,

586
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,770
men who have sex with men, drug
users, and ethnic minorities,

587
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:32,950
African Americans who have half of
the new cases in the last few years.

588
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,000
And Hispanics,
a transformation occurred.

589
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:43,240
AIDS in the 1980s was primarily a
disease among the white population.

590
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:49,660
It has since declined among whites and
spread disturbingly among minorities,

591
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,260
African Americans,
Hispanics and Asians.

592
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,270
So at that point,

593
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,540
I'll refer you to Wednesday when we'll
talk about the United States in greater

594
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:02,714
detail.

595
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,820
And I just conclude since I've run out
of time by saying at the pandemic at the

596
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:10,370
moment is extremely active.

597
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:15,140
The most hopeful thing I could say to
you is not that it's being controlled,

598
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,290
but that it seems to
be globally stabilized,

599
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,210
but there are a number of really worrying
places in the world and some very

600
00:51:23,211 --> 00:51:24,650
worrying developments.
