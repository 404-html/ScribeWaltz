1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,281
Okay.
Well,

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:07,281
this morning I want in a way to circle
back in time to cover an issue that's

3
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:14,070
been lurking in the background
but we've never faced directly.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,360
You'll remember that when we talked
about the Paris School of medicine,

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,600
there was the ethical issue raised of
the relationship of the patients to the

6
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,640
physicians who are using
them for medical studies.

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,110
And we've talked about this as well
in a variety of other contexts.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,071
For example,

9
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:40,071
in the breakthrough of the mosquito
theory of transmission of malaria,

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,990
uh, we've seen that there were
human experiments involved in not,

11
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,470
but there wasn't really an ethical
framework of a formal kind until well into

12
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:58,521
the 20th century and it's not development
that I want to look at this morning.

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,840
The development of a
framework of bioethical, uh,

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,320
experimentation for human studies.

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,330
And to do that,

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,480
I'd like to look at the Tuskegee
syphilis study from 1932 to 1972,

17
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,930
which was if we like the catalyst around
which a framework of biomedical ethics

18
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,390
was developed.

19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,990
Now the Tuskegee study
was a complex story.

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,440
It captured the national imagination
because it seemed to embody everybody's

21
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:46,611
fears as a worst case
scenario in medical ethics.

22
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,230
Tuskegee as a study embodied a number
of features that contributed to that.

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,880
Clearly it demonstrates as I think
we'll see the corrupting influence of

24
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:08,690
commercial considerations on
medicine and medical research.

25
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,530
It demonstrates the negative
impacts of scientific arrogance.

26
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,340
It brings out the dangers of
a military chain of command,

27
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:31,941
model of public health in which no one
questions or resists decisions from

28
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:35,490
higher authority.

29
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,930
It shows the exploitation of the poor
and disadvantaged by powerful interests

30
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,920
and the government.

31
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,540
And it also clearly embodies racism.

32
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,560
This is an experiment that began with
an idea that racial groups are serious

33
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,510
biological category,
not just a social one,

34
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,020
but that races are biological entities.

35
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,830
And that the differences from one group
to another are so significant that

36
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:20,491
diseases themselves follow different
paths in the bodies of different racial

37
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:24,550
groups.
Well,

38
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:29,551
the place where this unfolded was um,

39
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,650
in Macon County,
Alabama in the 1930s

40
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,460
and Tuskegee is here,
um,

41
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,070
in Alabama.
Let me look a little more closely.

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,193
Uh,

43
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,700
that's Macon County in
the state of Alabama.

44
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,670
Now, there are a number of features
we need to think about when we're,

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,680
remember Nate Macon County and we need
to take off our 21st century spectacles

46
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,220
and think back to different world.

47
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,460
In the 1930s when this
experiment got underway,

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,880
and at that time Macon County was one
of the most disadvantaged places in the

49
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,680
whole of the United States.

50
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,880
It had a large population of poor and
illiterate African American sharecroppers,

51
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,890
and this was the time of
apartheid in our country.

52
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,540
Studies had revealed in connection
with the social conditions of the

53
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:43,660
sharecroppers in Macon County,

54
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,640
an overwhelming burden
of disease and suffering

55
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,870
in a rigidly segregated environment.

56
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,620
The African American population
was also overwhelmingly illiterate.

57
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,941
In fact,

58
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:05,941
the state of Alabama spent $65 a year
on each white student in the county,

59
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,900
but less than $7 for every
African American student.

60
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,330
Venereal diseases and especially syphilis,

61
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,190
were also rampant in Macon County.
Well,

62
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:30,250
the story that unfolds
is a pretty awful one,

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,780
but paradoxically it begins
with good intentions.

64
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,920
The good intentions were those of a
philanthropic program established by an

65
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:46,240
organization,
I guess we would call it an NGO.

66
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,300
The Julius Rosenwald Fund was involved
at the time was the president of the

67
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:57,241
Sears and Roebuck company
and under these auspices,

68
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,710
Dr. Thomas Paren conducted a study of
syphilis in the south in 1929 and 30 and

69
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,650
this study had a clear moral purpose.

70
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,130
The idea was that it was to begin by
demonstrating the burden of syphilis and

71
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:21,440
that this would be a first step that
would pave the way for the federal

72
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:26,441
government subsequently to step in and
establish a national syphilis eradication

73
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:33,120
program.
The vision was this,

74
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,660
in year one there would be a Bosserman
test survey of six states in the south of

75
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:45,951
this country that is
establishing the extent,

76
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,620
the prevalence of syphilis and the
second year they would begin a program of

77
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:56,700
treatment and of education.

78
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,020
Let's look at what was found
in the beginning of the
study year one was actually

79
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:08,931
completed and it found that the United
States how to national rate for syphilis

80
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,390
of four per every thousand of population.

81
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,743
Yeah.

82
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,710
On the other hand,
for African Americans,

83
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,350
the rate was 7.2

84
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,140
for every thousand of population work
syphilitic but if we come now to Macon

85
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,170
County,
Alabama,

86
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,970
and that's the point that statistics
were absolutely staggering,

87
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,970
fully 360 and no,
I'm not making a mistake.

88
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,030
360 per thousand of population of the
African American population of Macon

89
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,520
County, Alabama was found to
be afflicted with syphilis.

90
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,390
So Macon County,
and this is the point,

91
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,480
was clearly placed on the map as the
very ideal place if you're interested in

92
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:16,701
how syphilis affected the bodies of
African Americans in particular African

93
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,000
American males.
Well,

94
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,030
the year two of this fill the
philanthropic program never got under way.

95
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,000
The reason was simple.

96
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:38,030
It was the Great Depression and
funding for the program vanished.

97
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,310
The phase that had been
intended of education,

98
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,670
of treatment and hopefully of
eradication never materialized.

99
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,500
What remained was only the initial study

100
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,240
at this point in the wake of the
activity of the Rosenwald Fund,

101
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,290
the United States public health service
intervened and it had as we'll see,

102
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,290
two very different objectives.

103
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,690
The first was associated with this men

104
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,250
and the idea of the
syphilis study was hit.

105
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,180
He was his brainchild.
This is tall lover Clark.

106
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,490
And his idea was to have,
um,

107
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,760
a scientific and racial curiosity.

108
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,450
There had been at the turn of the century,

109
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,720
a Scandinavian study on the course of
untreated syphilis in the human body that

110
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,550
was conducted in Scandinavia.

111
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,670
And Dr. Clark thought that
since the earlier study had
involved a Nordic people,

112
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,230
it would be really intriguing,

113
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,350
really neat to do a companion study to
show the natural history of syphilis

114
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,940
untreated in the body of
the African American male.

115
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,190
And if you wanted to do that
kind of study in this country,

116
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,400
what place could possibly be better than
making county which offered unlimited

117
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:30,540
material for just such observations.

118
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,530
And Clark started with a profoundly
racist to PA phasis that he wished to

119
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:43,101
demonstrate and not as the simple one
that the African American male was

120
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:48,531
racially distinct from the white
male and was so in ways that could be

121
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:54,141
demonstrated by studying the natural
history of syphilis in their bodies.

122
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,510
It was thought,

123
00:10:57,511 --> 00:11:02,511
or at least he thought that African
American men had such a high incidence of

124
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:09,021
syphilis because of their irresistible
fewer sex Wallace and they're deficient

125
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,140
cranio capacity,

126
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,830
but didn't really leave enough
room for gray mater to control it.

127
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,930
Secondly,

128
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,680
once established in the body of
the African American men syphilis,

129
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,920
Dr. Clark believed ran a different course
than it would in the body of the white

130
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:40,341
men and he had an idea of what
he expected that difference to be

131
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,020
and the bonding of white males.

132
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,740
The damage was overwhelmingly to,

133
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:54,580
they're more highly evolved
and therefore more vulnerable

134
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,470
neurological systems.

135
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:57,810
Okay.

136
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,650
You inspect expected that the result
in African American males would be very

137
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:07,510
different,
being less neurologically sophisticated.

138
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Their bodies would experience damage
instead primarily to their cardiovascular

139
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,220
systems

140
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,640
and proof was to be gained by studying
the natural course of the disease and a

141
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,500
group of males,

142
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:28,610
African American males who
were systematically untreated.

143
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,230
So let's keep this in mind,

144
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,320
it's to be on the bodies of African males
that are systematically not treated.

145
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,410
So let's remember that this is a
study that was based not on any fear

146
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,920
therapeutic objective.
On the contrary,

147
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,610
the main interest of the syphilis study
conducted at Tuskegee was to examine

148
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,700
syphilitic black male bodies post mortem

149
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,290
for this reason as the biomedical
ethicist Susan letterer explains,

150
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,520
the real purpose of this study was
not to treat the African American men

151
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,700
involved as subjects or even as bodies.

152
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:20,980
Okay.

153
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,980
But rather as cadavers
that had not yet died.

154
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,670
Let me quote the words of one of the
physicians involved in the study who wrote

155
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:39,100
the following,
the most important phase of the study,

156
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,370
which to follow as many patients as
possible to post mortem examination.

157
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,080
Okay.

158
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,080
In order to determine the prevalence
and severity of the syphilitic disease

159
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:55,150
process.

160
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,020
Yeah.

161
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:02,020
One physician of the US public health
service express the thought very

162
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:08,240
succinctly and with chilling candor,

163
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,710
he said once the study was established,

164
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,390
the subjects had no more interest
for us and killed. They were dead.

165
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,703
Okay,

166
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,120
well,
what's the second objective of this study?

167
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:30,110
The second aim of the study was
often as often not remembered.

168
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:35,481
So clearly it was more commercially
driven and less well known.

169
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,340
Remember,

170
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,210
cast your mind back to the 1930s

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,540
okay.

172
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,540
And worldwide at that time there was
a vast and stable demand for reliable

173
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,340
diagnostic

174
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,630
for syphilis.

175
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,560
The demand was created first of
all by law laws that required,

176
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:01,820
for example,

177
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,940
testing for syphilis before marriage
testing for syphilis before induction into

178
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,874
the army.

179
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,290
And still at this time at the start
of the 1930s there was no absolutely

180
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:21,560
reliable diagnostic test for the disease.

181
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,590
Furthermore,

182
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,830
developing such a test was scientifically
challenging because of a feature of

183
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:37,310
Treponema pallidum the closet,

184
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,890
this spire Keat that as you know,

185
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,460
that's the pathogen
responsible for syphilis.

186
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,700
The treponema Pallidum as one of
its features has extreme fragility.

187
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,880
It could not really be cultivated
in the laboratory at this time.

188
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,860
So there was an alternative
the experimenters thought,

189
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,220
and that was a simple one to keep a
ready supply of serum available through

190
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,830
regular blood samples from
untreated syphilis subjects.

191
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,440
I started to say patients,
but the point is they aren't patients.

192
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,350
They weren't to be treated.
They were subjects

193
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,940
and indeed in the course
of the SIF Tuskegee study
itself to new reliable tests

194
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,840
were developed using Tuskegee blood
and they were successfully marketed

195
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,610
these two tests where the venereal disease
research laboratory test was one and

196
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:53,771
the other was called the fluorescent
Trepan Nimol antibody absorption test.

197
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,370
And needless to say,
the subjects of this experiment,

198
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,820
we're never paid for this particular
service that they rendered to science.

199
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:11,841
Well,

200
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:16,841
a problem faced taller for
Clark and his experimenters.

201
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,890
The problem was to recruit volunteers,

202
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:31,090
volunteers to take part in a study
that had no therapeutic purpose.

203
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,650
Why would you volunteer?

204
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:38,651
You might ask to take part in a
study that has no benefit for you,

205
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,750
but whose purpose in fact

206
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,280
was to use your living body as a natural
history exhibit to observe pathology

207
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,020
while the subjects received no treatment.

208
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,000
And while their blood serum,
which used as a culture medium,

209
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,101
well,

210
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:07,101
they thought of a solution and that was
to make use of the ample availability of

211
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:12,360
African American males in Macon County

212
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,920
who were vulnerable to manipulation
because they were desperately poor because

213
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,320
they were illiterate.

214
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,190
Because they had almost no
access to medical care and
the medical profession and

215
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:35,481
because at this very moment they had
a substantial and as yet unfulfilled

216
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,810
expectation,

217
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,040
the expectation created unknowingly by
the Roosevelt involved study that there

218
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:52,281
would soon be a therapeutic intervention
of the United States government.

219
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,510
So what the United States Public
Health Service did was to send out mass

220
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:05,010
postings to block churches in Macon County

221
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,660
and these letters and placards let it
be known that the government was on

222
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:16,380
barking on the long
awaited treatment program.

223
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,590
Let me be clear again about that.

224
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,070
The announcement by the
public health service was not,

225
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:28,071
the second phase was underway and
that what was coming was a program of

226
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,034
treatment

227
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,960
treatment for anyone who thought
that he or she will. In this case,

228
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:38,980
he had what was called bad blood.

229
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,340
Now bad blood in Macon County,

230
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,450
Alabama was not a scientific term,

231
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,720
but a really elastic term,

232
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,840
local term borrowed from popular culture
that had a number of inconsistent

233
00:19:56,921 --> 00:20:01,630
meanings.
Bad blood might mean anemia.

234
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,890
It might mean simple indigestion.

235
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,610
It might mean venereal disease.

236
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,100
So if you had bad blood,
whatever that was,

237
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,470
treatment is on the way.

238
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,660
And in addition to treatment volunteers,

239
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:27,661
if you volunteered were promised that in
due course they would be provided with

240
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:33,310
all funeral expenses.

241
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,270
Courtesy of the u s government provided
they allow their bodies to be subjected

242
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:42,400
to autopsy.

243
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,880
The famous postmortem examination
that tall over was so enthusiastic

244
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,683
about,

245
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,410
they would also be provided with free
meals occasionally and free transport to

246
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,720
the treatment center.

247
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,650
So what was on offer might not seem
enormously expensive and I think it's a

248
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,480
reflection of their dramatic conditions,

249
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,460
social conditions of people at the
time that large numbers of people came

250
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,294
forward

251
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,860
and approximately 600 were selected and
they were regarded by those who were

252
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:26,350
rejected as the fortunate ones.

253
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:31,410
They were lucky they'd been taken
into a treatment program of the u s

254
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:35,380
government.
And after selection,

255
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,950
the 600 were divided into two groups.

256
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,480
399 were found to have syphilis and
they formed this study group 200 without

257
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:52,630
syphilis served as controls.

258
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,230
Now this raises,
um,

259
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,540
an ethical issue immediately
were these volunteers.

260
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,770
I would argue that these 600 African
American males can only by some stretch of

261
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:14,371
the imagination be called volunteers
for a really simple reason.

262
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:21,270
You can't be a volunteer if you're
lied to about that for which you're

263
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,970
volunteering.
In other words,

264
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,120
they volunteered for one thing and what
was put in place was something radically

265
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:35,230
different.
They were promised treatment,

266
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:41,190
but treatment was precisely what they
were to be denied systematically for the

267
00:22:41,981 --> 00:22:43,720
remainder of their lives.

268
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,370
Let me quote tall over Clark who presided
over the first year of the study and

269
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:55,390
directly approved the
use of this deception.

270
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,510
He wrote this to a colleague.

271
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,400
These negros are very,

272
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:08,401
very ignorant and easily influenced by
things that would be a minor significance

273
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,140
to a more intelligent group.
Now,

274
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:20,440
what was the site of this study?
Um,

275
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:25,441
this is a picture of one of the buildings
of Tuskegee institute now known as

276
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,680
Tuskegee University.

277
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,310
It had a very honorable history.

278
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,550
It was founded by booker t Washington
for the education of freed men after the

279
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,213
civil war.

280
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,520
And it wasn't used to cooperate by the
idea that such cooperation with the study

281
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,440
would enhance its prestige.

282
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,850
And would gain access for
it to government funding.

283
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,920
And there was an African American nurse.

284
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:05,870
We see her here, uh, with uh, Doctor,

285
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:06,831
uh,

286
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:11,831
Yunus rivers who was the local African
American nurse who served as the

287
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:18,551
intermediary between the physicians
of the Public Health Service and the

288
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:23,810
subjects of the experiment. No
Lot's been written about, um,

289
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,290
nurse rivers and her
role and the experiment.

290
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,530
I think that we ought to remember the
context of the time and the training in

291
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:38,051
which nurses were trained not to
question but to do as they were told.

292
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,920
Now at the outset,

293
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,220
something also paradoxical happen
and I would argue that in fact,

294
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,730
even if you wanted to have an entirely
cold blooded look at scientific validity

295
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,580
for section study,

296
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,820
this particular study was made
scientifically invalid from the outset.

297
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,340
At the beginning,

298
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:12,370
the experimenters ruined any possibility
that the study could ever produce

299
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:18,131
violet scientific results because the
government doctors began the study by

300
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:24,731
administering a small dose of
the accepted therapy of the day.

301
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,780
In other words,

302
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:31,780
the experiment is to begin to have an
study of untreated syphilis and they begin

303
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,160
by administering a small dose of the
established therapeutic revocation of the

304
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,220
day, which is a combination
of awkward arsenic and mercy,

305
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:49,820
funny mercury compounds plus Bismuth.

306
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,080
So this ruined the premise of observing
purely untreated syphilis sticks.

307
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,510
Then further weakening the scientific,

308
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,350
if we call it that validity of this study,

309
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,800
was the fact that some members of the
control group contracted venereal disease

310
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,200
and they were simply
transferred to the test group.

311
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:21,201
So they shuffled the deck between
the study group and a control group.

312
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:25,520
Well thereafter.
Nonetheless,

313
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,640
this particular study continued for 40
years down until 1972 and the volunteers

314
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:38,810
thereafter received no further treatment.

315
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,280
They were subject to
regular annual physical

316
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,910
and blood tests and do spinal taps and
they were given something that they

317
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,800
thought was medicine.

318
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:59,060
It was called pink medicine
and they took it regularly.

319
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,450
And actually what it was is aspirin.

320
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:09,360
Let me give you a primary source.

321
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,840
This is the Macon County health department

322
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,470
and this is the notice that was given
to those who were experimenting.

323
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,430
It says, dear. So sir,

324
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,620
sometime ago you were given a thorough
examination and since that time we hope

325
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,760
you've gotten a great deal of treatment.

326
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,760
Notice the word treatment for bad blood.

327
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:37,220
You will now be given your last
chance to get a second examination.

328
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,350
This examination is a very special
one and after it is finished,

329
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,520
you will be given a special treatment.
I underline that word.

330
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,420
If it is believed you are
in a condition to stand it.

331
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,220
And let me just look at the very bottom
in case you missed anything along the

332
00:27:55,221 --> 00:27:59,810
way. At the bottom you could read,
remember this is your last chance

333
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,660
for special free treatment.

334
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,170
Be sure to meet the nurse.

335
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:14,330
So the deception in this study
was systematic and extended.

336
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,360
In fact,

337
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,360
there was a time when there was a great
threat to this Tuskegee study and that

338
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:29,511
was when America entered the Second World
War because at that time there was the

339
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:35,661
danger that the members of the study
group risk to being drafted into the army

340
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,450
and that would entail blood tests,

341
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,570
their syphilis would be discovered and
the army would provide treatment ending

342
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:49,680
the experiment.

343
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:56,060
So the assistant surgeon general of the
United States intervened on behalf of

344
00:28:56,581 --> 00:29:01,581
the study and provided the
selective service board of
Macon county with the list

345
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:08,300
of all those men included in the study
and they were exempted from the military

346
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:11,394
draft?

347
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,053
No.

348
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,380
At the outset of this experiment,

349
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,380
what was the therapy for syphilis?

350
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,150
What is the treatment that these
men were being deprived of?

351
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,350
And we have to say that
by contemporary standards,

352
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,130
the treatment at the time
was not highly effective.

353
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,110
Okay.

354
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,050
And the most that we can say is it,

355
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:45,051
the members of the study at the outset
were being denied the best available care

356
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,330
of the standards of the time.

357
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,430
This was the metal metal
therapy as it was called.

358
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,110
Then I mentioned before.

359
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:57,860
Okay.

360
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,080
But what about later on?

361
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,230
This study continues from 32 to 72
I later in the 1940s penicillin,

362
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,760
a highly efficacious remedy
for syphilis was developed.

363
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,560
Okay.

364
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,560
And it was determined that the members
of the study would be systematically

365
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,340
denied the antibiotic as well.

366
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,270
Local doctors in Macon County.

367
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,450
We're all provided with the names of
the members of the study and they were

368
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:43,481
instructed by the public health service
that those men were not to be given

369
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:45,680
penicillin.

370
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,760
So the study continued for 25 more
years when a therapy actually existed.

371
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,580
Well by 1972 at the conclusion,

372
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,180
28 of the men in the study
died directly from syphilis.

373
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:14,660
100 others died of complications
related to syphilis.

374
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:23,100
40 wives of members of the study were
infected with syphilis and 19 children

375
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,480
fathered by members of the study
were born with congenital syphilis.

376
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,990
There was however no intention and the
public health service to terminate the

377
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:43,884
study

378
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,970
and this was not strictly
speaking a secret study.

379
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,290
There were published
reports on a regular basis.

380
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:59,350
This is really one of the more
disconcerting parts of this study.

381
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,080
What does it say about
our society at the time?

382
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,030
Okay,

383
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,150
the first report,
there's another words.

384
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,680
This is a study and the kind of study
that was published that was written about

385
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:20,681
publicly and scholarly articles
and people thought this was okay.

386
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,340
The first published report was in 1936
and papers were late or written every

387
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:35,160
four to six years or so until 1970

388
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:41,810
and strikingly there was never a within
the medical community about reports on

389
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:49,451
this type of study that appeared
in medical journals for 40 years.

390
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,440
In 1969 a committee of the Center for
Disease Control Determined that the study

391
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:00,500
should continue

392
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,400
and this conclusion was backed by
local chapters of the American Medical

393
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:09,803
Association.

394
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,080
Yeah,

395
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,080
the end came only in 1972 when a former
employee of the public health service

396
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:23,550
named Peter Buxton reported this
story to the Associated Press.

397
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,450
An article appeared in the
Washington Star in July,

398
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,910
1972 and this caused a national scandal
with charges against the government of

399
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:44,400
hiring carried out your moral
equivalent of Nazi medicine,

400
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,460
of abuse, of state power, of racism,

401
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,860
and many other things.

402
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,880
A famous book appeared by
James Jones called bad blood,

403
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,280
bad blood.
You now know what that means.

404
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,470
There was a play Ms. Rivers,
boys by David felt shoe.

405
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:10,080
There was a movie Miss Evers boys in 1997

406
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:17,910
the attorney Fred Gray initiated a lawsuit
on behalf of the patients and there

407
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:24,661
was an out of court settlement that gave
surviving patients medical treatment at

408
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:25,721
last,

409
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:30,721
at last and $40,000 in compensation.

410
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:37,150
So let's think about the
ethics of this experiment.

411
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,540
What was learned and what ethical
framework was established to prevent a

412
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:45,700
recurrence of something of the kind

413
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,620
we need to remember in judging the ethics
of those who initiated and continued

414
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:57,430
the study there.
At the time it started,

415
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,820
there were no clearly
spelled out guidelines for
biomedical research on Human

416
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:05,740
Beings,

417
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,740
and it would be unfair and anachronistic
to hold researchers retrospectively

418
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,720
accountable for the standards of 2010
but I think we need to look at the

419
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:27,091
concerns that were raised by medical
ethicists and a variety of forms with

420
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:32,440
regard to this experiment.
Remembering.

421
00:35:32,441 --> 00:35:36,610
Of course some of the
considerations were retrospective,

422
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,640
but I'm going to argue that many ethical
base bases made this unethical even by

423
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:47,331
the standards of 1932 well
places where this were raised.

424
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:53,630
There was a congressional investigation
led by Senator Edward Kennedy that took

425
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:57,360
place in 1973

426
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:03,860
the national medical association
produced a report in the same year.

427
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,340
There was a national research act in
1974 that created what was called the

428
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:17,901
national commission for the protection
of human subjects of biomedical and

429
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:20,430
Behavioral Research,

430
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,530
which came to be known
popularly as the Belmont report.

431
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,460
There was the class action suit on behalf
of the survivors and their relatives

432
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:32,580
that I mentioned,

433
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,910
and in 1997 there was an official
presidential apology by President Bill

434
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,690
Clinton,
of which more in just a minute,

435
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,220
the standard that the medical ethicists
applied was Emmanuel constant notion of

436
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,890
a categorical imperative,

437
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,390
and that is that ethical problems.

438
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:02,450
And here I over simplifying
cons definitely,

439
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,940
but the general idea,

440
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:11,030
which is what is important to us and
the context of the conclusions of the

441
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:16,731
Belmont report was an ethical problems
arise whenever a human being is not used

442
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,080
as an end for his or her own benefit.

443
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,530
Yeah,

444
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,530
but it's used only as the means
to some further ulterior objective

445
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,580
under round to give teeth and
specific content to that idea.

446
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,080
A number of corollaries,

447
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,820
we're said to flow Tim
gang thought meaningful.

448
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,770
The first was,

449
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,640
and we live with this and
you will know the phrase,

450
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,130
the doctrine of informed consent.

451
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:05,690
Now remember the letter to the
volunteers that I showed you sang.

452
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:09,390
Remember this is your last
chance for free treatment.

453
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:14,400
Be sure to meet the nurse that
was hardly informed consent.

454
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,710
We know about the hooks
of the pink medicine,

455
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,760
the ethically up to this
use of that term bad blood,

456
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,520
which wasn't a medically valid concept.

457
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,660
The fact that the volunteers
were never informed of the and

458
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,040
utility of penicillin and you can't
really have informed consent if you don't

459
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:45,220
know what you're consenting to.

460
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:51,330
The subjects were never specifically
told that they had syphilis about the

461
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,410
course of the disease.

462
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,860
There were never consulted about what
possible treatment options were available

463
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:06,060
and spinal taps were presented to
them as what were called spinal shots.

464
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:07,810
Once again,

465
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,070
a sly and deceptive play on words,

466
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,930
which suggested that the spinal
taps had some therapeutic purpose.

467
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:21,490
Isn't that what you understand when you
go to the doctors and you got a shot?

468
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,170
The second thing that was thought to be
an ethical response that's necessary and

469
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:34,420
biomedical research is the idea.

470
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,790
The principle of beneficence.

471
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,720
That is the subjects of a scientific and
medical experiment should be entitled

472
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:50,070
to the expectation that some benefit
will ensue for their suffering and their

473
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:52,900
participation.

474
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,260
And the point about this study in Tuskegee
was that it was entirely designed to

475
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,180
be non-therapeutic.

476
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:05,200
There would never be a benefit
to those who took part.

477
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:11,250
A third major principle outlined is not
biomedical research should be governed

478
00:40:12,071 --> 00:40:14,230
by what was called justice.

479
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,150
And by that was meant the principle
that the most vulnerable members of his

480
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:24,151
society should not be chosen
as experimental subjects
to the maximum extent

481
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,880
possible.
In other words,

482
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,890
biomedical research
should refrain from doing.

483
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:37,891
It's experiments on prisoners on
the mentally deficient on children,

484
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,580
the poor,
and members of disadvantaged minorities,

485
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,570
people who can be easily misled,
coerced,

486
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:50,860
or intimidated.

487
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,180
And the point about this experiment
was that the subject should Tuskegee.

488
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:00,270
We're targeted precisely because
they were maximally vulnerable.

489
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:07,610
A fourth notion that should
govern biomedical research
is not of a well designed

490
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:10,720
experiment.
Now,

491
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:15,721
you asked how come not becomes an ethical
category than an experiment should be?

492
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,160
Well designed.

493
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,460
The protocols should be so drafted
that the anticipated results have a

494
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:30,301
reasonable chance of resulting from
the procedures adopted another words,

495
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,510
if you take part in a
biomedical experiment,

496
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:40,630
there should be the expectation that the
experiment is so designed that any risk

497
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:47,060
that you take such as it is,
should not be entirely in vain.

498
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:48,890
So,

499
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:53,890
and ethical principle that was sad was
violated when the Tuskegee experiment

500
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:00,010
began with a dose of therapy and then
began by mixing the test and control

501
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:02,450
groups.

502
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:07,100
So whatever suffering was undergone by
the subjects or the experiment would

503
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:10,340
never have any scientific standing.
In other words,

504
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,460
they're suffering would be
entirely without benefit to anyone.

505
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,490
A fifth thing,

506
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,580
it's not a ethical experiment should
not violate the law and the existing

507
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,080
ethical guidelines of the
government professional and
international authorities.

508
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:32,991
Well,

509
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:37,991
this study in Alabama
violated the law of ninth,

510
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,080
sorry,
uh,

511
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,140
the law of 1927 which mandated
treatment for syphilis.

512
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,510
There was also during the
course of the experiment.

513
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,070
Let's get rid of that.

514
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,580
There we go. Ah, we won't
hear that again. Uh, the, uh,

515
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:09,660
there was also the idea in 1946,

516
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,020
there was an American Medical Association
Judiciary Council that an issue the

517
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:19,620
report establishing the
principle of voluntary consent.

518
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,850
In other words,

519
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,850
ethical standards emerge during the course
of the experiment that weren't there

520
00:43:26,341 --> 00:43:27,480
at the outset.

521
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,510
But the experiment continued to violate
ethical standards that were established

522
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:37,410
after it began.
And in 1964,

523
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:42,530
the World Health Organization issued a
health Sankey declaration that said that

524
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:50,301
informed consent should lie at
the basis of biomedical research.

525
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,800
Two other things,
ah,

526
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,380
were mentioned as
ethically very important.

527
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,710
One was not in future.

528
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,160
The assessment of the ethics of medical
research should not be by a closed

529
00:44:08,431 --> 00:44:10,350
medical cast.
In other words,

530
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,330
doctors shouldn't establish themselves
that what they're doing is ethical.

531
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:20,630
There should be independent review
boards to establish that and then this

532
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:28,911
experiment which said to violate also
the civil rights enshrined the American

533
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:33,090
Constitution,

534
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,840
the 13th amendment against involuntary
servitude and the 14th amendment against

535
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,080
trespass.

536
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:44,760
Yeah.

537
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,970
Now the question is do any of those,

538
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:53,030
what can we say about those who embarked
in 1932 they didn't have the framework

539
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,340
of the Belmont report.

540
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:02,210
The Helsinki Declaration did Judicial
Council report of the American Medical

541
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,720
Association,
but I would argue

542
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:12,780
but a judgment on this
isn't all retrospective.

543
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,360
I'd remind you that already at the
start of the experiment in 1932 it was

544
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:26,541
unethical for physicians to lie to their
patients and research subjects and that

545
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:35,481
it was unethical for a research program
to violate the law of Alabama of 1927

546
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,190
that mandated treatment for
anyone known to have syphilis.

547
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:49,440
Well, what's the legacy of
the Tuskegee experiment?

548
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,050
Well, they're positive and
negatives on the positive side.

549
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:00,110
This established a legally binding
ethical framework for biomedical research.

550
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,040
The universe of conducting biomedical
research is now entirely different from

551
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:14,001
that in 1932 and that's an
entirely a positive gain.

552
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,540
This study Dan did produce
something really positive,

553
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,520
which is an ethical framework.
There's also the fact,

554
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:25,080
and this is positive too,

555
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,610
there was a wide debate of all of
these issues through the press,

556
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,990
through plays, congressional
debates, scholarly literature,

557
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,700
television broadcasts,

558
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:41,180
President Clinton's public apology and
the coverage it received and all of you

559
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,650
are well know that phrase
about informed consent

560
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,640
on the negative side,

561
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,580
there were the sufferings of
this study members, their wives,

562
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,850
their children born with
congenital syphilis. There was,

563
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,820
I'm don to a great university,

564
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:07,330
Tuskegee University and its reputation.

565
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,500
There was harm done in terms
of a breakdown in trust
between African Americans

566
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:19,561
on the one hand and the medical profession
and the government on the other.

567
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:25,500
And when can see the legacy of this in
the HIV AIDS pandemic that we're coming

568
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:29,260
to in 19

569
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:36,270
when asked if HIV AIDS as an
epidemic was a genocidal plot,

570
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,990
an opinion poll of African
Americans revealed the 10%
responded yes and 20% that

571
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:50,800
they were not sure.
So at that time,

572
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:55,801
in the 1990s 30% of African Americans
thought that perhaps HIV AIDS was not a

573
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:03,850
disease,
but a genocidal plot.

574
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,250
And this had consequences,

575
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:11,370
consequences in terms of the failure of
people to seek medical and public health

576
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,900
education and treatment.

577
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:21,430
If your level of distrust
is pitched. Dot. Hi,

578
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,380
you can understand that.

579
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,190
And one of the reasons was
the Tuskegee experiment.

580
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,750
So then I'd like to close by remembering
Clinton's apology and the White House.

581
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,620
And May 16th,
1997 there were,

582
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:42,160
at that time a experiments,
survivors,

583
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,010
including this man,
Howard Shaw,

584
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,130
plus representatives of three others.

585
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,230
And I'm can't compete with
Bill Clinton and eloquence.

586
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:56,860
So I'd rather simply end by quoting him.

587
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,510
What he said was the United States
government did something that was wrong,

588
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,680
deeply, profoundly, morally wrong.

589
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:14,640
It was an outrage to our commitment
to integrity and equality for all our

590
00:49:15,281 --> 00:49:19,000
citizens,
to the survivors,

591
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,710
to the wives and family members,
the children and grandchildren.

592
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,330
I say what you know,

593
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:30,820
no power on earth can give
you back the lives lost.

594
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,890
The pain suffered,
the years of internal torment and anguish.

595
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,370
What was done cannot be undone,

596
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:45,100
but we can end the silence.
We can stop turning our heads away.

597
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,670
We can look at you in the eye and finally
say on behalf of the American people.

598
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:56,530
What the United States
government did was shameful,

599
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,480
and I am sorry

600
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:05,130
that people who ran the study at
Tuskegee diminished the stature of men by

601
00:50:07,391 --> 00:50:10,960
abandoning the most
basic ethical precepts.

602
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,880
They forgot their pledge
to heal and repair.

603
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,820
They had the power to heal.
They're survivors and all the others,

604
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:25,300
but they did not.
Today.

605
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,860
All we can do is apologize,

606
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:32,720
but you have the power for only you.

607
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,290
That is Mr. Shaw and
the others who are here.

608
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:41,291
The family members who are with us in
Tuskegee only you have the power to

609
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:46,901
forgive your presence shows that you've
chosen a better path than our government

610
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:50,900
did so long ago.

611
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,550
You have not withheld
the power to forgive.

612
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,540
I hope today and tomorrow
that every American will
remember this lesson and live

613
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:04,550
by it.
