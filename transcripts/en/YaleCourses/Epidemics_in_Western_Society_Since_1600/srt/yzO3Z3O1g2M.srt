1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,240
Well. Good morning. We can continue
with our subject of Asiatic cholera.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,050
And I thought we could perhaps frame
that discussion by reminding you that in

3
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:15,270
the 1990s,

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,330
the Nobel Prize winning microbiologist
Joseph Lederer coined a term emerging

5
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:24,540
diseases.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,410
He used it to describe infectious
diseases that are previously unknown,

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,890
at least two sources of human infection
and emerge as it were for the first time

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,050
too. In fact, human beings, these
are diseases in our own day.

9
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,380
We can think of Ebola or limes disease,

10
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,310
SARS or of course most importantly,

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,810
HIV aids. Oftenly often, uh,

12
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:55,830
the press,

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,920
which seems I would argue to suffer
chronically from historical Amnesia,

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,790
it often treats the appearance of new
infections is something unprecedented,

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,630
unnatural that never happened before.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,920
But the reality is the
Charles Darwin was correct.

17
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,790
We live in the midst of a constantly
evolving microbial world in which the

18
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,751
microbes have an inherent
advantage because of the
frequency of their mutations

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,140
and the extremely brief length
of a microbial generation
compared with the human

20
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:38,724
one.

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,320
So new diseases have always
been emerging and appearing.

22
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,220
And Asiatic cholera is a good
example of what we might go.

23
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,910
Let's be mindful.
It would be historically anocronysms it,

24
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,170
we might call it a great emerging
disease of the 19th century.

25
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:04,370
There is a scholarly debate on whether
cholera had long existed on the Indian

26
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:12,321
subcontinent and whether it
went back for centuries or not,

27
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,990
especially it clearly by the early
19th century had an endemic home on the

28
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:24,051
Indian subcontinent and particularly
the area here in the delta of the Ganges

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,850
and Brahmaputra rivers.
That's that area.

30
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,140
There are accounts of diseases,
um,

31
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,170
in various writings that are suggestive
of cholera well before the 19th century.

32
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,120
But that particular debate
is exotic for our purposes.

33
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,770
And what we want to know is
that by the early 19th century,

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,610
it was endemic in the Indian,
in the Indian subcontinent,

35
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,150
but it was unknown elsewhere then world
until it burst into a major epidemic in

36
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:08,020
1817 then escaped India and began.

37
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,020
It's devastating international career
reaching Europe for the first time in 1830

38
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,660
so cholera for the 19th
century was something new,

39
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,930
something never before experienced.

40
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,320
And that helps to explain a lot.
Good.

41
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:31,000
Part of the reaction to the populations
that were first afflicted by it

42
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,560
as the Great Colorado,
uh,

43
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,790
we should remember was the great
fear disease of the 19th century.

44
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,950
We've already seen that plague was
the most dreaded disease from the 14th

45
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:52,951
century through the 17th and we know that
smallpox succeeded in that role in the

46
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:59,551
18th cholera though not the great killer
of the 19th century was the most feared

47
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:05,500
affliction.
It was feared for a number of reasons.

48
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,380
It's extremely sudden appearance.

49
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,310
It's exotic and unfamiliar character,

50
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,020
the agonizing and gruesome
nature of its symptoms,

51
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,930
its high case fatality rate,

52
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:25,650
and it's predilection for adults and
the prime of life rather than children.

53
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,000
It's revealing that a great deal of
the discussion surrounding the early

54
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:36,001
experiences with cholera revolved around
the question of whether this was in

55
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,100
fact the return of the plague.

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,310
Some of the names that were given
to cholera capture, the fear,

57
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:48,100
it inspired.
It was known in all kinds of ways.

58
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:52,000
If you read the medical journals
of the 19th century and the press,

59
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:56,920
you see it was called Asiatic
cholera, cholera, more bus,

60
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,920
perhaps very scary,
tingly.

61
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,420
Cholera asphyxia was known as the gypsy,

62
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,390
the monster blue cholera,

63
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,620
and king cholera among
other names as well.

64
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,890
Now, since the 19th century was
an era of acute social tensions,

65
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,870
it was,
as you all know,

66
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,730
marked by a series of revolutions and
is often dubbed the rebellious century.

67
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:25,930
For that reasons,

68
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,440
you know about the revolutions of 1830
the revolutionary wave of 1848 to nine

69
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,750
across the continent.

70
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,780
When there were something like 50
revolutions within a two year period,

71
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:44,440
Italian independence,
the Paris commune one could go on,

72
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,650
but due to the fact that cholera
frequently accompanied those events and

73
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,090
indisputably did heighten
social and political tensions,

74
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,600
it used to be common to speculate about
whether the passage of cholera across

75
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:06,671
Europe was itself a contributary
factor and the coming of revolutionary

76
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,290
outbursts.
By now,

77
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:14,291
it's pretty clear that the causal chain
actually work the other way around.

78
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,740
In other words,
the outbreak of revolution,

79
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,770
war and social order created conditions
for cholera to thrive call removed.

80
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:29,990
I would argue in the wake of
revolution rather than triggering it,

81
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,420
so cholera if it didn't cause the
revolutions that mark the 19th century.

82
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,300
There has been in recent literature,

83
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,710
a swing of the pendulum in a different
direction with the views sometimes

84
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:49,190
express that cholera was dramatic.
Yes,

85
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,840
but not a lasting influence
on the history of the West.

86
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,950
After all.

87
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,490
Some would say that it was dramatic that
it led to all sorts of short term sound

88
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,694
and fury,

89
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,360
but in the longterm that argument runs
its legacy was small and clearly know

90
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:13,100
where the near the order of
magnitude of plague and small pox.

91
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,080
Well, we'll be deciding among
those conflicting views,

92
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,960
but before we can assess them properly,

93
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,020
we should look in our usual way at the
etiology of cholera at its epidemiology.

94
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,180
It's symptoms and its course in
European and North American history.

95
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,580
Then we'll be in a better position
to judge its impact. Well,

96
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:42,280
there were seven pandemics
of Asiatic Congo row,

97
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,100
the first in 1817 to 23
which was an Asian event.

98
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,900
The second pandemic was
in the 1830s and did Asia,

99
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,710
but also Europe for the
first time in North America.

100
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,280
The third pandemic of 1846
to 62 afflicting Asia,

101
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,410
Europe, again, North America,

102
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,050
the fourth pandemic from 65 to 75.

103
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,940
Again,
it was global.

104
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,420
The fifth pandemic from 1881 to 96
mainly a matter of Asia and Europe,

105
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,670
the sixth pandemic of 1899 to 23.

106
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,480
Again,
primarily an Asian and European event.

107
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,490
And then the seventh pandemic,
uh,

108
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,980
from 1960 onward that went through Asia,

109
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:41,600
South America, and Africa.
The last pandemic, however,

110
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,310
has been milder and less
variant with a new bio-type,

111
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,450
the all tour,

112
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,600
which is less dramatic and less
fatal than classic cholera,

113
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,880
which is our subject and which was the
form of cholera from the first pen,

114
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,330
dammit,
through the sixth.

115
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,540
The endemic home if cholera,

116
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,600
it's I've said was the Indian said
continent in the delta of the Ganges and

117
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:14,721
Brahmaputra rivers and it was confined
there until the number of developments

118
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,030
enabled it to spread the bacterium that
causes cholera is extremely delicate and

119
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,170
doesn't travel so easily.

120
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,710
So it required a number of factors that
enabled the disease to move beyond its

121
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,640
original area of endemicity.
What were some of those?

122
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,340
One was colonialism itself,

123
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,650
which meant large scale troop movements,
uh,

124
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:48,651
and increasing contact between the
sub continent and the outside world.

125
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,990
The increase in trade did the same
thing in terms of increasing continent

126
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,190
contact.
Then there was the transport revolution,

127
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,440
which was very important
because as I said,

128
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,470
cholera doesn't travels so well over
extended periods of time and it was the

129
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:14,430
railroad, the steam ship,
and later in the century,

130
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:19,431
the Suez Canal that radically reduced
the traveling time from the sub continent

131
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,070
to other parts of the world.

132
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,940
Another major factor was religious
pilgrimages and fares in the Indian sub

133
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:34,941
continent itself and very PR most
especially from the European perspective.

134
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,730
A very important factor was the hodge,

135
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,660
the voyage of pious Muslims to Mecca.

136
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,610
Now that cholera afflicted Europe and
North America in the 19th century wasn't

137
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,130
therefore a matter of chance.

138
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Epidemic diseases exploit features
of societies that are social,

139
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,260
political, and economic
and environmental. Now,

140
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:09,261
cholera is spread as we'll see exclusively
by the oral fecal root that is,

141
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,430
it's ingested by food and
water contaminated by feces,

142
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:23,020
and it requires, therefore,
it clearly is, uh,

143
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,180
in among the diseases certainly
that we've examined so far.

144
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,500
Cholera is clearly different
from plague and small pox,

145
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,360
and then it's much more a social disease
that is to say a disease that has a

146
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:41,270
clear predilection for poverty and for,

147
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,300
uh,
pathologies of social and economic life.

148
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,430
Cholera thrived on chaotic,

149
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,680
rapid,
unplanned,

150
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:57,690
urbanization with it's overcrowding
and teaming slums within adequate and

151
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,330
insecure water.

152
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,800
This continues to be true
with cholera in our own day.

153
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,610
It thrives on substandard housing.

154
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,100
Yeah,

155
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,740
on inadequate and inappropriate diet.

156
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,460
It has a predilection for port cities,

157
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:22,790
which are usually the first
place is to be affected.

158
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,930
This reminds us perhaps
of plague a little bit,

159
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,920
places in Europe like
Marsay onboard Valencia,

160
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,510
Naples were among the first and
most frequently to be afflicted.

161
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Cholera thrives also on filth and
the absence of sewage systems.

162
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,210
Cholera is among many
things a disease of poverty,

163
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,680
cholera,

164
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,150
also how to pronounce predilection
for the poor as I've said.

165
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,500
And then that way it
exacerbated social tensions.

166
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,100
Colorado, uh, as I said,

167
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:08,101
was associated with revolutions though
it followed rather than provoke them.

168
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:13,111
You can see that the revolt in Poland in
1830 the revolutions of 1848 to 49 when

169
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,060
cholera is often part of the movement
of troops to repress the revolutions

170
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,330
rather than being a factor in there
cause it was conditioned by the 1860

171
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:32,320
[inaudible] war between
Austrian pressure as well. Well,

172
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:36,970
what about the disease itself?
The pathogen is this,

173
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,010
the Vibrio cholerae,

174
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,640
which was discovered by Robert Call in
1883 helping to establish the germ theory

175
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,060
of disease. No. Uh,

176
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,080
this will note the flagellum or tail of
the Vibrio that plays an important role

177
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,160
in the human gut.
And we'll talk about that in a moment.

178
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,750
It's transmission, you know, uh,

179
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,850
pretty well because if you're reading
for this week on Jon snow on the mode of

180
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,470
communication of cholera,

181
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,160
you know that this is one
of the foundational texts
of epidemiology where he did

182
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,060
a brilliant epidemiological job
of detective work by finding,

183
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,330
uh,

184
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,330
the famous broad street pump that the
people who drank the water from that

185
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:31,630
particular pump,

186
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,750
we're the ones who fell ill and took
the disease back to their homes.

187
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,600
Snow did a good job of establishing
the Colorado then was ingested in water

188
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,110
primarily,

189
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,590
although it was also demonstrated later
that fish and vegetables that is food

190
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,550
contaminated with fecal matter can
also play a role. This was, um,

191
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,160
the faint.
That's Jon snow.

192
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,700
Yeah.

193
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,540
And this is the famous broad street pump.
Ah,

194
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:11,541
that made such an important moment
in the history of medical science and

195
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:15,060
Epidemiology.

196
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,980
Though it's important to remember that
it may seem odd to you as you read this

197
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:24,981
book and look at all of snow's evidence
to remember that in fact it failed to

198
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:29,340
convince the medical profession
at the time. By and large,

199
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,840
there was a big debate about whether
cholera was contagious or not.

200
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:38,070
We'll be coming back to that debate
and the reasons for and against.

201
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,250
But one of the things was that Jon snow
was unable to demonstrate an actual

202
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:47,160
mechanism.
There was something in the water,

203
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,550
but he wasn't able to establish what it
was and therefore he didn't provide a

204
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:54,210
convincing mechanism.

205
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,770
And for people who thought that
probably it was some chemical factor,

206
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:03,771
if it was anything that snows biggest
chance of making an argument was not,

207
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:08,900
it would be something chemical. Well,
if so, and remember this was London, uh,

208
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,660
if there was some sort of
chemical in the river Thames,

209
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,270
surely it would be infinitely diluted.

210
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,650
And so how would it be possible
that this chemical substance,

211
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,310
if that's what it was, ah,
was spreading the disease.

212
00:16:23,311 --> 00:16:27,900
So there was a big debate about
whether snow was actually right.

213
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,830
It was proved later in the
century conclusively that he was,

214
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,340
but it's important to
realize that for a long time,

215
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,490
his writing was very far from convincing
the international medical profession.

216
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,400
That didn't happen until
the 1880s and 1890s well,

217
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:51,630
what were some of the factors in the
transmission of cholera in the West?

218
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,110
We've talked about trade and
the transport revolution.

219
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,690
We've talked about pilgrimages,

220
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,210
we've talked about the strategic
role of sea ports. We're,

221
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:05,650
once again,
as in the case of flag,

222
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,700
it would be important the bacterium
would gain access to the municipal water

223
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:12,354
supply.

224
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,720
Yeah.

225
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,720
And there would also be the danger of
swimming or if eating shellfish that fed

226
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:25,000
on sewage, especially if the
costume was to eat it raw,

227
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,730
the disease would then spread along
inland transportation networks.

228
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,590
We've said to that cholera
was a disease of urbanization.

229
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,160
And if a defective urban infrastructure
infrastructure without sewage systems,

230
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,460
and remember in the 19th century,

231
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:50,550
waste in European cities was predominantly
thrown into the streets where there

232
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:56,961
would be a seepage downward into
tank wells that people would then,

233
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,580
uh, drink the water. And
it's bacterial bounty.

234
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,040
Remember too that the many of
the cities of Europe, Naples,

235
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,880
that you're reading about, but
Paris too and many others, uh,

236
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:16,881
we're surrounded by vegetable gardens
and the vegetables would be brought into

237
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:21,660
the city and consumed by the population.

238
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,650
But in the growing of the vegetables,
uh,

239
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,440
use was made of urban sewage,

240
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,800
which was collected and transported to
the vegetable gardens outside the city.

241
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,070
And then, uh, the sewage
was used as fertilizer,

242
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,930
which good not to waste anything.

243
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,140
And the plants then grew in human sewage
and then the vegetables were brought

244
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:47,250
back to town.

245
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,280
So we have a wonderful way for the
bacterium to make an excellent round trip

246
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,790
between the surrounding the
hinterland and the city itself.

247
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,160
This was the practice of sewerage farming,

248
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,610
which was extensive throughout the west.

249
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:07,790
And it was a good trick that market
farmers knew very well market gardeners,

250
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,540
which was not if you had an
open sewer and they were many,

251
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,690
if you dipped your head of lettuce
and the way to market into the sewer,

252
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,840
um,

253
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,840
then the ammonia from human urine would
make the vegetables look fresh for sale

254
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:24,894
in the market.

255
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,340
So that was a good little trick that
you might want to remember in any case.

256
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,230
Overcrowding was also another
important, uh, factor in,

257
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,580
uh,
in this.

258
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,330
And I just want you to
remember housing conditions.

259
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,450
These are the fun Daci in Naples that
you've been reading about and you can see

260
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:49,890
that this is a place if
you use your imagination,

261
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,720
that's a wonderful place
for cholera epidemic. Uh,

262
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,300
not only the, uh, the, uh, the,

263
00:19:57,301 --> 00:20:01,290
the fact of [inaudible]
lack of sewage and wells,

264
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,470
but the fact that it's really dark
and it's overcrowded and people,

265
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,720
lots of people live in a single room
and not single room is used as the sick

266
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:17,010
room, the sleeping room.
It's a place also work.

267
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:22,011
Food supplies are stored and with little
opportunity to have clean hands and

268
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:29,550
remember that the Vibrio
cholera is spread through,

269
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,570
um, fecal matter. But this,

270
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:37,620
the point is that in these
conditions and in the dark,

271
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,860
it's very difficult to
see. Um, and therefore, uh,

272
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,900
it's difficult to know when contamination
was actually taking place or moving

273
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:50,200
from Naples.
These are streets and nodding.

274
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:54,850
Him and England were
cholera also caused a major,

275
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,180
a couple of major epidemics
for similar reasons.

276
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,020
And the waste matter was simply
hurled into streets like this.

277
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,190
And in the center of the street would
be the gutter which would carry um,

278
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,320
human waste as well.

279
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,710
Another source of contamination
is flies which carry the,

280
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,590
um, the cholera, a bacterium with them,

281
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,780
the clothing of victims
that is the bed linen,

282
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,840
the mattresses, uh, and so forth.

283
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,330
We're also sources of infection.

284
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,750
And laundresses were people who were
particularly likely to fall victim and

285
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:39,010
remember that cholera spread
also by asymptomatic carriers,

286
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,530
it was possible to have to be spreading,

287
00:21:41,531 --> 00:21:46,531
shedding the bacterium
without exhibiting symptoms.

288
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,000
Well,
how was the,

289
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,030
what were the symptoms of cholera and
that I'm going to argue the symptoms.

290
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:59,591
The symptomatology is an important
factor and the social response to this

291
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:04,720
dreadful disease and it's caught
captured by such terms as blue,

292
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:08,230
cholera, cholera,
asphyxia, and the monster.

293
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,460
This is a picture of a representation
of a cholera victim in,

294
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:19,360
um,
the agony of the disease.

295
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,870
And this is an imaginative
idea of how overwhelming it is.

296
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:29,950
This is a cholera, a patient
about to be overwhelmed by, um,

297
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,950
the disease itself.
Well,

298
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:37,951
the bodily defenses are
against cholera are numerous.

299
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,760
The saliva in the mouth
was an important defense.

300
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,850
Uh,

301
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,850
the digestive juices of the stomach are
acidic and tend to kill the bacterium,

302
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,070
uh, when it's ingested.
So it's quite possible to,

303
00:22:57,071 --> 00:23:02,071
in just cholera bacteria without failing
falling victim to the disease itself.

304
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:10,000
But there are a number of
important variables that condition.

305
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,380
What happens next?

306
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:17,050
One would be how great extensive,
uh,

307
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,980
the infective dose actually was.
How much,

308
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,270
uh,
did you swallow?

309
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,070
The diet that you're living
on is important because
such foods that the poor in

310
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:39,250
particular lived on in European
cities as right an overwrite proof and

311
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,140
vegetables and other words,
the poor,

312
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:45,160
we're likely to buy goods
that were beginning,

313
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,760
degenerate and deteriorate because
they'd be marked down in price.

314
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,420
And those would be the goods
that the poor would live on.

315
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,500
And this meant that they often suffered
from diarrheal illnesses and those

316
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,770
reduce the digestive time and therefore
deprive the stomach of its defensive

317
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:11,741
capacity to protect you by the
acidity of the digestive juices.

318
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,640
And the consumption of raw fruit,
for example,

319
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,610
would be especially common
in the summer months.

320
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,150
Another factor would be the general health
of the person who was exposed to the

321
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,234
disease.

322
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,240
But let's suppose that you've eaten a
very large infective dose and it passes

323
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:36,740
successfully through your stomach,
into the small intestine.

324
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,510
What happens next? Well,
there's an incubation period.

325
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,050
Uh,

326
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,050
it can be as short as a few hours and
this to what's important in the social

327
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:53,150
history of cholera and
could last up to three days.

328
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:58,670
The site of infection is
the small intestine there.

329
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,700
The flagellum at the tail of the bacterium
that we've seen propels the Vibrio

330
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,160
and it attaches itself
to the intestinal wall.

331
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,870
Ironically, they're the, um,

332
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,540
uh,

333
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,550
immune system of the body is usually
capable of killing the bacterium.

334
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,450
But when it does,
the bacterium dies,

335
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:31,810
it releases a very powerful
toxin and enter rotax toxin.

336
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:37,180
That's one of the most powerful
poisons in nature and its effect on the

337
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:43,130
intestinal wall is to cause
it to work in reverse.

338
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,470
That is to drain fluid from
the bloodstream into the bowel.

339
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,080
And from there it's expelled.

340
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,270
So the mechanism by which cholera Kilz,
first of all,

341
00:25:56,271 --> 00:26:01,271
and predominantly is a sort
of hemorrhaging to death
in which the blood serum

342
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,280
loses its fluid massively.

343
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,330
Leaders can be expelled in
a matter of a few hours.

344
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:16,450
And the patient hemorrhages to death
in effect losing its blood plasma and

345
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,040
[inaudible] screening what are
called the famous right water, rice,

346
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:23,510
water stools.

347
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,170
And the patient goes
into hypovolemic shock.

348
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:34,210
19th century physicians said this is
no longer a fashionable term today,

349
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,390
but they described cholera as
going through two major stages.

350
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,690
The first was called the Algebra stage,

351
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,710
which was the time of
high drama and terror,

352
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,340
which had a sudden onset without warning.

353
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:58,080
And this was part of the social tensions
that were generated by cholera and

354
00:26:58,081 --> 00:27:03,081
other words you could be seized
suddenly with this dreadful disease,

355
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:04,890
uh,

356
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,890
out in a public place on a tram in a
marketplace and the streets itself where

357
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:12,790
you would fall down and start,
uh,

358
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,190
writhing vomiting and excrete eating rice,
water stalls.

359
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,660
This was part of the high
drama of the disease.

360
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,140
And the algae state would last.

361
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,820
If you survived normally
from eight to 24 hours,

362
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:36,330
it as a patient,
you would lose progressively.

363
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,250
Your pulse would become fainter,
or even almost absent.

364
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:47,330
The body would turn cold and
would have a livid appearance.

365
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,370
It looked within a few hours,

366
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,030
and this was another of the
frightening aspects of this disease.

367
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,830
Within a few hours,

368
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,860
someone who had been healthy that morning
by the afternoon looked cadaver rised

369
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,560
like a person who had been wasting
away from a longterm wasting illness.

370
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,950
The breath would turn cold,

371
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,380
the hands would look like dishwater
hands and very distressing.

372
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,030
There would be a very severe cramping,
terrible cramps,

373
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,780
terrible abdominal pain,
nausea,

374
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,190
violent vomiting, and
the blood itself, uh,

375
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:34,191
and physicians who were trying to treat
patients by bloodletting rapidly noticed

376
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,650
that the blood itself deprived of its
liquid content was transformed into a

377
00:28:41,611 --> 00:28:44,880
black tar that refuse to circulate.

378
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,470
Okay?

379
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,470
This could lead to heart failure to a
terrible thirst at the patient suffered.

380
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,960
And because the blood is no
longer providing adequate oxygen,

381
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,480
the patient suffers.

382
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Has the sense of us fixating a
terrible effort to gasping for air?

383
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,293
The,

384
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,940
uh, those are a couple of
pictures of contemporary,

385
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:21,030
I said cholera is still with us and so
I just wanted to show you a picture of a

386
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:27,070
patient, um, or another
child patient today.

387
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,340
Okay.

388
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,230
In any case,
if the patient survived the Algebra stage,

389
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,660
there was then the second stage that
19th fuzzy country physicians called the

390
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:44,830
reaction that might
last four or five days.

391
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,220
The prognosis isn't really better,

392
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:53,250
but the symptoms are at this time
the cold body becomes warmer,

393
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,070
there's a fever.

394
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:00,100
Usually the patient suffers terrible
headache and is often delirious.

395
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,540
The problem is that there were terrible
complications that over took patients in

396
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:08,740
the reaction stage.

397
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,400
Pneumonia was a frequent complication,

398
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,540
so it's kidney failure,
uremia,

399
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,970
gangrene of the extremities,
the ears, the nose, fingers,

400
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:23,680
toes,
the penis,

401
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,580
and there was a case fatality rate then
from Asiatic cholera in the 19th century

402
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,140
of something like 50%.
Today,

403
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,960
as we said last time,
uh,

404
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,990
there is an effective oral rehydration
therapy and the death rate with treatment

405
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,140
is less than 2% today.

406
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,790
That's partly because of the effectiveness
of the treatment and partly because

407
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,850
the El tour bio-type is less virulent
than classic Vibrio cholerae of the first

408
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:01,810
six pandemics.
In any case then,

409
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,260
what were the effects on a community,

410
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:09,950
on a society of an invasion
of a disease of this type?

411
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,970
Was this the return of the plague?
As people speculated,

412
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:22,110
this disease seemed a little
bit to resemble that in
terms of the terror that it

413
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:28,870
inspired and the social chaos
it caused during an outbreak.

414
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,060
Now an outbreak,
let's imagine a 19th century city,

415
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,650
you can pick your own,

416
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,910
let it be London or
Paris or perhaps Naples.

417
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,990
The outbreak would tend to begin with
what 19th century medical community termed

418
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,680
sporadic cholera.

419
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,240
Why that way mount a
small trickle of cases.

420
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:00,280
These would be transmitted in a
neighborhood, a family, a house.

421
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,800
The transmission might be by
contaminated clothing or bed linen,

422
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,600
contaminated food,

423
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:12,810
hand to mouth transmission from tending
a patient and then not washing the

424
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:13,984
hands.

425
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:19,050
Let me give you an example
of from Venice in 1885 there,

426
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:25,261
there was a particularly persistent
outbreak and a single street before the

427
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:30,250
disease became an epidemic
in the city as a whole.

428
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:35,610
And what happened was that this was
traced to a single restaurant and the

429
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:42,211
proprietor terror was a lovely lady who
happened to be tending to her own infant

430
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:47,510
child who was sick with cholera
and an upstairs bedroom.

431
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,140
She would go upstairs and tend to him
and then she would go back downstairs

432
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:57,920
without washing her hands and
prepare food for her clientele.

433
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:03,610
And that was how the disease was spread
in a single street for some time.

434
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,010
Now in fortunate instances,
the disease,

435
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,180
these outbreak,

436
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:16,181
this so called sporadic cholera will
just fade away and the community would

437
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,100
escape a large scale misfortune.

438
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,140
But if the VIP Rio gained access
to the city's water supply,

439
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,550
then the disease would flare
up with epidemic force.

440
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:33,530
And this would be what the 19th century
health authorities called epidemic

441
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:36,080
cholera instead of sporadic.

442
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,010
And if you made a graph
of cases and deaths,

443
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,870
there'd be a sudden spike
in mortality and morbidity.

444
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:45,831
Well,

445
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:50,831
what would be the likely magnitude
of the disaster that would follow if,

446
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:56,051
let us say a major European city had its
water supply contaminated with cholera?

447
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,480
Well, the order of magnitude would
be different from that of the plague.

448
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,590
Cholera was never responsible for the
kind of demographic catastrophe that

449
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:14,861
Europe experienced with the black death
or later invasions of bubonic plague and

450
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:20,900
the 19th century Europe experience.

451
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:26,230
A major population growth and cholera had
little impact on the population surge.

452
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,820
Let's take again the example with Naples,

453
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,640
a city famous for its overcrowding.

454
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,870
It's filled and it's recurring
epidemics of Asiatic cholera.

455
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,950
Let's compare it also with an
earlier experience of bubonic plague.

456
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Naples experienced a terrible epidemic
of plague and 1656 at that time,

457
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,110
the city had about a
population of numbering,

458
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,390
perhaps half a million people.

459
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,780
The state wasn't very good at knowing
exactly how many people lived in the city

460
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,500
and its statistics for mortality or
also to be taken with a grain of salt,

461
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,720
but there were estimates that as many as
300,000 people died of Boob onic plague

462
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,010
and that single year,

463
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,880
let's compare that with cholera.

464
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,970
In 1837 I chose 1837 because that was
the worst epidemic of cholera that Naples

465
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,670
experienced.

466
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:37,270
The population at that time was still
round about half a million people,

467
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,650
but in this worst year of Asiatic Cholera,

468
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,670
about 12,000 people perished.
Now,

469
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,750
I don't after our
experience of boob plague,

470
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,610
I don't want that to be a basis for,
uh,

471
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,470
insensitivity.

472
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,930
This an epidemic in which 12,000
people die is a major disaster,

473
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,800
but it didn't have the
same long term cultural,

474
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:08,920
philosophical and religious impact,
uh,

475
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,700
that the plague earlier had.

476
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,860
And it didn't seem to convince people
that the end of the world had possibly

477
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,703
arrived.

478
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,500
So color compared with
plague is less virulent.

479
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:28,430
The bodily defenses of healthy adults
are often effective and it doesn't have

480
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,750
those efficient vectors,
routes,

481
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:34,650
and fleas that enabled the
plague to reach every home.

482
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:38,180
Also,
unlike the plague,

483
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,220
cholera didn't endure for five
centuries returning every generation.

484
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:48,950
Cholera first invaded Europe in the
1830s and by the 1860s the history of

485
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:56,331
cholera in the industrially
advanced nations of northern
Europe was largely over

486
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,060
and for western Europe as a whole.

487
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:05,450
The 1890s mostly mark the
end and 1911 certainly did.

488
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:13,070
So cholera had only six pandemic
waves that ever invaded Europe,

489
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,500
and each wave was less widespread and
claimed fewer victims than the ones

490
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,070
proceeding it.

491
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,070
That's a very different history than
the history of Boob OnDeck plague.

492
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,170
Well,
how long would an epidemic last?

493
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:34,430
It would normally lasts in a great
European city for the length of the warm

494
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:38,640
summer,
and perhaps the early fall,

495
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,400
it would then recede and fade away
with the new onset of cool weather.

496
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,250
Now,
why would it fade away?

497
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,490
We're Robert Koch who discovered the
Vibrio cholerae set himself that this was

498
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:59,250
something, a question to which he
couldn't give a satisfactory answer.

499
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,510
He said that this was one of the great
cholera mysteries as he called up.

500
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:10,800
But we can speculate with regard to
certain factors that seem important.

501
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,470
One would be a change in weather.

502
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,730
Cold Dry weather is hard on the delicate
vibrio cholerae so like plague and

503
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,980
cholera to in Europe had a
very pronounced seasonality.

504
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,440
It struck during the warm months.

505
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,780
Another factor is an after the disease
had struck those people who are most at

506
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:42,781
risk because of their occupations and
their personal susceptibility and their

507
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:44,350
living conditions.

508
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,840
The epidemic was then like a
fire that ran short of fuel.

509
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,410
It ran short of people who are most
susceptible and at high risk and then

510
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:59,230
communities also,

511
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,500
and this was probably important adopted
measures of self defense and those to

512
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,600
help to cut short the outbreak,

513
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,760
especially later in the century when
the disease was better understood.

514
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,450
It's now I'm known to that the cholera
can survive in a spore form in algae

515
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:26,851
blooms off shore of the great port cities
and so there is a possibility too that

516
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:32,830
the disease was re-import it'd
from the waters off shore.

517
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,830
In any case, what were the
reactions to cholera in a community

518
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:45,620
here or there was an analogy possibly
with Plagge and that cholera to generated

519
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,160
terror and fear.

520
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,710
This is partly because of the
agonizing nature of the symptoms.

521
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,060
Of this disease.

522
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,900
And the fact too was that the symptoms
of cholera suggested were analogous to

523
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,490
something that people were already
familiar with and that is poisoning the

524
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:15,170
symptoms of cholera,

525
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:19,850
had symptoms that resembled a,

526
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,420
someone who had taken strict
[inaudible] for example,

527
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,130
rat poisoning.

528
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,820
And so people were suspicious that perhaps
this might be a crime rather than a

529
00:40:32,781 --> 00:40:33,890
natural event.

530
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:39,310
Let me show you some images that convey
the sense of terror that people felt at

531
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:45,260
the time. Uh, this is,

532
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,990
uh, king cholera. We've
said that's one of,

533
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,370
it's the terms that it
was associated with.

534
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,450
And you can see king cholera
astride the globe. Uh,

535
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,480
and this was clearly a sense of
it's [inaudible] or we can look at,

536
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,190
uh, this is New York City
with cholera approaching.

537
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,230
And again, you can see, uh,

538
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,920
the kind of terror that
was associated with it.

539
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,520
Or let's look as well,
and you can see cholera,

540
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,920
a striding over the defensive bulwarks.
Uh,

541
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,560
those are the kinds of,
this is clearly an Earl,

542
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:26,330
one of the early pandemics.

543
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,250
And what you can see is the attempt to
control this disease with the plague

544
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:33,160
measures.
You can see the troops,

545
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:38,150
sanitary coordinates and all the rest
trying to keep out the monster as it was

546
00:41:38,151 --> 00:41:42,350
called. But those in fact turned
out for reasons we'll be coming to,

547
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,430
to be entirely ineffective
in dealing with cholera.

548
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Unlike the plug or a,

549
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:54,641
we can see and hear the analogy when
people's minds that this might be the

550
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:56,150
return of the plague.

551
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:01,210
It's clear because here we can see the
grim reaper with his side mowing down the

552
00:42:02,611 --> 00:42:05,560
whole population. Or, uh,

553
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,640
we can see once again in the
19th century a revival here.

554
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,260
This is the danse macabre
with death calling people.

555
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,243
Um,

556
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,043
yeah.

557
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:22,000
Uh, and there you can see
again the dance macabre.

558
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,040
Here's the invitation
of death to come downs.

559
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,303
MMM.

560
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:34,620
So those are switch of
graphic illustrations of
the kind of fear that this

561
00:42:35,441 --> 00:42:37,390
disease caused.
Well,

562
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:40,660
it also caused a scapegoating.

563
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:46,230
So imagine for example,
let's go back to the first,

564
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,140
okay.

565
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,480
Uh,

566
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,480
arrival of cholera in the 1830s and 1830,

567
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:54,680
let's think of the Russian empire.

568
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:55,680
Okay.

569
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,680
When cholera struck Saint
Petersburg in 1830 at that time,

570
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,900
Russia was at war with Poland and Russians
believed at the time that the disease

571
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,260
was an act of terror by Polish agents.

572
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,470
So caller gave rise to men
hunts or witch hunts find it.

573
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,080
The search for scapegoats,
foreigners, gypsies,

574
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,140
someone newly arriving in town could be
suspicious and therefore could be set

575
00:43:24,721 --> 00:43:27,180
upon and attacked as a scapegoat.

576
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:32,870
Colorado also led because of its fear to
mass flight and some cities experienced

577
00:43:34,591 --> 00:43:39,591
almost biblical exoduses with tens of
thousands of people evacuating cities and

578
00:43:41,011 --> 00:43:44,970
fear for their lives and
justice and Defoe's account.

579
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,350
It was the wealthier classes you could
afford the journey and at some work to go

580
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,630
had who went first.

581
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,170
A consequence would be
that the administration and
public services in the city

582
00:43:57,631 --> 00:44:01,380
that was being evacuated more in chaos,

583
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,400
businesses shut down.
There was mass unemployment,

584
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,820
there was hunger and
shortages of all kinds.

585
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:13,950
There was also a new strain
on class relationships.

586
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,390
Cholera was a class disease,
I would argue,

587
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,950
and then it caused a sharply unequal
burden of death and suffering.

588
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,530
Unlike Plagge,
unlike smallpox polar,

589
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,180
my mirror only shows the poor.
Now,

590
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:35,100
there are reasons in terms of risk
factors that explain that difference.

591
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,460
There was normally by this time a pattern
of housing segregation that is to say

592
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,830
poor, the poor and the
wealthy didn't live in uh,

593
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,480
next to one another.
And the poor suffered from overcrowding,

594
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:54,960
filth, poor diet, lack of light,
and the wells they drank from.

595
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,200
We're not the same as
those used by the wealthy.

596
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:05,210
A good example of this difference in one
that cause a sinister speculations in

597
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:11,730
time of plague. As you know, those
who tended the plague, victims,

598
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:16,790
physicians and priests
parish in unimaginable
proportions during the time of

599
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:21,390
cholera,
however,

600
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,870
doctors and priests moved among the
most sported slumps and yet mysteriously

601
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,730
they manage to stay
healthy for the most part,

602
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,880
while those around them fell ill and died
there good epidemiological reasons for

603
00:45:38,731 --> 00:45:39,420
this.

604
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,070
Doctors didn't eat and sleep and
the sick rooms as the poor did.

605
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,320
They had better diets. They wash their
hands, they drink different water,

606
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,750
but to the urban poor,

607
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,930
the immunity of the wealthier of
classes was highly suspicious.

608
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,510
It suggested to some
the idea of poisoning,

609
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:06,030
particularly since the poor in the
19th century warrant medicalized.

610
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,920
That is to say they had little contact
and experience with medical attention.

611
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,730
And so on effect,
uh,

612
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,350
during the cholera years
was often violence.

613
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:21,620
There were assaults on doctors and some
places crowds invaded hospitals and lots

614
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:27,510
of directors and the suspicions
weren't all in one direction.

615
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,580
The wealthy at this time in the
19th century had a fear of those.

616
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,930
They called the dangerous classes and
they were thinking of the dangerous

617
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:41,700
classes as dangerous politically.
This was the rebellious century,

618
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,630
dangerous morally and in religious terms,

619
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,770
but also they now seem to
be dangerous medically.

620
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,110
And I think this is a
factor in some of the, uh,

621
00:46:55,350 --> 00:47:00,000
extreme violence that one sees in 1848,
for example,

622
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,710
or in the Paris commune,

623
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:07,080
there was a strain on
social relationships. Well,

624
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:11,910
what happened in terms of public
policy and organized effects?

625
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,150
Well, the first thing that happened, uh,

626
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,040
was a tendency to revive the plague.
Measures to contain it.

627
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,570
Collar put unprecedented pressure
on authorities to do something,

628
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,420
to take some sort of effective action.

629
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,920
And it was that the states
responded first off,

630
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:35,500
Russia, Austria, pressure for example,

631
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,230
by reviving the plague regulations,

632
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,990
Len based and maritime quarantine,

633
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:45,310
sanitary cordons lots Sorentos.
One can see this and pictures.

634
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:50,311
This is a cholera Lazzarato or
one can see a here is a cholera,

635
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:57,280
the Vibrio are arriving and you can see
that the board of health is trying to

636
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:00,850
stop it and there are sanitary
coordinates and all the rest.

637
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,930
This is a depiction of the early
outbreak or the attempt you,

638
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,900
this is familiar to you from time of
plague to purify the atmosphere by burning

639
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:13,300
sulfur and with fire.
These were,

640
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:18,301
or there were funeral regulations and
you can see here again the people bring

641
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:21,190
out your dead and transporting uh,

642
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:25,990
the victims to the cemetery for rapid,
hasty burial.

643
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,480
The funeral regulations,
the results,

644
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:31,510
then we're to maximize terror,

645
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,850
economic disruption and flight.

646
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:39,310
The plague regulations against
cholera caused political effects,

647
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,760
but they were counterproductive
in terms of the disease,

648
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:47,710
but they taught a dangerous lesson
that outsiders could be dangerous.

649
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,540
And so, uh, we see then
they don't stop the cholera.

650
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,410
They don't stop the cholera because
they're asymptomatic carriers.

651
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:01,530
Because the flight of population causes
trying to escape the plague measures

652
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,040
disperses the disease because cholera can
flow and rivers and waterways past the

653
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:11,560
troops who are trying to contain it.

654
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,950
So the plague measures weren't
effective against cholera,

655
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:19,360
but I'm going to argue there
what were the longterm effects,

656
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,890
and I'm running rapidly out of time,
but just saying that there were,

657
00:49:23,891 --> 00:49:27,010
I would argue,
not just immediate drama,

658
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,230
there were longterm effects.

659
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,440
Cholera led to a big debate in the
medical profession about contagion,

660
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:37,330
aneurysm,
rapid or not.

661
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:42,100
It led to the development of
epidemiology as a medical discipline.

662
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,050
It contributed to the coming of the germ
theory of disease in terms of public

663
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:47,590
health.

664
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:52,590
It led to a new set of measures
of sanitary improvements
that we'll be talking

665
00:49:53,111 --> 00:49:58,111
about next time and even to the refitting
and sanitary revolution in cities and

666
00:50:01,511 --> 00:50:05,980
even the rebuilding of
places like Paris and Naples.

667
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:11,070
Although the color was not the only fact
in places like Paris and it caused or

668
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,920
mortality revolution in urban cities.

669
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,230
We'll be talking more about that.

670
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:22,240
There are reasons then just say that
although cholera caused many of the

671
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:26,560
immediate affects of
terror like the plague,

672
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,900
it didn't lead to the
same kind of mortality,

673
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,870
and it didn't have the same
long term consequences,

674
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,960
but it did have a number of
longterm consequences that
I think it's well to bear

675
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:43,220
in mind. This was the great
dreaded disease of the whole,

676
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,420
of the 19th century.
