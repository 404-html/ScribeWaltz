1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,420
Well, I wanted to begin with
just a housekeeping item,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,580
which is that next Monday we'll have a,

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,130
the last class if you
want to call it that,

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,120
but it will be completely different
in that it will be a review session.

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,830
I'll elaborate on what
format that might take,

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,900
but essentially I'll be count,

7
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:29,730
there won't be anything that I'm planning
to lecture about. On the contrary,

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,640
it will be your opportunity to raise
questions or make comments on, uh,

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,420
any aspects of the material
that you wish to discuss more.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,250
So, uh, the format will be that
there'll be a microphone and uh,

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,180
you'll come up and use it and
ask questions and then, uh,

12
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:52,080
we'll discuss anything that you wish.
So it will really be,

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,710
I'll be in your hands and that
will be a glass that will, uh,

14
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,770
would be helpful if you came with things
that you wanted to discuss or things

15
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,670
that you think that we
should, uh, go into more.

16
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,470
So that will be what we'll do
on Monday for today. Instead,

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,550
we're going to talk about a three.
In fact,

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,340
new diseases that are um,

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,700
demonstrated once more that
the post World War Two idea,

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,830
the complacent assumption.
Dot.

21
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,020
Modern medical science and public health
had the tools to protect society and to

22
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:43,980
eradicate diseases one
by one when not illusion.

23
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,990
A fostered by the example of smallpox and
nearly by the eradication of polio was

24
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:58,971
once again punctured and as it had been
earlier by the emergence of HIV AIDS,

25
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,210
most of all, it showed that our
society is still vulnerable,

26
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,160
particularly to respiratory
infections in the industrial world,

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,190
transmitted by air or droplets.

28
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,300
They're true diseases of
globalization and maternity,

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,840
the thrive on high population density
and modern means of high speed

30
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,530
communication.

31
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,100
So I want to end our semester
by talking about SARS,

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,440
avian flu and swine flu and some of
the lessons we've learned from those

33
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,570
experiences.

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,720
I would regard them as the first new
diseases of the 21st century and also as

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,680
our great dress rehearsals for something
much more serious that may or may not

36
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:57,210
come later. Once again, I don't
want to make a prediction.

37
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,190
So let's begin with SARS.

38
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,930
The first great dress
rehearsal of the 20th century.

39
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,420
As you know,

40
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:12,421
or remember it began in November,

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,630
2002 with an index case,
uh,

42
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,650
from someone from the Quandong province
in southern China as severe and unusual

43
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,283
pneumonia.

44
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,850
What took place then in China was not
something an ex that was extraordinary as

45
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,360
our press tried to persuade us.
Rather,

46
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,640
it was something that's
happened many times,

47
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,730
the emergence of a new pathogen
previously unknown only in the sixties and

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,130
seventies.

49
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,130
Was there a boundless optimism about the
capacity of modern medicine to prevent

50
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,400
that from happening again?
Once again,

51
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:04,070
we're reminded that the
natural world isn't static,

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,600
but in a state of constant
Darwinian evolution with
the consequence that they're

53
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:15,331
always and inevitably new and emerging
diseases and viruses as you know,

54
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,290
are specially capable of
sudden rapid mutation.

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,960
Well,

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,960
the media did us a disservice at the
outset of SARS with sensationalizing

57
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:38,320
headlines,
attempting to stir up fear.

58
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,770
Examples being is this the Big One?

59
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,110
Um, killer bugged and uh, the light,

60
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,520
the Chinese authorities and their
response to SARS practice to conspiracy of

61
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,000
silence at the outset,

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,600
producing no reports or statistics
and censoring the press.

63
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,440
This will remind you of what happened
in China that also concealment isn't

64
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:15,490
something we haven't counted before
encountered before and it'll remind you of

65
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:19,450
other examples of public
health by concealment. Now,

66
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,460
why we might speculate,

67
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,960
did the Chinese decide
to conceal this outbreak?

68
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,510
First we could say would be the fear
of applicant omic repercussions.

69
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,720
The world economy at the time was already
stagnant and there were fear of the

70
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:42,100
implications for vulnerable
sectors. Travel, tourism,

71
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,210
investment.
There was a matter of national pride.

72
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,990
The World Health Organization had
already produced a report ranking world

73
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:57,121
healthcare systems and China had
ranked 144th just below Bangladesh.

74
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,140
So a medical emergency could cast a
new and harsh light on Chinese public

75
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,424
health.

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,120
It's also probably true that authoritarian
political systems have people who

77
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:15,650
man,

78
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,570
the op around us whose career
depends on producing good news.

79
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,360
We might also point to what we might
call an authoritarian paternalism.

80
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,140
The idea of sparing the population
anxiety and avoiding giving rise to

81
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:37,610
challenges to the state
and its priorities.

82
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,620
And then he case and whatever the
reasons China place the health of its own

83
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:47,621
citizens at risk by failing to enable
them to make informed decisions about

84
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:49,820
their own health.

85
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,250
And it took the risk also of allowing
the new disease to threaten the

86
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,930
international community,

87
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,980
delaying the process of patient detective
work that was required to unravel the

88
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:09,110
secrets of this new infection.
Finally,

89
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,760
on the 9th of February,

90
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,360
the Chinese Ministry of Health notified
the World Health Organization of some

91
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:21,941
305 cases and six municipalities
in southern China.

92
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,150
This too was a serious underestimate
and it was followed by weeks of tardy,

93
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:33,641
release of dubious and statistics that
were meant still to be reassuring.

94
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,970
So for weeks,

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
the World Health Organization wasn't
allowed to send teams of researchers to

96
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:46,640
investigate the disturbing
events in China.

97
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,910
The pathogen,
which is

98
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,930
this one was unknown.

99
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,960
The time of the outbreak was now known
to be a previously unincorporated corona

100
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,970
virus.

101
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,800
It structure was a schematic
picture of it would be that,

102
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,293
okay,

103
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,570
it's early names. Uh, what to call it.

104
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:17,630
It was called human pneumonia associated
corona virus because of one of its

105
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:24,300
early victims.
It was called the Urbani virus,

106
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,240
but the name that stuck was SARS,

107
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,270
severe acute respiratory syndrome.

108
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,450
Okay,

109
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:37,450
let's follow our usual procedure and
look at the symptoms and the epidemiology

110
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,660
and some of the effects on
society of the SARS outbreak.

111
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,880
In terms of symptoms,

112
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,120
the disease was first identified
and defined by Dr Carlo or bonding,

113
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,750
a 46 year old infectious disease expert
for the who who was working at an

114
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,410
annoying and once one of the early
physicians to encounter the disease.

115
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,430
He contracted it and died soon after.

116
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,470
The symptoms were an incubation
period of about a week,

117
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,540
five to 10 days or so,

118
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,900
followed by a sudden onset of fever
about to a hundred degrees to 101 general

119
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:24,780
malaise, headache, muscle pain, dizziness,

120
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,670
sore throat,
three to seven days later.

121
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,820
The majority of cases improve
spontaneously with no lasting ill effect,

122
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,110
but a minority of cases worsened at
that very point with lower respiratory

123
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:46,170
involvement.
And this led to a hacking,

124
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,970
nonproductive cough,

125
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,340
terrible shortness of
breath and chest pain.

126
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,220
It's worth remembering that the disease
at this stage was thoroughly unpleasant.

127
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,241
Uh,

128
00:10:00,241 --> 00:10:05,241
Toronto nurse suffering from SARS was
interviewed by phone from her hospital

129
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:10,581
room and she said that the cough she
was experiencing was so violent that she

130
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:16,311
turned blue and it caused her to fall
to our knees and a minority of cases.

131
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:23,690
There was a progress to very severe
respiratory distress requiring oxygen and

132
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,280
mechanical support.

133
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,930
Rays revealed what was
called atypical pneumonia,

134
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,290
which was a somewhat confusing term
because it had been used that until that

135
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:38,580
time for a different condition.

136
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,900
On the 7th of May,

137
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,900
2003 the World Health
Organization suggested that
SARS had a case fatality rate

138
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,510
of about 15% or so.

139
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,230
There was no known specific treatment
and patients were given broad spectrum

140
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,500
antibiotics and antivirals,

141
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,740
but they weren't very effective and
treatment was really symptomatic and

142
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:10,140
supportive.
What about transmission?

143
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,070
The dominant mode for transmitting
SARS was clearly face to face contact

144
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,280
droplets from coughing or sneezing
and the droplets were inhaled or the

145
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,480
contaminated objects that is fun.

146
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Mites and the person touching them and
then bringing the hand to the mouth could

147
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,430
ingest the virus.

148
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,300
This mode of transmission was encouraging
for public health because it meant

149
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:49,701
that the disease required prolonged
contact at close range and was much less

150
00:11:50,671 --> 00:11:53,890
contagious than say the Spanish influenza,

151
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,160
smallpox or pneumonic plague and the
dominant pattern of the epidemic was for

152
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:06,241
SARS just spread in tight clusters of
people closely gathered around a patient

153
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,250
healthcare personnel, their
family members, hospital visitors,

154
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,430
guests on the same floor of a hotel or
residents of the same wing of an urban

155
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:24,001
tenement dwelling and the disease like
airborne viral infections in general

156
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,380
seems to be an equal opportunity
affliction that can pass to all classes of

157
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,950
society, the young, the old,

158
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,610
the healthy and those with
preexisting conditions,

159
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,150
but there also was some evidence,

160
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,830
although mostly remained confined
to the hospital environment,

161
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,300
at least outside of China,
it could spread to communities.

162
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,070
There were speculations during the
outbreak of people who were called super

163
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,440
spreaders,
sort of viral.

164
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:03,820
Typhoid Marys was the
image who are unusually,

165
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:04,660
very [inaudible].

166
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,430
The new shed viruses inhaled
at a greater distance,

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
perhaps through the air
conditioning system of a hotel
or the circulating air of

168
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:16,534
an airplane.

169
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,060
There was speculation that sometimes
it could spread through the fecal oral

170
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:25,720
route or through asymptomatic carriers.

171
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,280
In any case,

172
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,400
the disease spread from southern China
and Kwang Dong province to its next

173
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:39,940
epicenter,
which was Hong Kong,

174
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,150
which was particularly important because
of population density and mass air

175
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:47,200
travel.

176
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Hong Kong being one of the great hubs
of the international air travel network.

177
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,803
The,

178
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,720
it's important noting too
that Hong Kong had intense,

179
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,700
constant links with neighboring
southern China in sheer size.

180
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:11,701
It had some 6 million people and was
known as one of the most densely crowded

181
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:16,660
cities on earth and possess
the busiest airport in Asia.

182
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,750
The first outbreak was,
uh,

183
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,800
the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong
and then very rapidly thereafter,

184
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,460
the Prince of Wales Hospital,

185
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,210
the disease at the initial initial cases
wasn't really recognized and no special

186
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:43,141
precautionary measures were taken though
the hospital and the hotel soon became

187
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:49,471
world famous as the first Pho sigh of
infection outside of Kwang Dong promised

188
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,490
the people afflicted early
on were doctors and nurses,

189
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,850
orderlies attendance,
hospital visitors,

190
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,700
and a couple of guests at the hotel.

191
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:07,390
So Hong Kong became the second world
epicentre epicentre and the disease spread

192
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:12,950
from there using air travel as its means,

193
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,610
it went to three places,
particularly.

194
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,470
First was to annoy in Vietnam,

195
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,600
then to Singapore,

196
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,510
and then on to this continent to Toronto.

197
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,250
It struck Toronto through a 78 year old
immigrant from Hong Kong who had been

198
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:42,560
staying at their Metropol hotel
before returning to Toronto.

199
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,940
She was hospitalized and died,
um,

200
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,960
and the Scarborough Hospital in Toronto.

201
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,120
There was soon a joke
about, um, uh, about SARS.

202
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,430
Uh, that is to say, uh, are you
worried about terrorists? I'm, no,

203
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,840
we're worried about Canadians.
Uh, and then he case, uh,

204
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,310
what was that? What were the public
health measures that were adopted?

205
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:11,811
Uh,

206
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:16,811
first thing is to note that I've said
this was a great dress rehearsal and it

207
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:20,570
was a transformative event.

208
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,550
Although we're going to see that all
of these three pandemics that were

209
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:30,551
discussed this morning were relatively
limited in terms of their impact.

210
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,830
They are really important for our
consideration because they marked a real

211
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,140
change in public health.

212
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:45,190
One of the few factors was that SARS
led to an unprecedented coordination of

213
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,690
international public health responses.

214
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,940
What happened was really extraordinary.
As Julie Gerberding,

215
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,970
the director of the CDC pointed out
saying that this was a monumental

216
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,220
international transformation that
what happened on the 12th of March,

217
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,740
the World Health Organization issued
a global alert by the 15th a travel

218
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:17,561
advisory and thereafter some 11
laboratories in 19 countries were linked

219
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,110
electronically.

220
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,970
As they shared all information and
real time hunting for the pathogen,

221
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,920
they began genetic sequencing and began
work attempting to find a vaccine and a

222
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:36,620
reliable diagnostic test.

223
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,150
The role exalt was success
in world record time.

224
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,050
On April 16 the World Health Organization
laboratory network announced that it

225
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:53,111
had identified the pathogen responsible
for SARS on by the 26th of March,

226
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,980
there was the beginning of electronic
ground rent ground rounds in which the

227
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:06,861
intranet was used to bring together d
clinicians from 13 countries to share

228
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:12,810
information on the care and
maintenance of SARS patients.

229
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,520
Those were novel features.
In addition,

230
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,440
there were some traditional measures that
were taken that constitute in part or

231
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:25,800
review of things that you're
already well familiar with.

232
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,710
A team of World Health Organization.

233
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:33,711
Epidemiologists began investigating the
epidemic in southern China and it's not

234
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:39,141
where spread some airports
began to quarantine.

235
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:42,480
People who arrive,
they took their temperatures,

236
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,570
examined them for symptoms and gave them
advisory cards with information on what

237
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:50,970
to do if they fell ill.

238
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,590
Hospitals set up isolation wards with
the capacity to contain air and with

239
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:03,390
barrier protection for hospital personnel,
double gowns,

240
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,740
facemasks goggles,
gloves and disinfection,

241
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,060
changes of shoes in affected areas.

242
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,530
There was the rigorous tracking
of all contacts, have known cases,

243
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,730
there was quarantine, uh, in some places,

244
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,020
even house arrests with video cameras,
unannounced,

245
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:29,520
police visits, sanctions,
fines and all the rest.

246
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,790
And you might like to know that the
Toronto Star also record mended reading

247
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:40,281
material for those in quarantine and it
looked a little bit like something that

248
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,760
might be a reading list for our course.
Uh,

249
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:48,930
that is the most popular view
book for the SARS patients.

250
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:52,560
You'll all be glad to know
was Daniel to fall journal.

251
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:56,820
If a plague gear and they also
read Khumbu and Boccaccio,

252
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,450
um, uh, in their quarantine in Toronto,

253
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,350
there was public information in the
media and on the web enabling citizens to

254
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:12,000
make rational public health choices.
There was compulsory masking,

255
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,010
the closing of schools,

256
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,960
counselation of sports events and
other large gatherings of people.

257
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,640
All of those were measures
that were fairly traditional.

258
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,930
So what's striking is a kind
of contrast on the one hand,

259
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,530
the high tech end working out the
biology and epidemiology of SARS with

260
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:39,210
extraordinary rapid,
efficient and high tech interventions.

261
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,830
On the other hand,

262
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,300
public health measures and
treatment were rather old fashioned,

263
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,380
low tech and traditional,

264
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,220
but the public health measures
were effective by mid May.

265
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,370
There were signs that the outbreaks
were retreating and being successfully

266
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:05,410
contained and healthcare settings.
By June 18th,

267
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,730
as the global epidemic
reached its hundredth day,

268
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,240
the number of cases was down to a handful.

269
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,070
On the 5th of July,

270
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,350
the World Health Organization announced
that stars had been controlled

271
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:21,280
worldwide.

272
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,780
The total by the end was something like
8,000 cases and a few hundred deaths.

273
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,590
Nonetheless, the passage of
this mark to transformation,

274
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,620
as I said in international public
health inter connectedness,

275
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,080
it also left behind it.
Uh,

276
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,620
important effects on communities.

277
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,930
Hong Kong was described as a ghost town.
It's shops,

278
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:57,250
restaurants, theaters, churches,
public health, transport.

279
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,570
We're all deserted.

280
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,630
And many closed communion
wasn't administered in
churches and daily life was

281
00:22:04,181 --> 00:22:09,181
transformed for those in quarantine
and for healthcare personnel.

282
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,910
A joke circulated in Hong Kong that
if you wanted space to yourself,

283
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,270
all you had to do is sneeze and
you'd immediately be left alone.

284
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,480
There was economic impact,

285
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,930
the collapse of tourism
and the retail industry.

286
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,130
One estimate was that some $10 billion
were lost in Asia because of the impact

287
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:39,961
of SARS with knock on effects on
unemployment and fragile economic growth.

288
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,640
Toronto,

289
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
this epicenter in North America
was less severely affected,

290
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:54,030
but there were things there too that
reminders of parts of our course that you

291
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,510
now know very well.

292
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,950
There were reports in the city
that it was being seized by a SARS,

293
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:04,951
pounding the stigmatization
of victims and scapegoating.

294
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,100
A nurse who had been hospitalized and
later interviewed in the press reported

295
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:15,430
that a crowd had gathered
outside her home and stoned it,

296
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,740
or there was in the Canadian press a
series of reports on what was called SARS.

297
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,134
Racism,

298
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,560
particularly in China Town and children
of Asian origin were bullied in school

299
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:35,160
and Asian Canadians were shunned and
public Toronto also spawned reports of a

300
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:38,830
general fear.

301
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,860
Polls show that 60% of Canadians we're
worried or very worried about contracting

302
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:50,561
source and even places not
touched by the disease experience.

303
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,850
Some ripple shock effects.

304
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,940
Los Angeles and San Francisco had people
reported that surgical masks had been

305
00:23:59,061 --> 00:23:59,900
sold out.

306
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,590
Ers and primary care physicians
were overwhelmed with
people with coughs and the

307
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:11,141
common cold Chinese restaurants and China
towns in the United States in various

308
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:13,940
cities were deserted.

309
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:20,050
And Health Canada reported an outbreak
of what it turned SARS racism against the

310
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:22,280
Asian community.

311
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:28,090
So the experience of SARS was the first
dress rehearsal of the 21st century for

312
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:31,400
emerging diseases.

313
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,560
And I think it showed that the world
community was still vulnerable,

314
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,590
especially to airborne diseases.

315
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:45,310
SARS tested the preparedness of public
health and the preparedness of political

316
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:49,310
authorities.
On the positive side,

317
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,400
it revealed and stimulated
an extraordinary technical
and scientific capacity

318
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,150
and interlocking laboratories that
identified the pathogen and in the ground

319
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:04,160
rounds in cyberspace.

320
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,260
But I would argue that there
wasn't really room for complacency.

321
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,920
The world was lucky and dodged a bullet
with SARS for a variety of fortuitous

322
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:17,090
circumstances.

323
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,570
The disease spread by droplets isn't
really very readily transmissible.

324
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,360
The chronology was fortunate.

325
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,640
The disease began to spread globally
in the spring, which is, you know,

326
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,730
is normally the beginning of the
end of the flu season and there was

327
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,120
serendipity.
The disease spread to Hong Kong,

328
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,280
Singapore and Toronto,

329
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:48,670
and those were all places with highly
developed healthcare systems and resources

330
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:50,870
making containment possible.

331
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,590
One wonders what the
result might have been had.

332
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:59,591
The earlier travelers who spread SARS
go to different destinations in resource

333
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:03,800
poor third world cities.

334
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,700
So that was the first dress rehearsal.

335
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,660
The second followed fairly quickly after,

336
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,410
and this was avian influenza,

337
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,440
h five and one which was a
new or emerging epizootic.

338
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,880
It was first isolated in 1996 but began
as a disease of waterfowl in Southeast

339
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Asia in mid 2003 early cases were
mostly undetected and unreported.

340
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,470
There then followed three small waves
of this influenza outbreak beginning in

341
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:51,960
December,
2003 January,

342
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,860
2004 in Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Cambodia,

343
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,360
Indonesia first among susceptible birds.

344
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,630
It's spread rapidly and affected their
internal organs with a mortality rate of

345
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:07,920
nearly a hundred percent.

346
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,820
And this was one of the great global
epizootic with tens of millions of wild

347
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,290
birds perishing.

348
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,730
Then h five and one demonstrated that
it was capable of transmission to human

349
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:29,310
beings who came into contact
with infected poultry butchers,

350
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:34,290
people who res life pulse rate or
live in close contact with them.

351
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,320
Um, this is, oh,

352
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,040
that's the masking from SARS,

353
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,050
but I wanted to show you someone
at risk during the epidemic of,

354
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,210
um,
avian flu.

355
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,360
Then there was,

356
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,390
there were human cases that began a
second detected wave in June and July,

357
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,360
2004 that ended in November,

358
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,070
2004 and a third wave
beginning in December,

359
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,480
2004 again in Southeast Asia.
Once again,

360
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,220
if we look at,
uh,

361
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,130
I wanted to show you a few cases of
humor generated by the Asian flu.

362
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,300
Uh, we hear, we see a person
saying that they're safe at last,

363
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,350
but in fact they weren't really,
uh,

364
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:35,850
then there's this one which might take
you a second to see what's happened to

365
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:37,790
our friend Donald Duck.
Uh,

366
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,810
I think it's worth knowing that epidemic
diseases sometimes also generate a

367
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,440
human response through a,

368
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:50,760
and then there's this one that
I was particularly fond of, uh,

369
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,800
which is, uh, uh, your
flock of geese and of, um,

370
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,230
you know,

371
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,230
poultry with one sneezing in the back
and someone in the front sang very funny.

372
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,920
Uh, in any case, uh,

373
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:08,640
the spread was by
migratory birds in flight,

374
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,160
but also by the great trade
routes of the poultry industry.

375
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:20,040
Uh, the trade and chickens and
feathers and chicken parts, uh,

376
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:25,041
for USAS feed chicken excrement
for use as fertilizer.

377
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,820
Once again,

378
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,850
the world was fortunate in that avian
flu didn't spread readily among human

379
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:34,110
beings.

380
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,920
We then experienced our
third rehearsal for the 21st,

381
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,640
and this was swine flu
that all of you know,

382
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,950
h one n one.

383
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,840
It first appeared in Mexico in March,

384
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,870
April of 2009 as far as is known then
swept the globe and isn't in fact,

385
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,810
um,

386
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:06,810
hasn't entirely EBD as we
meet this morning thus far.

387
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:08,500
However,

388
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,500
apart from the early phase of the
disease in Mexico where it was,

389
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,080
um, fairly wild, it has been,

390
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:21,820
it was fairly serious in Mexico.
It's been elsewhere,

391
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,880
a widespread but relatively mild disease
that's infected millions and millions

392
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:32,260
of people.
But with a strictly limited mortality,

393
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,880
I'm mortality less even
than seasonal influenza.

394
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,980
But we need to remember that we
don't know the end of this story yet.

395
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,650
Um, it's viruses, uh,

396
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:50,651
for influenza are highly
unstable and capable of mutating.

397
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,120
And so it could achieve still a greater,
very elements.

398
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:00,180
And we know from previous outbreaks of
influenza that it could return in future

399
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:02,141
waves.

400
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:07,141
Often a powder of influenza outbreaks
has been to have the series of waves.

401
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,800
We don't know what will
happen with the swine flu.

402
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,090
This was the first epidemic disease.
However,

403
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,720
and this was a major transformation in
public health to appear after the entry

404
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:27,811
into force of the new international health
regulations of 2005 that were signed

405
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:34,861
by 194 nations including all members
of the World Health Organization.

406
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:41,610
Those regulations were intended to
provide rapid international response to

407
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:47,461
public health threats and in particular
the old regulations had declared that

408
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:54,220
there needed to be reporting only
for diseases that were already known.

409
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:59,250
It seemed to assume a static world
without the emergence of new diseases.

410
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,760
The new regulations took that into account
and called for compulsory reporting

411
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,630
of disease events of known diseases,

412
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,250
but also new ones,

413
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,610
new public health threats and the new
regulations than required reporting.

414
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
They standardized and improved intern
national surveillance and they allowed

415
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:30,270
World Health Organization intervention
through regularized procedures and they

416
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:36,601
played the new regulations and important
role in the unfolding pandemic.

417
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,260
Indeed,

418
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:43,260
the coordination of the international
response to swine flu at every level was

419
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:49,451
one of the most encouraging lessons of
this particular pandemic along with the

420
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:55,361
speed with which a vaccine was developed
and distributed along with antiviral

421
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:59,600
medications.
But once again,

422
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,540
there was no real place for complacency.

423
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,620
It was true and this was a worrying sign
that the disease took the world public

424
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:11,990
health community by surprise.

425
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,220
The ruling Dogma and matters of influenza
was not the next threat would emerge

426
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:25,030
in the far east and it was there
that surveillance was concentrated,

427
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,940
but this was a pandemic that surprised
everyone by breaking out first of all in

428
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:36,221
Mexico and it did so at a time that no
one was expecting in the spring rather

429
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:43,241
than in the early fall or winter
as influenza normally does.

430
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:49,510
The crisis also exposed a lack of
capacity in the public health system,

431
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:56,650
limited surge capacity in terms
of hospital beds or caregivers.

432
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,830
There was an ongoing public distrust of
vaccination as something dangerous there

433
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:05,511
was.

434
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:10,511
It also showed the capacity of airborne
respiratory disease to emerge without

435
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:16,121
warning and to spread rapidly across
the globe before vaccines could be

436
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:21,671
developed to contain them and as
in the case of SARS and avian flu,

437
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,880
so to h one n one show that the world
community was fortunate because this

438
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:32,210
turned out really to be addressed.

439
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:37,211
Rehearsal in the pathogen
had a very limited virulence.

440
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,200
So as a society,
how prepared war we

441
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,520
once a pandemic strain appeared,

442
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,150
it took quite a bit of time.

443
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,460
I think we should say that neither
doomsday pessimism nor complacency or

444
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:59,810
rational,
the threat is real,

445
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,140
but pessimism is also unrealistic and
there are many steps that could be taken

446
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,060
to contain the threat.

447
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,360
The SARS lesson showed us that virologists
can now be instantly linked via the

448
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,440
web along round the globe,

449
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:27,010
and that clinicians can
exchange information on patient
care in the same manner.

450
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:33,250
SARS was epic making in this organized
response and this process was

451
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:39,491
strengthened through avian flu and
swine flu especially important,

452
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,130
as I've said,

453
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,160
was the entry into force of the new set
of international health regulations and

454
00:35:47,441 --> 00:35:52,441
individual communities and countries now
put into place advanced planning after

455
00:35:56,701 --> 00:36:01,701
SARS with procedures before the
next emergency globalization
and other words was

456
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:08,310
not only a health risk,
but also a resource.

457
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,080
And you can see the difference
right here on our campus.

458
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,780
SARS,
I would argue,

459
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,970
caught Yale unprepared and
the result was confusion,

460
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,090
fear and delay.

461
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,210
By the time of the swine flu outbreak.
However,

462
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,240
the lesson had been learned and it was
very impressive to know that this time

463
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:42,111
around there was a coherent strategy that
everyone was kept informed throughout

464
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,160
the course of events and perhaps the
only worrying aspect was something that

465
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,390
wasn't our community's fault,
but it's sobering global issue.

466
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,170
It was worth remembering that last fall
at the height of the swine outbreak,

467
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,320
vaccines arrived just as the disease
was moving on from the state of

468
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:09,630
Connecticut.
In any case,

469
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,690
in the absence of an effective
therapy or prophylactic for patients,

470
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:21,650
supportive care and nursing are crucial
considerations and one could argue that

471
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:28,281
perhaps for profit medicine has squeezed
the surge capacity out of our system

472
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,710
and radically reduced the
ratio of nurses to patients.

473
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,360
There was also a crucially
important factor,

474
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,390
which was the race to develop a vaccine
and here to cultivate the virus in the

475
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,690
case, for example, of SARS,

476
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,230
massive numbers of ha or avian flu.

477
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,820
What was discovered was the need
for massive numbers of hen eggs.

478
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,800
And so the poultry industry should
perhaps have been declared of crucial

479
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:06,801
importance because the hens themselves
were needed for the vaccine,

480
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,960
but with parish and crippling numbers
in the event of the avian flu going

481
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:14,664
further,

482
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,450
communities also learned that they
could plan their response in advance.

483
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,250
They could take measures
to educate about coughing,

484
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,290
sneezing, etiquette, hand
sanitizing, the danger of fomites,

485
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,470
the utility of masking and the utility
of avoiding assemblies of people.

486
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:43,290
And as far as possible to isolate
themselves during the outbreak and the

487
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:48,490
importance of information to
prevent the spread of panic.

488
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,040
So I would argue that these three,
um,

489
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,920
dress rehearsals for the
21st century had major are,

490
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:04,621
although all three were in terms
of their impact as diseases,

491
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,720
they were very limited.

492
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,170
The world was fortunate in that respect.

493
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,980
They revealed important vulnerabilities,

494
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,100
but they also provoked a new organization
of a response through laboratories,

495
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:26,470
a new coordination of the
public health community, new,

496
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,810
uh,

497
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,940
awareness of the need rapidly to
distribute a and t virals and vaccines.

498
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:40,360
And they taught the necessity
of preparation in advance.

499
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,730
For the next outbreak.

500
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,970
So I would say that the world moved
on enormously as a result of SARS,

501
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,570
of avian flu and swine flu.

502
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,780
But I would argue that emerging diseases
are an inherent part of the human

503
00:39:58,361 --> 00:39:59,194
condition.

504
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:04,650
Nothing totally to be thought
of as unexpected or strange.

505
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,430
And, uh, if I were to
make just one prediction,

506
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I would expect that there would be more
on that the system set in place and

507
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,200
improved by SARS,

508
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:22,290
avian flu and swine flu will be
tested again and our new century.

509
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,370
And with that,

510
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:29,370
I'll stop and we'll gather again on
Monday for a review session of everything

511
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:33,850
that we've covered in our course.

512
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,060
So the review should include
everything from the beginning, um,

513
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,000
down through the very end.

514
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,570
It's not meant to be limited
just to the first half,

515
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,970
but to the whole of the semester.
