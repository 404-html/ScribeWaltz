1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,110
Now that we've discussed a smallpox
and its impact on the human body,

2
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:11,211
it's symptomatology this morning I want
to concentrate instead on the impact,

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,290
uh,

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,290
on history and I want to concentrate
on three aspects in particular.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,160
The first part would be to
look at its impact in Europe.

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,850
The second and much more dramatic story
is the impact that you're reading about

7
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,280
in Elizabeth Fenn,

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,580
which is what happened with smallpox in
the new world and also in Australia and

9
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:43,284
New Zealand.

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,310
The third task for the morning is to
come to the a very different story,

11
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,450
which is smallpox and the development
of a public health strategy.

12
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,560
In this case, the development
of the strategy of vaccine.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,270
So those are the three topics I
like to deal with this morning.

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,310
And so let's begin with the
impact of smallpox in Europe.

15
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,860
Smallpox, uh, has a legend about it.

16
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,430
The legend,
it goes like this,

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,120
that it was brought back to Europe from
the Middle East by returning crusaders

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,200
in the 11th and 12th centuries.
As you know,

19
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:36,201
the Crusades lasted from 10 95 to 1291.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,840
And those are said to be this time
of armies in movement and transit,

21
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,230
uh,
to be the means of transmitting small pox,

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,580
uh,
back to western Europe.

23
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:56,190
There is no reason for us to accept
the truth of that legend as accurate.

24
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,500
But there is something
interesting about it. First, uh,

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,860
there's some support,
uh,

26
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:09,861
which is that Saint Nikkei's who was
a crusader of the order of Saint John,

27
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,560
he had an unhappy experience
in the Middle East.

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,050
He was captured and beheaded, but, uh,

29
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,090
thereafter he became the patron
saint of smallpox suffers

30
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,660
a cult of St Nikkei's.
Uh,

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,840
he's from rims is,
uh,

32
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,870
in particular spread across the continent
and churches were devoted to him.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,440
And there were representations
of this saint in stain glass,

34
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:48,120
windows in effigies and statues like this.

35
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:53,121
This is Saint Nick case at Reims
Cathedral of Saint Nick case.

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,450
And an angel.

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,500
There isn't any hard evidence that small
parks did return with the Crusaders.

38
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,400
Um,

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
although we all know that warfare is a
time that favors the spread of infectious

40
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,470
diseases.

41
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,890
And it's probably true that smallpox
had already been present in Europe for

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,090
centuries.
But there's something about this date,

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,980
which is that what it tells us is
not when smallpox actually began,

44
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,830
but when it first began
to attract attention

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,280
in any case.

46
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:34,350
Okay.

47
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,990
We know too that smallpox,

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,590
although it was present in
Europe during the Crusades,

49
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,010
the conditions at that time led to
it's beginning to have a more important

50
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:53,571
impact that reached its high point in the
late 17th and then throughout the 18th

51
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:57,684
century.

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,640
Okay.

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,640
And that had to do with preconditions
that enabled it to flourish,

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,740
preconditions associated
with industrial development,

55
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,950
the commercialization of agriculture
and rapid unplanned urbanization.

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,100
And this 18th century,

57
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:24,650
smallpox had clearly replaced plague
as the greatest and most filled feared

58
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,150
killer of its time.

59
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,520
No. And its history, the
fact that a sufferer,

60
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,490
and we mentioned this last time,
who recovered,

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,300
possessed a robust lifelong immunity
to this disease was important.

62
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,760
No one was naturally
infected twice with smallpox.

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,440
So a typical pattern emerged
in the cities of Europe.

64
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,340
And that was that smallpox became an
ever present disease that most people who

65
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,800
survived childhood had suffered.

66
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,410
The adult population,

67
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,500
therefore possessed what we might call
an extensive herd immunity to smallpox as

68
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:16,760
a disease.

69
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,280
So it became an endemic
disease of childhood,

70
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,860
but at intervals,

71
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,610
perhaps every generation or so,

72
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,120
smallpox would erupt as a major
epidemic among the general population.

73
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:35,680
Okay.

74
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,330
A couple of factors came into
play to reinforce this pattern.

75
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,280
Obviously not every child
contracted the disease,

76
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,880
and so over time there'd be a slow
accumulation of non-immune susceptible

77
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:53,800
adults.

78
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,490
Yeah.

79
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,900
Who could fall ill of the,

80
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:03,790
it was also true that European cities in
the early modern era where so unhealthy

81
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,320
that they sustained or
expanded their population,

82
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,420
not by growth from within,

83
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,540
but by a constant influx of people from
without peasants driven off the land,

84
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,530
perhaps by hunger or warfare
or the search for work,

85
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,700
failed harvests,

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,360
and these newcomers in large numbers
to use a contemporary medical jargon or

87
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,440
immunologically naive that is,

88
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:41,470
they were susceptible and added to the
pool of susceptibles in urban centers.

89
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,450
So in every generation,

90
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:49,451
we're so urban centers whose children
had already suffered some smallpox as an

91
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,910
endemic child to a disease,

92
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,830
suffered major epidemics
among not only children,

93
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,660
but young adults,
adolescents, and older people.

94
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,910
So smallpox is an example of a disease.

95
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,420
And we'll see malaria as another one
for which there is no simple distinction

96
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,940
between endemic and epidemic.

97
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,180
Smallpox was both endemic year
in and year out in Europe,

98
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,580
and it was also epidemic
sporadically every generation or so.

99
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,060
It thrived in crowded urban environments
with throngs of people and poorly

100
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,520
vented houses and workshops.

101
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,110
Now in the 18th century
statistics or elusive.

102
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,530
But smallpox is commonly thought,

103
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,830
and this is just a guesstimate to have
caused perhaps a 10th of all deaths in

104
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:57,311
the century in Europe and a third of all
deaths among children under 10 years of

105
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,234
age.

106
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,900
Half the population of the continent
is estimated to have been scarred or

107
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,910
disfigured by this disease.

108
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,540
And smallpox was also the leading
cause of blindness across Europe.

109
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,210
Perhaps half a million. This
is again, only a guesstimate.

110
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,680
People died annually from this disease.

111
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,940
In other words,

112
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,970
it was the equivalent of the largest
city in Europe at the time in the 18th

113
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:37,310
century was Naples with
half a million people.

114
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,370
It was as if a city of that size
disappeared from this single disease every

115
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,773
year.

116
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,170
The 19th century English poet and
historian Thomas Babington Macaulay road,

117
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,930
this about smallpox,

118
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,920
the havoc of plague had
been formed more rapid,

119
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,710
but the plague has visited our shores
only once or twice in living memory.

120
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,820
But smallpox was always there filling
the church yards with corpses,

121
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,470
torn mentoring with constant fear,
all limited,

122
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:21,471
not yet stricken and leaving on
those whose lives it's spared,

123
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,210
the hideous traces of its power,

124
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,110
turning the baby into a changeling at
which the mother shuttered and making the

125
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:36,141
eyes and cheeks of the patrol maiden
objects of horror to her lover.

126
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,230
Okay,

127
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,230
so two of the most famous descriptions
of smallpox in the century were those

128
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:50,801
that described it as the speckled
monster and the most terrible of all the

129
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:56,480
ministers of death.
Furthermore,

130
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,570
like blegh though smallpox was an
airborne disease unlike plague,

131
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,980
but like influenza,

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and it was an affliction that was
universal and had no predilection for any

133
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:13,820
subset of the population such as the poor.

134
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,020
It wasn't really a nonsense,
a social disease.

135
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:23,480
Even royal families were scourged,
buy small parks.

136
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,660
And the 17th and 18th centuries famous
sufferers and victims included King

137
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,690
Louis,
the 14th and Louis,

138
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:37,340
the 15th of Friends,
William the second of orange,

139
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,410
Peter, the second of Russia, the
Holy Roman Emperor Joseph, the first

140
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,073
in England,

141
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,080
smallpox was even directly
responsible for a dynastic change.

142
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,750
It extinguished the House of Stuart,

143
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,070
the last Stuart heirs to the throne all
died of smallpox between the death of

144
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:06,041
Queen Mary in 1694 and the death of
11 year old Prince William also from

145
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:13,241
smallpox in 1700 so this was a clear
case in which a disease produced a

146
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:19,961
constitutional crisis and led to the
act of settlement of 1701 that prevented

147
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:27,320
another Catholic from being crowned
and brought in the house of Hanover.

148
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:33,080
So small pox had a major
impact in western Europe,

149
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,970
but it's impact is not as simple
repetition of the story of plague.

150
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,120
Although it was dreaded.

151
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Smallpox did not give rise in Europe
to mass hysteria scapegoating and the

152
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:53,971
religious frenzy and their reasons
for that can surmise unlike plague.

153
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Small pox was not a sudden outside
invader that took society by surprise,

154
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,130
nor did it maximize its fury by targeting
young adults and the middle aged who

155
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,540
were the mainstays of families.
End of the economy.

156
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,000
Smallpox was an endemic
disease that was ever present.

157
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,910
And so it was considered almost normal,

158
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,310
especially because it targeted
infants and children as a rule.

159
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,200
Although as I've said,

160
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,860
it did lead sporadically
to broader epidemics.

161
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,630
So as a result,

162
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,720
everyone had some experience with small
polyps and half the people you might

163
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:48,241
meet on the street in a city of western
Europe would be pockmarked with as a

164
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,750
reminder of its passage

165
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,600
so familiar with smallpox,
that it bred a kind of fatalism,

166
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,490
the belief that it was
inevitable in people's lives.

167
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,210
And this attitude was so pervasive that
it wasn't uncommon even for parents to

168
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:14,431
expose healthy children intentionally to
mild cases and the hope that they could

169
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:18,730
protect them from something
much more catastrophic.

170
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,970
We could look at this attitude,

171
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:27,030
buy or appreciated by thinking
about European literature,

172
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,840
particularly British literature,
let's say in the 18th century.

173
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,290
Let's think for example of Henry
fieldings novel, Tom Jones,

174
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,340
and not when it was useful
to have a change in plot.

175
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,930
All the author had to do was to introduce
the idea of smallpox because no one

176
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:55,111
would question that that was appropriate
or considered that this was a clumsy or

177
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:57,340
artificial advice.
Artifice.

178
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,340
Everyone expected smallpox,

179
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,360
and in fieldings novel Joseph Andrews,

180
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,900
we find that there's a heroine who
is pockmarked or consider factories.

181
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,050
The adventures of Henry Esmond said in
the 18th century were smallpox drives the

182
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:18,874
plot.

183
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Smallpox quite simply was just there
and it came to seem for many people a

184
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:29,590
terrible but everyday part
of the human condition.

185
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,640
So smallpox didn't cause great European
cities like London to empty of their

186
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:37,780
population.

187
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,200
When people took to the road in flight
as plague did in the 17th century.

188
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,320
And as we shall see that cholera was to
do again in the 19th century and there

189
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,470
an urge to seek scape goods for what
seemed almost natural or normal event.

190
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,360
But this is a generalization and there
are reports of some who lost their nerve

191
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,200
at the approach of smallpox
and sought refuge in flight.

192
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,830
Let's return to our novel Henry Esmond.

193
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,790
There's a heroine lady Castlewood who
contract smallpox as an adult in a country

194
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,810
village.
Her husband,

195
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,580
and this was surprising because we
were told early on that he was an

196
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,800
extraordinarily brave soldier,

197
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,970
but he was a man who couldn't bear to
face a disease that he couldn't fight and

198
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:40,190
threatened him not only with death,

199
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,510
but this seemed to matter perhaps
more to him than death itself.

200
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,130
He thought he was extremely handsome and
he was afraid that he would be maimed

201
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,360
if he survived.

202
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,860
So unwilling to put his fair complexion
and is even fair hair at risk.

203
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,760
Lord Castlewood took to his heels
and he deserted his household for the

204
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:09,110
duration,
but he wasn't part of a mass exodus.

205
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,290
Although factory does have Henry
Esmond the hero of the story,

206
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,340
uh, tell us himself that
smallpox was, in his words,

207
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,490
the most dreadful scourge of the world.

208
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,290
We also know that as
a result of four deal,

209
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,440
lady Castlewood lost her beauty and
then her gallon husband on his return no

210
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:39,350
longer loved her as he
wants did as readers.

211
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:44,240
Then we know that one of the effects with
smallpox was that it had a big impact

212
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,590
on the marriage market,

213
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,670
it disfigured people and made them less
likely to succeed in the sweepstakes.

214
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,080
We learned that Kelly de Castlewood,
according to the author,

215
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,130
her beauty was very much
injured by the small pox.

216
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,300
When the marks of the
disease cleared away,

217
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,740
the delicacy of her color
and complexion was all gone.

218
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,800
Her eyes had lost their brilliancy.

219
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,190
Her hair fell and her face looked old.

220
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,440
It was as if a course hand to rubbed
off the delicate tense of that sweet

221
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,710
picture and brought to it a dread color.

222
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,160
It also,
it must be owned.

223
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Her ladies ships nose was greatly
swollen and red in any case.

224
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,140
As you can imagine,

225
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,260
having scars on pockmarks was also a
source of great psychological distress and

226
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:44,450
unhappiness.

227
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,930
And this too was part of the plot
of Thackeray's novel as it unfolds.

228
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,730
And part of what we should remember as
the impact of smallpox on the terrible

229
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:57,720
18th century,

230
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,800
but that was smallpox in Europe,

231
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,610
a major source of anxiety,

232
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,690
a major impact on population,
uh,

233
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,560
source of the cult of the St and e case.
Uh,

234
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:17,130
a major factor in demography,

235
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,490
but there's a more dramatic story that
we need to come to as we crossed the

236
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:28,491
waters and turns the new world or
also Australia and New Zealand.

237
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,540
This is the story of what happened when
the disease was suddenly introduced to

238
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:41,061
populations and part of the
world where it was a new invader.

239
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,600
Work arrived from outside,

240
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,680
had never been an endemic infection and
therefore against which the native or

241
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:57,000
aboriginal population
had no immunity at all,

242
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,990
then it produced real catastrophes.

243
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,670
Events describe as virgin soil epidemics.

244
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:12,050
These were catastrophes that accompanied
European expansion to the new world,

245
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,490
Australia,
New Zealand,

246
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,300
and they're smallpox and another
child to disease that accompanied it.

247
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,970
Measles had a transformative importance
in clearing the lend and promoting

248
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:31,740
settlement by Europeans
with their robust immunity.

249
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,430
The impact of smallpox and measles.

250
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,930
Measles was greater than that of gunpowder

251
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,940
in the new world.

252
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:47,150
You'll be reading about this in detail
in that wonderful book by Elizabeth Fenn,

253
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,890
Pox Americana,

254
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,250
and you might want to be reminded of
the simple fact that the author was

255
00:19:55,801 --> 00:20:00,801
actually a Yalie and that the book that
you're reading began life here as a phd

256
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:06,420
dissertation.
In any case though,

257
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,540
I want to have the division
of labor between the lectures
and the reading and so

258
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:15,120
I won't repeat the story that phen tells,

259
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,580
so movingly and so well,

260
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,210
but there were a few points that I would
like to highlight as specific examples

261
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,220
and a couple of general points.

262
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,880
And first the general idea we should
remember is not of something sometimes

263
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:34,950
referred to as the Colombian exchange.

264
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,330
That is to say that the European and
counter with the new world brought about

265
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,500
the large scale exchange from one side
of the Atlantic to the other and in the

266
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,800
reverse direction of fauna and flora.

267
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,830
Certainly as you know,

268
00:20:56,831 --> 00:21:01,831
Europeans brought back the potato maze
and Quinine for as examples from the

269
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:09,661
Americas and there's been a debate as to
whether this also involved in microbial

270
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:16,081
component and there are those who
speculate that Columbus and his sailors

271
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,950
brought back the disease syphilis
as well from the new world.

272
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,760
We'll be returning to that argument later
in the semester when we come to talk

273
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:29,560
about syphilis as a disease.

274
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,730
What's beyond out though is that there
was also a terrible movement of microbes

275
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,760
in the other direction as Europeans
unintentionally introduced smallpox and

276
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:45,970
measles to the Americas.

277
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,150
Let's illustrate with a specific
example of the Colombian exchange.

278
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,840
The exchange phen tells us about by
looking at this much travailed island of

279
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:03,400
Hispaniola,

280
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:08,910
the mountainous Caribbean island where
Columbus landed in the 1490s he spun

281
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:16,870
Yola. That is what is modern
Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

282
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,140
And as we know from today's news,

283
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Haiti has a long history of
natural and manmade catastrophes.

284
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,290
And the arrival of
Columbus was certainly one

285
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,950
the aboriginal inhabitants,

286
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,550
a tribe known as the hour wax,

287
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:42,090
our estimated or guesstimated to have
numbered something like a million people

288
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,590
in 1492

289
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Columbus described Hispaniola
as almost an earthly paradise,

290
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,210
a place of great natural beauty.
And you reported that the Roi box,

291
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,340
we're a welcoming and non war like
people who greeted the Spanish warmly and

292
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,010
showed them great kindness.

293
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,990
But unfortunately for them the
kindness wasn't reciprocal.

294
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,280
The Spaniards were interested in profit
and international power politics and he

295
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,180
spun Yolo was strategically located.

296
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,180
It also possessed fertile soil,

297
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,260
a favorable climate and
land at the Spanish crown,

298
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,970
coveted for cultivation.

299
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,890
So European interest
was based on commerce,

300
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,180
profit and international
power considerations.

301
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,260
The Spaniards militarily dispossessed
the wraps of their lend and intended to

302
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:52,940
reduce them to slavery first
in minds and then on the land.

303
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,140
They were assisted in the process
up to a point by two great assets,

304
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,880
gunpowder and disease.

305
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,140
Yeah.

306
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,870
And as you know from hating fen,

307
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:11,350
the aboriginal population of the Americas
lacked immunity to European diseases

308
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,420
like smallpox and measles.

309
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,643
Okay.

310
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,660
There's no evidence that there was a
plot of genocide or bio terror in the

311
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:26,911
intentional use of disease as a means
to clear the land and resettled.

312
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,440
What happened was spontaneous
and not intentional,

313
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,100
but the encounter between Europeans and
the indigenous peoples of Hispaniola

314
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,950
resulted in an extraordinary
and terrifying die off
between 1492 and 1520 the

315
00:24:47,441 --> 00:24:52,441
native population was reduced
from a million people to
15,000 disease thoroughly

316
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:56,170
cleared.

317
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,170
He Spun Yola for European colonization
virtually without resistance.

318
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,791
On the other hand,

319
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:09,791
small pumps forded the Spanish
intention and Hispaniola to enslave the

320
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,590
aboriginals.

321
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,760
They simply died off at two extraordinary,

322
00:25:17,761 --> 00:25:22,761
you're raped at therefore led the
Spaniards out of necessity to turn to a

323
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:27,530
different source of labor
for Mines and plantations.

324
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,490
And since Africans and Europeans shared
disease reservoirs that were partially

325
00:25:33,921 --> 00:25:34,940
overlapping,

326
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,130
there are people resistant to many of
the sane epidemic diseases that had

327
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:42,200
destroyed the native Americans.

328
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,650
So disease was a major factor in the
establishment of the African slave trade

329
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:51,410
and the development of new world slavery.

330
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,790
The Spaniards hardly delayed 1517 mark,

331
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:02,921
the beginning of the
importation of African slaves
to Hispaniola son Domingo by

332
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:10,481
1789 received into which supports every
year some 1,600 ships employing 24,000

333
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:19,301
shalers and it accounted for 11 million
pounds of the French total of 17 million

334
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:22,700
pounds of EPC sports.

335
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,020
It's trade was the foundation
of the wealth of port cities.

336
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,980
Like not we're doe and
more say it's cotton.

337
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,480
A basis for the French
textile mills and Norman date.

338
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,970
And the growth was exponential between
1783 in 1789 production doubled.

339
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,030
And with it,
the importation of slaves,

340
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,540
10,000 a year in 1764 15,017 71 27,017
86 40,017 87 the leading port of Sun

341
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,800
Domingo,
the prosperous city of look,

342
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:08,801
Cop Fall Swat had 20,000 people and
was called the Paris of the West.

343
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,980
So the Colombian exchange played a major
role in the history of Hispaniola and

344
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:22,170
that was written large in
the new world as a whole.

345
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,410
A similar story could be told about Aaron
Non Cortez and his fellow conquistador

346
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:38,150
Francisco Pizarro with regard to the Aztec
Empire of Mexico and the Incan Empire

347
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:43,590
of Peru,

348
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,520
which were destroyed not only by
gunpowder but also by smallpox.

349
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,330
That destroyed agriculture,
lead to famine,

350
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,720
destroyed the aboriginal military
capacity to resist and had were told a

351
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:06,681
tremendous psychological impact because
they're gods seemed not to protect them

352
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,890
and so there was a wave of conversion to
the European God who seemed to protect

353
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,520
his own people.

354
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,410
Now you also know from reasoning Elizabeth
Fenn that although this process was

355
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:26,280
primarily unintentional,

356
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,700
there were moments within it,

357
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:34,730
within the larger catastrophe
of occasional act of
intentional genocide and one

358
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:41,100
was by a Lord Jeffrey Amherst,

359
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:43,290
whom we're portraying here,

360
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,650
who intentionally gave native
Americans infected blankets.

361
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,710
I thought I perhaps tell you a little
anecdote that I won't vouch for

362
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:59,730
historically.
I know of it from a oral history,

363
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:04,790
from friends I had at the
time who attended Amherst
college and told me about a

364
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:10,071
demonstration that I think took place
in 1968 but that was that the plates

365
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,590
you've just seen, Lord
Jeffrey, who actually,

366
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,520
uh,

367
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,520
intentionally aimed at the die off of
aboriginal populations and intentionally

368
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,450
gave native Americans,
uh,

369
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,680
blankets infected with smallpox scabs.
Well,

370
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:36,681
the plates at Amherst College at in the
1960s look like this and they show a

371
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:39,521
surge.

372
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:44,521
Jeffery scourging Indian population
with a whip on horseback.

373
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,670
And so in 1968,
uh,

374
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,360
learning about the experience of genocide,
uh,

375
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,230
there was a demonstration when the
students of Amherst college stood up and

376
00:29:56,231 --> 00:30:00,940
smashed all the plates and the
dining hall. Um, in any case,

377
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,010
that was also the case that this sort
of tremendous dial off that fat affected

378
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,620
the Americas,

379
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,330
cleared the land for European
settlement was repeated.

380
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,850
Again,
not intentionally,

381
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,940
but with regard in Australia
to the aboriginals and in
New Zealand with regards

382
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:27,220
to the mayoress.
But you have that story told vividly on,

383
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:31,840
on a large canvas by Elizabeth fans,
pox Americana.

384
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,990
So I'll leave you to read about that and
I'd like to turn now to our third point

385
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:40,420
of the morning,
which was the development,

386
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,320
the importance of smallpox for
an entirely different reason.

387
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,270
And that is the development of a new
and major public health strategy.

388
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,290
The strategy of inoculation initially,

389
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,350
and that becomes more definitively
the strategy of vaccination.

390
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,500
Okay,

391
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,990
well let's begin with inoculation.

392
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,670
Oh,
what is inoculation?

393
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,540
It was an empirical practice,

394
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,200
we might call it a folk art and it was
developed in various parts of the world

395
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,250
as a result of two very
simple observations.

396
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,470
Okay.

397
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,470
The first was that small
pox was clearly contagious.

398
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,510
The second was that those
who had recovered from the
disease and it was easy to

399
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:41,261
know who had suffered from it because
there were scarred and pockmarked or also

400
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:43,700
there were often blind.

401
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,690
And it was a simple observation that
they never caught smallpox a second time.

402
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,640
Okay.

403
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,640
So the idea developed that it might be
a wise measure to induce a mild case of

404
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:03,991
small pox artificially to protect a
person or especially a child from the risk

405
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:11,371
of acquiring a naturally occurring but
severe and life threatening or maiming

406
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:13,234
case.

407
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,490
Okay.

408
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:19,490
And the practice that resulted
was called variously inoculation,

409
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,480
very elation or in a gardening
metaphor and grafting.

410
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,670
There were variations,

411
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,730
but then major technique was it liquid
material from a small pox postural.

412
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,680
You saw those last time.

413
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,690
Okay.

414
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,690
Of a patient selected for having a very
mild was allowed to soak into a thread.

415
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:49,450
The thread was then inserted into a
superficial cup made with the Lancet,

416
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,020
this sharp instrument that you've seen
pictures of and an earlier lecture into

417
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:02,651
the arm of the person to be protected
and fastened there for 24 hours.

418
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,680
12 days later,

419
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,120
the subject usually fell
ill with small punks,

420
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,830
hopefully suffered from a
mild case for about a month.

421
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Convalesced for a further month and
then remained immune for a lifetime.

422
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,890
Hopefully not park mark marked or blinded.

423
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,391
Now.

424
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:34,391
This practice of inoculation was common
in places like Turkey in the 18th

425
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:38,660
century but not in western Europe.

426
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,350
A major role in bringing this practice
to Britain and western Europe was played

427
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,160
by this lady, the wife of the
British ambassador to Turkey,

428
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Lord and Lady Mary Montagu who lived
from 1689 to 1762 and she was preoccupied

429
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:06,701
with small parks in part because your
own beauty had been compromised by a

430
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:12,011
severe attack of the disease and she
elected to protect her own children by

431
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:18,290
having them inoculated by the
practice I've just described.

432
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,840
While they were in Constantinople,

433
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:27,010
she returned to England
in 1721 and launched a one
person or one lady mission to

434
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:37,460
convince society to introduce
the practice of inoculation.

435
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,240
She devoted herself to propagandizing
British society in the practice.

436
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:49,810
She was able to convince the Princess of
Wales who had her daughter's inoculated

437
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,590
and the practice spread rapidly.
Now,

438
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:59,591
this was the first major public health
advance in dealing with small punks,

439
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,280
and as I tried to suggest last time,

440
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,700
I would argue that it had a role
note that I'm saying only a role,

441
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:14,870
not the role as part of the background
for the coming of the enlightenment.

442
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Indeed leading fuel of sof became ardent
advocates of inoculation people in

443
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:26,861
France like Voltaire and Charles Dilla
Condamine or on this side of the water.

444
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:34,270
People in light also describe as Philo's
off like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas

445
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,433
Jefferson.

446
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,090
Inoculation appropriately
gain most favor in England,

447
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,010
the epicenter perhaps
of smallpox in Europe,

448
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:51,540
but it gradually spread also
to France, Holland, Germany,

449
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:53,700
Sweden in Russia,

450
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:58,701
the procedure was introduced by Catherine
the great who imported an English

451
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:04,041
physician to inoculate her in 1768 after
which the nobility rapidly adopted the

452
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:08,220
practice.

453
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:15,140
The cresting wave then of the smallpox
epidemic in the 18th century in Europe

454
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,720
was met by the first practical
measure of public health against it.

455
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:26,010
Well,
why did inoculation work?

456
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,770
At least to the extent that it did,

457
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,150
and I would say that inoculation
was a partial success.

458
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,270
Biological processes were at work
that are still poorly understood,

459
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,660
but there are a couple of relevant
factors that we could note.

460
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,740
One was not as a matter of practice,

461
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,800
this procedure took infected
material only from very mild cases.

462
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:58,430
That was this selection then of
cases was one reason behind it.

463
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:00,720
Success,

464
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,860
the infective matter also was made to
enter the body through the skin in a way

465
00:37:08,701 --> 00:37:13,701
that doesn't happen in nature and for
reasons that aren't understood attenuates

466
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,240
the variance of the virus.

467
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,600
So the portal of entry into the body
also seems to have made a difference.

468
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,650
And lastly,
for all at one knows,

469
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,770
those who were inoculated were also
selected and you were only chosen for

470
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:40,950
inoculation if you are healthy and robust.

471
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,450
There were, however, problems.

472
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,010
Inoculation was also a
partially flawed procedure.

473
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,170
All too often,
despite all precautions,

474
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,400
it failed to produce the
desired mild infection,

475
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,410
but led and said to
severe illness and death,

476
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:10,200
and invariably it caused a month
or two of immense suffering.

477
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,910
It was also costly since
physicians insisted on a
lengthy period of preparation

478
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,910
when they were performing the procedure,

479
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,820
wanting to ensure that those they
inoculated, we're an excellent health.

480
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,480
They selected patients carefully and
then isolated them for a month before the

481
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:36,250
procedure during which
they regulated their diet,

482
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,470
their fresh air there exercise,

483
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,670
and this was obviously
an expensive process,

484
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,410
so inoculation was simply
not accessible to the poor.

485
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Another factor was that inoculation
could run the risk because it introduced

486
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,280
actual smallpox cases and therefore it
ran the risk of setting off an epidemic

487
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:09,100
unintentionally that those who contracted
the disease would then spread it to

488
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:10,540
others around them.

489
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,130
And to prevent that smallpox inoculation
hospitals such as one in London that

490
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:22,981
opened in 1746 we're set up to care for
the patients who had been inoculated and

491
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:29,260
to quarantine them so that they
were no longer a risk to others.

492
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,700
But nevertheless,

493
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:35,730
there was a spirit to debate over the
whole issue of rather on balance and

494
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:40,060
knock. Culation saved many
more lives than it killed.

495
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:46,630
Well, that brings us to this figure,

496
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,820
a decisive figure in the history
of medicine and public health.

497
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,890
And that is Edward Jenner.

498
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:00,390
It was in the context of this small pox
catastrophe of the 18th century and of

499
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:06,841
disappointments and anxieties surrounding
inoculation that we see a decisive

500
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:12,841
discovery in the history of medicine
and public health associated with this

501
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,950
English country doctor.
To understand what happened,

502
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,500
we need to remember
what we said last time.

503
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:27,050
And that is that there were three species
of the genus of worth of pox viruses,

504
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,920
Vario, Olin Major, Vario,
alon minor, and cow pox.

505
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,130
The first two are exclusively
infectious to human beings,

506
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,940
but the third mainly affects council.

507
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,930
But the point is that
under the right conditions,

508
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,080
cow pox can be transmitted to humans
among whom it induces a mild illness.

509
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,670
But it provides,
and this was the crucial point,

510
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,210
a robust crossover immunity
to vary all a major

511
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,260
now in Britain that people thought
most likely to contract cow pox.

512
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,810
We're Noke mates and Jenner,

513
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,380
and this is why I stress that
he was a country doctor. Uh,

514
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,250
this is his home in Barkley
in Gloucester shirt.

515
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,740
I'm in the west of England.

516
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,960
He made an observation that could only
have been made by a doctor with a rural

517
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:33,961
practice in a dairy county at a
time of prevalence of smallpox.

518
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,820
And this observation was that milkmaids
never seem to come down with a small

519
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:43,910
pumps,
gender like others.

520
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:46,580
She wasn't the first to
make this observation,

521
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:51,820
but he took it to heart and attempted
the next step of an experimentation.

522
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,660
A crucial experiment occurred in 1796.

523
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:58,610
The milkmaid,

524
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:02,930
Sarah Nelms contracted cow pox.

525
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:08,090
And this is me. Uh,
we'll see the experiment.

526
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:11,780
Edward Jenner,
um,

527
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,960
chuck the infective
material from Sarah Nelms.

528
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,450
Okay.

529
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,940
And vaccinated.

530
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,770
The eight year old son of
his gardener on his property

531
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,760
in 1796 and then after a period of time,

532
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:40,950
had a challenge in vacuum and
vaccination with live smallpox virus.

533
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,330
Okay.

534
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:49,000
And hopefully the experiment
was a great success.

535
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:54,330
And Edward Phipps demonstrated that he
was immune by this procedure to small

536
00:42:57,381 --> 00:43:01,420
pox.
And so soon thereafter,

537
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,970
Edward Jenner,

538
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:09,190
a whatever one thinks by modern terms
of the medical ethics of that particular

539
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:10,930
experiment.

540
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:16,650
In 1798 Edward Jenner wrote one
of the most influential pieces,

541
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:22,381
works in the history of medicine inquiry
into the causes and effects of the

542
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:26,320
Vario low voc scene.
I,

543
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:32,850
his genius was not just to devise the
experiment that was scientifically flawed,

544
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:38,581
perhaps in the sense that he extrapolated
from a very small vape database,

545
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,320
but in any case,

546
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,330
the point is that he recognized the
significance of what he discovered.

547
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:51,930
He thought that he saw immediately the
possibility of eradicating smallpox from

548
00:43:52,751 --> 00:43:55,930
the planet,
an idea who is important.

549
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:01,050
The British parliament recognized soon
afterwards when it declared vaccination.

550
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,540
The greatest discovery I'm quoting in
the history of medicine general wrote in

551
00:44:07,841 --> 00:44:12,841
1801 that he longed for the
annihilation of the smallpox,

552
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,600
the most dreadful scourge
of the human race.

553
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,950
That must be the final
result of this practice.

554
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:27,090
So gender had the genius to see the full
implication of his discovery and then

555
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:29,380
he devoted the remainder of his life,

556
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,500
single mindedly to the cause of
promoting this revolutionary method,

557
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,030
not only in Britain,

558
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:41,090
but also globally was also
the first example of a new
and highly effective style

559
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,210
of public health by vaccination.

560
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,930
A method that's proved its effectiveness
certainly with regard to smallpox,

561
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,860
but you could also mention polio,
tetanus, rabies, influenza,

562
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:56,700
diptheria,

563
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,820
shingles and a host of other diseases
and gender soon made influential converts

564
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,910
who establish vaccination as a
major instrument of public health.

565
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,380
Napoleon in France,
Pope Pius the seventh in Rome,

566
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,270
Benjamin Waterhouse and Thomas
Jefferson on these shores.

567
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:24,290
Generous method then was a means to
combat smallpox and unlike inoculation

568
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,860
vaccination didn't introduce an infection
of smallpox itself and therefore had

569
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:36,750
no risk of setting off
an unintended epidemic.

570
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:43,430
It also had a low risk of
serious complications for
the individual patient and

571
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,310
no risk at all for the community.

572
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:53,130
But there were problems with generous
method and it was to require a series of

573
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:58,131
subsequent improvements to make
vaccination of fully successful procedure.

574
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:04,340
The problems involves such things as
he required at the time and arm to arm

575
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:09,411
method and this entailed the risk of
spreading other diseases in particular

576
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:13,980
syphilis while trying
to present small pumps.

577
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,730
There were also failed vaccinations that
led to complications and gender made an

578
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:22,860
a crucial mistake.

579
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,280
He made it an article of dogmatic faith
that the community derive from smallpox

580
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:33,570
vaccination artificially was lifelong,

581
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:38,870
just like the natural immunity that was
acquired and he steadfastly refused to

582
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:44,601
consider evidence that ran counter to
his dog ma and fact artificial immunity

583
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,750
wears off.

584
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,190
It's now known after a period
that's not quite understood,

585
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,310
but 10 1520 years and requires to
still be valid revaccinated option.

586
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:06,170
This blindness on generous part discredit
vatted vaccination in some quarters

587
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,060
and was one factor.
These various limitations.

588
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:17,061
Then for one of the most powerful mass
movements of the 19th century and one

589
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,350
that's still with us today and that
is the anti vaccination movement.

590
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:28,370
Vaccination became one of the contested
debates of 19th medicine in Britain and

591
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:36,901
anti vaccination league was founded
and became a major political influence.

592
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,440
There were various sources of opposition.

593
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,540
There was the appear call
observation of failure, as I've said,

594
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:51,550
when people who had been vaccinated
actually contracted smallpox,

595
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,870
there was the opposition of liberals and
Libertarians to what they regarded as

596
00:47:57,881 --> 00:48:02,200
the excessive power of the state
and making vaccination compulsory.

597
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:04,570
And there was religious opposition.

598
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:09,690
People will consider it an an active in
piety to introduce material from animals

599
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,890
into a human body.

600
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:17,070
And there were sardonic posters featuring
people undergoing vaccination while

601
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:20,560
they sprouted horns or turned into counts.

602
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,350
But despite vaccination,

603
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:29,430
there was in Britain an act of 1840 that
provided for free infant vaccination.

604
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,240
And from that time,

605
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:39,360
the annual tall from smallpox began to
plummet despite the fact that the 19th

606
00:48:40,811 --> 00:48:43,580
century provided conditions that were,

607
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:47,080
would have been favorable
to promoting the disease,

608
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,470
improved and speedy
transport with steam ships,

609
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:55,471
canals and the railroad crowding with a
population that was ever more immobile,

610
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,040
massive growth and
urbanization and large cities.

611
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,660
And those,
uh,

612
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:08,190
changes and advances were reproduced
across Europe and North America.

613
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:13,570
And there were technological improvements
as well. All of which leads me to,

614
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:16,240
uh,
the end of this morning,

615
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,090
which was to saying in 1959,

616
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:24,180
the World Health Organization undertook
the unprecedented step of launching a

617
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:29,431
global smallpox eradication
program by means of vaccination.

618
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,140
In 1977,

619
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,350
the final natural case occurred,

620
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,390
and in 1980,

621
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,450
smallpox was declared by the WHL
eradicated everywhere on the globe.

622
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,560
So vaccination then comes with this
extraordinary history of public health,

623
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,120
of combating a major
disease like smallpox,

624
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,070
and actually eradicating it.

625
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,780
And what we'll want to do as we
move through the course is to ask,

626
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:06,870
what are the conditions
that make vaccination and
appropriate tool for public

627
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:11,650
health?
When is it not appropriate?

628
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,800
Why are there such difficulties with
poliomyelitis as we're speaking today with

629
00:50:18,341 --> 00:50:19,420
smallpox,

630
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:24,160
the beginning of a wave of
diseases to be eradicated this way,

631
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:28,990
one by one,
or was smallpox a an exception,

632
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,100
a special case?
We'll stay tuned and we'll deal with that.
