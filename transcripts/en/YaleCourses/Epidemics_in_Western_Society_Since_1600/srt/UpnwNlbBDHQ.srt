1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,213
Well.
Good morning.

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,370
You'll remember that last time we talked
about dividing tuberculosis into two

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,570
major errors in terms of the way that it
was understood and experienced by human

4
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:17,254
society.

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,300
The first era we talked about last time
was what I chose to call the age of

6
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,590
consumption.

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,370
At that time only the lungs were known
to be affected by the disease as all

8
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:37,761
other forms of tuberculosis as it's
now understood where then thought to be

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,140
instead different diseases at the time.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,500
The theory of anti contagion aneurysm
that by now is familiar to all of him was

11
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:54,081
still dominant on the tuberculosis
patient was deemed to be a,

12
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:59,541
should we say blameless and harmless as
he or she had a disease thought to be

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,480
primarily hereditary.
The treatments in fashion,

14
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,550
we're still traditional remedies
of 19th century medicine,

15
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,840
well familiar to you Veena
section or bloodletting.

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,650
Poultices were applied and people
were given medications with an aim of

17
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:28,041
increasing their appetite to combat the
wasting away creosote was administered.

18
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,560
We know it now primarily
as a wood preservative,

19
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,890
but it was in fact in the 19th century,

20
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,070
one of the chief medications used to
treat tuberculosis and it was administered

21
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,540
sometimes internally,

22
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,720
sometimes by inhalation
to relieve the call.

23
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,430
It was applied topically to the lowerings
to ease the coughing and alleviate

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,280
ulceration and sometimes there
were submucosal injections.

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Sometimes quinine was administered with
the strategy of lowering a patient's

26
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:13,671
fever and we've talked about gases
that were administered to combat the

27
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:17,370
infection directly in the lungs.

28
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,550
Sometimes carbolic acid spray opiates
like Louden them were sometimes given to

29
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:30,921
relieve symptoms and patients were
advised to travel to more salubrity as

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,270
climates to visit the sea,
the mountains,

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,380
the dry American southwest,
the Mediterranean,

32
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,150
and then we moved on from not period
the age of consumption and saw the

33
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:54,060
beginning of the age as a,
I'd like to call it this morning,

34
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,180
the age of tuberculosis from around the
1880s and this was marked by a number of

35
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:07,111
factors that came together
to foster new attitudes,

36
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,980
new treatments,

37
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,130
and new public health strategies
to deal with tuberculosis.

38
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,330
The first, and this man is by
now extremely famous to you.

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,870
Uh, and that's Robert Caulk. Once again,

40
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
his theory of the germ theory of
disease and the discovery as you know,

41
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,720
of the bacterium.

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,750
That's the causative agent
and tuberculosis in 1882
but that wasn't sufficient

43
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,780
to launch what we call
the age of tuberculosis.

44
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,520
In addition,

45
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,670
I would say that it was influenced
by international politics,

46
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,600
a gathering of international tensions,

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,910
clashing imperialisms
with colonial expansion.

48
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,310
Remember than that,

49
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,320
this is a time when population growth
was held to be essential to military

50
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,830
strength,
indeed to national survival,

51
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,920
to industrial production
and economic power.

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,780
This was the age when Social
Darwinism was at its height.

53
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,810
And in that context,

54
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,160
tuberculosis was held to
be a real national danger.

55
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,330
It was an internal danger.
And because of that,

56
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
patients came to lose their glamor.

57
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,880
There were no longer regarded
as creative, spiritual, sexy,

58
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,140
and in no bold,

59
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,680
but were thought to be a danger
to health and to society.

60
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,580
So that was a second,

61
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,790
should we call it the social economic
diplomatic context in which tuberculosis

62
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,500
was situated.

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,400
And then there were epidemiological
studies that went along in the period.

64
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,150
Public health became much more cognizant
through statistics of the ravages of

65
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,030
tuberculosis.

66
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,700
There were studies of its transmission
and society and knowledge,

67
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,190
statistically based.

68
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,610
Now we're placed anecdote
and the implication was not,

69
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:32,071
although tuberculosis did indeed affect
the elites of society and the arts,

70
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,380
it was in fact disproportionately
a disease of the poor,

71
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,040
of the dangerous classes and in
the American context of unsavory,

72
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:50,440
impoverished immigrants,
a disease of Irish and Italians.

73
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,620
And so tuberculosis slowly becomes
more stigmatized and more shameful.

74
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,341
Well,

75
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:03,341
the result of all of these converging
factors was from about 1880 to 1940 an age

76
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:09,620
of tuberculosis,
certainly,

77
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,860
but also a war on tuberculosis with new
strategies of public health to combat

78
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,110
what was seen to be a major
national and international menace.

79
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,230
So let's look at the weapons in the new
war in anti-tuberculosis public health.

80
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,050
The first chronologically was
also the most distinctive.

81
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,680
And in some ways the most
interesting and creative.

82
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,890
And this was the establishment of
Sanatoria or sanitary or if you prefer,

83
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,710
which gave rise to an
international sanatorium movement,

84
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,390
the prototype.
And the world's first TB.

85
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:04,391
Sanatorium was founded in 1859 but the
movement then slowly gathered momentum

86
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:12,010
towards the ends of the century and then
continued down to about the 1950s when

87
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,900
antibiotics led to the closing of the
Sanatoria and for a time or you fork view

88
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,610
that tuberculosis was
about to be eradicated.

89
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:29,720
A view that unfortunately has
turned out not to be the case.

90
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,710
The founding father of the sanitorium
movement was a German Herrmann Bramer.

91
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,380
He was a physician and
fell ill with tuberculosis,

92
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,570
not something at all unusual
and expecting to die.

93
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,710
He traveled to take the cure
in the Himalayas to a surprise,

94
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:59,171
though he recovered and he attributed
his improved health to fresh air climate

95
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,890
and rest and he thought that he could
generalize that to treating patients.

96
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,070
And an 1859 he founded the world's
first sanatorium in Cy Leesha.

97
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,030
This was followed by Peter Date filer,

98
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,660
who founded in 1876 the second
major sanatorium at Falkenstein.

99
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,540
But despite those two examples,

100
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,680
the sanatorium idea didn't really take
off to become a major movement until the

101
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:38,450
1880s.

102
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,080
And the decisive influence was that
of the American physician who has,

103
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,410
uh,
through his offspring a Yale connection.

104
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,070
And that's Edward Livingston
Trudeau who lived from 1848.

105
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,150
Um,
and is well known,

106
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:02,151
the true day of name to all of you as
the great grandfather of Gary Trudeau of

107
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,170
Doonesbury fame.

108
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,000
Let me just have a couple dots.

109
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,730
Edward Livingston,
True Dome,

110
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,660
let's remember a moment about his life
and how he came to play a major role in

111
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,490
the sanatorium movement.

112
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,730
He was a physician educated at the
Columbia Medical School in New York.

113
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,320
His brother had tuberculosis
and he died of it.

114
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,430
He himself was diagnosed with
tuberculosis and the 1870s.

115
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,450
And,
um,

116
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,060
this is a story that you've
heard more than once.

117
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,150
He too thought that he was going to die,

118
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,470
but he followed medical advice and went
to an outdoor climate to take the cure.

119
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,980
In his case,
his preferred definition,

120
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,160
a destination was the Adirondack
mountains and specifically sadder,

121
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,490
Saranac Lake and Upper New
York state at Saranac Lake.

122
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,650
Which was at the time,
uh, not a town at all.

123
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,760
It was the wilderness and true doves spent
his time largely resting and he would

124
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:30,801
hunt from fixed positions in a canoe
on Saranac lake or behind the blind.

125
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,260
And as far as possible,

126
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,550
he stayed out doors expecting to die.

127
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,721
Instead,

128
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:44,721
he realized that he was starting to
feel better and he to attributed his

129
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,230
recovery to this fresh air and rest.

130
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,930
And he too, felt that this was an
experience that could be generalized.

131
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,190
He became increasingly interested in
the medical literature on tuberculosis,

132
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,310
and he read about Bramer
and his sanatorium.

133
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,250
But in the 1870s, there had been little
interest in the medical profession,

134
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,980
in the disease or in framers idea,

135
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,300
the 1880s because of caulks
major epic making discovery,

136
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,540
however,

137
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,540
created an entirely different and more
susceptive climate to the whole idea.

138
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,110
And Trudeau became an early convert
to the idea of contagion, aneurysm,

139
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,240
and the germ theory of disease with
specific reference to tuberculosis.

140
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,160
So in 1884 this is a statue of Edward
Livingston Trudeau at Saranac Lake

141
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,640
and he established

142
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,420
little red,

143
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,380
which was the beginning of the sanitorium.

144
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,370
This was in 1884 which is the beginning
then of the establishment of a small

145
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,060
rest cottage,

146
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,710
little red for the treatment
of tuberculosis patients.

147
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,560
This is a picture of little red,

148
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,590
the first building in what becomes a much
larger sanatorium and that's a picture

149
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:31,240
of the inside of the sanatorium.

150
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,590
There were several ideas that Trudeau
embodied in the sanatorium and the first

151
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:44,080
was not the sanatorium
was a means of treatment.

152
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,460
And let's look at the treatment
ideas that Trudeau had in mind.

153
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,130
The first was what he
called the Wilderness Cure,

154
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,650
the one that he had experienced himself.

155
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,680
That is to say that you should live
outdoors in all weather taking the cure on

156
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,900
cottage porches.

157
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,590
And so there was a document called the
rules for patients at the sanitorium at

158
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,380
Saranac Lake,
and it said the following,

159
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:19,650
patients are expected to lead
an outdoor life to her in Maine,

160
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,710
eight to 10 hours in
the open air every day.

161
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,340
Each patient is required to be out of
doors from 9:00 AM to 12:45 PM and again

162
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:37,861
from 2:00 PM to five 45 every day and
sleeping out is considered a no way to

163
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:46,030
affect the requirement.
So the outdoor life was compulsory.

164
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,980
Second was rest.
The patients at Saranac Lake,

165
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,050
we're to have no exercise.

166
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,370
A patient with a temperature of 99.5
degrees was allowed half an hour of

167
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:06,781
exercise a day and exercise included
standing up and getting dressed or walking

168
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:16,171
to the refectory for a meal
and even getting in and out
of bed was thought to be

169
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:21,130
exercise. So there was very little
that you were allowed to do.

170
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,850
The third thing that was part of the
sanitorium regimen at Saranac Lake,

171
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,540
and I'm choosing Saranac Lake because
this was the model sanitorium that really

172
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:39,580
became the ideal for an
entire international movement.

173
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,950
Thousands of Sanatoria.

174
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,520
We're founded on this model.

175
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,240
The third treatment idea
was a solid substantial diet
to combat the consumption,

176
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:59,690
if you like, the wasting away of
the body and to build resistance.

177
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,700
So in pursuit of that goal,
patients, it's sour. Now,

178
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:08,701
clay had for compulsory hardy meals a
day with milk served in between with a

179
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:14,750
strong emphasis on meat and carbohydrates.

180
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,180
The goal was for the patient to
consume 4,000 calories a day.

181
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,660
Another point about the treatment regimen
is that the sanatorium was what we

182
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,570
might call a total institution.

183
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,443
Yeah.

184
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,580
Unlike the old idea of taking the cure
at the sanitorium at Saranac Lake,

185
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,530
patients were under constant vigilance.

186
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,670
That was one of the reasons that you
kept them on the porches on a porch.

187
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:53,600
You were constantly in view and visitors.

188
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,400
We're strictly regulated.

189
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,940
The patient's mail was censored.

190
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,750
The idea being that they
should be sheltered from
distressing news and emotional

191
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:11,390
shocks.
Those were not conducive to recovery.

192
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:17,770
The roles therefore stipulated that you
weren't allowed as a patient at Saranac

193
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,100
Lake to discuss your disease,

194
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,280
even with fellow patients
at the sanatorium.

195
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,380
The rules also stated that there
was to be no alcohol or tobacco,

196
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,680
that there was to be no socializing for
more than an hour a day and there were

197
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:44,480
to be no indoor visits from
members of the opposite sex.

198
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,560
You also, I'm not sure if the
medical purpose of this, but, uh,

199
00:16:49,561 --> 00:16:52,610
these rules were enforced by expulsion.

200
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,940
If you violated the rules,
you couldn't stay.

201
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,780
And the rules also said that
you couldn't practice profanity.

202
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,310
You weren't allowed to gamble.
Oh,

203
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,290
those were part of the cure as well.

204
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,300
And the next idea of this was segregation.

205
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,480
That is,
I'm not meaning racial segregation now.

206
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,880
I mean that isolation,

207
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:25,570
there were individual rooms with porches
were patients were always out of doors.

208
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:31,030
This is the polar opposite of crowded
conditions in tenements that were thought

209
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:36,380
to be the great means of spreading
the tuberculosis epidemic.

210
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,020
And, um, so Trudeau carried
out there was an island.

211
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,850
If you visit Saranac Lake,

212
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,120
you'll notice that there's an island which
is called rat fondly Robben Island in

213
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:53,540
the center. We're Trudeau during his, um,

214
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,950
I am self imposed exile for the
cure had gone hunting and so on.

215
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,090
But he also conducted an experiment
on rabbit island and the experiment

216
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:06,024
consistent,

217
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm not sure what you think of the
robust scientific quality of it,

218
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,840
but it certainly convinced Edward
Livingston Trudeau himself.

219
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,050
He took I think 10 rabbits on to rabbit
island and five of them were allowed to

220
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,410
live free in a good outdoor conditions.

221
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,510
The other five work put
in, uh, artificial, uh,

222
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,600
facsimiles of tenement conditions.

223
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,810
That is they were
confined to insalubrious,

224
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,560
unsanitary crowded cardboard boxes.

225
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,650
And at the end of a certain period,

226
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,740
a Trudeau notice that the five confined
rabbits had died of tuberculosis and the

227
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:57,150
other five who were leading
the hardy outdoor life.

228
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,040
We're a good advertisement for a
sanitorium and the outdoor cure.

229
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,370
Well, let's, um,

230
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,570
take a little tour of the sanatorium and
we saw it started at little red in very

231
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:12,180
humble beginnings,

232
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:17,430
but then I say this was the total life.
Um,

233
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,850
this was the library.
As you got better,

234
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,970
you are allowed to do a little bit more
and you could progress to the point

235
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,100
where you'd be allowed the
strenuous exercise of reading
books in the Sanatorium

236
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,390
Library.

237
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,390
There was also the idea that this would
be an educational experience and you

238
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:44,091
would take back skills and knowledge
that would be essential to you after you

239
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:50,010
had been discharged from the sanatorium.
And this is a plot,

240
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,040
the workshop where you would learn
skills or craft that you could exercise,

241
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:00,690
remember that you might still be a
something of an invalid and it would be

242
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:05,691
important that you would have those sorts
of skills that you were capable of a

243
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:09,000
craft that you could carry out.

244
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,340
There was the chapel out the sanitorium.

245
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,353
Okay,

246
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,440
here is one of the cure cottages and
you'll note a proliferation of porches at

247
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:27,540
Saranac Lake. And these, uh,

248
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:32,460
are more of the buildings. Those are,
this is the central administration.

249
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,931
And here are,

250
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:38,931
we actually see a patient's doing what
they did most of the time at Saranac

251
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,180
Lake. And this is taking the cure, um,

252
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,470
in the horizontal position and,
uh,

253
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,350
being you are also educated,
uh,

254
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,790
to use this little, uh,
x fashion accessory,

255
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,630
which is your sputum
comp. In other words, uh,

256
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:03,631
your sputum was thought to be extremely
dangerous and contagious and therefore

257
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,750
you were not to spit on the
ground, uh, but in this little cup.

258
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,020
So the education of patients then in
contagiousness theory was a part of the

259
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:18,880
experience they were
issued with sputum comps,

260
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,790
with handkerchiefs,

261
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,110
spitting was strictly
forbidden at Saranac Lake,

262
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,060
on pain of expulsion,

263
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,870
and patients had severe instructions to
suppress their coughs whenever possible

264
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,100
and to cover their faces when they did.
So.

265
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:43,900
Saranac Lake then was not
just for its own patients.

266
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,500
It was also conceived of to spread
the idea of the sanitorium as a model.

267
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,540
And Trudeau,
and this was one of his great assets,

268
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,840
he was really skilled at publicity.

269
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:04,170
He became a full time agent for
his own humanitarian project.

270
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,821
Well,

271
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:11,821
the Saranac Lake sanitorium than was
a place of treatment and a place of

272
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:13,420
education.

273
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,690
It was also a place of scientific research
featuring the science of tuberculosis

274
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,730
at Saranac Lake Trudeau founded the
world's first laboratory devoted to the

275
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:30,490
study of tuberculosis

276
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,080
and caulks techniques of microscopy that
Trudeau so much admired were followed

277
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,050
and taught.

278
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,860
Medical students were taught staining
the culturing of bacteria diagnosis.

279
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,450
And there was a six week course for
already qualified physicians to uh,

280
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,780
for an internship,
if you like,

281
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,950
in the Saranac Lake Laboratory
and at the sanatorium.

282
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,870
And there were courses for nurses as
well. Well, what were the results?

283
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:12,871
We'll Trudeau himself was very optimistic
that this institution had positive

284
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:17,710
results for the health of his patients.

285
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,370
He argued that normally an active case
of tuberculosis was almost universally

286
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,780
fatal,
but Trudeau by contrast,

287
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,990
claimed that he achieved a recovery
rate of about 30% and so he adopted for

288
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:41,380
Saranac Lake,
a little slogan of his own,

289
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,800
which was cure sometimes

290
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,650
relief,
often,

291
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,070
and comfort always.

292
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,860
So those were parts of
the mission of the center,

293
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:02,390
Knock Lake Sanatorium.
We should also see it though,

294
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
as an instrument of public health,

295
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,640
based on the idea of the
isolation of the contagious,

296
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:17,170
Trudeau estimated that each
tuberculosis patient in a year,

297
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,990
if he or she continued to
live in an urban environment,

298
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,860
would on average,
in fact another 20 people.

299
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,890
So we could see the sanitorium
as a kind of quarantine.

300
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,070
And its particular idea was not.
This was to move,

301
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,510
remove working people and
people of modest means.

302
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,470
In other words,

303
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:50,470
this first American sanatorium
was a work of philanthropy

304
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,750
patients.
At most,

305
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:58,810
there was a sliding scale of expense and
patients were charged at most half the

306
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:05,381
cost of their stay and their treatment
and the endowment of the sanitorium

307
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:11,111
because Trudeau was very effective at
gaining approaching donors and getting

308
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:17,381
financial support for this idea and so
the endowment of the sanatorium made up

309
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:19,130
the difference.

310
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,180
So there was a considerable number
then of patients with no funds who were

311
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:29,270
subsidized by the institution.
Well,

312
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:31,310
this went on as well.

313
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,370
We can see a relationship
between tuberculosis also
and should we say economic

314
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:43,811
development in that the sanitorium
became the center piece also for the

315
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:50,111
development of a town that is Saranac
lake as a town which was based on

316
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,370
tuberculosis and Edward Livingston.

317
00:25:55,371 --> 00:26:00,371
Trudeau and fact was also the mayor of
the town will initially those what should

318
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:07,391
remember that if you think getting into
Yale was difficult for you getting a

319
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,900
place at the Saranac Lake sanitorium
if you had tuberculosis was even more

320
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:15,404
difficult.

321
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,340
There was a rate of about 2000
people applying for every place.

322
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,523
Um,

323
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:29,650
and so the city of or town of Saranac
leg sprang up as a place where people

324
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,790
could be taken care of who weren't
admitted to the sanitorium itself.

325
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,310
In other words,
the town was filled with cottages,

326
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,680
with boarding houses,

327
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,740
with cure porches and the local board
of health of the town supervised and

328
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:58,620
regulated.
What went on in these cottages,

329
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,850
there were district nurses who gave
advice and monitored conditions and there

330
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:12,240
was a bureau of information in the town
to assist patients to find suitable

331
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:13,380
arrangements.

332
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,760
And then there were so called reception
college cottages for patients so ill

333
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,530
that they would be rejected by the
sanitorium and by the boarding houses.

334
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:30,090
Even. Um, one of the
features of the sanatorium,

335
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:35,091
it's difficult at Saranac Lake to
determine the effect because there was

336
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:40,770
considerable triage among
those who were admitted.

337
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,160
And one of the features of it was that
Trudeau did wish to take people into the

338
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:52,041
sanatorium whom he considered so ill
that nothing more could be done for them.

339
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,940
He wanted people who would actually
benefit from his cure. So in that sense,

340
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,240
this statistics were a little bit,
um,

341
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,270
massaged by the fact that the most serious
cases of tuberculosis didn't figure

342
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,730
in them.
Well,

343
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:13,530
the idea of the sanitorium
spread and spread rapidly.

344
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,700
It wasn't long before every state in the
nation had a network of Sanatoria and

345
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,760
some of them were specialized,

346
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:27,870
some for the indigent and
the poor that is the poor.

347
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,950
Some for women,
some for African Americans.

348
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,420
The abroad,
there were also Sanatoria,

349
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:40,530
the most famous in Switzerland
and Dave [inaudible],

350
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,700
you can read about it.

351
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,910
And Thomas Mann's the magic mountain
and that was clearly a sanatorium that

352
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:51,210
wasn't subsidized but wasn't
fat for the social elite.

353
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:56,270
So there were also Sanatoria of various
types for various social classes and um,

354
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,200
social groupings.

355
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,430
There were also distinctions within
the movement in the sanatorium idea in

356
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,770
England for example,

357
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,080
they shared the idea of the
importance of the outdoor life,

358
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,810
diet and surveillance,

359
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:24,650
but they differed and that they thought
that the kind of rest regimen that

360
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:30,921
Trudeau had in mind was counter productive
and that this would ruin working

361
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:35,160
people who would get used
to a life of idleness.

362
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,990
And so in England,

363
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:41,991
the Sanatoria instead practiced what was
called exercise and instead of the rest

364
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:49,140
treatment we have the work treatment.
And um,

365
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,010
those of you who are skiers,

366
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:55,390
no about the slopes are given color codes.

367
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,600
You're blocked diamonds, your blue
and your green for example. Well,

368
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,130
at the British Sanatoria,
um,

369
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:08,200
there were walks for the patients and
they were also color coded according to

370
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:13,201
difficulty and how much it was going
to make you breathe and you inmates.

371
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:16,660
Then as you got well,

372
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,670
you were encouraged to take
walks of progressive difficulty.

373
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,630
Well, in the interwar period,
there were some additional,

374
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,610
um, innovations in the
treatment of tuberculosis.

375
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,740
One was,

376
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:39,490
and this is still before the
age of antibiotics you've seen,

377
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,120
and one was a surgical approach and this
was practiced at Saranac Lake as well.

378
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,790
The idea being to extend rest,

379
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,210
to have real total rest of the lungs.

380
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,600
This was termed artificial pneumothorax
and that means that air was injected or

381
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:06,301
another gas like nitrogen into the
pleural cavity to collapse the lung or the

382
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:12,430
lungs by subjecting it or
them to external pressure.

383
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:18,330
That procedure was developed in the
1890s and came into vogue and after World

384
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:20,500
War One,

385
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:25,330
especially in this
country very invasively,

386
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,690
some surgeons even decided to make the
collapse permanent by removing patient's

387
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:37,000
ribs to paralyze the
diaphragm. Let me show you. Um,

388
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,720
this is,
uh,

389
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:43,730
a patient undergoing neumothorax
the artificial collapse of the lung.

390
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,540
And this is a diagram of
the neumothorax apparatus.

391
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,680
The remark of one surgeon was this
in a burst of surgical optimism.

392
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,820
He said,

393
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,820
physicians who have treated tuberculosis
for 2000 years and without effect,

394
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:12,660
it's time now for us surgeons to show
the way the analogy was that of the

395
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:19,930
resting of a broken limb and a cast.
Unfortunately.

396
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:20,800
However,

397
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:26,070
statistics seem to indicate that the
results were deeply disappointing and the

398
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:31,981
procedure was almost totally
abandoned by 1940 fortunately.

399
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,560
However, there were other weapons
in the war on tuberculosis.

400
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,230
One was another institution in
addition to this Sanatoria and knots,

401
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,970
the dispensary's

402
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,560
and cities to which patients returned
after discharge from hospitals and

403
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:55,880
Sanatoria.

404
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,240
They needed follow up care
and the dispensary's were
designed to provide that in

405
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:08,000
the community.
They also taught hygienic education,

406
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,990
reminding patients that even after
discharge from the Sanatoria,

407
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,570
they still weren't allowed to spit and
they should cover up their faces when

408
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:24,260
coughing or sneezing and they should
tell everyone in their families to do the

409
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:25,094
same.

410
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:30,290
So these were in part
health education facilities.

411
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,730
They also performed what we
might call social work services.

412
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,620
They helped recovering patients define
jobs that were suitable for their

413
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:40,454
condition.

414
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,730
Sometimes they provided loans or cash
grants or food to tide patients over while

415
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:52,721
they attempted to get back on their
feet after a prolonged period of being

416
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:57,020
unemployed.
There were also,

417
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,890
these were joined by campaigning,

418
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,350
voluntary associations.

419
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,980
And so we see a proliferation of
what we might now call angios.

420
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,860
And England was the National Association
for the prevention of consumption and

421
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:20,141
other forms of tuberculosis founded in
1898 and there were similar associations

422
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:26,480
in France, Germany, Belgium,
Portugal, Canada, Denmark, Sweden,

423
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,240
Russia, Japan, Norway, Australia.

424
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:34,990
And in our country there was the national
tuberculosis association that's now

425
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:38,270
called the American Lung Association.

426
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:42,560
And I wonder if you could guess
who its first president was. Well,

427
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,960
your friend Edward Livingston Trudeau,

428
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,740
I said he was a propagandist of genius.

429
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,580
The mission of these associations again
was to educate the public about the

430
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:55,880
disease,

431
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:01,630
to help teach people and how they could
protect themselves from it and also

432
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:03,860
protect those around them.

433
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,670
And they spent a lot of time attacking
the social construction of tuberculosis

434
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,220
from the first half of the 19th century.

435
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,030
That is the romantic idea of tuberculosis.

436
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,300
They stressed in
pamphlets and in lectures,

437
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,350
the tuberculosis was neither
romantic, newer, poetic.

438
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,370
One pamphlet wrote,
and I think it laid it on a bit heavy.

439
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,150
It said TB is of course,

440
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,820
common vulgar disease,

441
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,810
bread and foul breath in dirt and squallor
the beautiful and the rich receive it

442
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,610
from the unbeautiful and from the poor.

443
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,220
I think we're a million
miles away from La Blm.

444
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,291
And then he case,

445
00:35:55,291 --> 00:36:00,291
the idea then was to frighten people
in order to reform their habits.

446
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,030
And these are associations
produced pamphlets,

447
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,320
they sponsored lectures,
there are traveling exhibits.

448
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,980
Later on there were films
and radio broadcasts,

449
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,720
newspaper articles,

450
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,700
and the propaganda blanketed
schools and hospitals,

451
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,680
offices and shops, factories, town halls,

452
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:30,870
billing, uh, places,
public squares, city walls,

453
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,140
bulletin boards at schools
and universities and
particular targets where the

454
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:40,320
habit of spitting and alcoholism.

455
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:45,590
You would've noted not too many
years ago that if you boarded a,

456
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:51,240
um,
a boss say in Paris or in Rome,

457
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,370
that the back of the bus would have
a sign they false to crush shed.

458
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:01,550
No spitting in French or VA Tostitos
with Todd and Italian spitting was really

459
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,480
something that this
campaign heavily focused on.

460
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:10,170
In addition,
there were other messages,

461
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,200
the outdoor life and exercise
that wasn't unrelated,

462
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:20,290
that this was the time when the scout
movement gets going to give people outdoor

463
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:23,280
experience so that
there'll be more healthy.

464
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,590
It's sponsored playgrounds,

465
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:30,591
it's schools and parks and cities and
urban areas and also the movement funded

466
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,270
research.

467
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:37,470
In the basic sciences
related to tuberculosis.

468
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,920
So that was part of this campaign,

469
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,670
the war on tuberculosis.
In addition,

470
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:48,480
there were government measures.
One was a campaign.

471
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I said that a secondary way in which
tuberculosis was spread was through milk.

472
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,800
And so in this period we see the attempt
to screen herds to prevent disease,

473
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,040
milk and meat from reaching the market.

474
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:10,340
And it was the time when
the pasteurization of milk
took off as a practice.

475
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,120
Tuberculosis also by states,

476
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,180
municipalities and nations
was made a notifiable disease.

477
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,120
The pioneer here was New York City in
1897 Manchester in England followed suit

478
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,090
in 1899 and then there was
a cascade of other places.

479
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:38,050
We're physicians, we're obligated
to report cases to the authorities.

480
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,240
Now a result,

481
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:45,270
this clearly is a positive thing in
that public health depends on accurate

482
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:50,860
information and you can only get
information through statistics.

483
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,920
So I don't want to argue that this was
anything but positive except as many

484
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:58,090
positive measures have.

485
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,950
It also had a small undertone.
In other words,

486
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,010
this increased the fear of the disease.

487
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,940
People feared being reported
because they might lose their jobs,

488
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,210
they would lose all standing
in the marriage market.

489
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,230
They might be shunned by anxious friends,

490
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,390
neighbors and relatives.

491
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:28,590
Another idea was vaccination
and this was followed,

492
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,240
um, from 1925 and while eight, 19,

493
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,800
oh eight and particular,

494
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:40,801
but especially after 1925 with the BCG
first and vaccination with attenuated

495
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,350
bacteria thereafter.
Um,

496
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,320
not with a very successful result,

497
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,750
but this was part of the policy as well.

498
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,840
And then there was mass screening through
radiology and this tuberculosis skin

499
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,910
test.
Well,

500
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:05,911
how effective was the war on tuberculosis
with this set of tools used to combat

501
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:14,050
the disease? Well, interestingly,

502
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,140
I think one could argue that the war
on tuberculosis really gathered speed,

503
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,620
not at the very height of
the tuberculosis epidemic.

504
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,760
When there was the most suffering,
morbidity and mortality.

505
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,390
The decline probably began spontaneously,

506
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,920
somewhat earlier,

507
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,280
maybe reflecting the sanitarian movement
and improved urban living conditions,

508
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,420
improved wages and diet,
improved housing,

509
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:48,510
things that were done spontaneously and
lead to a recession of the disease by

510
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:50,470
those sorts of means.

511
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,560
But everyone agrees that Sanatoria and
isolation did reduce infection that

512
00:40:58,921 --> 00:41:03,921
dispensary's and TB campaigning
organizations provided
those at risk with means

513
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,690
to protect themselves.

514
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:12,850
So they undoubtedly did have a,

515
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:16,360
an important effect on tuberculosis.

516
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:21,510
And we can see a decline in the disease
in the early decades of the 20th

517
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:23,164
century.

518
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,800
But the real massive decline began in
what we might call the antibiotic era from

519
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:35,450
1940 to 1980 roughly.

520
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,420
And here a major event,
a new magic bullet,

521
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,540
was devised by some and Weissman

522
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,670
and 1943 at Rutgers university.

523
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
That is the development of streptomycin
and the first patient to be treated with

524
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:56,270
it.

525
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,270
Tuberculosis patient was 1944 when a
critically ill TB patient made a full,

526
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:08,371
we're covering what seemed truly a miracle
cure and this led immediately after

527
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:15,020
world war two to a confident expectation.

528
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:19,130
And we'll see this repeated in
a number of different fields.

529
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,070
And with regard to a series of diseases,

530
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:27,130
the idea that worldwide eradication was
just around the corner and there was in

531
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:33,671
fact it was fueled by a constant decline
from the 1950s to the 19 mid 1980s and

532
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:39,590
tuberculosis.
And the USA,

533
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,470
there was a 75% decline.

534
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,340
There were 80,000 cases in 1954
20,000 only in 1985 and the government

535
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:56,531
confidently predicted eradication by 2010
something that you know didn't happen

536
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,990
and worldwide by 2025

537
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:08,960
unfortunately a troubling
problem rapidly emerged.

538
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,220
First there was mono therapy that is
strapped to son and soon it happened.

539
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:21,310
It was discovered that bacteria are
becoming resistant to it for a time.

540
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,380
The problem was overcome by
combination treatments. Two,

541
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:31,360
three medications at once
instead of monotherapy.

542
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,920
I saw Niacin was developed in 1952
rifampicin in 1963 but then the problem

543
00:43:41,361 --> 00:43:46,361
increased with multiple drug resistant
tuberculosis and in 1985 there was a hole

544
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,660
and the decline.

545
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,020
1986 and seven a slight rise and after
1987 arise in the u s nine states,

546
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:07,220
but even more troubling a
pandemic in eastern Europe,

547
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,470
Southeast Asia, and sub
Saharan Africa. Indeed.

548
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:17,471
In 1993 the World Health Organization
took the step for the first time or for

549
00:44:18,681 --> 00:44:23,681
claiming the TB pandemic of
world emergency and warned
that the disease might

550
00:44:25,071 --> 00:44:27,080
spiral out of control.

551
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:33,010
Today there are perhaps worldwide
8 million people who develop,

552
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:33,760
AH,

553
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,760
give infections every year and a
million over a million people die.

554
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:45,450
Well, what are some of the factors
in this resurgent emergency?

555
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,100
One of course,
is poverty.

556
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:52,910
Tuberculosis thrives in the conditions
promoted by poverty and worldwide.

557
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,900
The nations with the
highest incidents of TB,

558
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,310
not by accident or those with the
lowest gross national product.

559
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:06,340
Okay.
If we look at in the United States,

560
00:45:06,341 --> 00:45:11,341
we can confirm this picture and that
70% of cases in the United States occur

561
00:45:12,821 --> 00:45:15,550
among racial and ethnic minorities,

562
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,090
40% among immigrants from abroad or
what we might call marginal groups,

563
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,570
intravenous drug users,
prisoners,

564
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,930
the homeless people in nursing homes for
the elderly or people with compromised

565
00:45:32,171 --> 00:45:35,350
immune systems due to HIV aids.

566
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,830
And remember of course that
in an era of air travel,

567
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,460
our country isn't an island and can't
reduce its own burden of tuberculosis

568
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,090
without also dealing with
the global emergency.

569
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,940
There were other factors that
have fed into this upsurge.

570
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:02,180
The displacement of people due to war
or economic disaster or environmental

571
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:03,960
catastrophes.

572
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,200
Remember of course that refugee camps are
wonderful for propagating tuberculosis

573
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,340
and then there's the HIV aids
pandemic and the upsurge in malaria.

574
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:24,020
Both of those diseases
are immunosuppressive and
both act as powerful sub

575
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:30,540
straight up for the emergence
of tuberculosis. Indeed,

576
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:35,570
TB is the leading immediate cause
of death among age surfer sufferers.

577
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,530
Tuberculosis is the perfect
opportunistic disease.

578
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,520
Then there's the problem of the emergence
of drug resistance that we referred to

579
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:52,370
and that has fed the [inaudible] high
rates of incarceration feed the pen,

580
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:58,170
dammit. That's been clearly
demonstrated in Russia,

581
00:46:58,171 --> 00:47:02,790
the former Soviet Union and in
our own country and in Russia,

582
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,780
the collapse of medical
services in eastern Europe.

583
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:11,820
And then of course there's the
availability of mass air travel.

584
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:13,471
Well,

585
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:18,471
I just wanted to close with the fact that
we're then in the midst of this world

586
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,960
pandemic and I wanted to say also that
there are a number of issues about

587
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:33,081
tuberculosis historically in medically
that still need to be worked out.

588
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:39,390
It's and not understood what factors
cause it to pass from the dormant state to

589
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:41,680
an active infection.

590
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:47,700
It's not known why in some people
it's a four minute disease,

591
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,880
but in others a slow wasting process.

592
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:57,900
It's not known why it chooses to invade
certain tissues and organs rather than

593
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,224
others.

594
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,920
It's not really clear why in the
middle decades of the 19th century it

595
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:10,981
disproportionately affected women
were as from the late 19th century.

596
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:17,040
It tended to favor men and it's not
entirely clear what were the factors that

597
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:24,571
caused this major recession of the disease
between the 1890s and 1985 although

598
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:29,560
we've dealt with quite a number of them,

599
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:34,180
spontaneous economic advance
improvement in living conditions,

600
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:37,630
government and Ngo campaigns,

601
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:41,710
the reporting of the disease,
the sanitorium movement,

602
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:45,580
and then finally the
development of antibiotics.

603
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,820
So that's the tuberculosis story.

604
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:53,200
From the age of consumption
down to where we are today,

605
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:58,180
which today we find ourselves
in a very problematic situation.

606
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:03,450
Condition with regard to what has been
this terrible upsurge of a disease that

607
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:09,400
defeated the confident expectation
that it would soon be eradicated.
