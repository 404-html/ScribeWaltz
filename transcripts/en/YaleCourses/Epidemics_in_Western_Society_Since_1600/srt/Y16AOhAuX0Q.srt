1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,420
Oh this morning we're going
to do something a little
bit different which is I

2
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:09,650
thought that everyone was ready for a
break so we're going to have a guest

3
00:00:09,651 --> 00:00:14,651
lecture this morning and I thought it
was particularly important that at some

4
00:00:14,811 --> 00:00:19,811
point we give you a perspective from
the clinical point of view and so I'm

5
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:26,120
introducing to your doctor Margaret Craven
and I'll just say a couple of things

6
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:26,810
about her.

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,810
She's an ob Gyn and so for about 30 years
she was involved in the trenches and

8
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:39,131
the war against Hiv aids and she's going
to talk to us this morning about HIV

9
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:42,950
aids in this country.

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,130
As I said last time and that's about all
I wanted to say except one other detail

11
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,600
which is that she's also my wife.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,593
Hmm.

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,040
AIDS is fundamentally different than
any other emerging global pandemic

14
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:04,510
preceding it because of the high velocity
of it spread around the world and of

15
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:06,820
the race to understand and control it.

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
I have given you a handout which
is a copy of the 1981 m m w R,

17
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:18,871
which stands for morbidity and mortality
weekly report of the Centers for

18
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:20,650
disease control in Atlanta.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,700
The CDC was founded in 1946 to control
malaria and is now part of the Department

20
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,853
of Health and Human Services.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,520
The MMWR is their fast track method
of publishing a medical article.

22
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:39,730
This is basically so that clinicians
can be up to speed on things.

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,520
One one report is from Los Angeles about
cases of pneumocystis pneumonia is in

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,880
gay men and the same issue.

25
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:53,200
There was also a report from New York
City about a rare cancer called Kaposi's

26
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,700
sarcoma and gay men.

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,160
Imagine that you're working in the field
of public health and our reading this.

28
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:05,730
The front page describes five cases of
men between the ages of 29 and 36 all of

29
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:13,321
them are gay and all have a rare lung
infection called pneumocystis pneumonia.

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,200
The back page of the report
has an editorial note
explaining what it is as it is

31
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:21,460
so rare that nobody would
ever have heard of it.

32
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,580
The article was the starting gun for
a sprint on the part of the medical

33
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:28,414
community.

34
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,350
Within three years of this
publication by the CDC,

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,450
the human immunodeficiency virus
was identified as the cause of AIDS.

36
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,230
The emerging epidemic of our times.

37
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:48,610
It is even more fragile fest is m
minuscule than the bacteria that causes

38
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:50,390
syphilis or gonorrhea,

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,320
but it is spread the same way through
the intimate exchange of bodily fluids.

40
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,010
How did HIV such a

41
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,010
powerful and widespread killer in
such a short time causing the present

42
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:09,580
worldwide pandemic of around 33
million infected individuals?

43
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,800
How is it left?

44
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:16,801
More than 25 million of us dead
and 14 million children orphaned?

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,830
Why did it still in fact,

46
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:25,831
about 2.7 million of us in the year 2007
and kill to 2 million people that year?

47
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,570
Certain historical background
conditions made this tragedy possible.

48
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,670
Globalization,
invasive medical technology,

49
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,150
especially blood transfusions and
migration and concentration of gay men.

50
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,610
Globalization is a phenomenon that's
been gathering momentum are ever since

51
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:56,880
Christopher Columbus length,
the two hemispheres.

52
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,550
I think you've heard about
the Columbian exchange.

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,680
Many thinkers have written about it.
I quote one of them.

54
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,460
The need of a constantly expanding market
for its products chases the Boers Waze

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,210
over the whole surface of the globe. It
must nessel everywhere. Settle everywhere,

56
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:18,570
established connections everywhere.
The Boris was,

57
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:21,030
he has through its exploitation
of the world market,

58
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,060
given a cosmopolitan
character to production and
consumption in every country to

59
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,140
the great chagrin of reactionists.

60
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,120
It has drawn from under
the feet of the industry,

61
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:33,270
the national ground on which it stood.
All old,

62
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:37,380
established national industries have
been destroyed or daily being destroyed.

63
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,910
They are dislodged by new industries whose
introduction becomes a life and death

64
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:46,230
question for all civilized nations
by industries that no longer work up

65
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:50,730
indigenous raw material, but raw
material drawn from the remotest zones.

66
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,430
You may have recently heard about
the tanker on the Australian reef.

67
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,570
It was going to China

68
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,010
in the streets whose products
are consumed not only at home,

69
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:06,310
but in every corner of the
globe and place of the old want,

70
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,850
satisfied by the
productions of the country.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,390
We find new wants requiring
for their satisfaction,

72
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:17,391
the products of distant lands and climbs
in place of the old local and national

73
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,530
seclusion and self sufficiency.

74
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,710
We have intercourse in every direction.

75
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,980
Universal interdependence of nations.

76
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,113
Yeah.

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
Who Do you think wrote this?

78
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,943
Okay.

79
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,560
Could it be Tom Friedman?

80
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
He'll frequently contributes to the New
York Times and writes extensively on

81
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:43,940
globalization.
How about Adam Smith or Carl Marx?

82
00:05:43,941 --> 00:05:48,941
Both very famous political economists
have earlier centuries or is it Jose

83
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:49,550
[inaudible],

84
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,550
a French farmer who organized the peaceful
remove or of Mcdonald's from his town

85
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:59,050
in France?
I quote wants more.

86
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,720
The Boers was he during its rule of
scarce 100 years has created more massive

87
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:08,890
and more colossal productive forces than
have all preceding generations together.

88
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,220
Subjection of nature's
courses to man machinery,

89
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:16,750
application of chemistry to industry
and agriculture, steam navigation,

90
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:21,550
railways, electric telegraphs, clearing
and hold continents for cultivation,

91
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,560
cannibalization of rivers,

92
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,730
whole populations conjured
out of the ground.

93
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,720
What earlier century had
even a present moment.

94
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,480
There's such productive forces lumbered
it in the lack of social labor,

95
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,100
modern bourgeois society with its
relations of production of exchange and a

96
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:39,934
property.

97
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,830
A society that has conjured
up such gigantic means of
production and of exchange

98
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,390
is like the sorcerer who is no longer
able to control the powers of the

99
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:53,080
Netherworld whom he has
called up by his spells.

100
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,310
It sounds like this profit,

101
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:01,910
Karl Marx speaking from the mid 19th
century would not have been surprised to

102
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,600
learn that at an even faster
mode of transportation,

103
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,440
air travel has been invented.

104
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,830
It now links all the continents of the
globe so that we can wake up in Africa

105
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:17,030
and go to bed and Canada.
This enabled one good looking French,

106
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:21,280
Canadian gay and very
promiscuous airlines steward,

107
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,390
so called patient zero to be instrumental
and spreading the aids epidemic

108
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,270
throughout North America.

109
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,590
The same forces also gave birth to a
growing science and technology that from

110
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:40,670
the underpinnings forum and
the underpinnings of modern
biomedical research and

111
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:41,690
Western medicine.

112
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,030
Let's reminisce about the good
old days and the 1970s pre aids.

113
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,370
I was at an Obg Ryan resident and
remembered that the medical profession was

114
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,410
full of optimism and hope.

115
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,860
A positive rather complacent attitude was
instilled in us medical students about

116
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,500
what hardworking well dockers
would be able to accomplish.

117
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,630
We would be able to fix the body's
mechanical defects with needles, tubes,

118
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:13,280
surgeries and blood products,
syphilis, TB, cholera,

119
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:17,630
and the other bacterial diseases
would be eliminated with antibiotics.

120
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,270
Vaccinations could cure a long list
of awful diseases like smallpox,

121
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:27,290
polio, diphtheria, tetanus, and on and on.

122
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,550
Globalization of medicine in the
World Health Organization would make

123
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:35,960
eradication of these diseases
from the entire globe possible.

124
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,590
Here's the world health,
the OP,

125
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,650
a whore organization's optimistic
de definition of health.

126
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:43,880
Back in those days,

127
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,320
ambitious scientist and doctors
were busy competing for grants,

128
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:54,580
positions of prestigious laboratories
and prizes like the Nobel prize.

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,600
The surgeon general of the United
States announced rather arrogantly.

130
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:05,601
In 1976 we have turned the
page on infectious diseases.

131
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,280
This smug medical attitudes
suddenly disappeared in the
1980s when our community

132
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:18,870
was confronted with a totally new
and mysterious emerging pandemic.

133
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,110
Where did it come from?
How did it start?

134
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,280
I highly recommend to you a book named
the river written by an Englishman Edward

135
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,280
Hooper,
who tries to answer these very questions.

136
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,490
The authors of Oud role model is Dr. John
Snow, the first modern epidemiologist.

137
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,060
He wrote a book about tracking down the
sorts of Colorado through the London

138
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:46,470
water supply in 1849 that you've
probably covered that in the course.

139
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,510
Like Snow Hooper has done an exhaustive
investigation of every available source

140
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:52,344
of knowledge

141
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,410
relating to the emergence of the AIDS
epidemic instead of one city. However,

142
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:03,000
he has had to trace the
epidemic up to three continents.

143
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,520
His story starts in the United States
with the first reported cases from the CDC

144
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:13,020
that you have there and traces the
chain of infection backwards in time.

145
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,140
Hooper agrees with Randy Shilts who wrote
the aids classic and the band played

146
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:20,690
on.
Um,

147
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,980
both think that the beginning of the
epidemic here was probably July 4th,

148
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,790
1976 to celebrate the
bicentennial of our nation.

149
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,890
New York City hosted the tall ships.

150
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,630
Huge sailing ships came from all
over the world and there was a lot of

151
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,360
international party and
going on in the big apple.

152
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,730
Retrospectively,

153
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:49,650
studies revealed that the first American
babies who were HIV positive were born

154
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:53,040
in New York City. A year later, 1977

155
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,970
hooper story then moves to Haiti.

156
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,960
The refugees seeking asylum here seem
to have a horrifyingly high incidence of

157
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:05,880
HIV.
And as a result,

158
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:09,660
many Americans went through a phase of
scapegoating Haitian refugees as the

159
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:10,680
sorts of aids.

160
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:17,090
Papa doc had a brutal regime that ruled
Haiti from 1957 to 1971 by means of

161
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:23,460
violent death squads called
the Tom Tom Macoute. Therefore,

162
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:28,230
when the Belgian Congo in Africa
became independent from Belgium in 1960

163
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,370
thousands of French
speaking professionals, uh,

164
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,700
escape their oppressive government
by taking jobs in the Congo,

165
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,610
in addition to help solve as
economic problems in Haiti,

166
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,320
Papa doc promoted his capital as a
tourist attraction for gay men from North

167
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,520
America and Germany.

168
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,950
Haiti was not the only country linking
the chain of infection back to the

169
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:56,050
Belgian count colonies in Africa.

170
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,070
The epicenter of the disease is found
where Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda,

171
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:08,020
nick come together by standard
epidemiologic logic, uh, detective work.

172
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,430
This is a picture of a refugee camp
that is a right in that area were aids

173
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:16,324
originated.

174
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,110
Okay.

175
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,840
How it started is a much
more controversial issue.

176
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,030
Hooper finds extremely compelling,

177
00:12:23,031 --> 00:12:28,031
the hypothesis that an oral polio vaccine
tested an African in 1958 in the very

178
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:33,080
place that is now the epicenter of
the disease may have enabled as Simian

179
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,920
immunosuppressive virus to cross
species from chimps to humans.

180
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,580
This hypothesis path is,
is,

181
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:45,380
is one among several about how the Simian
Immune virus could have mutated into a

182
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:49,730
human disease. Of course, there's no
ethical way of proving any of them,

183
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:51,920
so we will never actually
know what happened.

184
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:53,960
Yeah.

185
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,180
Anyhow,
back to what we know for sure.

186
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,800
Another background condition responsible
for the rapid spread of AIDS are the

187
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:05,540
tools of modern western medicine,
hypodermic needles, blood banking,

188
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,610
and invasive surgical techniques.

189
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,260
One of the first cases of recognized
aids occurred in a Danish surgeon named

190
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:19,481
Gretta Rask who had gone to work in the
Congo in 1964 she worked for three years

191
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:24,230
in a rural hospital that often had
no surgical gloves doing her surgery.

192
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,163
Barehanded.

193
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,970
She fell ill in 1976 eventually having
to fly back to Denmark under emergency

194
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:36,041
conditions and died there in 1977
as we saw from the CDC report,

195
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,410
the pneumocystis pneumonia that she had
was a rare opportunistic infection that

196
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:46,700
only occurs in people with severe
compromise of their immune systems.

197
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,620
According to close friends,

198
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:53,621
she had no other possible
route of infection than
performing surgery because she

199
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:56,780
would sell a bit and basically
spent her whole life working.

200
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:58,270
Yeah,

201
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,500
hemophilia axle.
Also,

202
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:03,970
we're one of the first groups noted to
have this new disease because they needed

203
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:08,650
to use pool. The factor eight to
prevent bleeding. At that time,

204
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,840
factory was used from concentrated,

205
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,230
pooled the CRM for many units of donated
blood and by 1984 50% of hemophilia

206
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:18,700
acts were HIV positive.

207
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:20,700
Okay.

208
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,320
And of course the tools of medicine don't
stay locked in offices and hospitals.

209
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,160
Needles made their way onto the
street for shooting the heroin.

210
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:32,250
A globalized mafia was,
uh, making available.

211
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,050
Ivy drug use also preceded the arrival
of HIV in New York at the 4th of July.

212
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:43,071
Celebration in 1976 IVD use that stands
for intravenous drug users soon became

213
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:50,250
one of the high risk groups for
aids and along with hemophilia x.

214
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,820
Let's take off that ugly picture.

215
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,070
The fourth factor in the rapid spread
of the epidemic was a migration and

216
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:01,850
concentration of gay men
in certain locations.

217
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,410
How and why did this happen?

218
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,370
Let's go back in time to the
middle of the 20th century.

219
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,730
The Nazi regime in Germany reveal to
the world how big a tree intolerance,

220
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,270
racism, and super nationalism can
grow into a grotesque, violent,

221
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,890
terrifying political machine of
Ostracism, slavery, and extermination.

222
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,140
Yeah.

223
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,250
In Hitler's Germany,

224
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,750
homosexuals were forced to wear a pink
triangle on their clothes and were sent

225
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:33,490
to concentration camps along with Jews,
communists, disabled people, and Gypsies.

226
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,050
I'm sorry to say that the Nazis are not
the first and last people in the world

227
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:40,270
to be bigoted in Hollerin and racist.

228
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,370
When American fighting men came
back home from World War II,

229
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:48,610
blacks went back to the segregated south.
Jews were excluded,

230
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,360
excluded from social clubs
and not long afterward,

231
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:54,730
Senator Joe McCarthy and FBI Director,

232
00:15:54,731 --> 00:15:58,990
j Edgar Hoover took on
communists and homosexuals,

233
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,990
the police in many large
cities and trapped men and
bathrooms by propositioning

234
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,660
them and immediately arresting
them if they responded.

235
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,190
Okay.

236
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,960
The usual punishment was not jail,

237
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:14,380
but notification of the
employer and public humiliation.

238
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:15,870
Yeah.

239
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,470
Alan Turing, a mathematical
genius who had cracked. Um,

240
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,750
the Nazi submarine code was arrested,

241
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:29,751
tried and convicted under Britain's
anti homosexual statutes in 1952,

242
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,040
he committed suicide in the summer of
1954 by taking a bite of a cyanide laced

243
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,600
apple in his laboratory.

244
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,630
Okay.

245
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,170
What do people do when they're living
a life of harassment and persecution?

246
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,930
They look for a place to go
where they will be accepted,

247
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:48,440
cared for and left alone.
That's ghettos form.

248
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,280
Even without state decree.
After the war,

249
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:56,390
people who were ostracizing and harass
back in their hometowns began to seek the,

250
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,460
I'm an anonymity of big cities.

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,320
A gay communities sprang up in Greenwich
village in New York and other developed

252
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:07,040
as a summer vacation spot
on fire island in the 60s.

253
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,920
It was illegal to serve
openly gay men at a bar.

254
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:18,410
Radical Gay Power and liberation was
launched with the Stonewall Inn riot the

255
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,340
last weekend of June,

256
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:25,340
1969 when a gay bar was raided by the
NYP D and drag queens bought back.

257
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,780
However,
the apogee,

258
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,690
the apogee of political sec success
for gays was achieved not in New York,

259
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:34,980
but in San Francisco.

260
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:36,500
Okay.

261
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,110
Harvey milk was elected as a supervisor,

262
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,590
the first openly gay elected
official in the nation.

263
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,450
And some of you may have
seen the recent movie, uh,

264
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,040
the film that was named a milk,
which is about his story.

265
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,100
In 1978, right? And City Hall,

266
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:58,101
Harvey Milk and the Liberal Mayor George
Mouse gone were shot by another member

267
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:03,120
of the board of supervisors,
the Anti Anti Gay politician,

268
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:07,680
Dan White. Instantly.
Harvey milk became a martyr,

269
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,460
galvanizing gay solidarity by 1980.

270
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,230
The then governor of
California, Edmond Brown, um,

271
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,480
declared the last week in June,
Gay Freedom Week.

272
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,310
This is the week of Gay
Freedom Day parades all over
the world commemorating the

273
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,710
stonewall riot.
As a result,

274
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:30,000
San Francisco became a Mecca
for gay people who's trained
there in great numbers.

275
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,640
I quote Randy Schultz in and the band
played on the promise of freedom had

276
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,430
fueled the greatest exodus of
immigrants to San Francisco.

277
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:43,431
Since the gold rush between 1969 and
1973 at least 9,000 gay men move to San

278
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,610
Francisco,
followed by 20,000.

279
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:52,611
Between 1974 and 1978 by 1980
about 5,000 homosexual man,

280
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:56,280
we're moving to the
golden gate every year.

281
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,750
The immigration now made for a city
in which two and five adult males were

282
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:01,620
openly gay.

283
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,690
This group was a very
politically coherent.

284
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,130
They were thrilled to come out of
the closet and participate openly.

285
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,800
Gay People started their own
churches and choirs. As a result,

286
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:20,720
local charities like the Red Cross,

287
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,360
we're happy to exploit
their civic mindedness.

288
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,810
In 1985 to 7% of the donated blood in San
Francisco was given by gay men who did

289
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,330
not know that they were HIV positive.

290
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,130
Okay.

291
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,600
Of course,
immigrant groups,

292
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:40,800
I'll always have their seamier side of
organized crime and our end up commercial

293
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:45,420
sex. Gay Men in particular were accustomed
to covert and anonymous expression of

294
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:50,421
their sexuality and participation in the
bath house culture was more mainstream

295
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,230
for them.
Remember,

296
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:56,130
many of these young men had
been repressing and hiding
their sexuality for most

297
00:19:56,131 --> 00:20:01,110
of their lives. And when society, they'd
denies people healthy ways of expressing,

298
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,340
expressing their sexuality, all kinds
of strange things begin to happen.

299
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,410
Many of the strange things that happened
in the bath houses are perfect methods

300
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:14,340
of transmitting every kind of infection,
especially hepatitis B,

301
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:18,690
g already a salmonella and
something brand new HIV.

302
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,290
Um, and if you don't know
what the bath houses are,

303
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,010
I would recommend that you read Shanti
Randy Shilts, his book and find out.

304
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,080
So this is the background of AIDS,
globalization,

305
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,490
modern invasive medical technology,
and ghettoizing of gay people.

306
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,010
Okay,

307
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,870
let's return to 1981 and the first report
in the medical literature that you all

308
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:43,770
have in your hands.

309
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:49,140
Western doctors who read it were oblivious
to the fact that while everyone is

310
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:53,350
celebrating like World Health
Organization's successful
program to eradicate

311
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:58,351
smallpox in 1978 [inaudible] stealthy
brand new germ had spread from central

312
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:04,150
Africa via professionals who had
worked there to both Haiti in Europe.

313
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,280
It had been introduced to centers of
commercialized gay sex once it had spread

314
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:14,230
into the blood banks and hospitals of
every nation and to intravenous drug users

315
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:17,830
and into their partners in babies.
Of course,

316
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:22,150
when the first horrible deaths from
weird infections occurred in the late

317
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,480
seventies and early eighties doctors
had no idea that the cause of this

318
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:29,100
mysterious immunological
deficiency was a retro virus,

319
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:33,880
that it was a slow virus and had been
contracted up to 10 years before.

320
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,100
The first characteristic of the disease
observant doctors noticed was it's

321
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,200
typical STD pattern.

322
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,510
It affected exactly the same high risk
groups that syphilis and hepatitis B

323
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,070
affect gay men,
prostitutes of both sexes,

324
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,710
intravenous drug users,
and hemophiliacs.

325
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,080
This epidemiological pattern caused
instant recognition in the minds of the

326
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,093
knowledgeable.

327
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,420
They immediately knew that this was an
infectious disease caused by a virus and

328
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:05,500
bodily fluids.

329
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,690
That's why the first report submitted in
1981 were published immediately in the

330
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:14,910
MMWR.
Take another look at the paper yourself.

331
00:22:14,911 --> 00:22:18,280
So imagine reading it and instantly
predicting the awful future.

332
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,470
Luckily for all of us,

333
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:25,090
Dr Don Francis Man and
the sweater did just that.

334
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:26,360
He was a 38 year old,

335
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:30,340
the epidemiologist who was at the
time working with the gay community on

336
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:35,220
developing a hepatitis B vaccine. His, uh,

337
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,180
phd project and lab work had been on
retroviruses on hearing about these two

338
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:44,890
reports. He instantly put two and two
together to predict that this was a virus

339
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:49,510
responsible for immunosuppressant and
to predisposing to cancers as well as

340
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:53,980
opportunistic infections.
By just the year before,

341
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:58,300
in 1980 doctor Robert Gallo of the
National Cancer Institute had shown that a

342
00:22:58,301 --> 00:23:03,301
retrovirus he called htlv cause a
type of leukemia common in Japan.

343
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,750
It was contagious and had a
frighteningly long incubation period.

344
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,660
Dr. Francis at the CDC
understood immediately in
1981 what sort of a disaster

345
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,500
was in the making.

346
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:18,850
And so right away he began trying to
move heaven and earth to get money for

347
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:22,730
recent search for virus
labs to isolate and uh,

348
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,450
the virus and get a diagnostic test.

349
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,230
But his please fell mostly on deaf ears.

350
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,810
A few did eventually pay attention
to him luckily and a year later,

351
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:39,190
Doctor Gallo at the NCI was finally
convinced the Dr. Francis was right and

352
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:40,890
dedicated a portion of his lab,

353
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,230
the research meanwhile and France,

354
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Professor Luc Montagnier Aa of the Pastor
Institute and in San Francisco j Levy.

355
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,670
We're also working on
trying to isolate the virus.

356
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,270
The French isolated at first and soon
afterwards applied to the patent office in

357
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,570
the United States for a blood test.

358
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,400
Gallows lab announced in 1984 that they
had discovered the aids infectious agent

359
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:11,270
applied to also for a patent and tried
to take all the credit for the discovery.

360
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,320
This led to an unpleasant
and embarrassing squabble,

361
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:19,190
the squabble between France and the U s
we always seem to be getting into little

362
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:23,570
squabbles with them.
Finally,

363
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:27,260
after lawsuits, congressional
investigations in public apologies,

364
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:32,261
everyone agreed on a way to
share a settlement negotiated
1987 named mom 10 Yay

365
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:38,720
and Gallo is co-discoverers and divided
the royalties from the blood tests

366
00:24:38,721 --> 00:24:43,100
between an aids foundation,
the Nih and the pastor institute.

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
The 2008 Nobel prize in medicine went
to doctor Montagnais for his discovery.

368
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,290
As you can see, it is he who
is smiling, not doctor Gallo,

369
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:56,960
mom,

370
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,960
10 yeas and gallows efforts had produced
the diagnostic Elisa blood test by 1984

371
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,330
this had enormous implications of course
for the blood banking ends it industry.

372
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:12,920
It also meant that populations could be
screened to find out who was infected

373
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,301
naturally.

374
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:18,590
Epidemiologist wanted to screen the high
risk populations to find out the actual

375
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:20,210
extent of the epidemic.

376
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,840
They wanted it to do what epidemiologists
always do try to contain the disaster

377
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:30,140
by identifying carriers and their contacts
and by preventing the spread of the

378
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:32,630
infection.
Unfortunately,

379
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:36,500
they knew that trying to work with
the two high risk groups, Msms,

380
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,540
that's men who have sex with men
and Ivd us was not going to be easy.

381
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,840
As an example,
gay time Douga the Canadian Airlines,

382
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:51,841
Stewart who is known as patient zero
estimated he had approximately 250 sexual

383
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:57,890
partners per year and carried on
like that for longer than 10 years.

384
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,180
Busy Guy,

385
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,450
the hotline at the Kaposi
Sarcoma Foundation began
receiving repeated calls from

386
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:10,451
people who had had sex in a sex parlor
with a Frenchman and he then calmly told

387
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:17,780
them that he had gay
cancer or Kaposi's sarcoma.

388
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,740
This is gay town Douga

389
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,080
and this is what one of the
signs of Kaposi's sarcoma.

390
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,241
As a result,

391
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:32,750
the director of the San Francisco Public
Health Department had to confront him

392
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:37,640
with the consequences of his behavior.
His pithy response to her was,

393
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,010
it's none of your goddamn business.

394
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,670
It's my right to do what I wanted to do
with my own body. If I was totally cool,

395
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,280
I would say that with a French accent,
but I'm not.

396
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,460
Next to the exact mechanisms of
pathogenesis were worked out.

397
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,650
HIV was shown to be
transmitted by sexual contact,

398
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:03,000
from exposure to infected blood or from
an infected mother to her fetus are

399
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:04,170
breastfed infant,

400
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,760
although the paranoid public thought
that you could get it from door knobs and

401
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:09,810
toilet seats.

402
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,860
Once the virus gained
access to the new host,

403
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,220
it would target lymphocytes in the blood
with the CD four cell surface molecule.

404
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,850
After gaining entry to these
important cells in the immune system.

405
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,500
Since the virus is cytopathic and
cell killing, it would replicate,

406
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:31,740
kill the cell and release into
the bloodstream causing a virus.

407
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:33,750
Emea of billions of particles.

408
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,200
Researchers discovered that they could,
uh,

409
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:42,230
course follow the course of the disease
by counting CD four cells more recently.

410
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,880
Um,

411
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,560
the ability to measure viral loads
directly has also become possible.

412
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,450
And so this is presently a routine means
of monitoring the course of disease and

413
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:55,740
the impact of treatments

414
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,410
and healthy people CD four counselor
over 500 cells per millimeter cubed.

415
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,130
And when the count drops under 200,

416
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,260
the person experiences significant
immunodeficiency so that their body cannot

417
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:13,020
fight off opportunistic
infections like TB,

418
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,760
pneumocystis pneumonia
or PCP as it's called,

419
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,090
toxoplasmosis and cryptococcal meningitis.

420
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,270
Here's a chart showing the most common
presenting complaints in a Haitian clinic

421
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,460
leading to a diagnosis of AIDS.

422
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,240
You can see that 54% presented with TB,

423
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,670
sorry. Yeah. Extra
pulmonary and pulmonary TB.

424
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,540
10% were diagnosed as part of pregnancy
screening and the third largest group

425
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:48,570
had what was called slim disease,
which is basically wasting away.

426
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,463
Yeah.

427
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,370
Once the pathogenesis was understood,
uh,

428
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:57,300
at strategies for treatment
could be developed.

429
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,390
This is consisted of
three prongs of attack,

430
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,260
one aggressive treatment and prevention
of the opportunistic infections that

431
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:09,261
ravage the bodies of immunocompromised
people to antiretrovirals and,

432
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,730
and more recently protease inhibitors.
That's lots of pills.

433
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,710
The invention I'm antiretroviral agents
began with Azt introduced in 1987 since

434
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:27,490
then, more than 14 have
been approved by the FDA,

435
00:29:27,491 --> 00:29:31,420
the food and Drug Administration,
which is incredibly fast approval.

436
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,340
Usually the FDA is very slow and
deliberate about approving new drugs.

437
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:41,890
However, because of intense
pressure from gay activists like up,

438
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,250
the rules were changed for
Aids medications in 1994
the pediatric AIDS clinical

439
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:53,431
trial group protocol showed that AZT
taken during pregnancy could significantly

440
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:58,240
reduce the vertical transmission
of HIV from mother to baby.

441
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:04,150
There's also from evidence now that
drug's given after exposure for medical

442
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:04,870
workers,

443
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,870
rape victims or other unprotected
sex offers a good hope of prevention.

444
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,230
This is called postexposure prophylaxis

445
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,140
and the most recent discovery
is that circumcision offers
some protection to men.

446
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:21,940
Okay.

447
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,940
And the space of seven years from the
first reported cases in 1981 of agonizing

448
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:28,780
deaths in young gay men,

449
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,160
the scientific medical establishment
was able to unravel the mystery of the

450
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:36,130
disease and start treating it.
However,

451
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:40,120
because of globalization and because
of cultural attitudes towards sex that

452
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:41,140
we'll talk about,

453
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,240
HIV AIDS had already spread around the
entire world within those seven years and

454
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:49,210
was duck decimating sub Saharan Africa.

455
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,240
Okay.

456
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,560
Since 1987 tremendous strides have been
made in wealthy countries and treating

457
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:59,430
the disease with complicated and
expensive multiple drug regiments.

458
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,560
Recommendations from a
CDC panel in 2002 state

459
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,070
antiretroviral regimens are complex,

460
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,960
have serious side effects,

461
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,700
post difficulty with adherence and Carrie
serious potential consequences from

462
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:24,380
the development of viral
resistance because of non
adherence to the drug regimen

463
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,830
or suboptimal levels of
anti retroviral agents.

464
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,330
Patient involvement in
therapeutic decisions is critical.

465
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:33,990
Yeah,

466
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,990
it's a full time job being HIV positive,

467
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,210
just keeping track of your medications.

468
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,390
These treatments cost well over $1,500
a month and turn aids into a chronic

469
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:48,390
illness. Most of the people
in the world, however,

470
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:52,760
are too poor to have access to these
expensive drugs and complex healthcare

471
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,670
interactions.

472
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,510
The majority of people with aids waste
away and die between the ages of 25 and

473
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,270
44 without the benefit
of any medical care.

474
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,630
Despite millions of dollars
and years of trying.

475
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:10,560
All attempts at developing a vaccine
have been dismal failures so far.

476
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,653
Yeah,

477
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,710
but this is basically an STD,
isn't it? What about prevention?

478
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,190
Yeah,

479
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,460
we all know that STDs are
potentially preventable,

480
00:32:22,461 --> 00:32:25,370
so why wasn't something done at
the beginning of the epidemic?

481
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,320
Why did the world wait around for science
to be worked out before going into

482
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:32,540
action to do something about the disaster?

483
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:37,700
You can bet that all smart medical
personnel like this lovely nurse instantly

484
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:38,900
put on gloves,
gowns,

485
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:43,610
and and instituted universal precautions,

486
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,320
which is the modern day a quarantine.

487
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,820
Why didn't everybody else
put on their condoms?

488
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,940
Our culture greeted the news of this
frightening new disease with the same old

489
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,430
counterproductive reactions of the past.

490
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,200
Scapegoating mass hysteria,
uh,

491
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,570
and the public was given a front
row seat by modern mass media to the

492
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:16,571
confrontation between the religious
right led by people like Reverend Jerry

493
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,470
Falwell and his moral majority
and organized gays like act up.

494
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,990
It was even more exciting
than professional wrestling
when the media and the

495
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:29,450
public realized however,

496
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,200
that unsuspecting patients were
being infected by the blood supply.

497
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,050
People with AIDS were ostracized.

498
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,730
Hemophilia children were
prevented from attending school.

499
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,540
Haitian immigrants were
excluded from the country.

500
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,600
People were afraid to donate blood.

501
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,470
They associated walking into a blood
bank with catching the disease.

502
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,710
But when Rock Hudson,

503
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,550
a movie star icon of male charisma
at the time announced he had aids.

504
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:05,650
And died of it in 1985 the American media
and its adoring public finally decided

505
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,560
we'd better get serious about all of this.

506
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,770
[inaudible]

507
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,770
old religious ideas about sexuality took
on fresh meaning suddenly everyone be

508
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:22,220
going, I'm talking about
celibacy, monogamy and abstinence.

509
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,530
The sixties and seventies had been a time
of liberalization of old sexual mores

510
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:32,150
in Western civilizations with the
invention of the birth control pill,

511
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,690
legalized abortion and
effective treatments for STDs.

512
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,780
Many religious fundamentalists
had been very unhappy.

513
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,970
Now they could climb into their
puppets and preach fire and brimstone.

514
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,140
Jerry Falwell, a Baptist
minister, pronounced

515
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,403
[inaudible]

516
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:54,280
aids is not just God's
punishment for homosexuals.

517
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,350
It is God's punishment for the
society that tolerates homosexuals.

518
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,310
The Roman Catholic Church ruled by the
pope from the Holy See at the Vatican is

519
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:09,190
an absolute monarch made a
response through its global
government of bishops in

520
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,260
parish priests.

521
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:15,770
The Catholic church also condemn home
homosexuality and since the Catholic

522
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:20,070
church is opposed to all birth control,
the use of condoms is also condemned.

523
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,333
Yeah,

524
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,840
the gay community has a particular
interest in the Catholic Church.

525
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:31,150
They suspect that many who have taken a
vow of celibacy may actually be closet

526
00:35:31,151 --> 00:35:32,200
homosexuals

527
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:38,640
as a result of decision was made by the
gay community to hold their world pride,

528
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:43,641
celebration and Rome and the year 2000
this was especially maddening because the

529
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:46,860
late Pope John Paul,

530
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:51,861
the second and the Vatican had mobilized
tremendous resources to celebrate the

531
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,140
2000 years of Christianity.
The jubilee,

532
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,940
the Church tried pressuring the Italian
government to remove its support for the

533
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:04,650
gay pride demonstration. The pope
appeared to make the following statement

534
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,930
and the name of the Church of Rome.
I must express sadness for the, uh,

535
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:14,931
front to the grand jubilee of the year
2004 the offense to the Christian values

536
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:18,810
of the city that is so dear to the
hearts of the Catholics of the world.

537
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,620
Homosexual acts are against nature's laws.

538
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,690
The church cannot silence
the truth because this would
not help discern what is

539
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:29,310
good and what is evil.

540
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,330
Before aids emerged in the United States,

541
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,360
right wing religious groups
had organized politically,

542
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,020
politically around antiabortion agendas.

543
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,750
This group would chooses the buzzwords
right to life and family values was

544
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:51,440
already up and running with big cloud
on the Republican Party's platform.

545
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:56,810
They had helped to elect the conservative
California governor President

546
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,550
Ronald Reagan in 1980

547
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,550
he was in the White House,

548
00:37:04,551 --> 00:37:09,551
busy slashing the healthcare budget
when the aids tragedy unfolded.

549
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,710
A disease of gay men and drug
users was not a priority for him

550
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,800
at a time that called for
strong leadership to contain
a major emerging epidemic.

551
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:26,420
Our president chose to remain oblivious
to the insistent demands of the CDC and

552
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:30,170
gay rights groups to be proactive about
preventing the spread of suffering.

553
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,850
In addition,
he had instituted the gag rule,

554
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,950
which effectively defunded the United
Nations Population Fund the largest backer

555
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:42,170
in the world of women's
reproductive health.

556
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,840
The clinics where poor people get condoms.

557
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,400
When President Reagan nominated doctor
c Everett Koop to be his surgeon general

558
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,580
feminist gaze and pro choice
groups were worried because of the,

559
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,630
this pediatric surgeon from Philadelphia
had a reputation for an anti choice

560
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:00,464
agenda.

561
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,310
Okay.

562
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,770
I'm only five years into the epidemic.

563
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:10,010
President Reagan responded to mounting
pressure by asking doctor coop to prepare

564
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:14,550
a report on AIDS.
Doctor Coop is a great guy.

565
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,080
He's a good hardworking doctor and he
got busy for the next nine months doing a

566
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:22,980
thorough and honest job
investigating the epidemic.

567
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,400
He ended up writing a lot of the report
by himself to the medical professions

568
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:32,460
delight. The report was
explicit, nonjudgmental,

569
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,470
controversial and popular.

570
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,400
It contributed significantly to providing
accurate comprehensive information to

571
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:44,200
the public coop.
Also personally penned understanding aids,

572
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,080
the public health,
a brochure.

573
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,040
He made the decision to send the brochure
to all 107 a million US households in

574
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:57,910
1988 the largest public help mailing ever.

575
00:38:59,210 --> 00:38:59,440
Yeah,

576
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,010
and rumor had it at the time
that President Reagan and
didn't find out about it

577
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:05,890
until after, after he got
his in the mail. I guess

578
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,760
aside from Dr. Cooper,
however,

579
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,810
the Reagan administration had two
political agendas that could not have been

580
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:16,480
more inimical to containing the epidemic.

581
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,180
The statistics speak for themselves.

582
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:27,090
Instead of providing more funding to
the government's health agencies to deal

583
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:31,320
with the problem, the administration
was slashing budgets. In addition,

584
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:36,210
they blocked the efforts of sex educators
worldwide around STD prevention,

585
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,010
the so called gag rule.

586
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,390
The large groups of people who believe
in preventive medicine began lobbying

587
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:46,500
hard for good sex education
and PR for condom use.

588
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,370
But Republicans and the religious
right have consistently tried to block

589
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:54,810
providing this education in public
schools and on TV while legislating

590
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:58,680
abstinence only, uh, education, uh,

591
00:39:58,681 --> 00:40:02,550
to which billions of
dollars had been given.

592
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,410
The Gay Community of course,
educated themselves about safer sex,

593
00:40:07,411 --> 00:40:10,950
but they blocked the closing down of
the bath houses for an unconscionable

594
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,270
amount of time.

595
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,100
Another preventative strategy strategy
that can tremendously slow the spread of

596
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:19,770
HIV is needle exchange programs.

597
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:25,580
IVD use intravenous drug users reused
dirty needles and countries that provide

598
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:28,920
sterile needles in
exchange for dirty ones.

599
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:33,060
The spread of disease among this
group slows dramatically. However,

600
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:35,790
in the United States,
these programs have been blocked

601
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,790
by the religious right

602
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,913
[inaudible].

603
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,510
One of the most depressingly shortsighted
responses to the epidemic was that of

604
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,100
the blood banking industry.

605
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,600
The Food and Drug Administration is
the federal agency that regulates them,

606
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,330
but politics prevented them
from doing the right thing.

607
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,430
Dr. Francis and the CDC, we're
desperately trying to convince the FDA,

608
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:02,730
the Red Cross,
the American Association of Blood Banks,

609
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,170
the national hemophilia foundation
to institutes screening and blood for

610
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:11,850
hepatitis B. Even before the
blood test for HIV had been, uh,

611
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:17,180
invented because gay men had cooperated
in the research for a vaccine against

612
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:18,450
hepatitis B,

613
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,780
it was clear to everyone that the
same people at risk for one disease,

614
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:23,070
we're at risk for the other.

615
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:28,290
But the gay groups were absolutely
paranoid about screening of any kind.

616
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,153
They featured,

617
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:34,190
they feared the stigma of positive
blood test would affect their,

618
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,120
uh, would make them lose
their job in their insurance.

619
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,410
And the blood banking industry was very
happy to go along with the gay lobby

620
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:47,270
because it would be so expensive and
such a big deal for them to screen the

621
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,580
blood.
Therefore,

622
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:53,540
even though Don Frances was openly
accusing them of negligent homicide,

623
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,640
the Red Cross did nothing until 1985
when the screening test for HIV became

624
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,630
available. Prior to this,
babies needing transfusions,

625
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:04,670
grandmothers needing hip replacements,

626
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,530
haemophiliacs their wives and
many others had died. Premature,

627
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:13,220
prolonged and painful deaths from
the contaminated blood supply.

628
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,680
Once blood testing became routine,
politically organized,

629
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:21,410
gay groups successively
got irrationally stringent.

630
00:42:21,411 --> 00:42:26,030
Confidentiality laws passed around the
screening test and those regulations

631
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:29,840
haven't had a negative impact on
collecting accurate statistics ever since.

632
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,000
Okay.

633
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,640
Luckily not all reaction to the aids
crisis were based on intolerance,

634
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,360
political expediency, financial
short sightedness and self interest.

635
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,290
Many nurses, doctors, families
and friends of victims,

636
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,490
ministers and rabbis rallied
around to provide support,

637
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
to organize fundraising to apply
political pressure and countless acts of

638
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,450
compassion and charity.

639
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,860
A heart rending and beautiful reminder
of this is the aids quilt which is part

640
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:06,500
of the names project.

641
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:13,120
Their stated goals are to provide a
creative means for remembrance and healing

642
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,700
to illustrate the enormity
of the AIDS epidemic,

643
00:43:15,701 --> 00:43:17,950
to increase public awareness of AIDS,

644
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,690
to assist with HIV prevention education
and to raise funds for community based

645
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:25,120
AIDS service organizations.

646
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,820
Anyone can commemorate someone who died
of AIDS by making a panel of the quilt,

647
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,560
which is a size of a gravestone
three feet by six feet with the name,

648
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:37,510
the dates in any memorabilia on it.

649
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,360
A documentary about the project called
common threads won an academy award in

650
00:43:43,361 --> 00:43:46,720
1990 and is available for you to watch

651
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,880
an October of 1996 the aids quilt
was unfurled in Washington DC.

652
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:01,670
It was a mile long extending from the
Washington monument to Capitol Hill.

653
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,810
I just want to say it's a little
different living through an epidemic than

654
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:07,644
reading about it.

655
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:14,400
Many thoughtful religious people were
jolted into reexamining their proper role

656
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,780
in this crisis with regards
to human sexuality and health.

657
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,120
The Episcopal Bishop of Newark,
New Jersey,

658
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:26,121
John Shelby Spong became famous with
the press and the 1980s because of his

659
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:30,030
active role in ordaining gay priests
in his work against homophobia.

660
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,310
He, along with others formed a task force
on changing patterns in sexuality and

661
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:40,140
family life to examine changes in modern
society and to make recommendations for

662
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:45,141
study for the National
Episcopal Convention in 1987
the task force recommended

663
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:51,690
in relation to premarital sexual
activity that all relationships are to be

664
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:55,950
assessed in terms of their capacity
to manifest marks of the realm of God,

665
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,760
healing, reconciliation, compassion,

666
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:02,730
mutuality and concern for
others both within and beyond.

667
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:07,731
Once immediate circle of intimacy with
regard to issues of committed homosexual

668
00:45:08,011 --> 00:45:08,761
relationships.

669
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:13,260
The report suggested that ideally
homosexual couples would find within the

670
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:18,261
community of the faithful the congregation
the same recognition and affirmation

671
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,890
which nurtures and sustains heterosexual
couples and their relationships,

672
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:24,360
including where appropriate,

673
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,750
liturgies which recognize and
blessed such relationships.

674
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,500
Many religious people were eager to become
a source of encouragement and healing

675
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,140
instead of guilt and shame for the myriad
of people who do not fit into narrowly

676
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:40,830
defined unrealistic sexual roles.

677
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,470
Reactions to the AIDS epidemic has caused
ongoing struggles within traditional

678
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:50,670
religions around the issue
of gay relationships and
premarital sex education.

679
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,670
And this continued into the new millennium

680
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,200
three days after the tragedy of nine 11
the Reverend Jerry Falwell pronounced on

681
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:03,420
the 700 club,
the Christian TV show.

682
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,980
I really believe that the Pagans and the
abortionists and the feminists and the

683
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:12,180
gays and the lesbians that are actively
trying to make an alternative lifestyle,

684
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,910
the ACL,
you people for the American way,

685
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,510
all of them who have tried
to secularize America,

686
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,440
I point the finger in their face and say,
you helped this happen.

687
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,410
CNN set up and took notice of this
and gave the executive director of the

688
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,470
National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force and opportunity to respond.

689
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,910
She answered by saying the terrible
tragedy that has befallen our nation and

690
00:46:37,911 --> 00:46:42,890
indeed the entire global community
is the sad byproduct of fanaticism.

691
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:48,080
It has its roots in the same fanaticism
that enables people like Jerry Falwell

692
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:52,430
to preach hate against those who do not
think live or love and the exact same

693
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:53,360
way he does.

694
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:57,950
The tragedies that have occurred this
week did not occur because someone made

695
00:46:57,951 --> 00:47:00,980
God man mad.
As Dr. Paul asserts,

696
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,580
they occurred because of hate,
pure and simple.

697
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,380
It's time to move beyond a place
of hate and to a place of healing.

698
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,120
We hope that Mr Falwell will apologize
to the u s and world communities

699
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,373
[inaudible].

700
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:24,060
The sad fact is that any one of us can
get aids in the same way that anyone can

701
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:26,770
be the victim of a terrorist.

702
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,660
Okay?

703
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,070
You don't to do anything to

704
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,570
deserve it. All you have to do is be
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

705
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,250
whether we like it or not.
In this 21st century,

706
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:45,251
we are one overgrown him and family of
more than 6.7 billion individuals packed

707
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:50,831
into a global village at the 33 million
among us who live with HIV AIDS or a

708
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:56,930
huge reservoir for all sorts of
opportunistic infections because of immune

709
00:47:56,931 --> 00:48:01,670
compromise. As a result, syphilis
and TB have made a comeback.

710
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,950
Multiple drug resistant TB is
becoming a growing problem at present.

711
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:11,930
Our best hopes for prevention of HIV AIDS
in the future lies and unfettered the

712
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:15,350
gigs on the sex education community,
providing condoms,

713
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:19,010
supporting and promoting monogamy
regardless of sexual preference,

714
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,260
needle exchange programs, universal access
to family planning and prenatal care,

715
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,240
and then funding viral research.

716
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,030
Okay.

717
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,330
Wherever the next killer epidemic starts,
like AIDS did an Africa,

718
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,240
it won't take long to
infect the whole earth.

719
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:40,280
If governments in system playing politics
with the medical profession and public

720
00:48:40,281 --> 00:48:44,000
health institutions,
evidence based medicine,

721
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:48,830
not religious revelation should be the
basis of decision making when it comes to

722
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:53,480
containing epidemics. Our future
relies on clever, energetic,

723
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:58,510
young people like yourself deciding that
you're not afraid of the hard work and

724
00:48:58,731 --> 00:48:59,630
complicated,

725
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,400
unpopular truths that are an integral
part of maintaining public health.

726
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,513
Okay.

727
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,330
Here's a list of questions to get you
started thinking and talking about

728
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:14,050
sexually transmitted
diseases and public policy,

729
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,200
and I think you're going to
email that to them, right?

730
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:22,990
So you don't have to copy it down.
Good luck.
