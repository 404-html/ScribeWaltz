1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,610
Uh,
as you know,

2
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:07,611
one of the longterm themes and our course
has been intellectual history and the

3
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:16,731
impact of epidemic diseases on
that this morning and not white.

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,190
I'm going to be looking at one of the
great medical debates in particular,

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,490
a great medical debate
of the 19th century,

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,050
which was to so called debate
between contagion, aneurysm,

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,490
and anti contagion aneurysm. Now, uh,

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,760
why would we be interested in it?
First of all,

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,180
if we're going to understand
19th century medicine,

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,540
we have to realize that
if you were to go back,

11
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,810
say to re reading the Lancet,

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,050
one of the major medical
journals of the 19th century,

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,850
or say the account of the proceedings
of the French Academy of Medicine,

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,560
you would see that they were,

15
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:03,360
one of the leading issue was
that was being hotly debated,

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,510
was the rights and wrongs the scientific
evidence for and against the idea of

17
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,830
contagion,
aneurysm and its opponents.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,080
The idea of anti contagion ism.

19
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,310
So this was really a hot button
topic in 19th century medicine.

20
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,000
It consumed the middle
decades of the century.

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,910
So if we're going to, if part of
our course is to understand, uh,

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,970
what was happening in the
world of medicine, well,

23
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,490
this debate was really crucial in it.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,310
Another part is not.

25
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,430
Another part of our interest in this
debate is that it brings to a conclusion,

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,860
um, much of our consideration
of Asiatic cholera.

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,240
We've talked about the impact of cholera
and we need to recognize that it's

28
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,440
impact was partly in the realm of ideas.

29
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,030
It's legacy didn't include just death,

30
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,450
fear,
social tension.

31
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,000
It didn't just leave behind it.
Sewer lines and water pipes and Britain,

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,170
the broad boulevards of
Paris and [inaudible],

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,520
the rebuilt lower city of Naples.
In addition,

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,900
it left behind it,

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,960
a major debate on the causes of disease
and epidemic diseases in particular.

36
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,550
And this is the debate between contagion,
aneurysm and anti contagion aneurysm.

37
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,320
It's useful for us to turn
to this debate awesome.

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,190
Because it helps us to prepare the
ground for one of the most important

39
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:55,070
discoveries in the history of science
and certainly medical science.

40
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,250
And that's the establishment
of the germ theory of disease,

41
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,840
which is our topic for next week. So, um,

42
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,560
what we'll want to do then is we'll
be moving towards the victory of

43
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,730
contagiousness them.

44
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,330
So this is a debate then that really
mattered in medical history now and

45
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,180
discussing this issue.

46
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,780
There are a couple of pitfalls
that I think we ought to avoid.

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,880
They're distorting and make it difficult
for us really to understand history in

48
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:35,680
general and history of
science in particular. Uh,

49
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,960
let me point out two pitfalls.

50
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,950
The first is a possibility of what's been
called the wig ish view of history now

51
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:47,770
and its application to science.

52
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,010
It sees history of science as a linear
upward march of truth moving steadily

53
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:58,270
forward over ignorance and obscurantism.

54
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,110
That is a history of constant progress
and it's reinforced if our history of

55
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:10,711
science deals and examines exclusively
the ideas that finally triumph so that we

56
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,210
study only a constant progress.

57
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:19,420
The march from one great idea to the next.

58
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,830
Another possible danger and pitfall
is what's called presenteeism,

59
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,970
which I might define as
the rather smug view.

60
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,510
That science all along has been striving
almost in Lamarche and manner to make

61
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:43,471
the benighted people of the past finally
emerge as smart as we are and we get to

62
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:50,701
look back condescendingly on
the thinkers of past centuries,

63
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,280
giving them marks for how right or
how wrong we now know that they were.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,970
So to avoid those pitfalls,

65
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,410
but I'd like to do is to approach
this in a different spirit.

66
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,370
Next time I will take the more traditional
path of looking at the victorious

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,630
germ theory of disease.

68
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,440
And at that point we'll pay our respects
to the famous trio of 19th century

69
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:23,020
science that you all know of Louie,

70
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:27,310
pastor Robert,
call Joseph Lister.

71
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,510
And in doing that we'll notice that
what triumphed wasn't only disembodied

72
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:39,310
scientific truth. I'm not
disputing, let me stress this,

73
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,810
I'm not going to be disputing the
truth of the germ theory of disease.

74
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,650
But what I want to do is
something a little more subtle,

75
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,720
which is to notice that what triumphed
wasn't just disembodied truth,

76
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,610
but also a worldview.

77
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,040
And that when that worldview one out,

78
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,690
there were some losses as
well that went with it.

79
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,420
The germ theory of disease.

80
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,570
It's one of the greatest advances
in the history of science.

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,040
What we need to argue that although true
it perhaps wasn't the entire team of

82
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:20,891
truth and then its establishment as a
reigning orthodoxy by the end of the 19th

83
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:27,281
century because it does in fact come
to be held by the entirety of the

84
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:34,661
international medical community
really after around the 1890s or so.

85
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,230
And that brought with it
one of its consequences and
unintended one was certain

86
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:49,301
negative impacts on understanding of
disease that we'll be talking about and to

87
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:54,680
understand and appreciate this fact.

88
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,910
I'm going to concentrate this
morning not on the victors.

89
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,750
You'll know about them already to some
extent and we'll be turning to them for

90
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,890
the whole of next week.

91
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,670
But I'd like to look instead at someone
you probably don't know or maybe not

92
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:17,510
know at all. In fact,
just out of curiosity, um,

93
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,680
had before we talked about him
in our course and reading, uh,

94
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,610
how many of you had actually
heard of mocks fun patent coffer?

95
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,590
See, that's what I suspected. Um,

96
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,500
actually no one had heard of mocks von
patent coffer. So all the more reason,

97
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,493
uh,
we're going to,

98
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,570
the good news for you is we're going
to be dealing with him for the next 40

99
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:40,700
minutes or so.
Um,

100
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,970
he's the most sophisticated and
scientifically robust of those who were,

101
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,510
as we might call wrong.

102
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,140
He lived from 1818 to 1901 and one is
of the great figures of 19th century

103
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,930
medical science,

104
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,500
although his scientific defeat was
total and humiliating by the 1890s.

105
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,240
And indeed that might form part of the
background to the fact that he was to

106
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:18,500
commit suicide at the turn of the
20th century when he shot himself.

107
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,620
But I'm going to try to understand
that he was not just simply wrong,

108
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,380
but I'll argue that he
was splendidly wrong.

109
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,310
That is mistaken ideas actually saved
millions of lives and that third defeat

110
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,220
how to paradoxical consequence,

111
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,190
not only of advancing medical science,

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,400
but in some ways impoverishing it in
ways that are important and that we might

113
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,030
want to consider.
Well,

114
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:52,031
who was a mock pet Petten coffer
and since you hadn't met him before,

115
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,230
let me introduce you to him.
Uh, and here we use, uh,

116
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,310
in splendor and he was a German
scientist and physician in particular,

117
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,653
uh,

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,290
ah,
map of Germany,

119
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,150
Patten coffers associated with
Bavaria here in the south of Germany.

120
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:18,400
Let's look at that a little more closely.

121
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,530
And he was an associated,
especially with the city of Munich,

122
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,180
and I'm pointing this out
to you, not simply so that
you'll know where he's from,

123
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:29,500
although that's nice to know,

124
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,590
but this is extremely significant in
his theories and that he tends to be the

125
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:39,901
defender of localism and the autonomy
of Bavaria and Munich against the

126
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:44,980
centralizing tendencies of,
um,

127
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,810
of Germany as a whole.

128
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,840
So it has a political significance that
we'll be turning to know what were his

129
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:55,300
social origins?
Who was he?

130
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,060
He came from a Catholic
family of very modest means,

131
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,410
but lots of children.

132
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,670
And the family that is his nuclear family
didn't really have the means to afford

133
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,410
him with a higher education.

134
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,860
And he gained that because of an uncle.

135
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,790
He had a wealthier uncle who
was a prominent apothecary,

136
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:24,450
but alas had no sons and he wanted his
nephew mocks to carry on the family

137
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:26,590
business.

138
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,990
So Mark's Van Patten coffers started
out life by studying pharmacy and

139
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:32,830
chemistry.

140
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,280
And this in fact was to have an
impact on his medical theories.

141
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,670
But he soon discovered that he hated
the subjects he had originally enrolled

142
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,580
into study and eat,

143
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,840
terminally disappointed his uncle when
he enrolled in as a medical student.

144
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,550
And he gained his medical degree in
1843 from the University of Munich.

145
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,380
Thereafter,
he had a varied career for a few years,

146
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,660
casting about for what he
wanted to do in life. Uh,

147
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,680
he worked for a while for a mint and even
had a field attempt to become a stage

148
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:15,874
actor.

149
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,780
But in 1847 he gained appointment to
the medical faculty at Munich and became

150
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,890
also a professor of organic chemistry.
From then on,

151
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,010
he enjoyed immediate your career as
one of the rising stars of science in

152
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:38,800
Bavaria in Germany and Europe in general.

153
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,370
It became advisor to the
Bavarian government and a
full professor of medicine in

154
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,930
1853

155
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,550
now 1854 changed his life and it did so

156
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,990
in relationship to an outbreak
of Asiatic cholera in Germany.

157
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,980
And it's interesting that this is the
very same epidemic that snow studied in

158
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:09,830
London,
but we're as snow was a contagion.

159
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:14,680
Honest patent coffer reached
the exact opposite conclusion.

160
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,420
Indeed.
Thereafter,

161
00:12:16,421 --> 00:12:20,080
he became a lifelong
opponent of snow's ideas.

162
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,260
And what do you referred to with
scorn as the English water mania,

163
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,470
the English, he said,
we're obsessed with water.

164
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,320
Well, what was the debate and
why was it so passionately held?

165
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Now the debate was obviously about the
issue of whether diseases are contagious

166
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:45,640
or not,
but it didn't involve all disease.

167
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,860
No one doubted in the 19th century
that syphilis, for example,

168
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,180
was contagious.

169
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,490
The debate was about a subset
of diseases fall in particular,

170
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,140
leprosy,
typhus,

171
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,980
and then what we might
call the big three plague,

172
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,410
yellow fever and cholera.
In other words,

173
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,500
the debates centered on the diseases
that were the most feared diseases of the

174
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,130
19th century.

175
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,470
And so the debate was passionate
because it concerned diseases that were

176
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,500
extremely important and it wasn't just
a matter of academic disagreement.

177
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,440
The decision on whether you defined
a disease as contagious or not had a

178
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,110
practical importance.

179
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,220
It meant what are going to be the public
health strategies that you'd devise to

180
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:49,144
combat it.

181
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,530
And the European powers were greatly
divided as to whether they should defend

182
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:58,330
themselves by quarantine,

183
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,630
the great Auntie
contagiousness measure or not.

184
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,170
Well, the two sides in the debate, then
we're contagion ism NMT contagion at them.

185
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,360
Let's start with contagent.
Awesome.

186
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,580
This wasn't a new idea at
all in the 19th century,

187
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,750
but it was unknown to the Greeks,

188
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,290
but it was part of Biblical tradition
and you've heard of it's popularization

189
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:30,661
already by the Italian physician for Daca
Storto and the 16th century contagion

190
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:37,201
ism had a widespread importance
in popular culture as well.

191
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:44,010
The contagion is an idea by
the 19th century was that
there were some infectious

192
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:48,580
material,
some people thought it was a poison,

193
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,850
a chemical and other words,
others that it might be.

194
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,170
It was pure speculation, a
living entity and animal. Cool.

195
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,960
You'll see that word in
John Snow for example,

196
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,170
in one of his speculative moments
that was transmitted in some manner,

197
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,440
perhaps person to person,
perhaps through the pores,

198
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,220
perhaps by contact with the sick person,

199
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,020
perhaps spine objects that had
been in contact with that person.

200
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,500
And you've just been reading
a very powerful expression
of the contagion honest

201
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,070
position.
And that's the work of Jon snow.

202
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:30,880
Okay.

203
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,880
But a potent thing to remember was
not down to the 1890s contagion ism.

204
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,810
And this may surprise you,

205
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:46,410
which primarily the standpoint of popular
culture rather than of the medical

206
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:47,914
elite.

207
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Whereas anti contagion ism dominated
the international medical profession.

208
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,030
Most of men of science regarded
contagiousness and as a view held by the

209
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:03,850
ignorant on the superstitious.

210
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:09,630
And indeed the irony is that contagion
ism reached a nadir in respectability

211
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,650
just before the work of call and pastor
demonstrated its ultimate vitality take

212
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:21,670
to understand that.

213
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Take an example that by now you know
extremely well and that is pledge

214
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,460
to the layman.

215
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,490
The spread of plague seemed to justify
the idea that by some means that people

216
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:39,820
still didn't understand it's
spread from one person to another,

217
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,060
but to little learned physician,

218
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,590
the case for contagion still seemed weak.

219
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,930
There wasn't a mechanism
to explain what it was,

220
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,580
how it was transmitted.
In many cases,

221
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,730
close inspection seem to demonstrate that
the disease spread without the direct

222
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:04,630
contact,

223
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,050
that the contagion is view
seem to postulate people
caught the plague who hadn't

224
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:14,650
been an immediate contact
with another plague victim.

225
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,000
Conversely,
where there was such contact,

226
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,300
often the plague didn't spread and people
who cared for plague victim sometimes

227
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:28,090
didn't fall ill.
How could that be explained?

228
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,490
Furthermore,

229
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,360
epidemics of plague began and ended in
the most mysterious manner that no one

230
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:42,380
could plausibly explain
under strength.

231
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,251
In their case,

232
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:48,251
the contagiousness would need to discard
their theory of inanimate contagion,

233
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,790
replacing it with something
that was living. Furthermore,

234
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:58,680
there was the need for the idea of
transmission of her distance by water,

235
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:00,810
perhaps food supplies,

236
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,960
or later we'll see insect vectors.

237
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,210
But the debate was also fueled
by political contusions,

238
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:10,380
by politics,

239
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,400
because major conclusions followed
from the position that one adopted

240
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,940
contagiousness in their
scientific conclusions or
people who buttress the power

241
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:28,200
of the state.
Because in the name of state power,

242
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:33,290
one could institute the most draconian
measures cordons lots of reptoids

243
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,010
quarantine.

244
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,850
You could see quester sequester
and confined individuals.

245
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,670
You could limit civil liberty and you
could radically control the movement of

246
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,680
goods and of trade.

247
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,250
So one of the results then
of contagiousness them,

248
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,400
you can see here,
um,

249
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,000
the idea here you have cholera,

250
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,060
yellow fever and plug trying to
enter the citadel at the gates.

251
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:12,820
And here we have quarantine
and the draconian measures,

252
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,760
uh, that follow from that
cleanliness. Uh, you know the film,

253
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,240
by now you're experts on the filth
theory of disease and the measures to be

254
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:26,500
adopted against it. So the
idea of contagion, aneurysm,

255
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:31,430
buttressed. Those ideas have a strong,
powerful state interventionism.

256
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,440
Now let's turn then to their opponents,

257
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,600
the anti contagiousness,

258
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,840
the people who were skeptical with
regard to the ideas of Jon snow.

259
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,890
These were largely associated
with the political left.

260
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Why auntie contagion
aneurysm implied free trade.

261
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,280
It was associated with liberalism and
with the defense of individual liberties

262
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,930
against arbitrary state bureaucracies.

263
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:18,270
It implied opposition to extreme and
sometimes violent plagued measures of

264
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,450
public health,

265
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,840
so it wasn't a by conclude incidents that
it was a good idea to look at a map of

266
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:30,971
Germany because the most important of the
contagiousness Robert Call was an icon

267
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:37,580
and promoter of the power of
the centralized German state.

268
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,570
He worked in Berlin and that wasn't by
chance and he defended the centralizing

269
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,880
and imperial interests
of the German Reich.

270
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,460
Worst Petin coffer was a liberal who
championed the local interests of Bavaria

271
00:20:55,361 --> 00:21:00,361
and Munich and indeed his theories
coincided both medically and politically.

272
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,560
There was some times
referred to as localism.

273
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Another way of seeing the stakes in
this debate is to remember that Britain

274
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,150
long opposed the contagiousness position.

275
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,140
There were big part in part
on for political and economic
reasons that is to say

276
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Britain was ranged in the international
conferences largely with Auntie

277
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,150
contagiousness in part because it's
interest prospered best through free trade

278
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,180
and it felt threatened
by medical arguments that
implied that the state should

279
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:51,361
interfere with commerce impounding
British ships and quarantining their crews

280
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:53,650
for 40 days.

281
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,630
The Anti contagiousness also had the
imprimatur should we like of tradition of

282
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,590
the authority of tradition.

283
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,040
Their views were sanctioned by Hippocrates
and Galen and were buttressed by a

284
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:16,180
whole panoply of ideas
that had grown up later.

285
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,390
But we're a,

286
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,440
if we like a compatible with
the traditional practice
of medicine with the idea

287
00:22:23,621 --> 00:22:28,621
of atmospheric influences of the
epidemic constitution as it was called,

288
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:34,860
a bit of jargon for you of the atmosphere
and it was compatible with the filth

289
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,480
and Maya theory.

290
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Let's also remember that anti contagion
ism inspired some robust health measures

291
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:48,070
as well and it saved lives.

292
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:52,990
Anti contagion aneurysm was to view of
people like Chadwick commune known now

293
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,330
and his associates Southwood Smith.

294
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,440
It was the view of [inaudible] and the
second empire and it was the official

295
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:06,670
doctrine of Rasaka mental that
is the rebuilding of Naples

296
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,600
now in the history of medicine and
public health and epidemiology,

297
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,870
the color of epidemic of 1854 looms large
giving rise to two foundational texts

298
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,390
of Epidemiology on opposite
sides of the debate.

299
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,960
On the one side we see John
Snow and you've read is on
the mode of communication

300
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:32,710
of cholera,

301
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,830
the final version of which
it was first drafted in 1849.

302
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,850
But the, uh, the draft that you
have appeared after this event,

303
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,630
and this was the classic statement of the
contagiousness view to the extent that

304
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:53,891
it could be supported without the
definitive evidence later provided by

305
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:56,060
microscopy.

306
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:01,270
So snow did everything that it was
possible to do purely on the basis of

307
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,950
epidemiological evidence.

308
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,460
There was going to need to be a conceptual
shift in order to clinch his view and

309
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:14,300
demonstrate it so that
it was broadly accepted.

310
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,460
On the other side,
we see a book that's been a,

311
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,500
it's not even on our own reading list,

312
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,710
a book that's been largely forgotten.

313
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:30,550
This is Max von patent coffers work
called investigations and observations on

314
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:37,421
the method of spread of cholera published
in 1855 and this I should say that

315
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:45,941
pattern coffer was no less rigorous
as an epidemiologist than Jon snow.

316
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,730
And this was a major foundational
texts in epidemiology.

317
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,790
It was a study of the 1854 epidemic in
Bavaria reaching conclusions that were

318
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:02,750
diametrically opposed to those of snows.

319
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,160
So from 1854 cholera became a lifelong
preoccupation of mocks Fon Patton coffer.

320
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:17,510
And he devoted himself to the
epidemiological study of the disease,

321
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,900
staking his reputation on high
profile debates with Robert Kaul.

322
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,830
He was to write some 200 articles and
books during his lifetime on a whole range

323
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:32,330
of scientific topics,

324
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,600
but the largest number about 60 we're
devoted to cholera and its transmission

325
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,480
and costs.
So Petten coffer.

326
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,570
And the reason we're dealing with him
now is he was the last major and the best

327
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:56,261
defender of the antique contagiousness
doctrine of Miasma TISM.

328
00:25:56,961 --> 00:26:00,500
In other words,
and he defended it until his death.

329
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,450
At The dawn of the 20th century,

330
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,270
he adopted the traditional
doctrine dating back to antiquity,

331
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,660
but provided with with the new
evidence based scientific underpinning.

332
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,111
Well,

333
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:20,111
why was patent coffer not convinced
by snow when it came to cholera?

334
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,810
Part of the reason,
you know,

335
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,910
contagion ism patent coffers said,
and in this he was right.

336
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,910
It didn't produce a really plausible
mechanism for the transmission of the

337
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:35,870
disease.

338
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,040
It correlated cholera
cases with drinking water,

339
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,260
but to Petten coffer,

340
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,320
there seem no means of explaining
exactly what was transmitted or how.

341
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,000
Also,
as you know,

342
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:56,001
petting coffer had been trained as a
chemist and he looked at the traditional

343
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:02,781
idea that the collar a poison with some
sort of chemical substance and he argued

344
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:06,840
that it was entirely improbable,

345
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:10,410
improbable that a dcs could be spread.

346
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:15,411
Then in the manor postulated looking
at London and the river Thames,

347
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:22,100
how could a poison contaminating the
Thames if it was a chemical not be

348
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,000
infinitely diluted?

349
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,990
Okay.

350
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,830
Furthermore,

351
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,950
he said there was a whole series of
what we might call cholera mysteries.

352
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,850
That snows position
didn't help to aluminate.

353
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,880
Why did an epidemic
start and why did it end?

354
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,540
Why could doctors provide their services
in the midst of an epidemic of cholera

355
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,080
and yet not fall?
Ill have it themselves?

356
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,950
What caused the pronounced
seasonality of Colorado?

357
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Why was its onset almost invariably in
the spring and the summer and why did an

358
00:28:05,781 --> 00:28:10,220
outbreak? We seem to ed with
the onset of cold weather.

359
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,900
And then lastly for the moment there was
what we might call the problem of Leon.

360
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,620
That is the great second city of France.

361
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,370
If cholera is contagious and if it
follows the great routes of trade and

362
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:29,930
Population Movement,

363
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,800
why is it that there are nonetheless
major centers that escaped throughout the

364
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,660
19th century?

365
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:44,550
Leo was the second largest city in
France located at the hub of a network of

366
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:50,470
trade and transportation
and it had all the earth.

367
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,170
It was a great textile
center of manufacturing.

368
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,970
Okay.

369
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,970
And with and had all the urban problems
of an industrial center at its time.

370
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,960
If ever patent coffer would say there
was a city that seemed primed to be

371
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:13,010
devastated by Asiatic cholera.
It was Leone,

372
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,310
and yet her to escape the visitations
of this exotic Asiatic outsider.

373
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,250
Well,
what was Patton coffers theory?

374
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,940
And it was his delight to believe that
he could provide an apparently clear

375
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,980
epidemiologically based explanation
for all of those cholera mysteries.

376
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,600
Indeed part,

377
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,660
another aspect of his theory that Robert
Kaul discovered the Vibrio cholerae.

378
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:55,171
You've seen a picture of the Vibrio and
he discovered it in 1883 petnin coffer

379
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,500
didn't reject the idea of the Vibrio.

380
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,450
Instead,

381
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,480
he incorporated it elegantly into his
larger theory explaining that it played a

382
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:15,250
role in the etiology of cholera,

383
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,700
but that its role and its mechanism were
completely different from the ones that

384
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,960
cock espoused
patents.

385
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:29,961
Coffers theory is often referred to
as the groundwater theory we've seen.

386
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:34,530
It can be called localism.
It can be called the groundwater theory.

387
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,600
Okay.

388
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,600
The simplest approach to his method is
a very simple mathematical equation that

389
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:46,890
he was very fond of himself
for illustrative purposes.

390
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,060
It was perhaps the simple of
all mathematical formulas.

391
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,280
X Plus y equals z.
Uh,

392
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:59,880
what did that mean? Tamoxifen
patent coffer? Well, for him,

393
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,010
Z was a cholera outbreak.

394
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,060
The result then of combining x and y,

395
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,640
it's produced,
in other words,

396
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,870
under certain specific
conditions of two other factors,

397
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:17,550
the x factor and the why factor,
the x factor,

398
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:21,150
he said was the presence of
the Vibrio cholerae. You see,

399
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,380
he accepts that the Vibrio plays a role,

400
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,960
but for Patton coffer,

401
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:33,110
the Vibrio itself on its own
would never make you sick.

402
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,450
You could swallow it quite safely
and remain entirely healthy.

403
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,250
He regarded it as harmless on its own.
And as we'll see in a moment,

404
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:49,340
he carried out a famous auto experiment
in which he tried to demonstrate

405
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,180
conclusively the truth of his view.
In other words,

406
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,240
he made himself a cocktail of
the Vibrio cholerae and drank it,

407
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:00,870
and in fact,

408
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:05,871
he remained healthy and therefore I'm
persuaded to the end of his life that the

409
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,240
Vibrio on its own was harmless.

410
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,510
Okay.

411
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,510
He was to say that the Vibrio causes
disease and an entirely different but

412
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,480
orthodox,
Maya's Madec manner.

413
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:27,230
The danger around doesn't arise when
the [inaudible] contaminates food and

414
00:32:28,171 --> 00:32:31,650
drinking water.
The problem is different.

415
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,800
It happens when the Vibrio gets into
the soil beneath a major city and their

416
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,233
Petten coffer,

417
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:44,570
a horticultural analogy referring
to germination or fermentation.

418
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:51,350
After the Vibrio gained access to
the soil under certain conditions,

419
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:56,410
it could germinate like a plant and
give off its poison into the air.

420
00:32:56,751 --> 00:33:01,751
Above that the population inhaled and
those who were susceptible fell ill in

421
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:07,811
large numbers and it was then that an
onset that you'd have the onset of an

422
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:12,830
epidemic.
So in 19th century medical parlance,

423
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,040
cholera was an example of a whole category
of diseases that were called Xy modic

424
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,060
diseases,
diseases caused by fermentation.

425
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,990
So that we've see the x factor
involves the Vibrio cholerae side.

426
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,930
Then that why factor was
simply those local conditions,

427
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,351
again,

428
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:41,351
localism that were necessary
for fermentation to take
place and for poison to be

429
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:45,020
given off into the atmosphere.

430
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,490
So what makes up the why factor?
So again,

431
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:52,970
let's think of horticulture
and the growth of a plant.

432
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,380
A plant doesn't need only soil to develop.

433
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,220
It also needs nutrients and fertilizer.

434
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,380
And here was the critical
role of filth and excrement.

435
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,690
They were in patent coffers,

436
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:12,890
mind the nutrients for this plant,

437
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,500
the Vibrio cholerae.

438
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,470
So unsanitary urban conditions literally
fed the Vibrio sewage was dangerous,

439
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,130
not because it got into the water,

440
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,820
but because it's seeped into
the soil beneath the city,

441
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:33,050
nourishing the Vibrio and
giving rise to fermentation,

442
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,660
but there's more to it.

443
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:40,661
And patent coffers epidemiology like a
plant fermentation required a number of

444
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:48,170
other preconditions. It needed
water. Plants always need water.

445
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,080
It needed a warm temperature.

446
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,060
It needed air and porous
soil in which to grow.

447
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,370
And it was at this point that we see
why patents coffers theory is sometimes

448
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:03,320
called the groundwater theory.

449
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:09,430
Groundwater was important to his analysis
because he considered variations in

450
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:16,031
the water table beneath the city to be
a measure of the capacity of its soil

451
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:22,331
beneath the city to support fermentation
and give rise to cholera epidemics to

452
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,180
higher water table would be like flooding
and that would kill the plant too low

453
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,100
a table would be like
a drought or a desert.

454
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,590
So for cholera epidemic,

455
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,520
the was an ebbing water
table that left moist,

456
00:35:41,521 --> 00:35:43,080
porous soil above it,

457
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,780
a condition that was likely to be
characteristic of the early summer,

458
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,200
and indeed Petten coffer now thought he
understood the seasonality of cholera,

459
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:00,620
he could explain it seasonality
by reference to the water
table of European and

460
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:06,900
other cities.
So armed with this theory,

461
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Petten coffer proceeded to conduct
exhaustive epidemiological studies of the

462
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:18,060
local conditions of localities
vulnerable to cholera

463
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,330
for Petten coffer.

464
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,740
It seemed obvious why mountainous areas.
The Alps,

465
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:30,150
for example, didn't, weren't
afflicted with cholera. There.

466
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:35,151
There was such a deep layer of insulation
between the groundwater and the

467
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:40,200
population who are therefore
protected from the collar poison.

468
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,640
Similarly,

469
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,080
desert areas provided no
conditions for fermentation.

470
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,890
Pim Petten coffer also thought
that he had solved the Leo problem

471
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,940
by investigating and studying Leon,

472
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,750
he realized that it was built on a thick
layer of impenetrable granted was built

473
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:09,591
on stone and therefore
provided no opportunity for
fermentation and germination.

474
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,760
The best conditions were provided by
cities that were built at sea level on a

475
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:18,930
loo,
veal porous soil.

476
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,990
This could explain why
Naples was ravaged Paris,

477
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,940
London,
Calcutta,

478
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,510
and then he decided being
an honest scientist that he
should also investigate in

479
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:35,460
particular the hard case,

480
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,990
the one that seemed to conflict with
his theories and that was the island of

481
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:40,824
Malta.

482
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:46,580
Malta was built on rock but it experienced
disaster during recurring cholera

483
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:53,481
pandemics and he thought to
his own satisfaction that
he could solve the riddle.

484
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:00,240
Malta, unlikely all was not
built on impermeable. Granted,

485
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:04,410
it had everything to do with the
specifics of the stone itself.

486
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,200
Malta was built on porous,

487
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:12,201
soft limestone and not provided infinite
air filled cavities that if watered and

488
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:20,001
fertilized and warm conditions would
provide wonderful places for germination.

489
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,750
You can see patent coffer visiting Malta,

490
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:27,750
which he did and having his Eureka moment.

491
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,080
He did core samples.
I'm trying to say.

492
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:36,110
The patent coffer was a very conscientious
research and a strong epidemiologist

493
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,810
and he went further.

494
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:45,811
He argued also that he could explain not
only which cities where most afflicted

495
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:50,710
by cholera, but also the very
neighborhoods within them,

496
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,580
low lying areas close to the water
table would be vulnerable to cholera

497
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,440
neighborhoods built on hills would be
protected. Naples was a good example.

498
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,810
The lower city was ravaged,

499
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,930
the opera city was not and Petten coffer
thought in you why Neapolitans as you

500
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:11,800
know,

501
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,800
in fact agreed with him and patent
coffers theories were much admired there.

502
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,230
It seemed to explain Neapolitan history
and it was his theories that were the

503
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,990
very basis for the rebuilding project.

504
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,460
So he saw his great achievement of that,

505
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:35,461
of developing a single unified theory
with no internal contradictions that could

506
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:41,911
explain all of the known facts of cholera
and clarify those puzzling cholera

507
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:45,160
mysteries.

508
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:51,150
Now an interesting point about patent
coffers theories there now rejected by

509
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:53,410
modern science,

510
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,460
but during the 19th century they provided
a major impetus to undertake needed

511
00:40:00,821 --> 00:40:02,260
sanitary reform.

512
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,250
His ideas therefore can be credited
probably with saving hundreds of thousands

513
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:13,330
of lives from a variety
of diarrheal illnesses.

514
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,520
Cholera of course,

515
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,150
but also typhoid gastroenteritis.

516
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,210
So this is a case of an idea that we
now know not to be robust scientifically

517
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:31,350
that nevertheless produced very practical
results that had a major impact on

518
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,790
combating epidemic diseases.

519
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:42,270
Patten coffer was responsible in fat for
bringing the sanitary idea to Bavaria.

520
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,380
He wanted to install sewer systems
to take away waste and fecal matter,

521
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,200
but not for the reason
that snow would have.

522
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,440
He wasn't worried that Bavarians would
drink infected water or eat contaminated

523
00:41:00,881 --> 00:41:01,714
food.

524
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:07,170
He was afraid that the fecal matter would
get beneath the city and would nourish

525
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:13,051
the Vibrio and thereby give rise to
poisonous fumes that would poison the

526
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,374
people.

527
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,980
Soon as idea was to make the soil
of Germany cities in fertile,

528
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,240
so buy a new could do that by depriving
the soil of organic matter and

529
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:27,214
excrement.

530
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:33,210
So he wanted to supply Germany with
clean water but not specifically clean

531
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:35,870
drinking water,

532
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,260
but he wanted to prevent sewage from
gaining access to the groundwater and the

533
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:42,950
soil beneath the city.

534
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,580
He also championed the idea of sand
filtration of water to ensure clean water.

535
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,560
He thought that snow had
been seriously misled.

536
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,170
There was a matter of proportion here.

537
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,230
Snow he said was really concentrated on
the few leaders that a person consumed

538
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,991
that water.

539
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:10,760
He argued no matter how contaminated
would actually do no harm.

540
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
The real issue was the massive
quantity of water of domestic,

541
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:21,250
industrial or household waste that
carried fertilizer to the city soil and

542
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:25,970
they're bred disease now.

543
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:30,971
Petten coffer recognize then the clean
water and effective sewage and waste

544
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:31,904
disposal.

545
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,940
We're a central public health measures
so we had as his legacy Petten coffer was

546
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:41,420
the founder of the sanitary
movement in Germany.

547
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,490
He was also professor of hygiene
at the University of Munich.

548
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,150
He founded a journal called the archive
for hygiene in 1893 and indeed it's

549
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:58,291
still published as the international
journal of Hygiene and environmental

550
00:42:58,521 --> 00:42:59,354
health.

551
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:05,410
He was the founder of the Mocks Fun
Petten Coffer Institute in Munich or world

552
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:10,520
famous research institute dedicated
to the promotion of public health.

553
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:16,220
He became its director and trained people.

554
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:20,210
It became a center of research
and training unique at its time.

555
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:25,710
It was an important figure and the
founding of the Johns Hopkins School of

556
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,630
Public Health and along
with his opponent John Snow,

557
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:34,750
he was a founding father in the field
of epidemiology is arguments though now

558
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,850
largely discredited.
We're supported by prodigious field work.

559
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:46,030
You could imagine him going around Europe
taking core samples of soil and rock

560
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:52,780
and correlating that with measuring
measurements of the rise and fall of

561
00:43:52,851 --> 00:43:57,851
groundwater levels and correlating
all of that information with rainfall,

562
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,940
temperature measurements and the
history of cholera outbreaks.

563
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,020
And Preston coffer was tireless in
propagating as ideas as a lecturer,

564
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,410
as writer.

565
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,500
He was an advisor to the Bavarian
government and he became president of the

566
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,973
Bavarian Academy of Science.

567
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,220
Another factor was not patent coffer was
quite interested in something else as

568
00:44:25,101 --> 00:44:25,970
well.

569
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:31,180
What made people susceptible and he
believed that poor nutrition was important

570
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:32,820
factor in that.

571
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:38,180
So as public health policies also
involved attention to diet and nutrition.

572
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,380
Of course some of his
recommendations were misguided,

573
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:49,490
but one measure he gave great attention
to was also the siting of infectious

574
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:52,320
disease hospitals in cemeteries.

575
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,420
A collar or a hospital or a cemetery
should be located on a hilltop,

576
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:02,690
far from the city center and down wind
of it that would prevent the cholera,

577
00:45:03,591 --> 00:45:08,591
a germ from percolating down easily
into the soil beneath the city and would

578
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:13,020
ensure that any poisonous
miasma that arose,

579
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,290
we'd be dispersed from the population.

580
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,710
So we can see that he helped the way
condition the way Naples for example was

581
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:27,921
rebuilt and where the infectious diseases
hospital in not city was located,

582
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,640
which was high above the
city and downwind from him.

583
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:38,390
And as I said to prove his theory he
tried is dangerous auto experiment.

584
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,021
Uh,

585
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:45,021
his theory was losing ground by 1892 when
there was a major epidemic of cholera

586
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:52,250
at Hom Borg and Germany and patent coffer
and Robert call were greatly at odds

587
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,170
to prove his case.

588
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,320
Patent coffer challenged caulk to provide
him with a collar or a cocktail that

589
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:05,571
he volunteered to swallow Cox collaborator
golf key duly dispatched a file

590
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,830
filled with vibrios.

591
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:16,820
There's some interesting ethical issues
here as coffee scent patent coffer,

592
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,310
what he thought was a fatal
dose of cholera and fully
expected patent coffer to

593
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,430
die an agonizing death there.

594
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,480
Then various accounts of what happened
next one account has it that patent

595
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,740
coffers lab assistants intercepted
the package and diluted the dose.

596
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:44,030
It's also true that the collar or cocktail
was sent in February and it may well

597
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:49,551
be that the cold temperature in transit
attenuated the variance of the vibrios.

598
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:55,710
In any case, Petten coffer was
a man convinced if his theory,

599
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:01,190
he put his life on the line to prove it
and he'd Uli swallowed the file that Cox

600
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:06,780
lab had provided he felt seriously ill,
have diarrhea,

601
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:11,670
but didn't develop the symptoms
he recognized as Asiatic Colorado.

602
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:17,370
He rapidly recovered and was convinced
that he proved that the Vibrio cholera

603
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:22,440
does not directly cause the
disease not by being ingested.

604
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:23,731
Well,

605
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:28,731
there wasn't unhappy sequel for patent
coffer caulks microbiology by the 1890s

606
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,720
convinced the medical world of the germ
theory and miasmatic doctrine of all

607
00:47:37,061 --> 00:47:37,750
kinds,

608
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:42,750
including patent coffers
own were discredited in 1894
he resigned his university

609
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:49,501
chair in 1899 he resigned from his other
offices and the 1890s also three of his

610
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:58,171
five children died and his
wife and in February 9th,

611
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,620
1901 patent coffer committed suicide.
Well,

612
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:07,621
there's a final aspect I'd like to raise
in my last minute and that is to say

613
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:14,310
the defeat of anti contagion isn't may
have had some negative legacies that it

614
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,170
took time to recognize.

615
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:22,950
One of the strengths of patent coffers
ideas was the stress they put on what we

616
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:26,260
would now call the environmental,

617
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,320
social and economic determinants
of disease for a time.

618
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,200
The germ theory of disease relegated those
aspects of medicine to the background

619
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,320
leading to a narrow gauge stress on
microbes and the attempt to find magic

620
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:45,370
bullets to destroy them.

621
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:49,450
So Patton coffer then
was ultimately wrong,

622
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:53,440
but I would argue that his
ideas were magnificently wrong.

623
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:59,110
They contained important elements of
truth and important and vital measures for

624
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:02,410
public health and for medicine.

625
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:08,250
Next time we'll take the high road and
move on to the victors in this debate,

626
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,760
uh,

627
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,760
pastor call LR and the successful
proof of the truth of contagion,

628
00:49:15,811 --> 00:49:18,130
aneurysm,
and the germ theory of disease.

629
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,340
But I thought you needed a
moment with mocks Vaughn.
