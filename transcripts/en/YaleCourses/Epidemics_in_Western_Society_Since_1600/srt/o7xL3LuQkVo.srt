1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,960
Well,
our topic this morning is influenza a,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,340
which is timely for today,

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,190
and I'd like to begin by talking about
influence of virus more in general,

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,710
and we'll concentrate our
attention for obvious reasons.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,960
On the gray,
the Spanish lady,

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,020
the great influenza of 1918
1919 no influence of virus
was isolated in the 1930s

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,210
by Andrews Wilson and Lud Law and the
mechanisms of the disease where then

8
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:43,710
unraveled. Subsequently. As you
know, there are three types,

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,680
a, B, and c, and it's a virus.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,250
That's the cause of
pandemics among human beings.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,420
I was terms of the structure of the virus.

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,490
As you know,

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,700
it's RNA wrapped in a protein envelope
with protein spikes on the surface.

14
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,120
You can see them.
Um,

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,600
and the spikes are of two major types,

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,490
Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
The hemagglutinin enables the virus to
attach itself to a host cell in this

18
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,630
case,
in the respiratory tract,

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,290
and it's neuraminidase that enables the
fusion of the virus with cells so that

20
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:40,201
the viral RNA can be released into the
cell cytoplasm and then migrate to the

21
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:43,590
cell nucleus.

22
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,490
The human gluten and in your amended
days have various strains that have been

23
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:53,730
numbered and you have on your handout,
um,

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,820
those that have been
identified for the 19th,

25
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:01,821
20th and 21st century and everyone
knows now a h one n one the swine virus

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,900
that's currently with us and I'm sorry
on the handout that I've got 2010,

27
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,260
I might to have 2009 to 2011.

28
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,040
So if you could make that correction,
that would make me feel happy. Uh,

29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,060
the viral RNA then hijacks the cell and
transforms it into a viral factory for

30
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:32,511
the reproduction of virus and it
eventually destroys the cell itself.

31
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,220
This process of reproductions,

32
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,260
extraordinarily efficient
and nearly instantaneous so
that the idea of measuring

33
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:47,760
generations of viruses
begins to lose all meaning.

34
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,160
We also need to point out about,
uh,

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,190
influence influenza virus that the RNA
combines in all sorts of ways making a

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,960
genetic characteristic
of extreme instability or
should we say mutability the

37
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:11,671
processes involved that you can study
up on science hill and more detail

38
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,150
involved things called Antigen drift,

39
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,300
antigen shift,
mutation,

40
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,310
hybridization giving rise to subtypes,
strains,

41
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,600
and variants.

42
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,260
All of these changes are part of the
success story of influenza as a disease,

43
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,790
and there is no crossover immunity from
one strain to another acquired immunity.

44
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:45,880
That is his strength specific.
Well,

45
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:50,881
mutability also explains an
epidemiological feature of influenza,

46
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,510
and that is that pandemics
tend to arrive in waves,

47
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,120
each being biologically different
with different symptoms and different

48
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,300
virulence.

49
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,570
And we'll see that the great pandemic
after World War One had four major waves.

50
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,893
Well,

51
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,900
influenza tends to have be reflective of
the relationships also of human beings

52
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:28,000
and animals, birds, horses
and pigs and not theirs.

53
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,060
Interspecies transfer from
animals to humans and from humans.

54
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,290
And the reverse direction,

55
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,870
and this may be the route by which human
beings first contracted the disease,

56
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,930
and it's known that this,

57
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:47,800
the animal reservoir is
a source of new strains.

58
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,390
The hypothesis recently has been
that there's a reservoir in Asia,

59
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:58,240
perhaps in China or Asiatic Russia,

60
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,860
but interestingly,

61
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,720
it's not very hypothesis that
misled public health responses.

62
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,900
When the swine flu pandemic first got
underway and that surveillance was active

63
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,430
in the far east,

64
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,240
but the disease arrived
in stead in Mexico.

65
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:21,790
Well, what's the history of
human beings and influencer?

66
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,760
The origins simply aren't known.

67
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,810
The earliest clear evidence in of a
literary kind is in the 15th and 16th

68
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:37,060
centuries, but records are
fragmentary and unreliable.

69
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,340
So the best we can do is to
look at the last few centuries,

70
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,640
the 18th 19th 20th and the
first years of our own century.

71
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,960
In the 18th century,
there were major pandemics,

72
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,230
1729 to 30 32 to 33 61 to 62 and then
especially 1781 to 1782 and then 1788 to

73
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:11,561
1789 and the 19th century
there were pandemics.

74
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,780
1830 to 31 33 50 to 51 and then the
great pandemic of 1889 to 1819 and in the

75
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:26,150
20th century we've had
a number of pandemics,

76
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:31,270
the greatest sping 1918 to 20
the Spanish flu as it was called.

77
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:32,751
Now,

78
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:37,751
the reason I was reading out the rather
grim years of influenza pandemics was to

79
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:41,420
point out first,
of course,

80
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:45,890
that they're recurrent and
are still with us as you know.

81
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,340
But also to note that there seem to be
something of a powder and of more or less

82
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,690
one major pandemic and every century,
well,

83
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,720
influenza is a viral infection
transmitted person to person and airborne

84
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,520
disease,

85
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,760
much more contagious than say SARS that
we remember from just a few years ago.

86
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,260
SARS requires prolonged face to
face contact but not influenza.

87
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,100
So a notable feature then of the
flu is it's rapid communicability.

88
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,980
It also has a short incubation period,

89
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,010
just 24 to 72 hours.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So all of that implies also
that epidemiologically it's
different from a number

91
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,900
of the infectious diseases we've studied.

92
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,830
As I said in the email that I
sent to you about social diseases,

93
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,950
it's really a spectrum,

94
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:56,750
not an absolute when we talk about
being a social disease or not.

95
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,960
And I would submit to you that influenza
is out the far end of that spectrum in

96
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:07,490
not really being a classic social disease.

97
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,900
It's not very sensitive
to economic conditions,

98
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,480
sanitation and diet.

99
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,970
Those features that were hallmarks
of malaria say or tuberculosis.

100
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,720
It's diffusion occurs wherever human
beings move in numbers and breathe.

101
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,030
It follows networks of
communication where roads,

102
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,430
steam ships,

103
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,560
airplanes in our time and ports
and railroad hub cities or uh,

104
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,280
eh.

105
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Now we would say airport centers tend
to be photo sigh of infection and we're

106
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,920
first attacked with lightening speed.

107
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,280
So flu was favored by the transportation
technology of the industrial revolution

108
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:03,711
and since and once again by urbanization
and of course population growth and

109
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:05,730
overcrowding.

110
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Let's look at a precursor to the
great pandemic of the first World War.

111
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,800
And this is the horrible pandemic of
the 19th century of eight nine 1889 to

112
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:21,810
1890.

113
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,470
This was the first truly global pandemic
of influenza and the most devastating

114
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:34,080
one in history until that time
it affected every continent.

115
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,310
The reasons without the world was
prepared now for pandemic influenza as a

116
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:46,440
result of the transportation revolution,
the railroad on the steamship,

117
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,230
urbanization and trade,

118
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
demographic growth and colonialism,

119
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,640
vulnerability to influence or then
seems to be in part a byproduct of

120
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:04,731
modernization as we've been reminded by
recent events studies of 1889 to 1890

121
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,290
demonstrate this in more
detail in cities like Moscow,

122
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,490
Paris,
or London.

123
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:23,210
The first case is occurred in October
to November of 1889 and these tended not

124
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:25,671
to be noticed.

125
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:30,671
There was nothing particular about
them that people noted at the time,

126
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,670
but they occurred among very particular
sectors of the population that we're

127
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,130
most involved in trade commerce
and the nodes of communication.

128
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,920
That is the first people to fall ill
tend to to be dockers or post office

129
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,680
workers, railway men, policemen.

130
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,080
Furthermore,
the lesson dust realize the locality,

131
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,630
the more remote and agricultural,

132
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:03,630
it was the later,

133
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,690
unless severely the locality suffered
in 1889 to 1890 the Alps in Europe,

134
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,040
Italy,
Spain,

135
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:19,041
and Portugal all lagged behind
northern Europe and the United States.

136
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,130
And even in the great urban centers there
were isolated small communities that

137
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:29,670
sometimes survive entirely unscathed.

138
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,420
Monasteries and convents for example,

139
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,540
in both Moscow and Paris went experienced
the pandemic without victims in some

140
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:41,544
cases,

141
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,550
and this was sometimes true also of
closed institutions like prisons.

142
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:53,250
Then typically after following
the transportation network,

143
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:58,410
and this was true of 1889 to 90 the flu
spread along what's called the urban

144
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:01,960
hierarchy.
That is,

145
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,080
it went first to major cities and from
there into the hinterland of those cities

146
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,590
and only later to smaller towns,

147
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,050
villages and rural areas,

148
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,950
and 1918 to 19 in the United States shows
this same pattern that is the flu went

149
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:27,751
almost instantaneously from
Boston and New York to Cincinnati,

150
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:32,710
Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit,
San Francisco, Seattle,

151
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,430
and then at greater leisure.

152
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,030
It moved into almost every
place in between until there
was hardly a settlement

153
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,420
of any size that had been entirely spared.

154
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,800
And whenever it went rich and poor,

155
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,180
educated and illiterate men and women,

156
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,650
the physically fit and the
unfit were similarly infected,

157
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,740
but there were circumstances,

158
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,300
certain ones that were especially
favorable to the disease.

159
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,560
A crowded urban environment was clearly
one where people were streaming in and

160
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:21,001
out and closely packed Emilio's schools,

161
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:26,020
theaters, barracks, naval
ships, tenement buildings,

162
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,060
college dormitories,

163
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,530
and all the epidemics of influenza
except 1918 to 20 there was also a strong

164
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:41,101
predilection of the influenza virus
for the infants and the elderly.

165
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,230
They're also tended to be an over
representation of people with preexisting

166
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:52,210
respiratory diseases,

167
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,720
say tuberculosis or bronchitis or
people with immunosuppressive diseases.

168
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,780
The great example until the
HIV AIDS era was of course,

169
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:09,781
malaria and malarial victims were
highly susceptible to influenza,

170
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,950
so the tuberculosis and the malarial died
massively during influenza pandemics.

171
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,150
A typical graph then of the influenza,

172
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,480
more tality would show a neat u shaped
curve spiked at both ends of the age

173
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:37,900
spectrum of the population,
the very young and the elderly.

174
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,550
Another common feature of
influenza pandemics was
pronounced seasonality in the

175
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,040
northern hemisphere.

176
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Influenza almost invariably
peaked in the winter months,

177
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,570
November to February, and ended with the
coming of warm weather in the spring.

178
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,890
The reasons for good epidemiological,
uh,

179
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,880
explanations have to do
partly with human behavior.

180
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,330
People tend to congregate
indoors in the winter,

181
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,590
often in buildings and rooms
that are poorly ventilated.

182
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,760
The virus itself doesn't survive well
in an environment where there's sunlight

183
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,130
and high humidity and winter's a time
when people tend to sneeze and cough more

184
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,520
than at other times.

185
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,400
What are some other features of flu
pandemics? One is short duration.

186
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,270
This helps to understand
societal responses as well.

187
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,330
We know that plague and collar attended
to lay siege to a locality for months

188
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,470
and in the community it
felt quite like that,

189
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:57,130
but flu tended to last just a
few weeks and then to move on.

190
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,240
It was true also that there was a high
morbidity that is lots of people would

191
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:06,500
fall ill from influenza,

192
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,590
but there was a low case fatality rate.

193
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,940
The overall mortality would be large
simply because of the large numbers of

194
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:17,030
sufferers.

195
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,890
The kill rate was low in the 19th century.

196
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,850
Influenza,
however,

197
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,940
killed far more people than
cholera and a stark contrast then,

198
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,730
um,
could be drawn.

199
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,590
Flew seems to be quintessentially
a contagious disease.

200
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,660
But since you're interested in the debate
between, this is one of your favorites,

201
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:49,580
I'm sure, uh, between anti contagion
aneurysm and contagion aneurysm,

202
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,640
we might point out to you that even,

203
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,730
although you think it seems to be
self evident that influenza the grip,

204
00:16:57,771 --> 00:17:01,940
the flu is contagious,
that many of the,

205
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
in fact the dominant current still
and the 1890s was not influenza,

206
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,310
was not contagious.
And the eminent British epidemiologists,

207
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,460
Charles Creighton still held to anti
contagion ism regarding this disease down

208
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:23,990
into the 1890s well,
what sorts of things, uh,

209
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,350
held Creighton back from accepting
influenza as an infectious disease?

210
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,311
Well,

211
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:36,311
first he argued the disease would affect
the most parts of a country in the same

212
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:38,990
two or three weeks.

213
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,080
There simply wasn't time for a contagious
disease to a spread without extreme

214
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:46,941
rapidity.

215
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:51,930
He thought he also thought
within a smaller radius,

216
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,890
it seemed to affect everyone
Santa household more or less,

217
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:59,580
I'm Matine Asley everyone
would fall ill at once.

218
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So it seemed there wasn't
time for contagion and it
was this simultaneous sudden

219
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,910
outbreak of influence that gave
it some of its traditional names.

220
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,650
It was called the grip,
not only in French log go deep,

221
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,690
but also in English and the 19th century.
It was referred to as grip.

222
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:26,670
And partly that's because it seems
suddenly to sees people in its grasp.

223
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,660
Typically,
you could be healthy at breakfast,

224
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,830
only defined yourself
suffering with chills, fever,

225
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
aching bones and nausea by lunchtime.

226
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Similarly bought Moscow seem to physicians
to be healthy on the 1st of November,

227
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,750
1889 but by the middle of the
month the disease was everywhere.

228
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,120
Shops and schools were closed,

229
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,140
commerce nearly ground
to a halt and this gave,

230
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:03,141
it was part of the reason it
got its other name influenza.

231
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,090
Um,
this was an Italian word,

232
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,120
meaning influence and in this case people
speculated about the influence of some

233
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:18,141
cosmic factor that would
disturb the microcosm as well.

234
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,270
Perhaps it was the influence of the
stars or the heavens that poisoned or

235
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:28,461
corrupted the atmosphere and lay
low whole cities all at once.

236
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,310
Well, what about symptoms
effects on the individual?

237
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,610
I think we can be brief
because it's probably very
familiar to you from personal

238
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:45,750
experience.
That is seasonal influenza.

239
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,100
The onset is we've said
is normally sudden.

240
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,100
The symptoms then are ones that you know,
a high fever,

241
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,090
a hundred to 104 degrees Fahrenheit,

242
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,630
typically an unproductive cough,

243
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,100
aching of muscles in the back,
the legs,

244
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,860
watery eyes,
sometimes nausea and vomiting,

245
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,840
general malaise, headache,
pain in the joints,

246
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,140
sometimes dizziness and a general
sense of fatigue and weakness.

247
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,730
Typically the acute phase would last
three to five days and for a few days more

248
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,500
you'd suffer from your
cough and from lethargy.

249
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,300
And then in the vast number of
cases there would be recovery.

250
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,950
Well flew for young adults in good health,

251
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,670
enjoyed a reputation as a nasty but
mercifully short and usually not serious

252
00:20:55,901 --> 00:21:00,160
affliction, influenza. And the night,

253
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,190
middle of the 19th century that is at
least before the cataclysm of 1889 and

254
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:11,050
1890 was people joked about it,

255
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,380
that it was a disease that
was so unimportant that the
only physicians who gave

256
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:22,810
it much attention were those
who simply had too few patients.

257
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:28,350
And so started treating people with flu
as a means of enhancing their income.

258
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,680
On the other hand,
for infants,

259
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,890
for the elderly and those with chronic
disease at some sometimes lead to serious

260
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,610
and even fatal complications.

261
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,600
And it was the complications much more
than the flu that tended to kill patients

262
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:54,460
who didn't recover after
three or four days,

263
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,630
then moved on to serious complications
like pneumonia or bronchitis and about

264
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,660
once a century,

265
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,440
a strain of influenza
that was not seasonal,

266
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,390
but pandemic appeared.

267
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,320
And demonstrated that flu can in fact
under certain conditions be one of the

268
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:19,870
most deadly of all diseases.

269
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,640
When the what about treatment?
Well,

270
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:26,740
today as in the past,

271
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:32,250
there's no specific remedy for influenza
as we've been reminded by recent events

272
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,290
in the newspapers,

273
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:41,130
the disease is self limiting
normally and simply runs its course,

274
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,640
so therapy is supportive and symptomatic
rest and nursing care more than active

275
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:55,120
medical intervention and the 19th century.

276
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,150
This was also recognized and physicians
weren't inclined to try heroic remedies

277
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,930
as they did say with Asiatic cholera,

278
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:10,140
but there were certain attempts at
therapeutics in the 19th century and even

279
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:16,630
after World War One,
people were given aspirin,

280
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,590
cinnamon with milk to
lower temperature fluids,

281
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,720
a nourishment bedrest,

282
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,590
quinine was administered
to lower the fever.

283
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,040
There were worn Babs for hydrotherapy.

284
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,730
Oxygen sometimes administered to patients
with respiratory complications and

285
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,810
some physicians recommended caffeine to
raise the flagging animal energy as it

286
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,370
was called.
Today,

287
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,330
the only actual
therapeutics is antibiotics,

288
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,420
but they don't come back
the influence itself,

289
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,270
but it's complication of pneumonia.

290
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,940
Well against that background.

291
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,440
Let's look more closely
at the Spanish influenza,

292
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,150
the Spanish lady,

293
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,180
the Spanish grip as it was called from
1918 to 1920 oh first you probably wonder

294
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,460
why the Spanish Association and the reason
has actually nothing to do with Spain

295
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:26,120
itself and disease.

296
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,300
It was simply that Spain was not a
belligerent and the first world war and

297
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:34,700
therefore was free of
censorship of the media.

298
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:40,390
Hence a free press reported the
medical crisis there extensively.

299
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,110
A popular theory in circulation these
days is that perhaps the Spanish lady

300
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,260
originated not in Spain at all,
but in Kansas.

301
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,450
In any event,
on the morning of finding the case,

302
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,270
zero is a perilous art,

303
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,480
but let's say that at least this much
as known on the morning of the 11th of

304
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,240
March,

305
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,240
1918 at Fort Riley the Cook Albert
Getchell reported sick by nearing noon.

306
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,960
The camp in from Marie had some 100
cases and these were the earliest known

307
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:28,070
examples of this new influenza.

308
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:34,180
There's some background that helps us
comprehend the extraordinary case of 1918

309
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,200
to 1920 as in the past mutations occurred
and then this time produced a new

310
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:49,601
strain that turned out to me more
virulent than any in influences history.

311
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,680
It's mode of communication was
identical to other flu pandemics,

312
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,800
but its effects on both the individual
and society were radically different.

313
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,360
So let's talk about this
pandemic as coming in for waves.

314
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,440
The first was in the spring of 1918 and
was relatively mild in March and April.

315
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,000
It soon passed under an
attracted little attention.

316
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,650
Wartime press.
Censorship was partly a factor,

317
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,490
but people were simply
preoccupied with the war, uh,

318
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:36,491
not with the presence of a mild outbreak
of a well known and common disease.

319
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,180
The second wave was the of 1918
which was the worldwide disaster.

320
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,010
It began in August with
simultaneous explosions in
places as far apart as Sierra

321
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,120
Leon, Boston and this
country, breast and France.

322
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:08,450
A common feature being that these were
all port cities and had an important role

323
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,640
in the movements of troops and supplies.
In this case,

324
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,030
one could argue that
not only the war itself,

325
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,150
but also the coming of peace contributed
to the spread of the flu armistice day

326
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:28,830
itself produce huge crowds and gatherings,
uh,

327
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,860
which were not propitious for
stopping the spread of the disease.

328
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,220
Then came the spring of 1919, uh, less,

329
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:45,480
much less mercifully less severe wave.

330
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,090
And then finally,
January,

331
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:53,010
February of 1920 the fourth
wave of this Spanish lady,

332
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:58,310
which was mild and limited and it's
morbidity even partly of course,

333
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,300
because by then so many people were
already immune where there are a number of

334
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:09,990
features of this Spanish
lady that made her unique.

335
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,080
The first was not possessed,

336
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,680
an extraordinary mortality and morbidity.

337
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,840
Comparing it with normal
outbreaks of influenza.

338
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,040
It's impossible to generate
precise statistics,

339
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,850
but there are speculations that
this was perhaps in absolute terms,

340
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,850
the greatest demographic shock that
humanity had ever experienced from

341
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,570
infectious diseases.

342
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,500
The more people died of influenza than
of casualties in the first world war

343
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,050
worldwide. Some estimates,
the estimates vary widely,

344
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,230
so one has to take them
with great caution,

345
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,980
but they range from 25 million people
perishing upwards to the highest estimates

346
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,790
or about 100 million in the United States.

347
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's pretty well known that at least
675,000 people perished more than American

348
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:20,190
casualties and all 20th century wars,

349
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:25,370
10 times the numbers killed in
first world war and a normal,

350
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,940
if there is such a thing,
influenza outbreak,

351
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,200
a case fatality rate might be something
like oh 0.1% in the case of the Spanish

352
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:39,090
influenza,

353
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:44,510
the case fatality rate was just above
2.5% and this yielded a vast total bull

354
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:52,150
mortality because indeed
as it seemed at the time,

355
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,400
almost everyone was infected.

356
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,400
Let's look at a slide of the death rates.

357
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:04,180
You can see the influenza,
the great wave,

358
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:06,430
and October,
November,

359
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,410
December of 1918 the black is 1918,

360
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,490
uh, rather, sorry, a 1911 as the average,

361
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,530
1911 to 1917 and the gray is 1918.

362
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:22,190
So this compares,
uh,

363
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:27,040
influenza then with what we
might call normal influenza.

364
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,400
You can see the
extraordinary near mortality.

365
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,810
Another feature of this influenza was
the lack of understanding of the disease

366
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,810
when it broke out.
Indeed.

367
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,870
I'd like to quote Viktor
Vaughn who directed public
health in the United States

368
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:51,010
army against the Spanish lady and he said,

369
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:53,980
and I'm quoting doctors,
no,

370
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:57,250
no more about the flu.

371
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:02,910
Then 14th century Florentines did
about the black death and I think it's

372
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:09,211
important to understand this idea of a
sense of helplessness facing this medical

373
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:12,070
catastrophe.

374
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Some physicians indeed in 1918
termed what they were facing,

375
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:23,550
epidemic pneumonia and then as now
there was no effective treatment.

376
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,120
The symptoms were distinctive.

377
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,000
As you now know from reading Cosby,

378
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,840
this influenza was fulminant
and post Wharton mortem.

379
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,210
Long examinations

380
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:46,770
revealed things that were unlike anything
that examining physicians had seen

381
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:48,580
before.

382
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,780
Enormous quantities of bloody fluid,

383
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,750
like a froth filling the lungs.

384
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Some physicians on their first encounter
suspected that this was a kind of

385
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:03,100
pneumonic plague

386
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,660
right here in new haven and the new
haven hospital pathologists wrote the

387
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:15,091
devastation caused to the lungs more than
anything else resembled the effects of

388
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:21,781
poisonous gases used in world war
one like phosgene or chlorine,

389
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,030
whether comparisons that came
to their mind. Furthermore,

390
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,060
although other organs of the body
could be effected the spleen,

391
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,360
for example,

392
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,750
the impact of the Spanish lady on the
lungs was so overwhelming that not alone

393
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:46,400
was often the cause of
death and pulmonary effects.

394
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:49,760
We're almost the only
ones that people noticed.

395
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Let me read a passage from
Katherine Anne Porter,

396
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,080
the famous writer, Pale Horse, Pale rider,

397
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:00,800
um,

398
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,800
where she was herself a
victim of the influencer.

399
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,180
And she writes here in the third person,

400
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:16,270
but she's describing her own symptoms and
I think it's worth noting how she felt

401
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,320
silenced.

402
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:23,410
Miranda's sank easily through deep sip
on deeps of darkness until she lay like a

403
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:30,491
stone at the farthest bottom of
life knowing herself to be blind,

404
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,650
deaf,
speechless.

405
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,590
No longer aware of the
members of her own body,

406
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,920
entirely withdrawn from
all human concerns,

407
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,300
yet alive with the peculiar
lucidity and coherence,

408
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,950
all notions of the mind,
the reasonable inquiries of doubt,

409
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:54,100
all ties of blood and desires of the
heart dissolved and fell away from her and

410
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,020
there remained only a minute,

411
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,140
fiercely burning particle of being
that new itself alone that relied upon

412
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:05,690
nothing beyond itself for its strength,

413
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,230
not susceptible to any
appeal or inducement being
itself composed entirely of

414
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:14,150
one single motive.

415
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:18,380
The stubborn will to live this fiery,

416
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,440
motionless particle set itself
unaided to resist destruction,

417
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,780
to survive and to be in its own madness
of being motiveless and plan lists.

418
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,210
Beyond that one essential end,

419
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,940
she felt without warning a
vague tremor of apprehension,

420
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,900
some small flick of distrust and her joy,

421
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:47,000
a thin frost touch the edges
of this confident tranquility.

422
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,720
Something somebody was missing,
she'd lost something she had left,

423
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:54,710
something valuable than another country.
What could it be?

424
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,550
There are no trees, no trees
here. She said in fright,

425
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,470
I've left something unfinished.

426
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,420
A thought struggled at the back of her
mind came clearly as a voice in your ear

427
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,370
where the dead, we've forgotten the
dead, the dead. Where are they at?

428
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:14,480
Once as if a curtain had fallen,
the bright landscape faded.

429
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,040
She was alone in a strange
stony place of bitter cold,

430
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,480
picking her way along the
steep path of slippery snow.

431
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,710
Calling out, oh, I must go
back, but in what direction?

432
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,980
Pain returned.
A terrible,

433
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:34,940
compelling pain running through
our veins like heavy fire,

434
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,910
the stench of corruption
filled her nostrils,

435
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,920
the Swedish sickening smell
of rotting flesh and pos.

436
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,310
She opened her eyes and saw
appeal light through course,

437
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:53,330
white cloth over her face and she knew
that the smell of death was in her own

438
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:57,960
body and she struggled to lift her hand.

439
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,040
There are also pictures of um,

440
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:07,190
this is a famous painting of Ed Voir monk
after the influence in 1919 or this is

441
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:12,600
also in fact,

442
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:16,740
this is called after
the flu painted in 1919.

443
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
A doctor wrote that his patients died
struggling to clear their airways of a

444
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:29,841
blood tinge froth that gushed
from their noses and mouths.

445
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,410
The fluid then filled the respiratory
system from the trachea to the tiniest Avo

446
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:42,000
lay and bronchioles and it
post mortem examination.

447
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,450
The lungs were greatly acts distended
and when pressed even lightly oozed with

448
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:52,050
blood tinge,
fluid and yellow pus.

449
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,100
The walls of the Avo lie collapsed under
the pressure leaving the formless mass

450
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,760
where neither blood nor air could flow
freely and the patient died of his fix

451
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:09,060
sia or the blockage of
pulmonary circulation.

452
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:14,150
Let me show you two pictures of the
lungs of a young woman who died of the

453
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:19,140
Spanish lady at the new haven hospital.
Um,

454
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,200
and I think you can see the enormous
and terrifying destruction of the lungs

455
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,280
that occurred.
Well in addition,

456
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,660
there were important sequoia.

457
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:38,210
One feature of this Spanish lady was the
distinctive length of convalescence and

458
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:43,330
also there were neurological aftereffects,

459
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,510
protracted depression.

460
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,260
And there is speculation that throughout
the 1920s there was an outbreak of

461
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,170
neurological afflictions that Oliver
Sacks deals with and his famous book

462
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,740
awakenings.

463
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,920
There's some dispute about whether this
was an authentic amongst the authentic

464
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,910
Kweli of the Spanish influenza,
but it is at least plausible.

465
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Another feature that made this pandemic
distinctive was the age profile of the

466
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:16,764
victims.

467
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:22,140
We've seen how normally an
influenza Thursday u shaped curve,

468
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,320
it does what seems normal to people
attacking the very young and the elderly.

469
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,680
The Spanish lady instead had a preference
for adults and the 20 to 40 age group

470
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,000
and so it produced something
that seemed highly unnatural,

471
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,180
a w shaped curve with a spike in the
middle afflicting the people in the prime

472
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:47,434
of life.

473
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,070
Viktor Vaughn again observed that the
Spanish flu imitated the war itself and

474
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:59,140
then it killed young adults like war.

475
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:02,860
He said this infection kills young,
vigorous,

476
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,750
robust adults.

477
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,260
The reasons are still mysterious,

478
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,740
but one could point to a
couple of partial factors.

479
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:17,070
Perhaps the elderly had some immunity
leftover from the great pandemic of 1889

480
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:22,840
to 19 and it was the young of course,

481
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:27,841
epidemiologically who most
directly experienced the
war and military service and

482
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:32,050
close crowded conditions,

483
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,410
just the young population most at risk.

484
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,400
And for those of you who think that
working out at the gym protects you from

485
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:43,960
influenza pandemics,

486
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:49,050
I would point out that the physically
fit also fell ill in comparable numbers.

487
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,210
John Hellem,
the u s pentathlon champion,

488
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,480
that is someone who did the broad jump
discuss Java Olin 200 meters and 1500

489
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:06,541
meters died in October of 1918 of the
flu as did Jackie O'shaughnessy who was

490
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:12,370
the u s national quarter mile champion.

491
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,670
So physical fitness had nothing to
do with survival from the influencer.

492
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,860
Let me show you a graph.

493
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,460
This is the notorious u shape curve of
the influenza and you see the two curves

494
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:29,284
together.

495
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:34,290
The dotted line is normal influencer and
this solid line with the terrible w in

496
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:41,740
the middle is the more
comedy from the Spanish lady.

497
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,050
Well meanwhile,

498
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,080
what happened with public health and
here a major feature is to point out,

499
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:56,430
and we should think of this in terms of
lessons for preparedness today was the

500
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:01,180
way that the public health
service was overwhelmed.

501
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:07,310
It was overwhelmed and part because of
the extreme rapidity with which this

502
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:12,490
disease through it's airborne
transmission was spread

503
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,080
by the speed of transportation and the
short incubation period of the disease

504
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,960
too is also true that
there is a percentage,

505
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:31,110
perhaps 10% in the Spanish lady of
people who are asymptomatic carriers.

506
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,460
Influenza also was not
a reportable disease.

507
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,380
It was maximized also because of the
unavoidable and uncontrollable movement of

508
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:49,040
troops because of the war.

509
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:55,030
But in addition there was a lock and we
might think about this of preparation

510
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,830
for just such an emergency,
a shortage of doctors,

511
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,940
nurses,

512
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:06,530
hospital beds and space
one hospital wards.

513
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,930
Influenza also has the terrible feature,

514
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,290
unlike cholera for example,

515
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,620
that it creates chaos within the
health system itself by striking down

516
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,670
caregivers who are among
those who are most vulnerable.

517
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:32,050
And then there was the war itself in
which doctors and nurses were mobilized to

518
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:35,480
deal with the victims of the conflict.

519
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,780
So there were a drastic shortages of
healthcare personnel available to the

520
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:45,200
civilian population.
Roofer glue,

521
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,410
whom you will remember from the Barbary
Plagge who was the director of public

522
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,150
health services during the crisis.

523
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,420
And he was forced to lure doctors and
nurses out of retirement to help deal with

524
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:04,730
the emergency,
to recruit even from old age homes.

525
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,020
Well,

526
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,850
what were the measures adopted
to deal with the crisis?

527
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:17,350
Antiflu measures by this time were
based on the premise that this was a

528
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:22,571
contagious disease and the understanding
that influenza was spread somehow

529
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,063
through the air.

530
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,130
So our first major goal was to prevent
those who are healthy from inhaling the

531
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:35,870
contaminated air of the infected.
So in that,

532
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,400
and to that end,

533
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,700
public gatherings and assemblies of
large numbers of people at close quarters

534
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,410
were banned.
Public institutions were closed,

535
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:52,340
schools, dance halls,
movie theaters, bars,

536
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:57,110
churches in this country
were allowed to remain open,

537
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,740
but the number of services
was greatly reduced.

538
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,140
And many cities,

539
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,260
people seen by the police to be coughing
and sneezing without covering their

540
00:44:08,601 --> 00:44:11,180
faces were stopped and find.

541
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:17,410
The New York City Department of Health
posted some 10,000 plaque cards around

542
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:22,940
the city bearing a message that was
familiar to the public because of its

543
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:27,941
similarity to the urgings of the
campaign against tuberculosis.

544
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:33,550
So one can see the anti-tuberculosis
campaign preparing people in a sense for

545
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:37,920
dealing with influenza
and in New York City,

546
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:42,660
the placards said to prevent
the spread of Spanish influenza,

547
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,780
sniff costs or expect to
rate if you absolutely must
into your own handkerchief.

548
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,200
You're no, no danger if everyone
should heed this warning.

549
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:01,430
Another widespread measure was
a of practical application.

550
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:07,251
Also one was masking with gauze masks
and some municipalities require their

551
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:13,230
whole populations to put on masks.

552
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,560
San Francisco did so and so did San Diego.

553
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,380
Another was disinfection practices
applied in hospital wards,

554
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:24,510
sick rooms and ambulances.

555
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,890
Trains too were washed down
with antiseptic solutions.

556
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:34,100
You can see a picture
of the properly mass,

557
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,540
uh, police, I think this
is San Francisco. Um,

558
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,430
wind here you can see the general
mass gain of the whole population.

559
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,680
And this was a public notice of
public health poster from Kingston,

560
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:54,580
New York or,

561
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,150
yeah.

562
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:01,010
Oh and it says about the measures I've
told you about theaters, churches,

563
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:04,820
schools, hospitals and so forth. Or um,

564
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:09,020
you can see here another
poster for public health. Well,

565
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:12,650
state boards of health also isolated.

566
00:46:12,651 --> 00:46:16,970
The ill through quarantine
are as far as possible.

567
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:22,270
And the military tried to quarantine
it's training camps on hospital wards.

568
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,760
Sheets were hung between beds.

569
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,320
Ambulance trains were
washed down with antiseptic.

570
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:36,110
People were urge to avoid
nervous and physical exhaustion.

571
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,350
You can see a long legacy of this idea.

572
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,490
You remember Lynette talking
about the posse on Triste,

573
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,980
the sad, um, uh,

574
00:46:45,981 --> 00:46:49,840
passions and their influence
on your constitution. So these,

575
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:53,960
some of the advice had a really
long history that you'll recognize.

576
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,520
And he also, they also cautioned
you are to avoid chills.

577
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,660
They urged people to gargle with warm
water and salt and just spray say line

578
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:10,130
solutions up their nose to where gauze
masks and legislation was passed to

579
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:14,810
prevent the use of common drinking cops.

580
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:20,650
Some people sprayed their nostrils with
carbolic acid spray and some towns set

581
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:25,070
up fines to punish people.
They called.

582
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:27,500
This was one of the jargons at the time.

583
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,820
The open face sneezer well,

584
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,880
New York City modified the opening hours
of stores and businesses in order to

585
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:42,241
stagger rush hour so that subway trains
and trems would not be so crowded and

586
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:44,800
not be so dangerous.

587
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,700
Congress voted special funds to an agent,

588
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:53,730
able as surgeon general Rupert blue to
recruit thousands of doctors and hundreds

589
00:47:54,791 --> 00:47:57,430
of nurses.
But as I said,

590
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:02,460
the war effort complicated his task
and he turned to people who'd retired.

591
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,940
Um, those were other, I
wanted to show you, um,

592
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:14,860
a camp,
a fact that it was wartime,

593
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,980
made it easy for the government to induce
people to accept rigorous measures.

594
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:25,590
People by this time had grown use by 1918
too invasive and restrictive measures.

595
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:31,710
They already knew all about the draft
or rationing or daylight savings time,

596
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:37,230
but existing facilities were
inadequate to cope with a sudden surge.

597
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:41,790
And so the general public
one can see, um, uh,

598
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,810
suffering as a result of that.

599
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,310
And I wanted to mention that there
were also popular remedies that people

600
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:51,130
adopted and especially in rural areas,

601
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:56,220
recourse to folk remedies and magic onion
soup was thought to be a preventative

602
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,270
people stuff salt up their
nostrils to ward off danger.

603
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:06,290
They wore garlic around their neck as
they had in Florence and the time of Boob

604
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,210
onic plague.

605
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:12,270
They burned heart charcoals with
sulfur or brown sugar to give off for

606
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:14,860
reassuring protective aroma.

607
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,860
You can recognize this
too from the plague.

608
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,930
There were rumors that the disease
perhaps was inactive bioterror.

609
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,700
There were thoughts that there were
mysterious German agents who landed on new

610
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,890
boats and started the epidemic.

611
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:35,340
There were suspicions to that poisonous
gasses associated with the war effort

612
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:40,330
had escaped and caused the disaster.
Well,

613
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,360
I will run out of time now and just say
that one of the things to think about

614
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:49,600
then or what,
or possible lessons,

615
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,840
and I just wanted to leave us to think
as we deal with our own h one n one and

616
00:49:56,381 --> 00:50:01,381
possibly whatever its successor is
that clearly in 1918 and 19 there's a

617
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:07,921
collective memory in the public health
service of the vulnerability of a society

618
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:15,360
of critically ill patients turn away
from hospitals that were full to bursting

619
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:20,170
with no care available because
the system was overwhelmed.

620
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,860
And there's a fear then of what about the
effects now of the impact of organized

621
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:33,550
care medicine on a managed
care basis with cutting costs,

622
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:36,860
cutting search for savings in our system.

623
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:42,250
The commitment to reading hospitals
have excess capacity and spare beds.

624
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:47,830
And so this approach raises the question
of what would happen and another time

625
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,070
when the system might
once again be tested.
