1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,600
Well. Good morning. Our topic for
this time and next is another,

2
00:00:06,601 --> 00:00:09,960
the really ancient diseases in our course,

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,940
which is tuberculosis,

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,250
tuberculosis was present in ancient Egypt.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,090
This is known from skeletons and from
mummies and it seems that tuberculosis has

6
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:28,800
been with human beings ever since.

7
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,670
They first began to gather
in substantial settlements,

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,080
which are essential for its transmission
and ways we'll be discussing.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,860
It was present in ancient Greece and
in Rome and Hippocrates and Galen,

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,010
clearly new patients
suffering from tuberculosis.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,690
It persisted in the Middle Ages,

12
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,160
so we're dealing not with the
new but a very ancient disease.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,240
A question that you'll be asking is
whether indeed it's an epidemic disease,

14
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:06,150
would it perhaps be better
to describe it as endemic

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,430
and this again,
I think as when we dealt with malaria,

16
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:16,431
we see that some diseases are both endemic
and epidemic and I think the supplies

17
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,140
to tuberculosis as well.

18
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,810
One way of thinking of it might
be in terms of its timeframe.

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,200
If you look at any single generation,

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,030
it often seems that tuberculosis
isn't an epidemic disease.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,480
It's present after all year after year.

22
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,550
It is contagious, but it's spread
slowly from person to person.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,870
It's course in the
individual body of a patient.

24
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,230
It was often very slow and capricious.

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,950
It's clearly different from bubonic
plague from influenza or Asiatic cholera,

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,570
but if you take a longterm perspective,

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,960
it might seem that tuberculosis does
ebb and flow like an epidemic disease.

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:13,010
Perhaps one could think of it in terms
of an epidemic that lasts for centuries,

29
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,010
perhaps or decades in the case of the
body of a single patient and times.

30
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,211
In a sense,

31
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:29,211
one could say that tuberculosis could
be an epidemic disease in slow motion.

32
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,870
Our concern will be with Europe and North
America at a time of a vast upsurge,

33
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,210
and here I'm referring to Western Europe
that coincided with the industrial

34
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,090
revolution.

35
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,170
Here there are a number of factors that
lie in the background that contributed.

36
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Probably one is a large skill pace of
indoor urbanization and we'll see the

37
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,760
impact of crowded housing
and poor ventilation,

38
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,010
which are decisive factors,

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,100
particularly in the case of a disease
that's a pulmonary disease above all the

40
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:17,911
rise of sweatshops and the factory
system again lead to crowding.

41
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:23,290
This time, not in the home, but in
the workplace and poor ventilation.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
Now during the day as well as in the home
at night and thinking of low wages and

43
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,260
with that poor diet and a
compromised immune system.

44
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,310
Another factor that's very important
for diseases that are respiratory is

45
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:47,341
pollution of the atmosphere and the smog
in cities like London due to sit from

46
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:53,851
the burning of coal or particles due
to tobacco from smoking or again,

47
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,470
particles in mind,

48
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:01,120
shots or run hygienic workshops
all made their contribution.

49
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,620
In any case,
it's not by chance that England,

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,920
the first industrial nation experienced
an epidemic wave that crested between

51
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:17,731
the middle of the 18th century and the
middle of the 19th and then in the case

52
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,740
of England,
there was a slow,

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,800
steady decline from the later
decades of the 19th century.

54
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,320
And we can see this as well taking
place in countries that industrialized a

55
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:36,460
little bit later, say France,
Germany, Italy, Russia,

56
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,400
the upsurge began later,

57
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,860
but did so remorselessly
and then a decline set in.

58
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,240
But again, slightly later from
the beginning of the 20th century.

59
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:55,060
If you look at the geography
of tuberculosis in Europe,

60
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,510
it would also support this idea of a
clear relationship between tuberculosis as

61
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,901
a condition and the conditions
created by industrial development,

62
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,080
especially in it's traumatic early phases.

63
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Tuberculosis was a major killer in
the northern industrial nations,

64
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,720
Britain,
Germany and France,

65
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,950
and it was less prevalent
and less industrial,

66
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,360
largely agricultural nations
such as Italy and Spain.

67
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,350
So there's this distinction to be made,

68
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,820
but also if you look at the
pattern of tuberculosis in Italy,

69
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,560
in Spain,
uh,

70
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,920
you would see not only was it less there,

71
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,280
but also it respected the distribution
of industrial development.

72
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,060
Take Italy for example,

73
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:54,061
we already talked in the case of malaria
about a major north south divide.

74
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,640
This is also true with
regard tuberculosis,

75
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,910
but in reverse tuberculosis and other
words was an affliction above all of

76
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:09,581
Italy's northern cities and it was much
less prevalent in the aquacultural south

77
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,310
where people worked out doors.
Well,

78
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,230
let's turn now to the nature of
the disease, how it's transmitted,

79
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,410
it's different forms and it's
symptomatology in the body.

80
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,050
The pathogen to begin with was first
discovered by someone we know well now and

81
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,440
a variety of contracts,

82
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,500
and this is Robert Kaul who discovered
it in 1882 the micro bacterium

83
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,730
tuberculosis,
which is

84
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,433
thought.

85
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,620
Now transmission tuberculosis can
be spread in more than one way,

86
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,270
but we're concerned and will be concerned
primarily with its dominant mode of

87
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:06,900
transmission, which is through
the air. In other words, uh,

88
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,790
suffer from tuberculosis,
we'll say cough,

89
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,060
sneeze,
spit,

90
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,050
okay.

91
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,320
And give off airborne droplets,

92
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,800
which are then inhaled by other people.

93
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,463
No,

94
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,770
a primary infection by most people who
come into contact with mycobacterium

95
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,210
tuberculosis, doesn't
develop, lead on to symptoms.

96
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,100
It usually heals,

97
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,360
but in those with
compromised immune systems,

98
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,170
the disease as the expression was,
is disseminated.

99
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,850
It can then lie dormant for years.
As I've said,

100
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:59,630
one of the things about
tuberculosis is it's enormous, uh,

101
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,610
capricious quality,
enormously capricious quality.

102
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,290
Alternatively,

103
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,350
it could produce disease within
weeks of the primary infection.

104
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,890
Mycobacterium tuberculosis can spread
via the bloodstream or the lymph system

105
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,300
too.
In fact,

106
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:24,390
a variety of organs and produce lesions
in virtually any tissue in the body.

107
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:31,470
I'll show you now a number of images
of suffers from tuberculosis in various

108
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:39,211
forms and I'm hoping that these images
won't be overly distressing to anyone.

109
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,410
Uh,

110
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:46,410
first this is squab Phila sometimes
called the king's eval which was here we

111
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:54,151
have [inaudible] of the neck are those
tuberculosis of the skin called Lupus.

112
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,190
Vulgarness.

113
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,990
Tuberculosis can also infect
them in NGS of the brain,

114
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,540
the bone and joints,
the kidneys,

115
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,690
the urinary and reproductive system and
can in fact the spine leading to severe

116
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:16,440
deformity and hunchback.
I'll show you the not form,

117
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,530
it's called pots disease and there's a
skeleton from a software of pots disease

118
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,880
or this would be what it would look like.

119
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,810
The disease can also affect the lining
of the abdominal cavity or the heart,

120
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,470
but overwhelmingly the most common form
of tuberculosis is of the lungs and this

121
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:47,751
is what we'll be dealing with primarily
in the course pulmonary disease,

122
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,840
also known as stasis or consumption.

123
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,770
We'll mention in passing that tuberculosis
is also a spread and was spread by

124
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,800
mill meat or milk of infected animals,

125
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,160
but that's a secondary tragedy within
the larger dominant pulmonary form of the

126
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,760
disease.
Now,

127
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:19,761
you know from your reading
response questions and from
Barnes is book this week

128
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,660
that tuberculosis is sometimes
referred to as a social disease.

129
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,740
And you'll see in your,
in trays that I've just sent you a,

130
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,520
um,

131
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,080
an email about social diseases
and how we might think of them.

132
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,210
But just for the moment,

133
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,300
you'll note that Barnes doesn't define
what he means by social disease by saying

134
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:50,610
that it was a social disease.

135
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,930
He's arguing that tuberculosis had a
predilection for certain social classes,

136
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,310
that it was a disease that was unlike,

137
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,330
um,
that it didn't affect all classes equally.

138
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,370
Now note that cholera for example,
um,

139
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,630
was a disease that didn't
affect all social classes.

140
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,000
Tuberculosis did in fact afflict
royal families, aristocrats,

141
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,970
artists' riders and professionals.

142
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,820
And this was an important factor in
the social response to the disease.

143
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,540
Given the mode of transmission
that is through the air,

144
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,510
it was inevitable that
that would be the case.

145
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,200
So even if we do decide to call
tuberculosis a social disease,

146
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,140
we need to make major qualifications,

147
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,770
but to focus on the rich and famous is
distorting because out of all proportion,

148
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,670
tuberculosis did.
And still a flicks the poor,

149
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,460
especially the urban poor.

150
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Remember the risk factors we said living
in cities rather than the countryside.

151
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,090
Crowded unhygienic housing,

152
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:18,410
poor ventilation workplaces that were
similar to those of the home child labor

153
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:25,411
on mass lowered resistance due to
poor diet or preexisting diseases.

154
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,460
Tuberculosis then thrived in slums and
tenements among industrial workers and

155
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:41,410
among the inmates of alms
houses, prisons, barracks.

156
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,850
Let me give you some illustrations and
we'll look at some famous pictures.

157
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,870
I think that we have no better ones than
the photographs taken by Yaka Reese of

158
00:12:56,671 --> 00:13:01,671
tenements and sweat shops in New
York City in the 1880s and nineties,

159
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,470
some of which were collected and is
really famous and influential book.

160
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,620
How the other half lives that was
published in 1890 and I'd like to show you

161
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,300
some of the pictures.
This is a slide of a tournament,

162
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,520
uh,
an ideal place for tuberculosis.

163
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,170
We'll be looking first at some pictures
of housing. And I'd like you just to,

164
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:33,171
you'd make the imaginative
leap of thinking what are
the kinds of conditions if

165
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:38,550
you live in these places that
facilitate the spread of tuberculosis.

166
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,600
Again,
this is from Yaka breeze,

167
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,210
a tenement in New York City.

168
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,150
Uh, here we see the conditions
in which people were sleeping.

169
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,550
This is what was called 7 cent lodgings
and an unhappy street pell street in New

170
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,950
York City. Um, and you can see, uh,

171
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,870
how tuberculosis would thrive
in conditions like this.

172
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,080
But let's also remember the tuberculosis
also thrive because of conditions at

173
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,424
work.

174
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,520
And here's a sweatshop in the garment
district in New York City again in the

175
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:30,130
1890s or here again,

176
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,880
another picture.
I think you get the point,

177
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,080
remember to that prison populations then
and now have been seriously affected

178
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,430
with consumption because the inmates
there have often lived in conditions like

179
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,690
those if tenements with ventilation or
lighting pervasive down overcrowding,

180
00:14:55,971 --> 00:15:00,830
inadequate diet for sanitation
and conditions like that.

181
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:04,820
Tuberculosis runs riot.
Indeed,

182
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,850
The New York Times reported
in 1908 but it was a lie.

183
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,320
When judges sentenced
convicted felons to hard labor,

184
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,413
the truth,

185
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:22,450
the paper reported the sentence should
be labeled to hard labor and tuberculosis

186
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:31,210
and an inspection in 1905 the
New York state superintendent,

187
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:35,630
if prisons declared that sing
sing prison in particular,

188
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,640
and here I'm quoting from
the superintendent of
prisons if New York state,

189
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,760
he called it a hotbed for the culture
and spread of tuberculosis that should be

190
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:50,780
in band and as unfit for human habitation.

191
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,300
Well,
even if a person is infected,

192
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,110
as I said in the vast majority of people,

193
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,230
the immune system of the body contains
the disease and the 19th century San

194
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,420
Paris or la for probably
New York City as well,

195
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,540
it's estimated that virtually every
inhabitant had encountered microbacterium

196
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,860
tuberculosis,

197
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,780
but most remained asymptomatic
and noninfectious.

198
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,830
An active infection was promoted
by a compromised immune system,

199
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,540
let's say perhaps heredity,
alcoholism,

200
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,970
malnutrition,
drug abuse,

201
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,120
the presence of concurrent infections
that are immunosuppressive and our own

202
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:46,400
times.
One can think of malaria,

203
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,460
aids or two diabetes as forming a
good substratum for tuberculosis.

204
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,340
What are the symptoms of TB?
Well,

205
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,200
it's extremely variable.

206
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,620
One of the mysteries of medicine in fact,

207
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,460
is the course of tuberculosis
in the human body.

208
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,050
It can be fulminant and
lead to death and months.

209
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,170
This is often called galloping consumption
at the time or Miliary tuberculosis.

210
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,080
Alternatively,

211
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,140
there can be an onset of symptoms followed
by recovery or remission and then a

212
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:31,760
relapse and instead of
leading to early death,

213
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,180
it can lead to a long chronic illness,

214
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,420
often punctuated by prolonged remissions
and equally mysterious relapses.

215
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,590
Before the age of antibiotics,

216
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,280
some 80% of cases were deemed and fatally,

217
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:56,030
but in a time span that varied from
up to 1520 years and in every age the

218
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:04,680
respond to serious Tanea
secures or parent cures.

219
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,600
Let's look at two opposite extremes.
Two famous cases,

220
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,400
the medical careers of two famous
19th century British riders.

221
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,970
The first is John keys

222
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,530
who lived from 1795 until his death from
tuberculosis and 1821 no 1821 because

223
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:32,610
he fell ill in February,

224
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,610
1820 and died the next year at the age
of 26 from galloping and consumption.

225
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:44,330
Kate's in fact became an icon of the
relationship of tuberculosis to the arts

226
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,960
and to genius and entire century was
familiar with the fact that he contracted

227
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:56,850
the disease while tending his diet,
dying brother,

228
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,020
that he made a desperate departure from
Britain to Rome in search of health and

229
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:06,780
it knows the world,

230
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:11,781
knew at the time of his death and burial
there after a final period that was

231
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:17,601
widely and romantically regarded as his
most productive and brilliant his life

232
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,120
was described by romantic
riders as not of a meteor,

233
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,460
a comment or a candle that
rapidly burned itself out.

234
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,280
And this became a focal point.

235
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,520
And Keats himself did for the way
this disease was construed or socially

236
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:43,911
constructed in the middle of the 19th
century as the disease of genius,

237
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,980
it was considered to be a disease
of sensibility and civilization.

238
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,150
Let's look at the disease,
um,

239
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,420
of a different person whom you all know.
Well,

240
00:19:57,421 --> 00:20:02,421
this is Robert Louis Stevenson
who lived from 1850 to 1,894.

241
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,250
This is a picture of him and about 18,
19.

242
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,670
Now Stevenson,
unlike kicks,

243
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,730
battled tuberculosis for decades,

244
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:19,350
he went in and out of
health spas and sanatoriums,

245
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,930
but he led a long and productive
life that was ended in fact,

246
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:29,550
ironically not by tuberculosis,
but probably by a stroke.

247
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,730
Now in the 19th century,

248
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,210
physicians regarded the course of
pulmonary disease as passing through three

249
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:40,750
stages as they saw it.

250
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,940
But remember though,

251
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,970
before the tuberculin skin test
and the development of radiology,

252
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,040
tuberculosis was difficult to diagnose
as the symptoms mimic those of other

253
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:02,980
common diseases.
And even if the diagnosis was accurate,

254
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,570
one stage merged
imperceptibly into another.

255
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,100
But for 19th century physicians,
there was still this distinction. Now,

256
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:17,101
the first stage as they described
it was marked by a persistent cough.

257
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,960
Some difficulty in breathing,
especially after exercise.

258
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,230
The patient would sweat profusely.

259
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:32,190
There would be an elevated pulse
pain in the chest and shoulders,

260
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,820
general lassitude, a
loss of weight, power,

261
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,630
declining performance
at work or at school.

262
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,250
Then came the second stage when the cough
became tormenting and frequent and the

263
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:51,460
patient would begin to
cough up a greenish phlegm.

264
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,810
He or she would experience intermittent
fevers spiking twice daily at copia

265
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,540
sweating and a rapid pulse.

266
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,500
The patient would suffer from severe
fatigability from hoarseness that made it

267
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,640
difficult and painful to eat
or to speak above a whisper.

268
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,870
There would be extreme
shortness of breath on exertion.

269
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,810
Pain in the joints of the body.

270
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,330
Then came the third stage
of advanced tuberculosis,

271
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,020
which gave the most common 19th century
name to the disease consumption.

272
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,490
That is a frightening emaciation in
which the body wasted away or seem to be

273
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:43,990
consumed.
The face would be hollow.

274
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,700
The complexion Pale.

275
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,170
Perhaps this was one of the reasons
that it was called the white plague.

276
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,040
The eyes would be sunken in their sockets
and a patient could easily look like

277
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:57,581
this.

278
00:22:57,581 --> 00:23:02,581
This is a picture of a consumptive patient
in 1892 the cough now seemed like a

279
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:08,590
death rattle and the
patient would cough blood.

280
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,130
There would be constant
pain in the joints.

281
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,460
The legs would be swollen,
there would be fever,

282
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,960
often uncontrollable diarrhea
and extreme shortness of breath.

283
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,010
At that point,
the diagnosis was certain,

284
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,500
but at this advanced stage,

285
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,510
death was imminent and it's
form was unpleasant and painful.

286
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,990
Often asphyxia as the patient virtually
drowned on the phlegm in his or her

287
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:43,201
lungs or there could be a sudden and
unstoppable hemorrhage with blood rushing

288
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,190
from the mouth and nostrils and
the patient again suffocating.

289
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,830
Well, what was it that happened
to the lungs? Well, here's a,

290
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:59,690
some modern ex-ray slide
of a TB patient's lungs.

291
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,440
And let's look behind the X-ray
at a pictures of the lungs.

292
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,900
Here are, is a set of healthy lungs, um,

293
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,150
hopefully like all of yours.

294
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,720
And then I'd like to take you through
the drawings and pictures of the process

295
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:24,941
called cavitation in the lungs and
what the way in which the mycobacterium

296
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:31,331
tuberculosis consumes
the respiratory organs.

297
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,750
This is a famous drawing by Renee Lynette,
you know,

298
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:40,751
of the Paris School of medicine
who was a tuberculosis authority.

299
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:46,810
And he did this drawing of the onset
of the cavitation in the lungs.

300
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,833
Let's look,

301
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,043
uh,

302
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,430
at a picture of it.
Uh,

303
00:24:55,431 --> 00:25:00,230
this is the process of necrosis
at work in the tissues.

304
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,400
And the end result would be
the destruction of the lungs,

305
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,400
which would look more or less like that.

306
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,750
Yeah.

307
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,920
So this was, uh, an enormously painful,

308
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,730
horrible and unpleasant disease.

309
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,550
And I want to argue that there are two
great eras in the modern history of

310
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:28,551
tuberculosis in which the disease was
conceived or thought of quite differently

311
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,980
and without much relationship to the
reality of the quality of the symptoms.

312
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,080
The two periods are divided by the
watershed of the germ theory of disease

313
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,930
established by Robert Kaul from about
1882 and slowly then accepted thereafter

314
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,360
by the medical profession and
educated society as a whole,

315
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,200
not instantly,
but in the decades that follow.

316
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,650
Now I'd like to call the first era
the era of consumption or perhaps the

317
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:09,840
romantic era of tuberculosis.

318
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:15,230
Let's define it from the end of the
18th century to the middle to the bout.

319
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,870
Uh,
the time of Robert caughts discovery.

320
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,590
It was jolted first by in the 1860s and
seventies by the work of Sean Antoine

321
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:28,590
via Ma and France,

322
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,100
who first convincingly proposed
the idea that TB was contagious.

323
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,730
And then the romantic era clearly came
to an end with the work of Robert Call

324
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,750
when accepts this new interpretation
and the word consumption begins to fade

325
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,780
from popular usage.
Thomas Men's great book,

326
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:59,810
the Magic Mountain is perhaps the
last great artistic expression of the

327
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:05,300
consumptive era and it susceptibilities.
Now,

328
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,260
what was the idea behind the
romantic or consumptive theory?

329
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,850
It's most authoritative
formulation was fine.

330
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,270
The great authority of the Paris
School of medicine, when they Lynette,

331
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,440
who's drawing you just saw the man who
invented the stethoscope and spent his

332
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:28,560
life listening to the lungs
of tuberculosis patients.

333
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,720
Lynette talked about what he
called the essential list theory.

334
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,330
Ironically,

335
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:41,390
given the opposition of the parish
school to Galen and humorless teachings,

336
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,830
we could see a centralism
as actually a form of humor.

337
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:51,831
Realism revived a kind of anti
contagion aneurysm in classic dress.

338
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,940
Now note the irony your friend ackerk
necked at is the historian of medicine

339
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,880
observed dryly. After all, things
have to be explained somehow.

340
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:06,991
Well,

341
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:11,991
TB was explained and primarily by internal
causes due to the inherited essence

342
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,680
of the patients,

343
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,990
his or her constitution
or in Linnex jargon,

344
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:27,170
the patients diathesis which caused
him or her to be susceptible to the

345
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:32,940
immediate factors that
triggered the actual illness.

346
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,860
So you're a diathesis was
an inborn inherited defect,

347
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:44,390
precipitated or immediate
causes supervened and these
were thought to be some

348
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:50,010
irregularity in the patient's life.

349
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,670
Very important in the literature
or alcoholism and sexual excess.

350
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Lunette postulated that two sorts
of issues were important to him.

351
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,350
One more what he called Lipase on
Trieste melancholy sorrow or despair.

352
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,960
And again, um, sexual excess,

353
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,740
the loss of bodily fluids was thought
to weaken the body and lead to illness,

354
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,570
but both were almost an aspect
of an individual's fade,

355
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,930
his or her nature.
So consumption,

356
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,020
unlike the other great epidemic killer
of the 19th century that is cholera was

357
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:42,081
not thought to be contagious
but hereditary and therefore
its victims weren't

358
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:45,940
feared or thought to be dangerous.

359
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,200
And Tuberculosis was a slow killer,

360
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,760
not a cause of sudden
death and its symptoms.

361
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,770
By the canons of the day,

362
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,980
we're deemed to be respectable and not
thought to be disgusting or source of

363
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,390
unbearable torment.

364
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,580
And death was private unlike cholera,

365
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,560
not a public spectacle.
Furthermore,

366
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,620
tuberculosis wasn't so frightening
because it was also an [inaudible] endemic

367
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:20,620
disease and was ever present in society.

368
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,860
So the effects on society,

369
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,250
we're not at all like
those of Asiatic cholera.

370
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:32,310
We mustn't think of diseases
as interchangeable causes
of death that had the

371
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:37,180
same effects on the societies.
They afflict tuberculosis,

372
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:41,830
didn't lead to terror,
hysteria, xenophobia,

373
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,370
revolt,
and it's for in its first phase,

374
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,940
it didn't lead to stigmatization,
but it's opposite.

375
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,830
Patients with tuberculosis were
thought to be glamorous, sexy,

376
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,730
and chic.

377
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,690
They were blameless as it was their
heredity that was responsible and there

378
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:04,270
weren't outbursts of religiosity.

379
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,320
There was a recognition
of Lard that in fact,

380
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,210
large numbers of the social
elite fell victim to the disease.

381
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,640
There was no poisoning frenzy.

382
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,120
This disease was too slow,

383
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,390
too unrelated to digestion,
too,

384
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:25,930
associated with the powerful
as well as the poor.

385
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,380
And it was true that doctors and officials
paid their tribute to the disease,

386
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,590
but it did have major social effects.

387
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,720
And let's think about what
some of them were. Uh,

388
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,730
first was be the widespread
experience of patients.

389
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,160
This is the career of invalid ism.

390
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:54,630
Tuberculosis after diagnosis
became a lifetime career.

391
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,750
Okay.

392
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,750
The rest of one's life after receiving
diagnosis was unknown and unpredictable.

393
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,350
And this would affect
every possible decision,

394
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,450
career choices,
whether to marry and have a family,

395
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,950
whether to place one's
normal responsibilities on
hold and to devote life to

396
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:26,170
seeking to recover health.

397
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:33,570
And so the sufferers tended to undertake
and new an all consuming occupation,

398
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,470
restoring health,

399
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,310
and to accept what would
probably be an early death.

400
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,970
Let's think for example of
um,

401
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,850
Antoine Checkoff,
who's the men on the left.

402
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,460
Pictured here with Leo Tolstoy.

403
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,540
Now checkoff who lived from 1860 to
1904 was a sufferer from consumption.

404
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,230
It was forced to abandon his
own career and is actress,

405
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:14,231
wife in Moscow in the attempt to
restore his shattered health to do so,

406
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,070
he went to the mild climate of the Crimea.

407
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,570
His plays were all written in the period
of his illness and all subtly have

408
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:32,480
invalid ism as a hidden
but unmentioned theme.

409
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:37,250
The protagonists in checkoffs
plays not by chance,

410
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,980
seem oddly unable to act.

411
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,580
They seem to be waiting and waiting for
events beyond their control to unfold.

412
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:53,650
The middle classes tended to go off
to what was called taking the cure.

413
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:57,770
That is they travel in Europe.

414
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,800
They would go to a climate that was
thought to be favorable spas and health

415
00:34:02,901 --> 00:34:07,370
resorts and southern Europe on
the French Riviera or an Italy.

416
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,490
Those were favorite destinations and
the list of distinguished travelers is

417
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,634
lengthy.

418
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,080
Keats and Shelley went
to Rome to buy a smaller,

419
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,440
went to nice the Brownings
went to Florence,

420
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,240
Chopin went to Mayorca.
Paul Erlick went to Egypt,

421
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:31,010
but this was also true in our own country.
In the United States.

422
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:36,250
People took see journeys to recover their
health or they traveled to the West on

423
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:42,461
the South West and here the famous
frontier thesis in American history.

424
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,930
As you got another meaning,

425
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,980
health seekers formed a substantial
current that is of the movement West and

426
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:58,421
turned into a large scale movement with
the availability of the railroad from

427
00:34:58,701 --> 00:35:03,701
the 1870s Colorado Springs and Pasedena
or examples of communities that were

428
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:12,050
founded by and for tuberculosis sufferers.

429
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,130
Also popular were other destinations,

430
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:18,170
Florida and the Caribbean,

431
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,860
and the cure became a kind of industry.

432
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,430
It was stimulated by a flood of medical
books by rumor and anecdote by brochures

433
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,850
prepared by interested parties
such as the railroad companies.

434
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,973
There was

435
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,370
other exotic but more affordable
ways of seeking the cure.

436
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,620
One was altitude therapy in which
you'd go up high in a hot air balloon.

437
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,180
More commonly,

438
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,040
people moved out doors simply
where they lived in New York City.

439
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,900
At the turn of the century,

440
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,260
the buildings were dotted with people
who had moved to live in tents on the

441
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:09,171
roofs and porches of apartment buildings
or in their back yards if they had

442
00:36:10,681 --> 00:36:11,514
them.

443
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Let me remind you of Professor
Irving Fischer of Yale University,

444
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,990
who in 1907 promoted health by inventing
a tent that he claimed was perfectly

445
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:30,651
ventilated for those who took to the out
of doors life and he wanted his tent to

446
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:36,090
make outdoor living affordable
for the pure, for the poor.

447
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,970
He himself was a consumptive,

448
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,480
but he regained his health after living
out of doors and he aimed to make the

449
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:49,890
cure universally available.
If you read the New York Times,

450
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:54,891
you would see there were people who
move not only to tense but also to tree

451
00:36:55,561 --> 00:37:00,561
houses that they constructed in their
yards and example being Charles Battersby

452
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,020
of rent them Massachusetts,

453
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,530
a consumptive who constructed a house
between two adjoining pine trees and moved

454
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:15,261
into it full time in the winter of 1906
who knows to what extent the travels,

455
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:22,701
if people were also means to escape the
regimens that if they stayed at home

456
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,840
their physicians would have
subjected them to at home.

457
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,550
The treatments weren't
especially enjoyable.

458
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,390
There was bleeding and cupping
to release the noxious agents.

459
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,450
There were direct
applications to the lesions,

460
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,080
poultices ointments,
infusions.

461
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:51,830
There was also the spray therapy that
is inhalations in which the doctors were

462
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:58,041
attempting to attack the disease at
its C as you inhaled gas mixtures,

463
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:04,340
creosote and carbolic acid had a
large vogue and these centuries.

464
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:11,070
Well, what about the effectiveness
of the travels? Well,

465
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:16,090
in some cases it's probably safe to
say that the travel were beneficial for

466
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:20,820
pulmonary tuberculosis.

467
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,880
It probably did help to escape the urban
smog of a place like London for Lupus

468
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,480
full Garris.
The disease of the skin.

469
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:35,510
Sunlight is known to be beneficial and
it was probably beneficial just to have

470
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:41,971
hope and to have the belief that you
could do something to help yourself that

471
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,760
probably did more good than harm.

472
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Tuberculosis also clearly had
economic and demographic effects.

473
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,060
Tuberculosis was the greatest killer of
the young at the time and an inevitably

474
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,070
limit to the growth of population.

475
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:05,850
It limited the expansion of the
economy and caused widespread poverty.

476
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:08,820
There was a new one,

477
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,680
awareness and sensitivity to
this death with romanticism.

478
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,250
Tuberculosis,

479
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,400
I want to say was not
the cause of romanticism,

480
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:29,060
but it is true that romantic literature
and the arts did fit some qualities

481
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:37,140
about tuberculosis. That
is romanticism, stress,

482
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,860
the transiency of youth,
early death,

483
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,850
melancholy life as a femoral,

484
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:50,510
the importance of autumn as a symbol
no longer now assemble of the harvest,

485
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,390
but as a time of falling leaves,

486
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,570
dying flowers as death sets
in genius was part of it.

487
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,400
The redemptive and ennobling idea of
suffering that releases the life of the

488
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:13,041
soul as the gross material body wastes
away and there was a poetic quality that

489
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:19,590
was attributed to tuberculosis.

490
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,340
It was sad to release
genius and creativity.

491
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,350
So one sees this portrayed in
romantic works in the century.

492
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:35,110
Emily Bronte, weathering heights,
Victor Hugo lame. He said,

493
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:35,900
ah Blah.

494
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Alexandre Dumas honoring
inertia or the romantic opera,

495
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,730
Verdi La Traviata or Puccini's,
Labo m.

496
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,260
Then I would argue the tuberculosis also,

497
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:56,290
so it had an effect and the effect the
causal chain worked in both ways and

498
00:40:57,141 --> 00:41:02,141
effect and promoting romanticism and
romanticism in turn promoted a certain

499
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:08,020
understanding or social construction of
the disease itself had a major impact.

500
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:14,801
Then on literature and was portrayed often
in literature and indeed in the opera

501
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,940
tuberculosis also had an
effect on gender issues.

502
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,690
I would argue that it helped to
promote a new idea of feminine beauty,

503
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,000
thin,
elongated to Burke jeweler,

504
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,060
short pallor at the time,
white powders,

505
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,480
not Suntan oil is today where the fashion,

506
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,550
let me show you an example.

507
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:49,540
This is a famous painting of a woman
at the table by to lose little trek and

508
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:55,961
you'll note that she looks extremely
polished and it's quite thin.

509
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,190
Uh, but what I wanted to point out
is what she has in front of her,

510
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,061
uh,

511
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:07,061
which is a pot of rice powder that she
puts on her face to imitate the power of

512
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:11,750
a consumptive one.

513
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:16,250
Can see this also in the paintings
of the pre Ralphio lights,

514
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,990
whose favorite models were
often women with tuberculosis.

515
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,230
Elizabeth Siddall for example,

516
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,650
was a model for 10 years of and then
became the wife of Dante Rosette t and

517
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:33,950
became also a model for molay.

518
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:39,970
Jane burden became the model and also the
wife of William Morris and one can see

519
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,230
some of the, uh, you can
see the long gated, uh,

520
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,120
this is Mariana.
This is the bay ought to bear tricks.

521
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,500
In any case,
then consumption was a fatal,

522
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,610
debilitating,
and excrutiatingly painful disease.

523
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:07,150
But paradoxically then it was given
positive associations in the way it was

524
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:12,941
described at the time tuberculosis
was said to make the body beautiful,

525
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,820
to make a person spiritual by
wasting away the gross flesh.

526
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,860
And it was said to enhance
creativity and genius.

527
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,450
How can this be explained?
Well,

528
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:30,680
in the United States,

529
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,460
tuberculosis was also thought
to be the white plague,

530
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,240
partly because it was popularly regarded
as a disease that affected the white

531
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:45,461
race and not African Americans who were
thought to have a different affliction.

532
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,920
In the middle of the
19th century tellingly,

533
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:53,980
it was called the white man's plague and
the white men scourge in this country

534
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,150
and in Europe.

535
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,860
It wasn't associated in the popular
mind with the working classes.

536
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,980
And people remembered that aristocrats
and artistic celebrities often contracted

537
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:11,450
it. And you can see the power of
what we might call advertising,

538
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,930
the endless stream of novels,
poems,

539
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:20,110
operas that extolled the beauty
and sensitivity of those afflicted.

540
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:25,260
In addition, recalling what we
said about Gubernick Plagge,

541
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,820
tuberculosis did not evoke the fear
of Moore's rape and sudden death.

542
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,400
So dreaded with bubonic plague or
Asiatic cholera with consumption.

543
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,700
There was no danger that a person would
be caught unaware and not even have time

544
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,560
to write his or her will.

545
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:52,340
The disease was spiritual in part
because it worn the sufferer of death and

546
00:44:52,561 --> 00:44:57,561
ample time to work out one's relationship
with God and with the community.

547
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,620
And there was also a simple matter
of comparison consumption. Death,

548
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:09,621
consumptive death was perhaps construed
as beautiful because pulmonary disease

549
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,010
didn't disfigure in
the manner of smallpox.

550
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:19,320
It's symptoms weren't degrading
in the manner of Asiatic cholera.

551
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:21,960
Well,
so to make the point,

552
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,500
let's turn to a work that
probably all of you know,

553
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,860
the most influential,

554
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,430
best selling novel of the 19th century,

555
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,150
which was Harriet Beecher
snow uncle Tom's cabin.

556
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,320
You probably know very well that it was
a religious novel about Social Justice

557
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:45,840
and God's way with men,

558
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:52,070
that it was about Simon legree and
the horrors of slavery and called for

559
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,510
abolition.

560
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,260
But you've probably forgotten that it
was also a major tuberculosis novel and

561
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:07,551
that the heroin at when the child
little ava dies of consumption.

562
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,780
Let me remind you of how Harriet Beecher
Stowe described approaching death and

563
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:21,531
she wrote for so bright and placid was
the farewell voyage of the little spirit

564
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
by such sweet and fragrant breezes was
the small bark born towards the heavenly

565
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:34,821
shores that it was impossible to
realize that death was approaching.

566
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,600
The child felt no pain,
only a trend,

567
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:44,601
cool soft weakness daily and
almost insensibly increasing.

568
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:50,370
And she was so beautiful,
so loving, so trustful,

569
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:51,210
so happy.

570
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,640
The one could not resist the soothing
influence of that air of innocence in

571
00:46:56,641 --> 00:47:00,060
peace that seem to breathe all around her.

572
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,200
Her father found a strange,
calm coming over him.

573
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,880
It wasn't hope that was impossible.
It was not resignation.

574
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,340
It was only a calm resting in the present.

575
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:16,730
That seems so beautiful that he wished
to think of no future was like that hush

576
00:47:17,341 --> 00:47:19,650
of spirit that we feel the mid,

577
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:22,980
the bright mild woods of
autumn when the bright,

578
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:28,010
hectic flushes on the trees and the last
lingering flowers by the brook and we

579
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:34,450
joy in all the more because we
know that it will soon pass away.

580
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:40,780
I would argue that this barest little
relationship to the actual extraordinary

581
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:46,360
suffering of tuberculosis at the very end,

582
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,140
and I think it makes a good way to have
a transition from the consumptive era to

583
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:58,270
what I would call the era of tuberculosis,

584
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,550
when the way that disease,

585
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:05,580
this disease was constructed and
understood changes radically.

586
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,520
And this comes about after the germ
theory of disease and the work of Robert

587
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:17,730
Call when the disease was found not to
be hereditary and due to one's diaphysis,

588
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,500
but to be a nasty,
contagious disease.

589
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:28,860
When softwares became objects of
fear and stigma attached to them,

590
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,580
when the glamor of
consumption was stripped away,

591
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,880
as was its association with feminine
beauty and Mail Genius and poetry and its

592
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:46,050
appeal as a period of spirituality
and sexuality disappeared.

593
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,110
So that's what I want
to talk about next time,

594
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:55,380
which is the movement from the era of
consumption to the era of tuberculosis.
