1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,300
Well,
welcome back.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,890
And what I want to do this morning is to
be cognizant of the fact that you have,

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,160
as you all know,

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,360
the hour exam later this
week in a different format.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,170
And I've written to you about
that. Uh, because of that,

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:23,490
what I thought would be useful to do this
morning would be to have something of

7
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:28,491
a review session I in which
we make explicit some of the,

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,131
uh,

9
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:34,131
ways in which it's useful to think about
epidemic diseases and in which we go

10
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:40,431
over some of the terrain that we've
covered thus far in the semester.

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,170
But at the same time,

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,350
I want to talk about introduce
a new and important disease,

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,110
which is syphilis and provide a bit
of background for the book that you're

14
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:58,350
reading this week, which is
Alan grants. No magic bullet.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,400
And you'll be wanting to know,
well, where did syphilis come from?

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,590
What's the historical background?

17
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,740
So I'm going to try to introduce that
while going over some of the issues that

18
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,670
we've already presented.

19
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:16,671
So you'll find a lump that's already
familiar this morning as we go back in

20
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:18,330
time,
uh,

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,360
covering major issues that we've dealt
with and I hope at the same time to be

22
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:27,180
introducing something
new which has syphilis.

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,270
So we'll look at the oil period we've
covered in the course through the lens of

24
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,300
syphilis. So that's the
direction in which we're headed.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Now in order to talk about a variety
of epidemic diseases and their impact,

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,400
we want to have,
uh,

27
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,340
some comparative questions
that we make explicit.

28
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,170
That is what is it that we need to know
about each of the diseases that we're

29
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,040
talking about?

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,100
What are the crucial aspects that
make it a transformative force or not?

31
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,030
What are the historical variables?

32
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,390
I have a sort of suggestion of maybe
10 major questions that we ought to be

33
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:17,481
thinking about with regard to each of
the diseases that we examine throughout

34
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,440
the semester. Uh, first
one is these questions,

35
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,780
by the way,
are not canonical.

36
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,100
I don't mean that you shouldn't be asking
other questions as well and indeed I

37
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:30,000
hope you will,

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,060
but I think we should know at least the
answers to these 10 questions and then

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,470
build on not as a foundation.

40
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,450
A first major question for any of the
diseases we're talking about was what's

41
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:49,281
the total mortality and morbidity that's
caused by the epidemic and question the

42
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:55,800
mortality, the total numbers
of deaths, morbidity,

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,750
the total number of cases.

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,960
That's an important factor that needs
to be kept in taken into account and

45
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:06,850
assessing the impact of the epidemic.

46
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,140
A second question has to do with the term
we introduced long ago a phrase which

47
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,850
was the case fatality rate

48
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,800
and the related question with that is,

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,920
is there an effective therapy or means
of prevention or instead business society

50
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:33,961
experience the disease and feeling itself
to be helpless and physicians feeling

51
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,294
the same.

52
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,030
The case fatality rate is,

53
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,560
we could call it the
kill rate of a disease.

54
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,280
The percentage of cases
that terminate and death.

55
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,180
And we know that for example,
in dealing with plague,

56
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,300
one of the features of it and Asiatic
collar as well was a very high case

57
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:06,430
fatality rate of plague,
50 to 80% cholera,

58
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,350
something like 50%.

59
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,250
At the other extreme when we come to it,

60
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,430
we'll see that influenza has a very high
morbidity but quite a low case fatality

61
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,164
rate.

62
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,350
And that's related I think to the impact
that that disease influenza has on

63
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:31,900
society which isn't
associated with such um,

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,130
uh, terror as say, plague or cholera.

65
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:40,750
That's an important variable down
is the kill rate of the disease.

66
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,850
Another factor,

67
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:47,851
a third question we need to ask is
what's the nature of the symptoms of the

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,940
Infectious Disease in question?

69
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,570
Are they particularly painful?

70
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,280
Are they degrading according
to the norms of the time?

71
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,340
And we've seen for example,

72
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:08,200
in dealing with plague and cholera that
a major feature about them was not,

73
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:11,800
their symptoms were
agonizing and dehumanizing.

74
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,630
Clearly as we turn to syphilis,
um,

75
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,290
it's symptoms also,
uh,

76
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,320
were extremely important in the way
that the disease was experienced.

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,810
Tuberculosis on the other hand,

78
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,840
and we'll be looking at that was seen
at the time to make it suffers more

79
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,150
intelligent,
more romantic,

80
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,550
more beautiful in some sense,

81
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,510
at least in the first half of
the 19th century. So that, uh,

82
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,210
what is the nature of the symptoms
is a crucially important question.

83
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,120
Another fourth question that I hope
you'll bear in mind throughout the course

84
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,360
and in your review for the
exercise this week is the question,

85
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,870
is this disease new

86
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,580
or is it familiar to the population?

87
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,190
Familiar diseases tend
not to be so terrifying.

88
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,150
The population is also likely to have
some degree of immunity to the disease,

89
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,160
and the disease is likely,

90
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,210
or my have already mutated
to become less deadly.

91
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,760
Examples are the so called diseases
of childhood like chicken pox,

92
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:35,930
mumps and measles,
normally relatively mild,

93
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,390
but in populations to which they're newly
introduced, they can be devastating.

94
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,550
A fifth question has to do with the,

95
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,150
what's the profile of the
victims of the disease?

96
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,150
Is this a disease that's an affliction
of the young and the elderly

97
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,650
that is experienced as a more normal
course of a disease in accord with

98
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:08,651
society's expectations and past experience
or does it instead striked down,

99
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:14,771
particularly those who are in the
prime of life thereby no longer seeming

100
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:20,981
natural but as something extraordinary
and the experience of the population.

101
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,630
And it also means that the disease
is likely to maximize its um,

102
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:30,990
fine.

103
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,990
It's economic and financial impact
to be particularly destabilizing to a

104
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,594
community.

105
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,820
Cholera in this regard for example,

106
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,850
was terrifying because of the way in
which it seemed to afflict the those who

107
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:55,181
were the bulwarks of
families and of communities.

108
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,660
A six question, that's important. Uh,

109
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,740
what's the class profile of the sufferers?
How,

110
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:11,741
what sorts of people in society
are stricken with the affliction?

111
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Is this a disease of poverty such as
cholera is usually thought of or is it an

112
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:26,201
affliction that strikes everyone without
particular reference to class or social

113
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:34,361
and economic status like influenza or um,

114
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,241
syphilis?

115
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:40,241
Indeed a seventh important question is
what is the mode of transmission of the

116
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:48,200
disease?
Is it transmitted person to person?

117
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,460
Is it transmitted by contaminated
food and water are involved?

118
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,700
Is it spread through the air by droplets?

119
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,270
Is it spread by sexual contact?

120
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,350
And clearly I think will be arguing
that the mode of transmission is really

121
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:14,460
crucial and in sexually
transmitted diseases.

122
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,580
I think that that is going fairly self
evident and a very important factor in

123
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:23,430
the social impact of those diseases.

124
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,930
And eighth important question is whether
the disease is full minute and it's

125
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:37,011
course or is it slow acting
and a wasting disease.

126
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,630
If we look, for example, at cholera,

127
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,430
one of the features and
in a striking one is not,

128
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:50,610
it was a one of the most
full minute of diseases.

129
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:55,611
It would strike down the sufferer and
will you could board a train and die

130
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,030
before you reached your destination as
the disease ran its course that quickly

131
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,270
through the human body or on the other
hand is the disease one that takes years,

132
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,550
perhaps even decades to run its course.
Um,

133
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,940
and an example of that of course would
be tuberculosis or HIV AIDS in our own

134
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,464
time.

135
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,820
And ninth important question we need
always to bear in mind is how was the

136
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:34,791
disease understood by the
population that it's infecting?

137
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,870
Is it a Pacino as a punishment of God?

138
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Is it later on thought to be something
that comes from the dangerous classes or

139
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:53,190
later on is understood to
be a microbial infection?

140
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,340
And those ways in which the disease or
understood is understood have enormous

141
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:03,510
impact on how the population
reacts to the disease.

142
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,820
A 10th and a variable is what's
the duration of the epidemic.

143
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,310
Influenza,
for example,

144
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,390
passes through a locality
in a matter of weeks.

145
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,960
Normally cholera or plague tend to
have epidemics that last for months and

146
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,240
tuberculosis,

147
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:35,241
one might describe as an
epidemic in slow motion that,

148
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,071
uh,

149
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:40,890
afflicts a community for
a whole century or more.

150
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,910
So those are 10 major questions that
I hope that you'll be bearing in mind

151
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,390
throughout the course.

152
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,480
I think they'll help you in dealing
with the diseases in a comparative and

153
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:59,041
finding out and teasing out why some
diseases have an impact of one kind and

154
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:02,020
others are very different.

155
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,580
Well this morning I'd like to go through
some of this material again in a review

156
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:15,820
manner by looking at syphilis.
Uh,

157
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,610
why syphilis at this stage of the course,

158
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,270
I think that it provides background for
no magic bullet and it also helps us to

159
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:32,770
look at some of the material that we've
already covered and that you'll be

160
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,860
writing about in the next few days.

161
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,300
Well first let's deal then
with the chronology and this
helps us to step back in

162
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:48,331
time from the 19th century
to go back indeed to uh,

163
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,590
the plague years.

164
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,270
Syphilis in fact was contemporary
and its onset with plug

165
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,950
and like plague it the time it was a
new disease that first struck Europe in

166
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:09,760
this case in the late 1490s.

167
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,560
And we'll see that there's an important
Darwinian evolution that takes place,

168
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,070
which is to say that the syphilis of
the 15th and 16th centuries is quite

169
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,860
different from syphilis thereafter.

170
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Syphilis and its first century or so
was what we might call the great pox a

171
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:41,791
disease that was much more
severe than modern syphilis.

172
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,800
So syphilis clearly begins as a
dreadful epidemic that swept Europe.

173
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,220
And then the world after the 16th century,

174
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,460
it's still a very serious illness,

175
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,040
but it's much milder,

176
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,370
less fatal unless agonizing.

177
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,540
So today is the,

178
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,070
we're going to deal primarily
with the early syphilis,

179
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,860
the syphilis of the great pops.

180
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,190
Now the mode of transmission,

181
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,530
it's clearly important and
we need to examine, uh,

182
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,780
what are the particular features of Stds
of sexually transmitted diseases among

183
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,330
the venereal diseases
to use an older term,

184
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:39,930
syphilis was king from the 15th Century
until the late 21st 20th when there was

185
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:46,300
the appearance of a much
more threatening competitor,

186
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,890
Hiv aids

187
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,480
and more in more recent times after
World War Two and the introduction of the

188
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,130
era of antibiotics,

189
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,540
particularly penicillin and sex education,

190
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,340
there's been a radical decline
in the incidents of syphilis.

191
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,340
And for a time there were even heady
hopes that it could be eradicated all

192
00:15:12,341 --> 00:15:15,650
together, but more, most recently,

193
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:18,860
unfortunately it's made
something of a comeback.

194
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,380
Now keep in mind too,

195
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,390
that historically the STDs
weren't carefully distinguish
one from another until

196
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:33,200
late in the 19th century.
Other significant STDs,

197
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,320
gonorrhea and Shanker in particular
weren't known to be separate diseases.

198
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,660
There were thought to be simply
milder manifestations of syphilis.

199
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,583
So there was,

200
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,120
we might say a unicity theory
of the venereal diseases.

201
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:54,650
There was thought to be one disease,
no,

202
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,950
uh,
reason for dealing with syphilis.

203
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,951
Now at this point in the course is that
it had a significant impact on medical

204
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:08,440
science in ways that we've
already touched upon. Uh,

205
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,240
with regard to bubonic plague.

206
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,300
That is to say like plague syphilis
seemed clearly to be contagious

207
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,510
and it was understood from the
beginning to be spread somehow.

208
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,660
No one quite knew how
through sexual contact.

209
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,980
And so like plague syphilis challenged
the reigning orthodoxy of humor realism

210
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,670
and gave rise through someone
we've already met. And we'll,

211
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,500
we can look at it again in a
moment, uh, through Geraldo Muff,

212
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:48,620
Rocco Storto and particular
to the doctrine of contagion.

213
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,730
And it generated also the idea that
disease might be a specific entity.

214
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:01,870
Syphilis was clearly something distinctive
and many people regarded it as a

215
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:06,490
disease on its own rather than us.

216
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,710
Any example of humoral imbalance.

217
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:16,450
So syphilis had an impact on medical
science and influenced as along with plug

218
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,300
the, uh, if we like the,

219
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:28,301
I began to make humeral doctrine
less stable at its foundations.

220
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,590
Well where does syphilis come from?
What are its origins in here?

221
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:37,310
Or there's a major debate,
uh,

222
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:42,311
that has not been resolved and
it continues down to this day.

223
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,680
I'll put forward a couple of candidates.
Uh,

224
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,820
and I think it's more important to know
these different origins theories of the

225
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:57,321
origins of sinfulness because they
have a big impact on how the disease is

226
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:03,201
experienced rather than expecting us to
resolve the issue of where the disease

227
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,090
came from.
In fact,

228
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,110
let's note how people
thought the disease appeared.

229
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,770
A first theory was the one
associated with Christopher Columbus.

230
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,700
This is the Americanist idea
of the origins of syphilis.

231
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,570
And we've talked already about the,
um,

232
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,440
Colombian exchange.
So I just wanted to review that again.

233
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,290
That's Columbus's first trip.

234
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,130
And this is the idea of the Colombian
exchange of what was transmitted from the

235
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:48,320
old world to the new, the
old world contributing, uh,

236
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,040
various foodstuffs like coffee,
beans and rice, livestock,

237
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:57,450
cows and various diseases as
you already know, smallpox,

238
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,030
measles and so on. And the new world, uh,

239
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,700
being the source for Europeans of corn,
potatoes,

240
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,960
um, and so on. Certain
precious metals, tobacco.

241
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,840
And there is the idea that uh,

242
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,870
the Americanists so-called argued that
it was Columbus and his crew who brought

243
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:23,460
back syphilis from the new world.

244
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,150
This idea held that syphilis was endemic
in the new world spread to Columbus's

245
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,900
sailors and was reported
to Europe on their return.

246
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,031
The problem,

247
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:41,031
of course for the theory is that there
isn't in fact any definitive evidence

248
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,580
that syphilis did exist in the new world
at the time or the Columbus sale or

249
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:51,930
Columbus has sailors were actually
infected in the manner required by the

250
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:52,764
theory.

251
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,490
So the evidence in supportive
this is entirely circumstantial.

252
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,940
The chronology works.
That's one factor.

253
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,570
And another is that there isn't in fact
in the medical literature before this

254
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:14,541
time a disease like syphilis anywhere
in Europe and more recently Paleo

255
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:22,221
pathologists haven't unearthed evidence
of syphilis and European cemeteries.

256
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,070
It clearly seems to be a disease
that was a new or blood is used an

257
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,480
anachronistic term,

258
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:35,630
an emerging disease in the 1490s and
because of Eurocentrism and perhaps

259
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:44,280
xenophobia, there was a
preference to blame. The other,

260
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:49,310
a second idea that,
uh,

261
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,190
was very popular was not syphilis.

262
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Instead of being a of American or new
world origins was of Spanish or African

263
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:05,250
origin.
This theory held the,

264
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:10,251
perhaps the disease was present in Europe
for a long time but had been confined

265
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,070
to a small corner of the
continent perhaps and one can see,

266
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,950
um,
certain sinister views here,

267
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:25,550
confined perhaps to Jews or Moore's
in Spain and unnoticed my outsiders.

268
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,190
Then with the expulsion
of the Jews and the 1490s,

269
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,210
the disease was
disseminated across Europe.

270
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,080
No.
Among those who propounded this view,

271
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,050
there was clearly a current of racism,

272
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,530
Anti Semitism and xenophobia.

273
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,540
Syphilis was supposed to have
been endemic among the Jews.

274
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,750
Having come perhaps earlier from Africa
and was prevalent in those populations,

275
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,260
uh,

276
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,060
because their sex in some way
was unnatural and out of control.

277
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,320
So syphilis was confined
in Europe to Spain.

278
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,350
This theory argues until the expulsion
of the Jews in 1492 when they unleashed

279
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:20,400
there contagion on the rest of Europe.
And any case,

280
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,460
what's really clear is that absolutely
no one wanted to acknowledge syphilis as

281
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:31,701
his or her own four Italian
syphilis was somebody else's.

282
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,990
It was the French disease for the French,

283
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:39,660
it was the Neapolitan disease.

284
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,100
For Russians it was the Polish disease.

285
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,020
And for every one that was
the great parks or the KLOPP.

286
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,910
Now how do we get the term syphilis?
Where does that come from?

287
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,320
The word itself was coined by the Italian
physician whom you've already met for

288
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,730
our custodial who did something
extraordinary in 1531 which was not,

289
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,470
he wrote a work called syphilis.
Um,

290
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,480
and here was Flocka storto
whose face you've seen again?

291
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,030
No, this work was odd in our
unusual, in a number of respects.

292
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:29,270
It was a poem written in
Latin and modeled on Virgil.

293
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,920
And as I think about it,

294
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,010
I can't think at the moment of another
poem about an epidemic disease.

295
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:42,420
It was also an instant success.

296
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,270
It rapidly went through lots of
additions and established for our costs.

297
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,350
Dorros fame even more than
is more scientific works.

298
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,800
It also offered,

299
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,070
what I think we could say was a clearly
moralizing judgmental analysis of this

300
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,480
disease as a scourge of God.

301
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,120
You know the drill by now and in the poem,

302
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,240
the first victim of the disease was a
shepherd who's name was syphilis and the

303
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:23,981
shepherd had offended the gods by turning
against them and worshiping a king as

304
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,790
a deity.
So in their anger,

305
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,350
the gods afflicted syphilis
with this terrible POCs.

306
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,400
So we can see that built into it from
the beginning was the idea that syphilis

307
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,250
was best understood as the wages of sin.

308
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,170
And there's a further polemical
thrust that's not made explicit,

309
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,360
but as a subtle undertow in the poem.

310
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,570
Remember the poem was written in the 1530s
in the midst of a religious CISM with

311
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:05,090
Martin Luther,
a devout adherent of orthodoxy.

312
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:10,340
That is Daca Storto was
and of the Catholic Church.

313
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:15,610
He was a physician to bishops
archbishops and cardinals and syphilis,

314
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,000
as I've said,
was a shepherd and in Latin,

315
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,910
the word for shepherd
is pastor Pasa stored.

316
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,620
So the men who was punished was a pastor,

317
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,580
not a priest that is
possibly a Protestant leader.

318
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,030
So there's a slight
hint here that syphilis,

319
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:40,031
the disease as a divine
punishment for the reformation.

320
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,410
So Flocka Storto didn't adhere
to the Americanist position.

321
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:52,130
Then there's perhaps modern,
a third more modern idea.

322
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,550
Our hypothesis is that
perhaps the causative agent
of syphilis are emerged in a

323
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:06,180
Darwinian manner. The spiral
[inaudible] or triple noma Apollo,

324
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:11,181
Adam arose perhaps as a mutation of some
preexisting Trepanier hymns that are

325
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:18,581
morphologically very similar under
the microscope and perhaps it was,

326
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,550
it emerged as a,

327
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:26,840
an evolution from the
Trepanier that causes yours.

328
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,390
In any case,

329
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,860
it was clear that whatever
the sight of its origin,

330
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,580
its spread across your with terrifying
rapidity and one can see the role of

331
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:46,121
warfare in particular in promoting the
movement of syphilis and it's spread

332
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:48,661
across.

333
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:53,580
Europe was closely associated
with Charles the eighth of France,

334
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,440
known as Charles the affable,

335
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,960
who lived from 1470 to 98 and
launched a series of wars with Italy,

336
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,570
which he invaded in 1494
at the head of a large,

337
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,130
large army.

338
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,720
The army marched across the Italian
peninsula and reach Naples that Charles

339
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:21,450
besieged and captured.

340
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,800
He then found himself facing a powerful
coalition of powers that have ultimately

341
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:33,780
defeated him and after
his forced withdrawal.

342
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,910
The point is that his army disbanded,
and this was a large army,

343
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:44,030
a mercenary force of tens of thousands
of men from various nationalities,

344
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,830
and a feature of war is that it's
always a providential time for epidemic

345
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:57,501
disease and sexually transmitted diseases.

346
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,310
In particular,

347
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,000
the army of Charles the
eighth was poorly disciplined.

348
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,310
It indulged and pillage,
plunder and rape,

349
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,630
and it had its numerous camp
followers of beggars and prostitutes.

350
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,650
So among the troops and those
who consorted with them,

351
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:27,310
the disease flared up and after
they're disbanding and mobilization,

352
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,680
it was disseminated across the continent.

353
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,550
Between 1495 and 1520 something frightful
happened as the epidemic swept Europe

354
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,500
from Naples to Moscow. To Oslo, Madrid,

355
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,860
London,
and every place in between.

356
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,190
So this is the origin of syphilis.

357
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,700
However it arose,
whether it was an imported,

358
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,200
whether it was a newly emerging disease,
uh,

359
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,120
perhaps a mutation from yours,
from a disease already present in Europe,

360
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,240
it was clearly spread by this favorable
opportunity of warfare and the army of

361
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:16,390
Charles the eighth.
Well,

362
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:21,391
what's the etiology and
symptomatology of syphilis?

363
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,990
And here,
this is the causative agent,

364
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,790
the Treponema Pallidum or sparky.

365
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,570
This the trip.

366
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:39,571
And Nema [inaudible] has a special
feature in that it's exquisitely

367
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,760
and fragile and it requires very
precise conditions in order to live.

368
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:56,250
It cannot survive outside of bodily
fluids and the warmth of the human body.

369
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,300
And therefore it can only be
transmitted by intimate contact.

370
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,221
Indeed,

371
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:11,221
the spire acute is so delicate that
it can hardly be cultivated in vitro.

372
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:18,010
And that's one of the reasons that the
development of a vaccine has proved so

373
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:20,500
difficult.
Well,

374
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:25,501
there's an initial incubation period
with syphilis and we'll talk about three

375
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:29,300
stages in,
uh,

376
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:32,560
it's impact on the individual human body.

377
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,650
The first stage,
and we're talking now about the great pox.

378
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,520
This early stage in the
history of syphilis.

379
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,640
The first stage lasted a month or two
and was marked by a painful and alarming

380
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:56,671
Shanker at the site of entry of
the spiral keyed into the body.

381
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:04,170
But this Shanker heals spontaneously just
like lesions in chicken pox or herpes,

382
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,490
but that doesn't mean that the
patient has cured, is cured,

383
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,670
the disease insect persists,

384
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,780
but for a time without
generating symptoms.

385
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,220
Then there's the onset of the second stage
of syphilis between 45 days after the

386
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:33,310
disappearance of the Shanker and a year.

387
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,490
There are numerous symptoms,
but in the second stage of sinfulness,

388
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,060
only the superficial tissues of the
skin are affected with rash and Boyle's.

389
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Now it was this second stage of syphilis
that was of extraordinary severity.

390
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,150
During the era of the great pox,
it was painful,

391
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:03,100
disfiguring, incapacitating,
and often fatal.

392
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:09,420
There were sowers and swellings all over
the body from the soles of the foot to

393
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:14,701
the crown of the head leaving
disfiguring scabs and pockmarks worse.

394
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,410
The disease was described as
attacking the whole of the body.

395
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,430
It was said to eat it away and consume it.

396
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:29,610
The body stank and the
surfers were afflicted in an
addition with fever and pain

397
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:34,150
in their joints.
So intense.

398
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:39,151
One contemporary wrote that the victims
screamed day and night envying the very

399
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:41,534
dead.

400
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:47,950
Let's listen to [inaudible] himself who
described the great parks like this.

401
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,990
He wrote,

402
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,350
remember he was a physician as well
as a poet and the majority of cases,

403
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,560
small ulcers began to
appear on the sexual organs.

404
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,900
They were intractable and
would not depart. Next,

405
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:12,230
the skin broke out within
crusted postulates.

406
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,040
They soon grew little by little
until they were the size of an Acorn,

407
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,510
which they in fact resembled.

408
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Then these ulcerated puzzles ate away
the skin and sometimes infected not only

409
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:31,610
the fleshy parts,
but the very bones as well.

410
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,100
In cases where the malady
was firmly established and
the upper parts of the body,

411
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,940
the patients suffered from pernicious
Qatar that eroded the pallet or the

412
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:48,200
pharynx and tonsils and
some cases the lips,

413
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:52,280
the nose and eyes were
eaten away or in others,

414
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,790
the whole of the sexual organs.
Moreover,

415
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,850
many patients suffered from the great
deformity or Goomada that developed

416
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,380
besides all of the above symptoms
as if they were not bad enough.

417
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,260
Violent pains,
attack the muscles.

418
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,930
These pains were persistent,

419
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,170
tormented the sufferer chiefly at night.

420
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,920
And we're the most cruel
of all the symptoms.

421
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:25,520
There is a theory that may be even the
disease was too virulent for its own

422
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,660
good, that his symptoms were
so debilitating as to prevent,

423
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:31,940
suffers from transmitting it.

424
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,810
And so the modern disease evolved during
the 16th and 17th centuries as a milder

425
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:44,830
form of the great parks. I'll
show you a couple of, um,

426
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,850
images of extreme forms of modern syphilis
that sad to give us some idea of what

427
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:57,510
the great pox was like.
Uh,

428
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,330
they're rather of course
unpleasant slides. So I would
tell you that in advance,

429
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:06,920
but this will give you some idea of
how terrible the great parks was.

430
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,110
Um, it looked like that, or indeed,

431
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,970
uh, like that. So we'll move on.

432
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,260
Uh,
then there's third stage syphilis,

433
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,750
tertiary syphilis,

434
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,380
and in this phase do you have involvement
of the deep tissues and it's symptoms

435
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:36,860
are things such as what's
called Tabius door solace,

436
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:42,110
which is a degeneration of the neurons
in the spinal cord and leads therefore to

437
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:48,150
lack of coordination to a stumbling gate,

438
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,590
um,
and symptoms of that kind to Ataxia,

439
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,380
which means the stumbling gate.

440
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,800
It also leads in this phase
to cardiovascular disease
to often to insanity and

441
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:09,000
dementia to general
paralysis and to death.

442
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,300
So tertiary syphilis can
be the cause of death.

443
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,420
Well, what we're, if that's
what the disease looked like,

444
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:21,390
what were some of its effects on society?

445
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,070
Well,
because of its mode of transmission,

446
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:31,610
syphilis was associated with
terrible social effects with anxiety,

447
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,060
guilt,
pain,

448
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,370
broken relationships,

449
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,030
breakdowns and trust within families,

450
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,190
infertility among women
and like the plague.

451
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,510
And unlike some of the diseases
that we'll be studying,

452
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,600
syphilis was no respecter of
persons of social class or status.

453
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,830
We might,
uh,

454
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,910
perhaps are chronically call it a
democratic disease and that it afflicted

455
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:11,580
everyone from the bottom
of the social scale.

456
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,200
Touristic crowds learned professionals,
kings,

457
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:20,610
cardinals, bishops.
Occasionally even popes, um,

458
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:25,260
such as Julius the second
who was also a syphilitic.

459
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,020
So accordingly,

460
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:33,021
one might argue syphilis caused
a great strain on society,

461
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,470
but not along the uh,

462
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,480
Fisher's running between
classes as did for example,

463
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:44,070
Asiatic cholera.

464
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:50,750
It was also unlike plug and then it was
not terrifyingly swift and it's obvious.

465
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:56,430
Association with sex meant
that the demeans to avoid it,

466
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:57,390
we're clear.

467
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,780
And so there was no generalized
terror of the kind that accompanied a,

468
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:08,280
say,
bluebonnet plague or Asiatic cholera.

469
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,540
Everyone knew how
syphilis could be avoided.

470
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,550
What were the effects on then?

471
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,400
One was a new asceticism.

472
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,300
There was a suspicion of pleasures
and the Protestant world,

473
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,430
an epidemic of syphilis was
perfectly timed not to create.

474
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:37,431
And here I don't want to be saying that
epidemic diseases created puritanism I'm

475
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:44,641
would argue instead simply thought
this is a disease that reinforced it.

476
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,840
Asceticism indeed had long been
present in European culture,

477
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,090
but syphilis helped make it more
popular and a widely held sentiment.

478
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,850
And the Catholic world,

479
00:38:57,851 --> 00:39:02,851
one can see a new piety as well in the
Catholic reformation in Janssen aneurysm

480
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,960
for example.

481
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,980
Another impact clearly was in terms
of tensions between the sexes.

482
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,050
Now this is familiar to you.

483
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,320
We're going back over
old ground in our course.

484
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:22,910
Remember paintings that we saw earlier
of the Garden of Eden and original sin,

485
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,880
Adam drawn into evil bias helpmate eve,

486
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,760
the original [inaudible].
Well,

487
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,790
the passage of syphilis was marked by a
sinister under stone toe of misogyny in

488
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:43,690
a patriarchal society,
male fears, anxieties,

489
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,160
and indeed guilt.

490
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,460
We're projected onto women who were seen
as the crucial agents and the spread of

491
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:52,780
this disease.

492
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:57,781
Two men and two groups of women were
particularly suspect prostitutes first and

493
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:05,230
here was a prime example of
a new male double standard.

494
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:11,070
The passage of syphilis was marked by
harsh police measures against prostitutes,

495
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:17,430
including the closing of brothels and
the rounding up an exile of people from

496
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:18,910
communities.

497
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:24,990
There was also a hunt for scape
goats and witch hunts are,

498
00:40:25,151 --> 00:40:26,200
we're part of that.

499
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,910
Another feature was a new religious cult.

500
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,770
The cult in particular of a new saint.
Um,

501
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,730
and this is rather unique,
which is there's only,

502
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:41,200
as far as I know,

503
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:44,920
one saint who wasn't a Christian.

504
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,180
And this is job from the book
of job in the Old Testament

505
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,740
Joep ah,

506
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,470
however was actually
said in the book of job.

507
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,540
He had especially a and
especially convincing, um,

508
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:09,570
defense attorney and that was God himself
because God says in the book of job

509
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,710
that this is the most just of all men.

510
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,190
He's the best and most innocent
and yet to try his faith,

511
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,510
he was scourged by Satan.

512
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:27,630
And this is the painting
by William Blake of uh,

513
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:32,730
this scourging of a job by Satan
who's pouring out Boyle's ah,

514
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:39,350
that will soon torment
him from head to foot.

515
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:44,830
And the description of the disease that
afflicted job in the book of job is

516
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:50,171
highly suggestive of what we might
call a venereal disease or STD.

517
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:56,770
He was covered from head to foot and
boils and yet Jobe was reassuringly free

518
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:02,780
from sin. We know that because
God told, tells us so. And so,

519
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:06,440
Joe became the patron
saint of syphilis six.

520
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
There was also a public health response
that is to say the building of hospitals

521
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:19,721
for the incurables who were the syphilis
lytics and there was a new philanthropy

522
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,720
and religious orders that
took over their care.

523
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,850
Let's look for a moment at some of
the treatment regimens that were also

524
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,620
important in this disease.
One was, uh, the beginning,

525
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,370
uh,
the again,

526
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,420
the pumice common treatment regimen with
a 40 day period beginning with fasting

527
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,230
and then the administration of Mercury,

528
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,360
which had been used in the treatment
of skin disorders over the centuries,

529
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,370
diseases such as scabies.
So mercury was sometimes applied.

530
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,950
It was applied in lots of different ways.

531
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:02,330
Desperate remedies for
a desperate disease.

532
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,170
Ointments were applied
to the skin lesions.

533
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,160
There was so called general friction in
which applications of mercury were made

534
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,910
to the whole body.

535
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,200
Sometimes it was administered internally,

536
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,850
but as you know,
mercury is extremely toxic.

537
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,780
It causes great salvation of falling out
of the teeth and then serious and often

538
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,300
life threatening symptoms.

539
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,910
But salivation seemed to be the
right approach according to humorless

540
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:38,900
principles.

541
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,980
It would lead to an evacuation
of the pecant humor.

542
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,790
And it also,
and here was a factor.

543
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,860
It seemed to work when applied
to second stage syphilis,

544
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:57,670
perhaps simply because as we've already
seen second stage syphilis goes into

545
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:03,341
spontaneous and often lengthy remission
and it was possible to argue that it was

546
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:05,600
the therapy,

547
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,600
the treatment that had been effective and
perhaps the suffering that accompanied

548
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,440
this particular treatment provided
some moral satisfaction to those who

549
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:18,920
administered it.

550
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,460
Another a remedy that
was tried was Guyana,

551
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,930
which is a hard wood from
a tree in the new world.

552
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,730
It was ground into saw dust and made into
a decoction that patients drank twice

553
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,550
a day for 40 days.

554
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,640
We see these 40 days appearing
over and over in quarantine.

555
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,370
The 40 day fasting,
the regimen for mercury,

556
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,500
the regimen for Guyana will.

557
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,650
All of this of course had
a religious background

558
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,360
and so the Guy App was administered for
40 days during which there was fasting

559
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:04,870
at the same time.
Then so Gaia,

560
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:07,620
chuck and Mercury Worthy,

561
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,770
so we might say the miracle drugs,

562
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:12,720
the wonder drugs of their era.

563
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:17,610
There were other indications
also recommended for syphilis,

564
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:20,430
bloodletting bounce,

565
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,360
purgation cauterization of the Boyles.

566
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,970
Well an important impact.

567
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:31,971
Then the next thing I want to point out
is the impact of syphilis on medical

568
00:45:33,301 --> 00:45:34,320
science.

569
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,460
We already in this gives
us a moment of review.

570
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,360
We know already the traditional approach
to these and other diseases that they

571
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:48,030
were an imbalance of humors.

572
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,160
There was had been no idea of
discreet entities that were diseases,

573
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,120
diseases.

574
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,120
We're an individual matter depending on
the constitution of the patient and the

575
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:03,360
environmental influences
that acted on him or her

576
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,780
and the 19th century.
However,

577
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:11,781
we've seen already that diseases fully
crystallized into forms of specific

578
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:17,331
entities that were actually biological
entities that existed apart from the body

579
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,840
of the individual sufferer will the
period from the 1490s to the 19th century,

580
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,930
the period that embraced both plague and
the great POCs and then modern syphilis

581
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,050
mark and error of transition,

582
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,400
and I would argue that syphilis was
something that propelled this transition

583
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:42,234
forward.

584
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:48,510
Remember how traditional medicine as
taught at universities and practice by the

585
00:46:48,511 --> 00:46:53,511
elite physicians was that the truth
about disease was to read the classics.

586
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,680
Hippocrates and Galen supplemented
later in the Middle Ages by astrology.

587
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,710
So for humor list physicians.

588
00:47:04,711 --> 00:47:09,711
Then that was the way it was proceeded
on when fuzzy when syphilis for struck,

589
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:15,050
there were disputations in which people
sought the truth of the disease by

590
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:20,580
looking through into the [inaudible]
or what Galen had written.

591
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:24,280
And so there were disputes,
uh,

592
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,010
disputations that were formerly
held, um, through library.

593
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:35,190
The challenge of syphilis was that it
was a pandemic that was difficult to

594
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:40,180
explain within the traditional
framework of humor realism.

595
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:46,510
At the same time, the disease had
no real place in the classics,

596
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,531
humor,

597
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:52,531
realism was static and had no way
of accommodating emerging diseases.

598
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,100
So what do you do with the disease
that was unknown to the ancients?

599
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,130
Syphilis was also clearly contagious.
Everyone could see that.

600
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,980
And so there was obviously some more
biphasic substance that passed from one

601
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:13,900
body to another. The disease, in other
words, seem to be something specific.

602
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,320
And this helped to promote also the
idea of a new concept of disease and

603
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,831
syphilis tried physicians
because it really was an
incurable disease at the time

604
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:32,970
and until the late 20th century didn't
respond to the classical recommendations

605
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,020
for therapy.

606
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:40,350
All of this made it a major
challenge to humorless orthodoxy.

607
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,000
And with that, I would
say we've reviewed, um,

608
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:51,300
this period of syphilis and plague that
presented a major impact on society and

609
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,340
a major impact on medical science.

610
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,930
And we've run out of time this
morning and next time, uh,

611
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:03,850
having had our review session,

612
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:09,130
we'll come back to the 19th
century and deal with the debate,

613
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,730
the huge medical debate between,
um,

614
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,440
contagiousness and anti contagiousness.
