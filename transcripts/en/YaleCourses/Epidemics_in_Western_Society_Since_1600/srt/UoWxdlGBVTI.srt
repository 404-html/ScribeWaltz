1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,990
And the first thing I want to say is
that there's a thesis to the course that,

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,760
um, you don't have to share, but that
I'd like to test for the next, uh,

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,790
12 or 13 weeks and not thesis is that
infectious diseases are too important to

4
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:23,430
leave solely to the doctors.
Epidemics,

5
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,330
in other words,

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,570
have had an impact on history that
I would regard as equal to that of

7
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:34,110
revolutions,
wars and economic crises.

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,950
They are part of the big picture of
historical change and not some exotic

9
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,450
special interest.

10
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,850
Epidemic diseases have had an
enormous impact on religion,

11
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,170
on the arms,
on the colonial expansion,

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,080
on the establishment of new world slavery,

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
on the rise of modern medicine and
on strategies of public health.

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,320
To examine this thesis,

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,500
we won't be looking at all diseases.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,400
We'll be looking only at a subset of
high impact infectious diseases that have

17
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,740
affected Europe and North America.

18
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,650
So this means certain exclusions.

19
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,690
We won't be looking at chronic
diseases such as cancer,

20
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,860
heart disease, diabetes, asthma, obesity.

21
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,550
We won't be examining
occupational diseases such as
miner's lung or asbestosis.

22
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,010
We'll eliminate also a whole range of
tropical diseases that haven't had a major

23
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:49,491
impact on the industrial west such as
Dang gay or sleeping sickness or chagas

24
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,450
disease.

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,900
All of these and other diseases I would
agree entirely aren't important and

26
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:58,380
worthy of study,

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,070
but it would take far more than a semester
to examine the mall and lumping all

28
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:09,561
diseases together would lose
all coherence epidemic diseases.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,930
That is our high impact.

30
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:17,931
Infectious diseases make sense
intellectually as a separate category of

31
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,950
analysis.

32
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,580
That is to say they were and still are
experienced differently from chronic

33
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:30,930
disease and give rise to
distinctive fears and anxiety.

34
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,720
As you can see on your own day.

35
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,260
Having heart disease can be frightening
and an even a lethal experience,

36
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,780
but it's qualitatively distinct
from being diagnosed with HIV AIDS

37
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,870
or up to the middle of our century with
syphilis or being stricken with Asiatic

38
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:52,704
cholera.

39
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,310
Cardiovascular disease with can have
massive impact but it doesn't give rise to

40
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:02,950
escape Gooding to mass hysteria,

41
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,570
to outbursts of religiosity to
works of literature and art.

42
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,170
So epidemic diseases are distinctive and
have left a particular legacy in their

43
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:17,140
way.
And since our interest is in history,

44
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,230
we need to know that throughout human
history until the 20th century and still

45
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,930
today and the 20th first
century in the developing world,

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,080
infectious diseases have been the most
important cause of suffering and death.

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,840
Infectious diseases today are the
leading cause worldwide of death.

48
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,230
And one of the jobs of our force is to
give an explanation of why that song.

49
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,270
Furthermore,

50
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,420
we've had a number of recent
scares from new diseases like SARS,

51
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,220
avian flu,
swine flu.

52
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,190
We're living in the midst of a global,
uh,

53
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:02,230
experience with the persistence of HIV,
AIDS,

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,810
tuberculosis,
malaria.

55
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,620
And these events remind us that epidemics
is still major threats even in the

56
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:14,050
industrial world.
Indeed,

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,080
how we deal with them may be an important
factor and whether and how we survive

58
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,130
as a species.

59
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,680
So the course will raise the question
of how prepared we are today.

60
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,350
What are our major defenses
against microbial disasters?

61
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,610
How did they evolve,
how robust are they,

62
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,650
and what are the most important
sources of vulnerability today?

63
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,870
Well. Then let's think about
geography of our course.

64
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,530
Our focus will be primarily on York and
North America and I wish to say entirely

65
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:59,320
for reasons of manageability
and you'll be grateful because,

66
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,130
um,

67
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,080
if we attempted to include the whole of
the world throughout the period and all

68
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,430
tropical diseases,

69
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,050
you'd have a reading list that would be
four or five times as long as the one

70
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:11,884
you have.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,810
But I would also say that we,

72
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,110
when we come to the 20th and 21st century
and deal with such global pandemics is

73
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:26,920
HIV, aids, malaria and tuberculosis.

74
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,430
We will look quickly a
little further a field,

75
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,730
it would be perverse to discuss HIV
aids without paying attention to Africa,

76
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,270
which has its place of origin,
its epicenter,

77
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,390
and the place where the disease is
causing almost an unimaginable burdens of

78
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:48,980
suffering and loss.
We're in escapable,

79
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:53,981
he part of a global world in which
microbes refused to recognize political

80
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:56,920
borders and we have to take that into,

81
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,020
so that's the geography focusing
on Europe and North America,

82
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,190
but branching out for the very
modern part of the course.

83
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,590
Chronology. Uh, when,
what period do we cover?

84
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,810
Well really we look at the
centuries from 1600 to the present.

85
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,950
We'll start with everyone's idea of the
worst case scenario in terms of epidemic

86
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:25,431
disease.

87
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:30,431
And by that I mean boob onic plague and
we'll end with the current situation and

88
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,700
the latest threats to
have emerged like SARS,

89
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,720
avian flu and swine flu.
As a student,

90
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,780
I always felt disappointed when history
classes on the modern period didn't come

91
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,080
right up today.

92
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,100
So I feel a motivation
to bring us up to uh,

93
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,570
the newspapers today.
In fact,

94
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,190
one of the goals of the class is to help
to equip ourselves with the critical

95
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:03,191
tools we need to confront today's
events in a more informed and productive

96
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,250
manner.
And since I've mentioned influenza,

97
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,530
we'll certainly ask in passing.

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,310
And I hope some of you will answer the
question why it is that the most Penn

99
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,430
threatening pandemic afflictions of
the 21st century seem to be respiratory

100
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,560
diseases.
Why is that?

101
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,210
How did that come to bout then I want
to talk with you for a couple of minutes

102
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,950
about the diseases that we'll be
examining. I've told you so far,

103
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,850
the ones we mostly won't be looking at.
Well first,

104
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:38,000
what are the criteria by
which I've chosen them?

105
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,110
First I'm going to be looking at epidemic
diseases that had the greatest social,

106
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,060
scientific and cultural effects.

107
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,960
We'll call them high
impact infectious diseases.

108
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,310
That's the first criteria,
their impact. Second,

109
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,930
I'll be looking at diseases that have
had the most important role in the

110
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:03,440
development of public health
strategies to consent them.

111
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,070
A major concern throughout the course
is the variety of efforts that societies

112
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:12,710
have made to prevent,
contain,

113
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,920
cure and eradicate infectious diseases
are courses not only about disease but

114
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,130
also about public health.

115
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:27,790
And so we'll give that a privileged
place to that and to those diseases that

116
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:34,181
stimulated various styles of organized
and effective societal responses.

117
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,411
Uh,

118
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:41,300
next criterion is that we're going to
look at those diseases that were the most

119
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:45,440
feared killers of each of the
centuries that we'll study.

120
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,990
We'll also want a very
diet and in other words,

121
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:53,180
diversity.
And to that end,

122
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,090
some of our diseases will be some viral,

123
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,080
some parasitic,
some will be transmitted sexually,

124
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,660
some through the air,
others through food.

125
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,660
And Water and some are carried by insects
and by these criteria will focus in

126
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:15,030
particular on bubonic plague,
on Asiatic cholera,

127
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,470
smallpox, syphilis, tuberculosis,

128
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,640
polio,

129
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,730
HIV AIDS and yellow fever with
influenza bringing us right up to date,

130
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,270
so those are the diseases we'll
be concentrating on. Well,

131
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:36,300
how do we deal with them?
What's our strategy?

132
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,330
What's our way forward and I want to
stress that this is not a biology course,

133
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,500
but a history course.

134
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,580
Epidemic diseases are biological
events and we'll need to have some

135
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:53,910
understanding of what they are,
where they come from,

136
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,930
how they were transmitted,
how they affect the human body.

137
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,730
It would be inconceivable to study the
history of medicine without coming to

138
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:07,410
terms with the medical and
biological aspects of disease.

139
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,400
Indeed,

140
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,400
one of our goals will be to examine
major changes and medical thinking and

141
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:14,850
philosophy,

142
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,460
but the biology will be throughout in
the background and the exams and the

143
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:25,461
papers will not test you specifically
on that aspect of the course.

144
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,190
Our concern will be with the
impact of disease on society,

145
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,910
religion and culture,

146
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,490
but we want to do a lot more than
examine a series of gas leak,

147
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,260
biological invaders,

148
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,180
although we will do that and so the
course will stress a number of longterm

149
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,160
themes. The first of those I've already
told you about and that's public health

150
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:54,390
strategies.
We'll look at vaccination as a strategy,

151
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,450
quarantine and sanitary cordons,

152
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
urban cleanups and sanitary movements,

153
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,530
Santa Turia as for tuberculosis,

154
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,330
magic bullets like Quinine,
penicillin, antibiotics,

155
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,730
and we'll also look at an unfortunate
public health policy by which I mean

156
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:19,731
concealment to hide the presence of
disease as China did during SARS,

157
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,120
but following a long precedent in which
other governments have a history of

158
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:30,000
adopting similar policies and
we'll be looking at that too.

159
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,700
Then we'll be looking at intellectual
history, epidemic diseases.

160
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:36,600
In other words,

161
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,430
had a leading role in the development
of the modern biomedical paradigm of

162
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:46,431
disease with the germ theory and such
disciplines is tropical medicine and

163
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,730
infectious diseases.
And I'll want to argue,

164
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:55,420
or at least we'll be testing the
idea that perhaps medical ideas,

165
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,600
one of their aspects is that their
ideologies held not only for scientific

166
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,220
reasons,
although that's true,

167
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,490
but also because of the kinds of societies
they promote or the power they convey

168
00:12:09,371 --> 00:12:13,360
to nations or strategically
placed elites within them.

169
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,820
That will be a question
we'll be examining.

170
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,590
Then we'll be looking at ethical issues.
Uh,

171
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,600
what are the ethics if
human experimentation and
we'll be looking at some

172
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,820
horrific failures and ethical standards
and in particular we'll examine the

173
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,560
Tuskegee syphilis study.

174
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,940
We'll also be looking and thinking about
diseases as a tool for the historian as

175
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:41,890
a means of casting,

176
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,920
revealing light on how societies are
constructed on the relations if human

177
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:53,341
beings to one another on
the moral priorities of
statesmen and religious leaders

178
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,910
on the relationship of human
beings with their environment.

179
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,410
By which I mean both the natural
environment and the built environment,

180
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,650
the cities in particular
in which they live.

181
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,870
So responses to epidemic
diseases will be important to us.

182
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:15,160
How do people respond?
And we'll be looking at stigmatization,

183
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,220
witch hunting and scapegoating at flight
and mass hysteria at up surges and rela

184
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:27,880
jaw city at changes in
art and in philosophy

185
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,160
the course.

186
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,160
We'll also try to provide
some understanding of a
number of major concepts and

187
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:41,800
terminology and public health.
By the end of the class,

188
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:45,730
you should be fluent in
using words like etiology,

189
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:48,190
case fatality rate,
no zoology,

190
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,050
and you should know the difference between
incidence and prevalence between an

191
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:57,700
epidemic and a pandemic between
inoculation and vaccination.

192
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,320
And then another theme will
be an assessment, as I said,

193
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:05,740
of where we stand today
and the 21st century.

194
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,460
What have we learned as a society from
the experience of the past four centuries

195
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,370
of recurring and dreadful epidemics
in 1969 the US surgeon general,

196
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,300
how to premature surge of optimism and
the age of antibiotics and he declared as

197
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:26,674
he put it,

198
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:31,740
we've turned the page on infectious
disease and medical schools and the public

199
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:34,840
health community talk,

200
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:39,820
but it would be possible to eradicate
one epidemic disease after another like

201
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:42,880
smallpox or polio as models.

202
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,420
But our surgeon general turned out to
be spectacularly wrong today in 2010

203
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,400
infectious diseases or the number
one cause of death worldwide.

204
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:01,390
And it's also clear that it
will be impossible to write
the history of the 20th

205
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:06,731
and 21st century without giving you a
central place at the very least to HIV,

206
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:12,830
aids and to other pandemics as well.
Furthermore,

207
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:17,831
we know too that there's a whole hearse
host of emerging diseases of Bola,

208
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,930
Lassa fever, West Nile
virus, SARS, avian flu aids,

209
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,960
and of course swine flu and familiar
diseases have reemerged and resistant and

210
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:36,281
threatening manners such as drug resistant
tuberculosis or malaria and other

211
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,940
diseases as well.

212
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,600
So the threat has been made clear and
dress rehearsals we've had in our new

213
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,750
century SARS, avian flu, and as we speak,

214
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,780
swine flu and indeed the nature of modern
society may make us more vulnerable

215
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:59,630
rather than less to such.

216
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:04,630
Threats will want to think about some
of the factors that may make that true

217
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,370
such as a high and ever growing world.

218
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:12,371
Population density as we rapidly reach
a figure of 7 billion people before very

219
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:18,770
long rapid movements of
population by rail road,

220
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:21,110
cruise ship,
but above all the airplane,

221
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,220
rapid and chaotic urbanization with the
appearance of evermore mega cities with

222
00:16:28,011 --> 00:16:32,560
populations in excess of 10
million people, places like Tokyo,

223
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,760
Mexico City, Lagos, Delhi,
Mumbai, New York, Jacarda,

224
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,920
whiteness,
Iris and others.

225
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,670
These many of them conjure
up images of overcrowding,

226
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,560
of poverty,
substandard housing,

227
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,640
inadequate access to healthcare,
extensive illiteracy,

228
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,960
open sewers.

229
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,620
Then there's the perennial problem of
warfare and the terrible dislocations that

230
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:04,910
wars leave in their wig,
displaced people, refugee camps,

231
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,300
the collapse of health
systems and sanitation,

232
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,580
extensive poverty and
widening social inequalities,

233
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
climatic change and
environmental devastation and
the failure to provide such

234
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:25,271
basics as safe and adequate water supplies
for untold millions of people in the

235
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:27,530
developing world.

236
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,220
Unfortunately not one of those factors
seems likely to abate and then your

237
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:38,330
future and some of them are
gathering momentum as we speak.

238
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:39,861
Well,

239
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:44,861
it's possible and reasonable even to
ask that the way whether it is true that

240
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:50,681
the way we handle epidemic diseases
will be crucial to our survival as a

241
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:53,370
society.
In addition,

242
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:57,540
I would argue that it's important
to examine these diseases,

243
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,720
the ones that have been most prevalent
as they hold up a mirror to ourselves.

244
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,740
I would argue that every s diseases and
epidemic disease in particular aren't.

245
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:16,131
These are not random events that every
society has its own specific types of

246
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:22,560
affliction and to study them is to
learn about it's living conditions.

247
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,630
It's more a priorities and
relationships for all of these reasons.

248
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:32,340
We could argue that epidemic diseases
are great bearers of meaning,

249
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,700
and our job is to decipher the meaning
embedded in them as contemporaries

250
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:42,450
experienced them and to
understand them retrospectively.

251
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,030
Well then that brings us to our first
couple of weeks and where we go next.

252
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:48,991
Well,

253
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:53,991
on Wednesday we'll roll up our sleeves
and get down to work looking at the

254
00:18:55,051 --> 00:19:00,051
meanings that Europeans gave to epidemic
diseases when they first stroke a

255
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,450
continent and as they were seeing
through the lens of the reigning medical

256
00:19:05,641 --> 00:19:06,474
doctrine.

257
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,870
That is the humoral lessem philosophy
developed by Hippocrates and Galen at the

258
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:17,970
time of plague in the 17th century,
humoral ism,

259
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,190
which was the first embodiment of what
we might call scientific medicine,

260
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,700
was still the dominant medical paradigm
for disease as it had been for nearly

261
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:30,150
two millennia.

262
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,670
And so our first task will be to examine
a topic and intellectual history of

263
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:36,504
medicine,

264
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:41,310
a topic that will help us to understand
how the first epidemic disease that

265
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:46,311
we're going to study bubonic plague was
understood how it was experienced by

266
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:50,400
physicians, statesmen,
and educated layman.

267
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,950
And we'll also be in a position then
to understand that epidemic diseases

268
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,100
fundamentally challenged humoral
notions and help to lead toward major

269
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:06,411
intellectual paradigm shift that
we'll discuss later in the semester.

270
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,861
So our course,

271
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:12,240
then we'll begin with the legacy of
two of the most influential doctors,

272
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:15,090
whoever lived both Greeks,

273
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,570
Hippocrates from the fifth century BC
and Galen from the second century of the

274
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:22,290
common era.

275
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Looking at their philosophy of medicine
will give us a framework to understand

276
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:33,450
the ways in which the experience
of a plague was a tremendous shock.

277
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Most obviously it was a shock
in terms of death and suffering,

278
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,200
but it was also a shock because it
undermined the foundations of medical and

279
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,980
intellectual understandings of disease.

280
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,760
The passage of bubonic plague through
European society was not only a biological

281
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:58,780
and material event,
but also a major intellectual,

282
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,210
religious and psychological one.

283
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,900
So having done that next week,

284
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,620
what we'll do is turn to
bluebonnet plague itself.

285
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,500
Now the plague is, everyone's
counted for the worst case scenario.

286
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,760
A plank is synonymous with terror.

287
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:24,300
One reason was that it was
an extraordinarily rapid
and excruciating killer with

288
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:30,871
symptoms that were dehumanizing and
agonizing with no effective therapy and to

289
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:37,210
kill rate that ensured that the
majority of its suffers perished.

290
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,090
It was also readily transmissible so
that it seemed poised at various times to

291
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:49,711
destroy the whole population of Europe
and it did kill an enormous proportion of

292
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:54,910
the population up to half
and major European cities.

293
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,570
So here was the origin of a terrifying
cliche about plug that it struck down so

294
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:06,280
many that there weren't enough
people left to bury the dead.

295
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,470
So what will we do next week?
What we'll look at symptoms of plague,

296
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,520
it's horrifying effects on
the individual human body.

297
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,390
We'll look at its devastating impact on
society and at the responses of whole

298
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:26,290
populations to the time of plague,
mass flight,

299
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,270
scapegoating, social disorder,
up surges and religion,

300
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,350
new cults of Saints,
new iconographies in the arts,

301
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,140
but there's more to it than not.

302
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,560
The plague led also to the first
successful strategies of public health to

303
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:49,471
combat pestilence strategies that were
often draconian and direct proportion to

304
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,990
the magnitude of the threat.

305
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,800
These strategies included as we'll see
boards of health with almost unlimited

306
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:03,430
powers during the emergency quarantine,

307
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:08,550
military lines and naval blockade to
isolate cities or even whole countries.

308
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,390
And we'll have see pest houses to confine
an isolate the sick and dying and as a

309
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:21,070
guide to our experience,
we have this book,

310
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,390
which is Daniel Defoe's
journal of a plague gear,

311
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,580
which is the first reading assignment.

312
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:32,200
And I want to talk about it for a minute
because some of you may want to start

313
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:36,430
reading it straight away.
I'm not too good as a salesman,

314
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,930
but I do think it's appropriate
to make a plug for great books.

315
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,210
And in this case of default,

316
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,390
I want to introduce one the classics
of a whole genre of what you'll become

317
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:50,900
familiar with as plague literature.

318
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,740
Defoe's masterpiece is a powerful
description by a contemporary and fact,

319
00:23:57,801 --> 00:24:02,801
a survivor of the most dreadful outbreak
of boob plague and the history of the

320
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,670
British isles.

321
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,180
The catastrophic visitation
of 1665 plagues had returned
in successive waves in

322
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:18,041
European history ever since the first
visitation of 1347 but one of the terrible

323
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:23,810
features about it is that over the
centuries it didn't become milder.

324
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,440
And some of its last visitations where
the most violent and horrendous of all,

325
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:35,170
including the epidemic that ravage London
in 1665 now a possible issue for some

326
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,650
may be overcoming the barrier of language.

327
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:47,540
So I want to throw out a challenge.
The book I will admit,

328
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,300
can start out a bit
slowly for some of you.

329
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:56,110
So I want you to think not so much at the
outset as you open it up as to whether

330
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,100
you immediately enjoy it on
though I hoping that you will.

331
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,820
But I want you to think instead
about why it's so important.

332
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,430
I'd like you to think about what you
can learn from being in the company of

333
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:15,230
someone who had the experience of living
through the worst of all public health

334
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:20,231
calamities and to ask yourselves why
this book has been read avidly for 400

335
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:22,934
years.

336
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,960
It may interest you also to know that
during the SARS outbreak in Toronto in

337
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:34,331
2003 thousands of people were quarantined
in their homes and that the top of

338
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:41,621
their list of books that they read to
pass the time and make sense of their

339
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:46,430
experience was this one to foes
journal of the plague gear.

340
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,031
Well,

341
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:52,031
history after all is in part about sharing
a common culture and common memories

342
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,770
and reading this book.

343
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:59,771
Then there's certainly part of that and
if you think of it in those ways with

344
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:04,460
those questions in mind, I think,
and this is my secret agenda,

345
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,930
you'll really enjoy it.

346
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I also think that you'll find it's
a wonderful account of how a society

347
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:17,201
responded to one of the greatest of all
challenges to recounts the flight of the

348
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:23,480
King and other authorities from
London in fear for their lives.

349
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,200
He tells us about religious enthusiasm,

350
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,300
about how people understood the
catastrophe they were experiencing,

351
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,560
what it meant to them.

352
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,160
He tells us about the hunt that was on
for witches and scapegoats and culprits.

353
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,700
He talks about plague induced crime,

354
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,070
the helplessness of physicians,

355
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:52,550
about popular culture and desperate
attempts of people to save themselves.

356
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:58,670
And then about the extreme measures of
shutting people up in their homes by

357
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:03,741
government authorities or taking
them away by force to past houses.

358
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,980
And since this is a comparative course,
Oh,

359
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:12,981
hope that you'll begin to reflect on how
far we've changed and progressed from

360
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:20,010
the time that differ road. And I'll
draw your attention, for example,

361
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,160
to the early years of the
HIV aids epidemic and we'll
think together about some

362
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:31,140
possibly very troubling similarities.
In fact,

363
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:36,141
one of the constants in the centuries
since the plague itself and the West has

364
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:41,421
been a tendency in times of public health
crises to resort to plague measures of

365
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,590
self defense.

366
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,370
We'll see that very dramatically and
the 19th century and the time of cholera

367
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,740
when the desperate attempt was made to
stop Asiatic cholera with measures that

368
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,760
had worked against plague.

369
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,460
But turned out to be
entirely counterproductive.

370
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,460
And we'll see it again in the
early years of the AIDS pandemic.

371
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,660
And in that case too,
with haunting consequences.

372
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,350
So now you know where we'll begin on
Wednesday with medical science and its

373
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:21,351
first but long lasting embodiment and
the way that Europeans experience play

374
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,770
through the lens of humoral theory.

375
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,590
And then next week we'll deal with the
most devastating epidemic to strike the

376
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:36,030
western world, bubonic
plague. And in Daniel Defoe,

377
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,840
you have a really good guide to
accompany you on your journey.

378
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,820
So I'll see you next time.
