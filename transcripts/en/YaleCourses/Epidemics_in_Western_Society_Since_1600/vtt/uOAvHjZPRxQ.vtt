1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.110
Well as,
um,

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.280
what we'll do this morning is to start right now and we'll be dealing today with

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:14.691
an the beginnings of our first major epidemic and the course we'll be talking

4
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:20.601
about bubonic plague this time we'll have an overview of boob [inaudible] plague

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.030
and its passage through Western society.

6
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.540
And then the next two classes we'll look at specific features of Boob,

7
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:38.631
onic plug next time a community responses to the plight and the time after that,

8
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.840
the impact on society and in particular on European culture.

9
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.030
So that's where we're headed.
And this morning we'll have a sort of overview.

10
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.830
No,

11
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.830
one of the reasons for dealing first with the flag is that it's very important

12
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.120
as part of testing the theme of our course,

13
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.280
the theme being one of the themes that epidemic diseases aren't just

14
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:11.970
interchangeable causes of illness and death,

15
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.630
that each one has its own particular history that's determined by a number of

16
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.310
variables that we'll be looking at,

17
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.340
such as variance the nature of the symptoms of the disease and a number of

18
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.184
others.

19
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.960
And we'll be testing the theory to that.

20
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.230
Epidemic Diseases are major determinants of historical change.

21
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.500
And have major impacts on society will plug in a sense set the standard by which

22
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:49.830
all other epidemics are judged.
The Plagge was,

23
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:54.831
we might call it the worst case scenario and we'll see that in later centuries

24
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.810
when society's experienced some new and unfamiliar disease,

25
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.080
they waited anxiously to see if those diseases would be similar in their impact

26
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.970
and especially terrible diseases like cholera and the 19th century and influenza

27
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.120
just after the first world war were said to be the return of the plague.

28
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.920
Tuberculosis,

29
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.750
the great pillar of the 19th century was known also as the white plague.

30
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.120
Now,
what were some of the distinctive features of bubonic plague?

31
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.620
Uh,
first thing stands out is it's extreme virulence.

32
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.800
Now that's one of the first words that we may want to define as we move on.

33
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.521
By that,

34
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:49.521
I mean it's capacity to cause harm and symptoms and the human body.

35
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.620
It's a measurement of the ability of a pathogen to cause disease we'll plug and

36
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.760
not was highly very alert.

37
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.760
It also struck rapidly.

38
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.300
It caused excruciating and degrading symptoms and it achieved a case fatality

39
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.910
rate.
Another technical term,

40
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.940
which simply means the kill rate that a disease achieved and the case of

41
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:22.951
bluebonnet plague at normally killed 50 to 70% of the patients that infected

42
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.580
arrayed attained by few other diseases.

43
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.650
It's course in the human body was also terrifyingly swift.

44
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.160
Normally it killed within about three days of the first appearance of symptoms.

45
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.780
Another feature that was characteristic of Boob OnDeck plague was the profile of

46
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:47.950
its victims.

47
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.840
I mean not both in terms of their age and their social class.

48
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.770
Familiar and DEMEC childhood diseases in a society tend to strike primarily

49
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.770
children and the elderly that if you like,

50
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.800
would be the normal experience of society with infectious diseases.

51
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.330
But the plague was different.

52
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.960
It struck men and women in the prime of life and this fact among others made

53
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:25.621
plagues seem like an unnatural or might we say supernatural event.

54
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.240
It also magnified the economic and social dislocations that cause.

55
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.210
In other words,
Plagge left and it's wig vast numbers of orphans,

56
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:41.740
widows and destitute families.
Furthermore,

57
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.040
the plague,
unlike most epidemic diseases,

58
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.040
did not show a predilection for the poor.

59
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.740
It struck universally,

60
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.950
again magnifying the sense that this was the final day of reckoning,

61
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.150
a divine visitation.

62
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.470
Another feature of plague we'll be looking at is terror as a response to it.

63
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.520
All of the things that we'll be saying about plague magnified the responses of

64
00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:14.200
the societies that were afflicted.

65
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.350
Plague was associated with mass hysteria with terror,

66
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.260
with violence,
with religious revivals.

67
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.410
As people sought to assuage the divine wrath was associated with scapegoating

68
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:34.231
and witch hunts for the guilty people in society responsible for the disaster.

69
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.660
Perhaps those were the sinful,

70
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.500
for those who saw the disease as divine retribution or it could be for a search

71
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:50.221
for the homicidal agents of some human conspiracy for the demonic interpretation

72
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:56.770
of disease.
Those might be foreigners,
witches,
Jews,

73
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:58.040
or poisoners.

74
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.970
Then the plague was important because it generated a major societal response.

75
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.770
The development of the first forms of public health

76
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.590
in part because of its very,
very painless.

77
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.800
The plague inspired the first and most extreme form of public health policy to

78
00:06:20.921 --> 00:06:25.921
protect populations and contain the spread of this trendous and terrible

79
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:29.500
disease,
plague public health.

80
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.050
And we'll see this more next time.

81
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.440
Involved a military style policy carried out by the army and the navy.

82
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.710
It involved maritime and land based quarantines sanitary coordinance,

83
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.230
which are military.
I lines isolating a population.

84
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.280
It gave rise to past houses or lots to ref toes and to new health authorities

85
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.550
variously called over the centuries health magistrates or boards of health

86
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.600
equipped with extraordinary powers to enforce the plague measures.

87
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.050
And some places there were erected stocks and scaffolds to remind the population

88
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.230
of the powers of these authorities.

89
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:18.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

90
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.960
<v 0>No early Italian states at the time of the renaissance devoted a special role</v>

91
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.690
deserve,
does special role as the inventors of these public health measures.

92
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.050
This was thrust upon them by their vulnerable position at the geographic center

93
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.420
of trade routes in the Mediterranean.

94
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.320
So we'll see that decisive role in the development of these measures was played

95
00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:51.090
by places like Florence and the great port cities like Genoa,
Naples,

96
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.013
Venice,

97
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.200
<v 1>okay.</v>

98
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.110
<v 0>Later centuries we'll see another pattern.</v>

99
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:01.350
When a new mysterious and frightful disease strikes say cholera,

100
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.080
yellow fever or aids.

101
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.770
One of the first responses of authorities is to return to play egg measures of

102
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:13.510
self defense.

103
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.880
It's set of generals that they always try to fight the last war over again,

104
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:24.070
often confronting new enemies with inappropriate strategies.

105
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.550
The same might be sad of public health authorities over the centuries and this

106
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:34.681
temptation is all the greater for authorities because the battery of anti plague

107
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:39.901
defenses gives an impression of taking forceful and decisive action providing

108
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:44.920
the population.
In other words with some sense of security.

109
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.290
A third feature of the plague is it's enormous impact on society.

110
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.590
As we've said,

111
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.620
infectious are not narrow specialized interests.

112
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:05.340
There are often part of the big picture as essential for understanding a society

113
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:10.860
in its history as studying war,
religion,
economics,

114
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.950
high politics and culture and not trying to make a case for disease determinism

115
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.570
and I'm not what you might want to call a microbial Marxist.

116
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.290
My argument instead,

117
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.350
it's simply that certain diseases do have a transforming effect on society.

118
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.210
Plague being one of them.

119
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:38.450
Certain others do not even great killers such as polio or influence them.

120
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.520
We're going to examine why this major difference,

121
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.610
why some diseases have a much more lasting footprint than others,

122
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:55.910
but bubonic plague was a disease that affected every aspect of society.

123
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.580
It transformed the demography of Europe,

124
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.880
recurring cycles of plague with an epidemic.

125
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.910
Every generation constituted a major break on population between the 14th

126
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:14.181
century and the 18th it had a devastating effect on economic life and economic

127
00:10:15.841 --> 00:10:16.674
growth.

128
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.350
It also had a major impact on religion and popular culture.

129
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.450
It gave rise to a new piety to cults of plagues,

130
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:28.080
Saints to passion.

131
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:33.081
Place plague leapt to an outpouring of sermons and religious pamphlets with a

132
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:38.490
central theme being what we might call theodicy.

133
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:43.580
That is how do you justify God's ways towards men adjust and loving God could be

134
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:50.640
angry and punish sinners who turned from him and disobeyed.

135
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:56.270
But how were priests and ministers to explain the gruesome suffering and death

136
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.360
of innocence and in particular of children?

137
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.070
So thus also we see another undertow.

138
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:06.840
We talked about piety.

139
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.020
I would argue that plague also led sometimes to its opposite the terrifying

140
00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:16.530
conclusion,
but how could there be a good god?

141
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.040
Because a loving and all powerful being would not take the lives of half the

142
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:26.430
population of a great city indiscriminately killing men,

143
00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:27.600
women and children.

144
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.040
So for some the result wasn't an active atheism,

145
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.370
but in mute despair that was not articulated a psychological impact that with

146
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:43.410
historical hindsight,
we might even call post traumatic stress.

147
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:49.730
So plague how to major psychological impact on the relationship of human beings

148
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:54.370
to their mortality and to their God.

149
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.540
Plague had a major impact on the arts and culture and literature we'll be

150
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:03.700
seeing.
And in fact,
you're starting to see,

151
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:08.701
I hope already by reading defoe that there's a whole genre of plague literature,

152
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
including not only defoe but names like Boccaccio commune Manzoni of whom more

153
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:20.410
later it affected European painting profoundly.

154
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.850
And we'll be looking at that.

155
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It affected architecture with large numbers of churches dedicated to the

156
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:29.710
redeemer and the plague.
Saints,

157
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.280
it led to sculpture and plague columns appeared throughout Vianna and the

158
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:40.060
Austrian cities.
We have our,
even in modern times,

159
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.130
the film that I hope you'll be seeing,

160
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:47.190
the seventh seal by Bergman plague also had a major impact intellectually on the

161
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:51.970
medical paradigm of disease.

162
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:57.670
Plague profoundly tested the humeral framework of disease.

163
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.640
And we can see this in a man I mentioned in the last lecture,
Jude,

164
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:04.960
all of them are Frauca steroidal,

165
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.480
who developed a theory of contagion aneurysm.

166
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.830
Now the humeral idea,

167
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:16.980
and Hippocrates had recognized the difficulty that epidemics pose for humoral

168
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:19.330
theory.

169
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:24.330
How is it possible to account for vast numbers of people experiencing the same

170
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:30.510
humeral imbalance at precisely the same time?
Well.

171
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.520
Frauca Storto took that idea and he eliminated the mediation of the humors

172
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:43.410
suggesting and said that the disease was caused by a poisonous chemical

173
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.800
transmitted in a way he didn't understand from one person to another,

174
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.770
but less let's not think of Frauca Storto as a modern medical scientist.

175
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.830
He thought that plug was caused not by a living entity but by a chemical.

176
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.100
Well,
that's the background.

177
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:11.101
Then let's remember the history of three pandemics of Gubernick Plagge that

178
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:17.080
afflicted the west.
Now first,

179
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:22.081
maybe we should define what we mean an outbreak at what's talk about three terms

180
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.230
and outbreaks and epidemic and a pandemic and outbreak is a small surge in

181
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.760
morbidity and mortality in a locality,

182
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.120
so we might talk of an outbreak of influenza in new haven.

183
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:45.630
An epidemic is a much bigger surge over a larger area and depend on that is when

184
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.480
an epidemic goes transnational becomes an international phenomenon affecting

185
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.960
pull continents or occasionally going global.

186
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.000
Now the plague struck the west in three pandemic waves.

187
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:10.001
We'll be talking about the history then of three pandemics of bubonic plague and

188
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:15.140
each pandemic as a subset if we like,

189
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.920
had a series of recurring visitations that might even last for centuries and in

190
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:27.680
addition to being cyclical and nonsense plague,

191
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.840
how to pronounce seasonality,

192
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:35.470
an epidemic of bubonic plague usually began in the spring or summer months and

193
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:38.780
faded away with the coming of winter,

194
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.730
especially favorable.
We're months that were both hot and wet.

195
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.110
The explanation for that is we'll see,
wasn't a humoral one,

196
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.170
but that provides an ideal environment for fleas which are decisive in plague

197
00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.160
and their need for warmth and humidity for their eggs to hatch and they become

198
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.150
inactive and called or very dry climate.

199
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.530
The first pandemic one was that that lasted for two centuries after five 41 a d

200
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.510
and it's called the plague of Justinian.

201
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:23.470
It was the first appearance of bluebonnet plague as a major player in world

202
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:29.351
history and there are estimates that it flooded Africa,

203
00:16:29.451 --> 00:16:32.210
Asia,
and Europe with people are guessing,

204
00:16:32.211 --> 00:16:37.211
but there are figures bandied about of perhaps 100 million victims.

205
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.060
There are fewer accounts or records that are survivors.

206
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.430
And there's some debate about whether this so called plague of Justinian was

207
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:50.420
even bubonic plague at all,
or whether it was some other disease.

208
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.130
But as we speak,

209
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.160
Paleo pathologists or work exhuming bodies from ancient cemeteries in order to

210
00:16:58.431 --> 00:17:03.431
find conclusive DNA evidence to support affirmed diagnosis.

211
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.920
And the latest news is that they're pretty certain that it was bubonic plague.

212
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:15.070
The second pandemic occurred from the 1330s in the Middle East until the 1830s.

213
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.900
So we have what's thought,
um,

214
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.540
five centuries of bubonic plague.

215
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.980
In the second pandemic,
it began with what was called the black death.

216
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:36.310
This erupted in Central Asia and the 1330s and first invaded Europe in 1347 and

217
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:43.760
the early years from 1347 into the 1350s,

218
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.370
we're usually called the black death,

219
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.640
which referred to the first wave of the second pandemic after which it's usually

220
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:57.900
referred to simply as boop,
onic,
plague,
plague or pestilence.

221
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.640
It may well,
and this is the common theory,

222
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.920
have arrived to board agenda.

223
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.040
We smirch didn't ship that sailed from the Black Sea and the summer of 1347 in

224
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:13.320
any case,

225
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.330
Italy was the first land to be invaded by the disease.
Again,

226
00:18:18.331 --> 00:18:19.164
as I say,

227
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:23.970
not by chance because Italy was at the center of the trade routes of the

228
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:28.971
Mediterranean and therefore it was always at this time permanently at risk.

229
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.900
About a third of the population of Europe is estimated to have perished and

230
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.280
after the 1350s after the black death,

231
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.610
the plague returned more or less once in a generation for a number of centuries

232
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.850
with some famous local epidemics.

233
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.450
Let me just remember some of the worst cases,

234
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:59.870
Florence and 1348 when the disease killed half the population and that's

235
00:19:00.961 --> 00:19:05.961
portrayed vividly in Bo conscious to Cameron 15 seven 76 to seven belong 1630

236
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:16.350
again Milan and there are two major plague works of literature,

237
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:21.330
Monzo novel,
the patrol and his work,
the column of Infamy,

238
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.080
1656 in Naples and 1665 and six in London,

239
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.350
which are reading about into foes journal of the plague here.

240
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:37.010
Then for reasons we're going to return to the plague was vanquished in western

241
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:42.471
Europe between the end of the 17th century and the middle of the 18 the last

242
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.090
outbreaks in western Europe of the second pandemic,

243
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:52.830
we're 1720 to 22 at Marsanne France,

244
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.980
the last on the western [inaudible] PN mainland,

245
00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.240
and in 1743 at Messina and Sicily.

246
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.290
Interestingly,

247
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.320
Messina is a convenient and bookend the very first place in western Europe to be

248
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:12.480
afflicted by the plague and also the last during the second pandemic.

249
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:18.030
Now don't make the mistake of assuming that the very elements of the plague

250
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.080
declines over the centuries in many cases,

251
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.140
the last step epidemics of the 17th or 18th century where the most devastating

252
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:28.530
at all of all,

253
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.430
including the experience of London that you're reading about.

254
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.450
Then we come to the third pandemic,

255
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:42.350
which lasted from about 1855 until 1959 more or less when it fades away,

256
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.310
it began in earnest and attracted world attention in China when an Attoc Hong

257
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:59.830
Kong and concern in 1894 and as I said,

258
00:20:59.831 --> 00:21:02.890
it lasted until the middle of the 20th century.

259
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:08.070
Now this pandemic ravaged India and effected five countries,

260
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.670
but mostly not the industrial west.

261
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:18.090
Apart from a brief flareup in April in Naples and 1899 and an also limited

262
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:25.321
outbreak in San Francisco in the early years of the 20th century.

263
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:30.690
That's the topic of Marilyn Chase's work that you'll be reading the Barbara

264
00:21:31.171 --> 00:21:32.004
replug.

265
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.400
It was the steam ship that enabled plague to reach the new world for the first

266
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:41.770
time in the 20th century.

267
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.430
It had limited impact on humans,

268
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.760
but it did establish a sable reservoir of infection among wild rodents and the

269
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:57.271
southwest of the United States where it persists to this very day and causes and

270
00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:02.140
ongoing trickle of cases of Mubarak plague in this country.

271
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.640
The great disaster was India from 1898 to 1908 when she experienced some 13

272
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.270
million deaths from the bubonic plague.

273
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:21.820
Now present day plague,
and I think a number of you may have,

274
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:26.620
the idea that plague is something medieval that doesn't have anything to do with

275
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:28.180
the modern world,

276
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.890
and I want to make it clear that plague is not extinct.
Indeed.

277
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:37.060
I have a friend myself who was a survivor of bubonic plague,

278
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.840
which she contracted in Arizona and the southwest,
uh,

279
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.700
as I said,

280
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:47.760
it continues to cause a trickle of cases every year in the United States because

281
00:22:49.301 --> 00:22:52.960
it persists in the wild animal population

282
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.160
and there are occasional flare ups.

283
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080
So we also need to remember there's a somber background threat then of Boob onic

284
00:23:05.381 --> 00:23:07.180
plague even today,

285
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.570
which is made more vivid by the threat possibly of bluebonnet plague as an

286
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:16.900
instrument of bioterror.

287
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.840
And just to show the sort of modern,

288
00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.380
here's a modern image of the grim reaper,
uh,

289
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.770
as still with us now,

290
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:31.771
our focus here in our class will be instead firmly on the second pandemic and

291
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:38.800
especially its last terrible century in Europe,
the 17th.

292
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:44.920
But let's talk about some of the features of Boob onic plague and we'll begin

293
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.560
with its etiology.
Again,
a bit of jargon.

294
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:53.590
And by that I simply mean the causes or origins of the disease.

295
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.920
And the plague is a disease with a complex history of four protagonists.

296
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.550
First there's the bacterium,
um,

297
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:08.540
and there it is,
uh,

298
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.540
your Sinia pestos sometimes called.
Um,

299
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.750
more in a more old fashioned way.

300
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.900
Pasta relas Pestos it was discovered in Hong Kong by Alexon dairy person,

301
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.660
a Swiss student of Louie poster.

302
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.580
And at the same time by um,
his rival,
the jump in niece,

303
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:29.750
physician,

304
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.380
she busts a Butoh Kitasato a protege instead of Robert comp.

305
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:42.560
So the first protagonists is this bacterium.
You're Senate.
Yup.

306
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:46.580
Pestos and then there are two vectors.

307
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:51.700
The vector is normally another bit of jargon and animal or insect responsible

308
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.370
for conveying a disease to human beings.

309
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.680
And in this case,

310
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:05.710
there are two vectors or carriers that conveyed the disease to human beings,

311
00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.460
fleas and rodents,
especially routes.

312
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.840
And then there's the fourth protagonist,
uh,

313
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.870
you and me by between 1894 and 1898,

314
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.460
you're a person and his colleague,
Paul Louis C mall,

315
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.570
unraveled the complex relationship among routes,

316
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.130
fleas in humans,

317
00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:36.310
that God and the bacterium that governs the epidemiology of Boob onic plague.

318
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.420
Normally the plague began as an infection,

319
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.570
an epidemic among animals and especially wild rodents,

320
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.730
hamsters,
gerbils,
prairie dogs,
chipmunks,

321
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.740
squirrels in their burrows are underground catastrophes unknown to humans to

322
00:25:57.321 --> 00:25:58.154
place.

323
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.730
A particularly important moment was when it inflicted this particular creature

324
00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:07.160
and friend that lives not so distant from us.

325
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.660
Rothfuss rattus the block route or ship rap.

326
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.570
And as you see a extremely cute,

327
00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:17.630
it is unlike his cousin,

328
00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:20.420
the Brown route that took over.

329
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.480
It's ecological niche later on and it's more familiar in modern times.

330
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.700
The black rap was definitely not shy,

331
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.480
but lived in close proximity to pupil with whom they shared the same dietary

332
00:26:35.481 --> 00:26:40.010
preferences.
So the rock was extremely important.

333
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.650
The bacterium was spread.

334
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.680
Then third major character is the flea,

335
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.670
a highly efficient vector for boob onic plague.

336
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:59.810
The flea is naturally parasitic on warm blooded animals in a single feed.

337
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.040
It's sucks up an amount of blood equal to its own weight.

338
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:10.430
I'm talking about something like a billion bacteria at a time and here we're

339
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:15.501
looking at the slide of a flea and gorged with blood after a meal,

340
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:22.080
no once infected.
And here you'll feel sorry for the poor flee.

341
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.530
The flea does not survive the plague either.

342
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:31.280
The bacterium blocks the gut of the flea causing it to starve to death,

343
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.893
poor thing.

344
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.980
But before dying in a frenzy bid to survive the flea feeds repeatedly and in

345
00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:47.181
each bite inoculates perhaps 100,000 bacteria into the bloodstream of its warm

346
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:49.980
blooded victim.

347
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.890
So when a rodent host of fleas Sikkens and dies,

348
00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.520
the fleas leap to the warm body of another mammal that passes within leaping

349
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:03.030
radius.

350
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.570
And the flea also is capable of hibernating for as much as a couple of months

351
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.590
lying in its weight.

352
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:16.730
Now how did human beings come to be involved in this catastrophe?

353
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.500
Well,
it might be at some times that the remote steps were wild.

354
00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:27.120
Rodents lived,
had their ecological systems disrupted,

355
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:32.300
perhaps by floods or droughts that sent animals scurrying over long distances.

356
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.740
And then they encountered other rodents who lived in close proximity to men and

357
00:28:40.651 --> 00:28:43.560
especially our friend,
the black round.

358
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.030
Alternatively,
human beings invaded rodents,

359
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:51.570
habitats exposing themselves to infection,

360
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.100
soldiers perhaps,

361
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.870
or refugees in times of war or hunters and shepherds.

362
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.860
And so the first photo side that is the first low locus is where infection

363
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:07.530
sprang up among human beings.

364
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:13.340
We're the first infected men and women would share their fleas and infection

365
00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.650
with other members of their households,

366
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.040
so the plague would then begin not as a disease,

367
00:29:20.041 --> 00:29:23.820
so much of isolated individuals,
but if households,

368
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.460
housing conditions were important,

369
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:31.730
overcrowding with whole family sleeping in a single bed facilitated the exchange

370
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:39.051
of fleas and there were particular moments that were especially dangerous such

371
00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:45.411
as the laying out and final attentions to the dead as the body hold the fleas

372
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:53.670
infesting it became desperate to escape to the next warm body.

373
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.030
That approach quite possibly you and me.

374
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.860
Then there was the wider spread and this was dependent on networks of trade and

375
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:06.730
commerce.

376
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:12.300
It was not an accident that plague emerged when it did in European history.

377
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:18.150
It's spread over land and the long river valleys by river traffic.

378
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.890
Now,
fleas obviously are severely restricted in their range,

379
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.310
but routes are really wonderful travelers.

380
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:32.380
They hide in the shipments of wheat and are transported over land.

381
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.220
They travel by barge down waterways.

382
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.740
But the garments of victims were all so important because there were recycled

383
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:46.890
non remember how precious an item of clothing was in the early modern world.

384
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:53.260
And so the clothing of dead men and women was packed in crates and sold in

385
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:55.000
markets and fairs,

386
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.990
often with fleas intact among their folds,

387
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:04.130
certain professions.
We're also highly at risk,
uh,

388
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.070
street vendors,
market stall holders,
washer women,

389
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.980
grave diggers,
physicians,
priests,

390
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:18.150
and also millers and bakers because of the dietary preferences of your friend,

391
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:19.990
the black rock.

392
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:26.490
But the disease also went further a field and it did so by sea.

393
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:32.580
And shipping was essential to the spread of the plague over a long distance and

394
00:31:32.861 --> 00:31:35.800
helps to explain its epidemiology.

395
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:41.310
It's tendency and that is to arrive in a country first by striking port cities

396
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:48.090
and only then moving inland by road and river traffic in factored routes would

397
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:54.991
clamor aboard ships by ropes and gangplanks where there could be lifted a board

398
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.810
and create some grain or shipments of clothes.

399
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:05.100
So eastern bull was a great hub of trade in the Middle East and it linked the

400
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:08.710
rest of the Mediterranean world by trade,

401
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.450
overland across the Balkans and by ship to Venice,

402
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.480
Naples,
Genoa,
Marsay,
Valencia.

403
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:22.020
Sometimes there was havoc at sea when a whole crew and its passengers would be

404
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.560
killed by the plaque before they arrived at port.

405
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.710
And there were ghost ships that floated on the Mediterranean once reaching a

406
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:35.500
port.
However,

407
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:41.040
the ship would dock and routes would disembark in crates or by rope or by the

408
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:46.500
gang plank again.
And at the same time,
in fact,

409
00:32:46.501 --> 00:32:50.900
it passengers and crew could go ashore together with their fleas.

410
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.650
Normally the first indication of plague,

411
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.790
one that's dramatically apparent in [inaudible] novel the plug.

412
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.570
But we'll also see in some of the paintings,
uh,

413
00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.530
that we'll look at a time after next.

414
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.760
An important indication was a sudden and massive die off of routes.

415
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:18.190
And there would be pictures like this of rots killed by an epidemic of Boob onic

416
00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:24.110
plague,
in this case,
Sydney,
Australia.

417
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.680
So ports are crucial and epidemics and in the development of public health

418
00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:31.850
measures to counter them.

419
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.330
Almost invariably in western Europe,

420
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.360
the plague arrived in port cities and then spread inland following roads and

421
00:33:41.031 --> 00:33:43.880
rivers in the large cities.

422
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:47.960
The disease typically would arrive in the spring,

423
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:52.040
reach a peak of ferocity after a few weeks,

424
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:57.490
then continue as a violent outbreak for two to four months and then decline with

425
00:33:58.701 --> 00:34:03.701
the coming of cold or dry weather either to disappear entirely or to be

426
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:09.320
rekindled when favorable climatic conditions returned.

427
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.330
Well,
if that's the etiology in a nutshell of the plague,

428
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.260
I'd like to turn now to it's symptomatology in pathology.

429
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.430
That is how does it affect the individual human body

430
00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:29.850
and the study of the symptoms of the epidemics we study isn't just a matter of

431
00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:31.750
ghoulish curiosity.

432
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:37.510
I'm going to argue that the history of each epidemic disease is distinct.

433
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.380
That's one of the reasons that I will be showing slides to fix the image of a

434
00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:47.890
particular disease in your mind because it's important not to confuse them

435
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.840
because each has its own history.

436
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:55.980
Under crucial variable is the differing way in which each of these diseases

437
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.140
effected its victims.

438
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.800
And a feature of the plague I would argue is that it seemed almost purposefully

439
00:35:05.201 --> 00:35:08.050
designed to maximize terror.

440
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.800
I will be showing you some vivid material and I'm sorry that it's just before

441
00:35:14.321 --> 00:35:19.090
lunch and indeed a couple of years ago in this class,

442
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:23.230
someone in the front row fainted,
um,
with some of the pictures.

443
00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:27.680
So if you don't wish to look at them,
I can tell you in advance.
Ah,

444
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.110
it's not compulsory.

445
00:35:29.111 --> 00:35:34.111
You can simply close your eyes and then he case you're Sinia.

446
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.310
Pestos is exceptionally,

447
00:35:36.311 --> 00:35:41.311
very lint because of its ability to overwhelm the immune system of the body

448
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.930
after an infective bite.

449
00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:49.620
There's an incubation period usually of one to six days.

450
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.110
And then the classic symptoms appear.

451
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.153
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

452
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.520
<v 0>the for beginning launching the first stage of a bionic plague.</v>

453
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.160
And that is at the site of the flea bite.

454
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:07.670
There's what's called a carbuncle or gangrenous black blister surrounded by red

455
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.160
pockmarks.

456
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:16.260
And this will be familiar to you because it's been immortalized in the nursery

457
00:36:16.261 --> 00:36:19.230
rhyme.
This is the ring or ring or roses.

458
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:20.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

459
00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.770
<v 0>Know also part along with it,</v>

460
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:28.350
there's high temperature and shivering,
violent headache,

461
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:33.870
nausea and vomiting and general flu like symptoms after which the patient passes

462
00:36:36.161 --> 00:36:39.100
on to the second stage of bubonic plague.

463
00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:40.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

464
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:45.470
<v 0>When it invades the bacteria invade the lymph system and drain into the lymph</v>

465
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:50.720
nodes a couple of days later,
a so called Bobo,

466
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:55.420
the which gives the symptom that gives the disease its name,
the Dizzy Boob,

467
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.860
OnDeck plague,
the plague of boobos appears.

468
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:03.840
This is an infected swelling of the lymph nodes or hard mass,

469
00:37:03.841 --> 00:37:06.810
the size of an orange beneath the skin.

470
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.770
The side of the Buba varies according to the location of the infective bike.

471
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.540
If a fleet bikes,
the legs,

472
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:18.850
the boobos usually in the groin and um,

473
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.940
would look like that.

474
00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:26.610
If the flea instead were to bite the arms,

475
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.400
the boob ball would appear in the armpit or on the neck.
And um,

476
00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.890
there would be symptoms that would look like this or like that.

477
00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.880
In any case,
uh,

478
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:46.910
Daniel Defoe imagined and he writes in our book,

479
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:52.190
but the agony was so violent from the blue ball that victims hurled themselves

480
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:56.010
from roots or into the Thames to escape it.

481
00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:01.460
And there was a general consensus that the body in all of its excretions urine

482
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:05.910
swept the breath,
had an overpowering stench.

483
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.580
This led on,

484
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.640
I want us to remember how dehumanizing the symptoms of plague war,

485
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:19.190
and that's tremendously important to the way that society's experienced it's

486
00:38:19.471 --> 00:38:21.900
outbreak.
In the third stage,

487
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.960
the bacteria release a powerful toxin and this circulates throughout the

488
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.750
bloodstream and it's the toxin that kills it.

489
00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:35.751
Attacks tissues causing blood vessels to hemorrhage and giving rise to propolis

490
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:41.590
subcutaneous spots.
The so called Tokens of Plagge,

491
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:46.710
another bit of jargon to remember the plague is associated with tokens and

492
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:51.820
these,
let's have a look which looked like this.

493
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:57.010
They gained their name because they were thought by many to be the signs.

494
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.800
That is the tokens of God's anger.

495
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.690
The anger that led him to smite his people with the plug.

496
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:11.190
Now the talks and initiates the septic phase of this disease causing rapid

497
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:16.240
degeneration of the muscles of the heart,
of the kidneys,

498
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.030
of the nerves and the central nervous system.

499
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:23.200
And this leads to such symptoms.
His bloodshot eyes,

500
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:28.540
general prostration,
fever,
nausea,
severe headache,

501
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.080
and progressive neurological damage that's manifested by slurred speech,

502
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:41.130
a staggering gate psychic disturbances and arrangement.

503
00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.310
Uh,

504
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:47.310
we again see how this disease is terrifyingly dehumanizing and agonizing,

505
00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.620
and it leads then to delirium and coma.

506
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.260
Sometimes it also causes gangrene of the extremities.

507
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.333
Um,

508
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.790
and I will also have a picture of that and this May in fact be the origin of the

509
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:09.370
term black death.

510
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.660
Now in terms of the symptom ontology,

511
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.300
let me pass on from not to this.

512
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:21.750
This is a Franciscan friar Michael of Piatsa a corner clear.

513
00:40:22.031 --> 00:40:26.860
You'll remember I said Massino was the first place to be afflicted by bubonic

514
00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:28.990
plague in 1347.

515
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.080
He wrote this terrifying description of how it afflicted as SIF software.

516
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.960
He wrote,
not only did the burn blisters appear,

517
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:43.020
but they're developed in different parts of the body gland boils and some one

518
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:48.220
the sexual organs and others.
Oops,

519
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:52.150
sorry.
There we go.

520
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.650
Um,

521
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:58.810
and others on the arms or the neck.
At first,

522
00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:03.220
these were the size of a Hazel nut and developed a company by violence.

523
00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:05.320
Shivering fits that soon.

524
00:41:05.321 --> 00:41:09.790
Render those attacked so weak they could no longer stand upright,

525
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.520
but we're forced to lie in their beds,

526
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:17.380
consumed by violent fever and overcome by great tribulation.

527
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:22.570
Soon the boils grew to the size of a walnut than a hen's egg and they were

528
00:41:22.571 --> 00:41:24.940
exceedingly painful and irritated.

529
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:29.941
The body causing it to vomit blood by vitiating the juices,

530
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:35.600
the blood rose from the effected lungs,
the throat producing on the whole body,

531
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:38.420
uh,
putrefying and decomposing effect.

532
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.250
The sickness lasted three days on the fourth at the latest.

533
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.840
The patients succumbed.

534
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:49.490
So as soon as anyone was seized with headache can shivering.

535
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.760
He knew that he was bound to pass away within the specified time and first

536
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:59.150
confessed his sins to the priest and then made his will.

537
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.900
So death occurred and about half of cases within a few days though some of the

538
00:42:06.591 --> 00:42:11.591
afflicted lingered in agony for as long as three to four weeks and then a

539
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:14.810
minority slowly recovered.

540
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.210
So the symptoms of Gubernick leg are agonizing.

541
00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.110
They're terrifying,

542
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:26.590
dehumanizing as sufferers succumb to elusive nations and delirium.

543
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:33.880
Now there are three forms of bubonic plague and I want to mention what those are

544
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.790
immediately.
These are not three separate diseases.

545
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:42.080
They're one disease in three separate manifestations.

546
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:46.880
The first is what we've been describing as classic bubonic plague,

547
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:50.660
the most common and historically most important form.

548
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.990
Then there's septicemic plague,

549
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:59.020
which is an overwhelming infection in which the patient frequently design dies

550
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.830
even for before developing the Boopa.

551
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.620
But this is I said is not a separate disease,

552
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.980
simply a foreman that form of plague and it's most common among the older

553
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.210
elderly
and then there's pneumonic plague,

554
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.060
which again is the same disease,

555
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.660
but clinically and epidemia logically distinct.

556
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:28.970
It begins with an ordinary case of plague,
complicated by pneumonia,

557
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.720
and can then give rise to a secondary catastrophe within the general disaster.

558
00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.250
That is the disease is then spread by bacteria,

559
00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:45.310
coughed out in the sputum of the victim and spread person to person when inhaled

560
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.820
by those near him or her.

561
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.560
Now this form of flag is not dependent on fleas.

562
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:59.830
It's highly infections and as far as it's known is 100% fatal.

563
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.630
And even today in the antibiotic era,

564
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.990
there's no cure for pneumonic.
Plague and pneumonic.

565
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:13.991
Plague is also recorded in your off true in your favorite nursery rhyme.

566
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:20.690
This is the orange shoe,
Archie,
you,
we all fall down.

567
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:28.070
Now what would the doctors do?
What were treatments historically,

568
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:34.270
there was a continuity of from the black death through the 18th century based on

569
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:40.710
galenic principles of dealing with the disequilibrium of the humors.

570
00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:46.370
So the main indication of treatment was to assist the body and expelling what

571
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:52.521
was called the pecant humor responsible or the more biphasic poison the

572
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.100
physician regarded.

573
00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:00.260
His task is one of assisting nature as the body was already clearly attempting

574
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:04.680
to expel the poison.
After all,
it was vomiting.

575
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.050
There was diarrhea and sweating.

576
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:11.100
So physicians attempted to assist the body in its fight,

577
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.350
perhaps directly by bleeding,
a very popular therapy.

578
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.740
Although there were intense debates about timing,

579
00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.870
about the best veins to be opened and the amount of blood to be drawn.

580
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.900
Other key practices,

581
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:33.260
we're administering powerful purgatives or medics so the poison could pour forth

582
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:38.811
more copiously or to cause the patient to sweat piling him or her high with

583
00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:42.000
clothes,
even mattresses.

584
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:46.890
So the poison would pass out through the pores and forbidding the sufferer to

585
00:45:46.891 --> 00:45:50.350
drink.
And of course,
Lansing or cauterizing,

586
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.020
the Boob oh itself,

587
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.430
so that it too could discharge it's load of poison directly.

588
00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:00.180
Some doctors applied hot compresses.

589
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:04.830
There were also internal medicines that were administered as they were thought

590
00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:09.831
to raise the boobos or to hasten recovery by four to find what was called the

591
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:14.190
flagging animal energy of the victim.
Uh,

592
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:19.020
things like brandy or opium.
But in practice,

593
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:23.580
treatment was pitifully rare for plague sufferers.

594
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.770
Physicians,
priests,

595
00:46:25.771 --> 00:46:29.850
and attendance recognize that they were powerless,

596
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:35.160
that they were too few in number to cope with the catastrophe that engulf them.

597
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.880
And they perish to in great numbers during the outbreaks and many overcome with

598
00:46:42.001 --> 00:46:45.600
carer,
like everyone else simply fled.

599
00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:51.120
So one of the terrorists of the plague was that it broke the common bonds of

600
00:46:51.121 --> 00:46:56.121
humanity and the common plight of plague victims was often to be abandoned to

601
00:46:57.471 --> 00:47:02.400
face agony and death alone.
Let's listen to the famous,

602
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:07.460
an awful testimony of Boccaccio in the Decameron,

603
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:11.610
um,
describing Florence,

604
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:15.583
<v 1>me,</v>

605
00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.830
<v 0>sorry for momentary technological glitch,
but we'll get there.</v>

606
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.700
Here we are.
Uh,

607
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:31.790
this is book concho describing and 1348 let us admit that one citizen fled after

608
00:47:35.201 --> 00:47:40.201
another and one neighbor had not any care of another parent's snore kindred ever

609
00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:45.280
visiting them,
but otherly they were forsaken on all sides.

610
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:50.850
This tribulation pierced into the hearts of men and with such a dreadful terror

611
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:55.720
that one brother four soca nother,
the uncle,
the nephew,

612
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:59.140
the sister of the brother and the wife,
the husband,

613
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:04.960
nay a matter much greater and almost incredible fathers and mothers fled from

614
00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:08.530
their own children even as they know,

615
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:13.590
as if they know way I pertain to them in regard to where of it could not be

616
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:19.090
otherwise.
But that it countless multitude of men and women fell sick,

617
00:48:19.330 --> 00:48:24.330
finding no charity among their friends except a very few and subject to the

618
00:48:25.301 --> 00:48:27.400
avarice of servants.

619
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:33.300
So this is our first overview of [inaudible] and its three pandemics.

620
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:39.060
Next time what I'd like to do is to talk about the response of communities to

621
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:45.001
this catastrophe and to look in particular at public health measures designed to

622
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:49.240
protect communities.
So that's where we're heading next.
