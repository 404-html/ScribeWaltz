WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:01.440
Oh,

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.440
we can get started and this morning will be a slightly different style of

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.404
lecture.

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.810
You'll notice that you don't have handouts and that wasn't an oversight.
Uh,

5
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:15.480
it was actually because you won't need them this morning.

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
What we're going to be doing is something of an experiment,

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.830
which is that it seemed to me that it was useful when you were reading,

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.100
uh,
various historical works.
Dot.

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.350
Sometimes the author of one of them should explain,
uh,

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.620
and discuss with you how they came to be as they are.

11
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.070
So that was one of the reasons that I put my own book,

12
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:43.830
this one on Naples on the reading list.

13
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.070
And I thought this morning I tried the experiment of a different kind of lecture

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.170
where I talked to you about how it came to be the work that it is.

15
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.700
We're moving on now from the material on,

16
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.560
uh,

17
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.560
the power school and on plague and small pox to our next major epidemic disease,

18
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.530
which was the great fear disease of the 19th century,

19
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.010
which was Asiatic cholera,
which hit Europe.

20
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.700
It wasn't an endemic disease.
It hit Europe,
uh,

21
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:25.701
for the first time around 1830 and returned in a series of pandemics in various

22
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.610
waves.
Uh,

23
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.790
and normally the official historiography has it that about the last epidemic in

24
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.760
western Europe was in the 1890s.

25
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.970
Don The statistics of the WHO and the various countries of Europe support and

26
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:54.411
the literature as well support this conclusion that Asiatic cholera after the

27
00:01:55.171 --> 00:02:00.171
1890s were turns again to western Europe only in tiny little outbreaks in,

28
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.030
uh,
the last of which was 1973.

29
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:11.031
So there really isn't supposedly a history of cholera in the 20th century in

30
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:14.514
Europe.

31
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.670
And it's not that I want to challenge and to talk with you about this morning

32
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.460
now as I began and here we can start into how the book came to be,

33
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.900
to exist at all.
I at the time,
well one,

34
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.340
there's this sort of,
as I started doing research on a very different topic,

35
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.670
I had an a sense perhaps been primed for an interest in cholera.

36
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.480
I had been primed because I had lived through and outbreak in Rome in 1973 and I

37
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:57.321
had noticed a number of things that it captured my attention because this was

38
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:01.660
Italy,
this world's industrial power at the time.

39
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.650
And I remember some strange phenomena being in Rome.

40
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:10.651
The epidemic had started and found its epicenter in the city of Naples and cars

41
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.050
had at that time a license plates that bore the province of origin,

42
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.141
uh,

43
00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:26.141
of the vehicle and cars and Rome that had Naples license plates were being

44
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:29.740
stoned by the citizens of Rome.

45
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.130
It was also true that in the fish and vegetable markets near the apartment where

46
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:39.760
I was living,
that uh,

47
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.790
this stalls of the fish and vegetable sellers were attacked and overturned,

48
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.760
uh,
by crowds.
So there,

49
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.860
this seemed something that captured my imagination very clearly.

50
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.710
And then the minister of health went on television and said that you really

51
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:05.311
didn't need to worry because all you had to do was to squeeze because the

52
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.400
Vibrio,

53
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.400
the bacterium that causes Asiatic cholera is highly susceptible to acid.

54
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.250
So all you have to do is squeeze a little lemon juice on your raw muscles and

55
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:21.400
then you'll be,
can quite happily eat them.
Uh,

56
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.180
which I wouldn't advise any of you.
Uh,
in any case,
uh,

57
00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:31.181
it was also true that the prime minister and Minister of health visited Naples

58
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.980
and the infectious diseases hospital there,

59
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.220
and there's an Italian magazine in which pictures of them appeared a,

60
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:46.621
and you could see them almost running down the wards as they were visiting the

61
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:51.760
patients and behind them they had their hands.
Uh,

62
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.500
you can imagine trodding,
uh,
with this gesture,
which is a,

63
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.090
a gesture toward off the evil eye in Italian culture.

64
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.350
So this seemed rather strange in the world's seventh,
uh,

65
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.140
industrial power.
So in a sense,

66
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
I had done this subliminal message that came from an earlier experience,

67
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.820
but there I was,

68
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.630
a decade or so later and my project was,

69
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.870
I thought that I was interested in political philosophy and social history and I

70
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:31.891
was working on the disappearance of the European peasantry under the press of

71
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.390
economic circumstances and,
uh,

72
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.130
major transformations in the countryside and the coming of the commercial

73
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:46.780
revolution in agriculture,
urbanization,
and the industrial revolution.

74
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.110
But I began to have my imagination captured by a numbers of references that I

75
00:05:55.031 --> 00:06:00.031
began to find around the early 20th century to call Laura and Italy around 1910.

76
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.320
And that seemed a little surprising to me.

77
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.630
And it really began,

78
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.690
I began to read more about it and it seemed to illustrate the how people's lives

79
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.520
were lived and their standard of living much better than,

80
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.790
uh,
the project thought I heard originally began with.

81
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.920
And so I let this medical project have a life of its own.

82
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.160
And this is what eventually became my book as I was working on,

83
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.130
uh,
more on cholera.
However,

84
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.090
something else came to the forefront of my attention.

85
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.300
And that was a conflict between what I read about cholera in the literature and

86
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:50.300
what I was beginning to find in my own research.

87
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.920
The literature said that there wasn't a major epidemic,
uh,

88
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.470
in the 20th century in Europe,

89
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:00.980
the last major one being in the 1890s.

90
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.160
But I was beginning to find odd references to some very strange events,

91
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.530
particularly in the summer of 1911 and I began to think that perhaps a very

92
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:18.701
interesting policy of concealment was taking place that is an epidemic that was

93
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:26.210
concealed by the authorities.
And Naples once again,

94
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.800
uh,
was a very interesting place.
Now Naples is,
uh,

95
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.820
if you're interested in Colorado and the west Naples is a very interesting place

96
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.480
because it was the city,

97
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.510
it was the largest city in Europe in the 19th century and it was scourged the

98
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:50.540
most often by this affliction.

99
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.760
And I'm going to be arguing that it was scourged also.
Um,

100
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.230
and times that aren't recorded in the standard,

101
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.970
a historiography of this subject and in particular in 1911,

102
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.060
it also is an extraordinary place because it has something happen that you won't

103
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:15.560
find elsewhere.
And that is,

104
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:20.561
this is a city that was actually after the dreadful epidemic of 1884 was rebuilt

105
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:27.970
in order to make the city collar reproof so that it wouldn't return.

106
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.160
So we see an extraordinary,
uh,

107
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.550
we talk about the impact of infectious diseases.

108
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:39.670
And here we see a case study of a place where the city itself is reconstructed

109
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.580
specifically as a result of an epidemic catastrophe in order not to make another

110
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:51.380
one possible.

111
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.470
And so we can directly see in bricks and mortar and in the sewers underground

112
00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:00.870
and the buildings above and in the layout of the city,

113
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.900
you can see the impact of cholera end of the idea of miasma because the mayas

114
00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:11.441
Madec interpretation was the one under which that guided the reconstruction of

115
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:12.900
the city,

116
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.610
which happened after in the way of the 1884 catastrophe.

117
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.040
But in 1911,

118
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.050
there was no public record of a major epidemic.

119
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:30.410
So I had a whiff of the fact that there was,

120
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.370
but I couldn't prove it.
So how do you go about demonstrating,
uh,

121
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.990
uh,
an epidemic that doesn't have a literature?

122
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.360
So I thought that the first thing that would be useful to do would be to visit

123
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.590
Naples.
And in particular to visit the Naples cemetery,

124
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.660
the cemetery is a very large one.
You can visit it yourselves.

125
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.130
Uh,
and it's a very monumental ground cemetery.

126
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.410
And I went in the middle of the week with the idea that I would go to the

127
00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:06.630
registry or uh,

128
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.690
and perhaps their find records of burials and that I would also be able to see,

129
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.450
uh,
in stone the victims of a major epidemic.

130
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:22.830
In other words,
the first idea I had was not,
you can't,

131
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.760
in order to prove that there was an epidemic,

132
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.590
you would have to have a sudden bulge and mortality in the summer months of

133
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:32.700
1911.

134
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.200
And I thought I could demonstrate that by visiting the Naples cemetery.

135
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:38.640
And if there weren't,

136
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.830
there wasn't a sudden excess of death in the summer than I would know that I was

137
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.800
actually on the wrong trail entirely.
And I should have bound in my project.
Uh,

138
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.710
well as I was walking through the,
uh,
monumental cemetery,

139
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:55.230
I think it was a Wednesday or Thursday,

140
00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.510
I suddenly had a car pull up alongside me,
uh,

141
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.410
and,
uh,
the mountain said,
uh,
get in,
get in.

142
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.820
Um,
I don't know exactly how you would have reacted.

143
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.810
I hesitated,
uh,
um,

144
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.840
particularly as it was a cemetery in which on a Wednesday and a Thursday I found

145
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:23.211
myself completely alone except for this a strange request that I got in a car

146
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:29.280
with someone I had never seen before.
Well,
it turns out to,
as we talked,

147
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.400
that he was the director of the cemetery and he had come to rescue me.

148
00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.590
And so I did eventually got 10,

149
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.620
and he took me out of the cemetery talent scolding me and telling me that I was

150
00:11:42.811 --> 00:11:47.610
obviously a stranger,
an outsider,
and a foreigner who knew nothing.

151
00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:53.210
And that in fact the Naples cemetery is the most dangerous place you can be in

152
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:54.281
the city,

153
00:11:54.281 --> 00:11:59.281
which has a long history of organized crime because during the week,

154
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.740
this was in fact where the local mafia did its drug deals and that everyone in

155
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:08.170
Naples knew this except me.

156
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.640
And he was possibly saving my life by removing me.

157
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.530
But it wasn't that I wasn't welcome.
Um,

158
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.440
I was welcome to come back on Saturday and Sunday because that's when all the

159
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:25.180
people of Naples,
uh,
do come to pay their respects,

160
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:25.660
uh,

161
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.660
to their relatives and their flower stalls and gazillions of people frequenting

162
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:33.550
the cemetery then,

163
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.780
and the registry office with the records was also open.

164
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.640
Then I also discovered that there was,

165
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.670
in fact by reading the newspapers surrounding the time of my visit that not very

166
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:50.230
summer there was the,
uh,

167
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.100
I was doing a little checking up and it turns out that the rector of the

168
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:56.440
cemetery wasn't kidding me at all.

169
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.340
That there was a major drug bust in this very cemetery.

170
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.960
And the way they had done it was that they had wired the tombstones.

171
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.240
Um,
and,
and this way they had a pulled off a major,
uh,

172
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.210
uh,
move against the Camorra,
which is the local,
uh,

173
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.430
if we like a subset of the organized crime families in Italy and one of the most

174
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.800
important crime syndicates in the world in modern times.

175
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.370
So that was not brought me back on a weekend.

176
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.150
And on the weekend I discovered that there was in fact a big mortality bulge,

177
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.460
that there were a lots of people who'd been buried in the summer of 1911,

178
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.481
well,

179
00:13:46.481 --> 00:13:51.481
in excess of the year before 1910 and 1909 or the years that were succeeded.

180
00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.120
1912 or 1913 and there was a book that have red registered the deaths and

181
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.990
burials and there was a huge bulge in 1911.

182
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.020
So I knew something had happened.
And,
uh,

183
00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:15.670
something was interesting because the,
uh,

184
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:21.090
one of the features of the book that's the register of burials is not,

185
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.220
they provide the neighborhood from which the deceased,
uh,

186
00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:32.110
was resident.
But in this case,
uh,
they,

187
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:36.970
instead of the usual record of a neighborhood,
they had,

188
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.840
uh,
the marking cartoon,

189
00:14:38.841 --> 00:14:43.450
you'll hospital was the last place that the deceased had been.

190
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:48.630
And the [inaudible] hospital then as now was the Infectious Diseases Hospital of

191
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:49.864
the city.

192
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:55.050
So I suddenly knew that there was this great excess of mortality in the summer

193
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.620
of 1911 and that the mortality was from infectious diseases because the people

194
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:09.580
had been buried in vast numbers from the cartoon Tunio hospital as their last

195
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:14.150
port of call.
So then the next thought,
um,

196
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:19.390
and I think a lot of historical work is a bit like detective work and I found

197
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:23.900
myself playing a sort of detective role.

198
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:28.880
So my next place to visit was the Katrina Hospital,

199
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.780
uh,
of infectious diseases.
And,
uh,

200
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:37.781
I've just made two findings there that we're confirming me in my vision of what

201
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.460
might have happened.
Uh,
thought they were,
there was a,

202
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.740
in the library of the hospital,

203
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.760
the hospital itself had preserved its own records,

204
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:56.120
our patient records.
And after some persistence,

205
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.920
I was allowed to look at patient records in the hospital and found something

206
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:02.930
interesting and mysterious.

207
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:07.640
And that was that there were records of the,
uh,

208
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.580
patient records through 1908,

209
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:12.890
nine 10 and the first half,

210
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:18.550
first half of 1911 and then suddenly there were no records at all.

211
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:19.760
Uh,

212
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.760
there was a mysterious disappearance of the records of the patients of the

213
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:27.260
hospital.
Uh,

214
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:32.290
then I went to the library of the Infectious Diseases Hospital where there was a

215
00:16:32.901 --> 00:16:37.280
second interesting thing,
which was not,
the hospital had its own.

216
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.390
Um,

217
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.420
we're search journal that published recording the research findings of its own

218
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.180
physicians,
its own house physicians and interns and residents.

219
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.450
The result of that was to discover that for surprise surprise in the summer of

220
00:16:57.021 --> 00:17:01.220
1911 the physicians of the cartoon,
your hospital,

221
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:06.230
we're doing lots and lots of research on therapeutics for Asiatic Cholera.

222
00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.160
Uh,

223
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.160
they were experimenting with giving patients ice and lots of other therapeutic

224
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:16.640
procedures that we'll talk about in a couple of minutes.
So,
uh,

225
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.670
value now knew that the physicians of the Infectious Diseases Hospital were

226
00:17:22.911 --> 00:17:27.230
enormously preoccupied with Asiatic cholera.
Uh,

227
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:32.231
then the next place was to go to the local archives where I was told that my

228
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:36.800
idea was impossible.

229
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:40.450
There was no such thing that there are also,
uh,

230
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.970
the local records had been moved in,
uh,

231
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.510
during the Second World War Two,
uh,

232
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:52.540
out of the city for keeping to the sanctuary of Monte Cassino and uh,

233
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.450
and Abby outside of the city.

234
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.630
But I think the number of you have heard of Monte Cassino,

235
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:05.100
it became a major battle site in the war.
And so,
uh,

236
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:09.450
the Abbey itself and all of the archives went up in flames.

237
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.720
And so all the records of the city for the period I was interested in were

238
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:15.924
destroyed.

239
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.710
And I was told that a project of the kind that I was imagining was,
uh,

240
00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:24.180
inconceivable and also couldn't be carried out.

241
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.300
So what do you do next if you think there's a major epidemic and,

242
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.990
uh,
you want to demonstrate its existence.

243
00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:38.400
So the next thing that happened,
uh,
was not,
uh,

244
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:43.401
I had the idea that this was a time in 1911.

245
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.330
That was the height of mass emigration of Italians.

246
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.433
That is,

247
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:54.080
I've said that I had been studying the disappearance of the European peasantry

248
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.570
and that its transformation into workers or uh,

249
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:03.670
urban dwellers and want a part of that was the extraordinary story of Italian,

250
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.540
a transoceanic migration in large part to this country,

251
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:11.760
but also to Australia and other places.

252
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.850
So I thought if there really was an mass movement and Naples is,

253
00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:20.370
was then,
uh,
a port,

254
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.050
it was one of Europe's along with harp,
Hem Borg,
Hum Board,
uh,

255
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.210
major,
uh,

256
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.630
port cities and what Naples specialized in if Homburg specialize and goods and

257
00:19:34.531 --> 00:19:38.820
surfaces.
Naples specialize in the export if people,

258
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.530
and in particular at Italian emigrants,
uh,
to,

259
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.210
uh,
New York City,

260
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.100
there was enormous transoceanic migration.
So I thought,
well,

261
00:19:50.101 --> 00:19:54.930
if this is true and these,
uh,
thousands,

262
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:59.880
hundreds of thousands of emigrants are moving through the city of Naples and

263
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:04.320
there is a major cholera epidemic and they're arriving at Ellis island,

264
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.940
we'll surely some of them will have,
uh,

265
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.980
been afflicted with the disease and there would be records there of that at

266
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:17.920
Ellis island.
Well as it turns out,
this was true,
uh,

267
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.260
there were records,

268
00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:24.261
cholera did break out on a series of demographic bearing ships in the summer of

269
00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:32.451
1911 and people were quarantined for the disease Italians that is,

270
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.120
who had last been in Naples where quarantine for the disease on Ellis Island.

271
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.690
And indeed there had been a number of people who were released from quarantine

272
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.710
and fell ill on the main land.
And so there are perhaps a dozen,

273
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.713
um,

274
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.730
cases of people who felt sick in New York state and not on Ellis Island itself.

275
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:58.780
So we know that there was,

276
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:03.490
then there were Italian immigrants coming to the United States who were

277
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.560
afflicted with the disease.

278
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.160
So this led me to think,
well,

279
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:13.630
I do have a project and now the point is to prove it further,

280
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.140
what can I find out about it's reasons?

281
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:20.290
What are the politics of concealment and so on.

282
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:25.590
And I was lucky then because I was interested in a physician called Leonard

283
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.720
Rodgers,

284
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.720
who was one of the world's experts in tropical medicine at the early years of

285
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:40.480
the 20th century.
And it was he who in 1908,

286
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:45.510
made a major discovery in terms of the therapeutics of Asiatic Cholera,

287
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:50.290
uh,
down to 19,
uh,
oh nine.

288
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:55.770
There was nothing that physicians could do that was effective and helpful for

289
00:21:58.241 --> 00:21:59.170
their patients.

290
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:04.410
And so the case fatality rate was something like 50% for Asiatic cholera in 1908

291
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:10.210
in 1909,
uh,
Leonard Rogers,

292
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.500
who was a British physician working in India had found,

293
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.553
uh,

294
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.610
that he could reduce the mortality from 50 to 15%.

295
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.180
Um,
the first major advance in therapeutics.

296
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:30.270
And he did it one by a simple,
uh,
building on a,

297
00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.460
something that had been observed from the 1830s.

298
00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:38.461
And that is to say the cholera kills by dehydration,

299
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.640
the bodily fluids flow out of the rectum and the mouth through vomiting at an

300
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.440
extraordinary rate so that human beings lose up to three quarters of the fluid

301
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:55.570
portion of their blood serum.

302
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.990
And so from the 1830s onward,

303
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.080
one of the therapeutic ideas was why not simply replace the fluids?

304
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.280
So,
uh,

305
00:23:06.281 --> 00:23:11.020
there were major attempts early on to get people to drink lots of liquid.

306
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.690
That doesn't work because you're simply vomited up.

307
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:18.350
It has no effect except to make the patient weaker.
So,
uh,

308
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:23.370
having discovered that there were attempts by physicians to replace the fluids,

309
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:26.980
uh,
intravenously,
uh,

310
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.910
the problem early on was not,
there was not a knowledge.

311
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.290
There are several problems.

312
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.550
How much liquid do you actually administer?

313
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.170
And many patients died of heart failure from an excess of fluid.

314
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.100
Uh,
it was also a time before the discovery of the germ theory of disease.

315
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.470
And so,
although,
uh,

316
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.430
they were given drips that had clean water,

317
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:56.540
it wasn't sterile and patients died of septicemia.
Uh,

318
00:23:56.541 --> 00:24:00.620
it was also true that,
uh,
another discovery,

319
00:24:00.621 --> 00:24:02.300
which was not the patients,

320
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:07.301
what made people persist with rehydration is not this administration of liquid

321
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:13.180
because the patients to feel much better briefly for a few hours,

322
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.260
they seem to recover.
They would sit up in their beds and feel infinitely better.

323
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.350
So something clearly positive was going on,

324
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:26.180
but what it was wasn't understood.
And what happened was that,

325
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:26.660
uh,

326
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.660
if the administration of fluid was trying to replace fluid than had the same

327
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:36.920
salinity as the blood of the bar,
uh,
that,
uh,
that in the body,

328
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.290
uh,
unfortunately it is not retained by tissues,

329
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.950
uh,
and it merely pours out of the body again.

330
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:51.070
And so the patient who had momentarily for a few hours felt better relapses.

331
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:56.590
And even the continuing of this therapeutic attempt had no positive effect.

332
00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:01.250
Well,
Leonard Rogers discovered in 1909 a number of things.

333
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:06.110
He measured the amount of fluid loss.
Um,
he,
uh,

334
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:11.111
used a distilled water and he made it a hypertonic that is a much more sane lean

335
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.150
than the blood fluid.

336
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.100
And the result of that was that it was retained through mechanisms that aren't

337
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:26.210
very well understood.
The fluid was retained.
And so Leonard,

338
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:31.211
Ron Jurors was able to save the lives of the vast majority of the patients.

339
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:35.590
She treated for Asiatic collar in India.
And he wanted to demo.

340
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.220
The problem was this was a time,
uh,

341
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:43.330
in medical history when there were racial ideas of disease and it was thought

342
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:48.830
the fact that he had discovered this with Indian bodies,
uh,

343
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:52.280
would have nothing to do with European bodies.

344
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.640
And so partly for humanitarian reasons and partly for scientific reasons,

345
00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.200
he was looking for,
uh,

346
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.350
an outbreak of cholera in the West in which he could apply his therapeutics and

347
00:26:06.051 --> 00:26:10.760
demonstrate their ability to save life,
any human life.

348
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:14.720
And in 1911 because he was watching very closely,

349
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.810
he realized that there was an epidemic afoot in Italy and he sought permission

350
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:25.990
to go to Naples to demonstrate the efficacy of his new procedures.

351
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.580
So soon I had Leonard,
I was in contact with Leonard Roger's family,

352
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.760
and I had access to his papers and his discussion of what happened to him in the

353
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.930
summer of 1911 which ones,

354
00:26:38.931 --> 00:26:43.280
not to admit that there Wa that to admit him to the hospital,

355
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.350
Naples to train physicians and saving lives the best available practice.

356
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.130
The only therapy that had any effect would be to admit the presence of an

357
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:58.050
epidemic.
And so he wasn't allowed to come to mainland Italy.

358
00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.280
Instead,

359
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:04.280
he was allowed a two week visit to Sicily where the disease spread as well.

360
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.150
And the Italian physicians,

361
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:11.151
they're called him the prince of medicine because they had a survival rate under

362
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:16.170
his direction and his new rehydration method of 85%,

363
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.250
which was extraordinary,
uh,
by international standards,

364
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:25.370
he had discovered the first collective therapy one that is in fact the basis of

365
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:31.320
present day therapy for cholera,
which is oral rehydration.
Ah,

366
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.860
Leonard Rogers methods have been perspect perfected,

367
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.980
but he was the one who found an effective rehydration system so soon.

368
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.820
We knew then that the state in Italy for various reasons,

369
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.880
was preserving a secret and denying its own citizens the most available of the

370
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.830
most effective,
the only effective available system of care.

371
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.980
So Leonard Rogers left Italy in great disappointment after only being allowed to

372
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:07.110
visit the collar awards in Sicily and was denied by the state,

373
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.460
the ability to visit a,
to visit Naples,

374
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.920
which was the epicenter of what was happening.
Then the next thing,
uh,

375
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.010
I was able to discover was that the records for this epidemic,

376
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.420
there were records,

377
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.480
but they existed not in the usual places that scholars would think of to study

378
00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:28.380
public health.
Uh,

379
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:32.700
the first files on this that I discovered,
uh,

380
00:28:32.701 --> 00:28:37.701
were in police records and they happen in an odd way,

381
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:43.820
which was that the prime minister of Italy ordered the state police in their

382
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.830
Italy to deal with the new offense,

383
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.080
which was sanitary defeatism.

384
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:57.740
And in order to preserve silence and not promote sanitary defeatism,

385
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.890
they began tapping,
uh,
the,
uh,

386
00:29:01.891 --> 00:29:06.891
telephone lines used by physicians and censoring and opening physicians male.

387
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.260
And in the city of Venice in 1911,

388
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.910
there were actually the police records that demonstrated the following,

389
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:23.030
which was to say that the Venice Medical Society decided quite sensibly in the

390
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:29.390
summer of 1911 that it would save lives and enable people to protect themselves

391
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:34.670
by publishing pamphlets and distributing them about Asiatic Cholera and how you

392
00:29:36.091 --> 00:29:37.920
can protect yourself against it.

393
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.040
And they printed thousands of these and wall posters as well to put up on the

394
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:43.871
walls.

395
00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:48.871
If Venice instead the medical society was visited by the police who confiscated

396
00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:57.571
and burned all of the pamphlets and all of the wall posters and told the

397
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:03.510
physicians of Venice the city that to propagate health and sanitary defeatism

398
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:10.390
would be fatal to their careers.
So they are there.

399
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:14.160
This was all preserved in the records,
uh,

400
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:19.000
of the police regarding the summer of 1911 in Venice.

401
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.550
The next place that I visited done,

402
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.450
um,

403
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:30.450
was the national archives here and discovered that Italy had signed in 1903 on

404
00:30:34.751 --> 00:30:39.310
this is means that all of the things that I'm telling you about mark to

405
00:30:39.311 --> 00:30:43.570
violation also of international law because in 1903,

406
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:48.690
there was a Paris sanitary convention which made the full disclosure of an

407
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:54.310
infectious diseases mandatory for Italy.

408
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:59.020
And the United States were both signatories along with a series of other

409
00:30:59.021 --> 00:31:04.021
countries and the physician who represented the United States in 1903,

410
00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:09.220
a major cholera expert named Henry gettings had,

411
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:14.290
was now stationed as nape at Naples as the u with the u s embassy are directing

412
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:18.790
the medical service there.
Why Naples?

413
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:23.791
Because Naples was the center of mass emigration from Italy to the United

414
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:24.070
States,

415
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.510
and there were health inspections that took place in the city before departure.

416
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.470
And Henry gettings was therefore in charge of protecting the health of the

417
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:37.471
United States by heading off infectious diseases before people leave and boarded

418
00:31:37.811 --> 00:31:40.120
the ship.
Well,
in 1911,

419
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:44.110
there's an extensive correspondence and a very happy,

420
00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:49.140
unhappy correspondence by Henry gatting's and people in the United States,

421
00:31:49.961 --> 00:31:54.961
including his superiors and his family about his experiences in the city where

422
00:31:55.181 --> 00:32:00.181
he tried to report to the United States government that there was a major

423
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.470
epidemic of Asiatic cholera.

424
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:07.540
He found that his life was threatened in the city of Naples,

425
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:10.600
uh,
and his superiors in the United States.

426
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:15.750
We're not at all enthusiastic about receiving his message of what was taking

427
00:32:16.721 --> 00:32:19.540
place.
And so the United States government,

428
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.100
you've met Walter Wyman in your study of the bubonic plague,

429
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:29.050
uh,
and the Barbaree plague in San Francisco where we meet him here again,

430
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:29.471
uh,

431
00:32:29.471 --> 00:32:34.471
actually colluding with the Italian government in the suppression of knowledge

432
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.440
about this important major infectious disease against international law that the

433
00:32:41.211 --> 00:32:44.210
United States had actually signed.
Um,

434
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:49.170
then there were an addition to that.
I then went back to,
uh,

435
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:54.300
the police files and discovered that there were also health statistics that were

436
00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:56.330
coming in to Rome,

437
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.500
a reporting events in the Italian provinces and they included statistics for

438
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:04.340
Asiatic at cholera,

439
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:09.520
but the prefects who are the highest authority for law and order in each Italian

440
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:10.730
province today.

441
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:15.730
As then we're actually sending back to health officers and the various

442
00:33:15.771 --> 00:33:16.640
provinces,

443
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.760
the statistics they were receiving saying that these aren't good statistics,

444
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:25.580
we don't want them send us something better.

445
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:30.940
And so you actually see the process by which the state manufactured the health

446
00:33:32.451 --> 00:33:37.070
statistics that were subsequently published and are the basis for the

447
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:38.360
historiography.

448
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:43.460
And you can read those statistics in World Health Organization reports and

449
00:33:43.461 --> 00:33:48.461
Italian government reports and in US government reports of the summer of 1911.

450
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:53.240
Now,
why is this true and why was this so sensitive?

451
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.550
Uh,
this meant that I needed to go back in time.

452
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.880
And so my first idea was to write the second half of the book about concealment

453
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:09.920
and I'm introducing that I think that's important in our course because we're

454
00:34:09.921 --> 00:34:14.921
talking about various strategies of public health and so far we've looked at

455
00:34:15.621 --> 00:34:19.790
plague regulations and we've looked at vaccine,

456
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.910
but there's,
as you will remember,

457
00:34:22.911 --> 00:34:27.911
probably from the SARS outbreak that China practice to policy of concealment at

458
00:34:30.981 --> 00:34:31.814
the outset.

459
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:37.160
What I'm trying to say is that concealment is also a style of public health

460
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:39.040
policy.
And uh,

461
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:44.090
I think our newspapers rather miss lettuce and leading us to believe that this

462
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:48.680
was some plea unique to China.
Something very unusual.

463
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:52.880
I would argue as well that this is probably something that's been resorted to a

464
00:34:52.881 --> 00:34:53.960
number of times.

465
00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:59.110
And this epidemic of 1911 is a good example and a good case study in which one

466
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:04.940
can find the actual documents of the concealment and the reasons that it took

467
00:35:04.941 --> 00:35:07.520
place.
Well,
why this pressure?

468
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:12.530
Why does the Prime Minister of Italy collude and why the United States,

469
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.790
uh,
the public,
uh,

470
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.830
surgeon general of the United States also colluded with that.
Indeed.
Uh,

471
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:24.050
I would tell you another little anecdote which was a,

472
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.810
that Walter Weinman had a friend who was the,
uh,

473
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:32.660
friends a couple he knew who were the parents of um,

474
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:37.750
young Johnny who just finished his Ba degree in 1911,

475
00:35:38.041 --> 00:35:40.350
I'm sorry,
not here in new haven,

476
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.130
but rather that other unmentionable place in Cambridge,
mass.

477
00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:49.490
And having finished his degree in 1911 as a newly minted bachelor of arts,

478
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.440
it was planning a grand tour,
which was going to take in Italy.

479
00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.920
And,
uh,
he,
Italy had,

480
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.950
this was the 50th anniversary of Italian unification and there was a major fair

481
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.440
with our grand us pavilion and Johnny was planning to visit until that is a,

482
00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:12.720
he got a letter from his friend,

483
00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:17.721
the US surgeon general who wrote to Johnny's parents that this trip simply

484
00:36:18.901 --> 00:36:23.901
wasn't on in the summer of 1911 because due to infectious diseases,

485
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.440
it wasn't safe,
uh,
to visit Italy.
Um,

486
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:33.180
uh,
the Mucus pavilion also the,
uh,
people,

487
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:37.770
the organizers wrote back to Washington saying that they were scandalized and

488
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:41.940
horrified because,
uh,
American citizens,

489
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:47.030
we're not being warned that in fact there was cholera are rampant in Italy and

490
00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:51.570
their health was at risk and there was no knowledge of this and no cover of it,

491
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.670
of coverage of it and the press.
Well,
why would this be happening?
Well,

492
00:36:56.671 --> 00:36:57.910
the first thing,
uh,

493
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.920
that is that by this time there was an enormous stigma associated with Asiatic

494
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:05.490
cholera,

495
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.490
Asiatic cholera by in western Europe and in North America was supposedly

496
00:37:12.721 --> 00:37:17.721
vanquished by the bulwarks of sanitation and public health.

497
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.540
Cholera is a spread by the ingestion and only one way,

498
00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:28.680
which is the ingestion of food and water contaminated with fecal matter.

499
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:34.220
And so it really is an indictment of sanitary standards.

500
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:39.480
And therefore one of the features was in a matter of national pride for

501
00:37:39.481 --> 00:37:40.230
Italians,

502
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:45.230
not to admit that there was in fact there were these deficiencies in sanitary

503
00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:48.790
standards in,
uh,

504
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:53.550
a nation that was supposedly advanced and silk.
And as they would have said,

505
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.030
civilized.
And so part of it then is avoiding stigma.

506
00:37:57.031 --> 00:38:01.540
This was an important part of what happened.
But in addition,
there was a,
uh,

507
00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:06.541
a patriotism involved because this was the 50th anniversary of Italian

508
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:12.840
unification and the whole world was descending on Italy or so,

509
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:17.841
it seemed an Italian soaked and to destroy the festivities by putting them off,

510
00:38:19.861 --> 00:38:24.861
by warning the world that cholera was rampant in Italy at this time would have

511
00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:29.250
had enormous economic repercussions for tourism,

512
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.020
a major industry.
It also would have had major repercussions,

513
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:38.890
uh,
in terms of pride in counseling.
The whole of the celebrations.

514
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.090
A second feature.

515
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:45.280
Another feature has to do as the fact that I've just said that the Italian

516
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:50.281
economy and Italian standards of living were dependent in part on the export of

517
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:54.130
people at this time.

518
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:59.370
These were emigrants who came to these shores and to South America and then sent

519
00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:05.251
back very large scale remittances that were very important to the Italian

520
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:07.180
economy.

521
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:12.330
And what would have happened if the 1903 sanitary convention had terms had been

522
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.990
enforced and Italy as it should have and was legally committed to doing,

523
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:24.090
had announced the presence of Asiatic cholera that would have stopped emigration

524
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.040
to these shores and to South America.

525
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.030
And that was something that Italians did not want to risk.

526
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:36.180
And this also could have had a repercussions in terms of civil disorder.

527
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:41.550
So there was a fear that then to cholera as we'll see is much associated with

528
00:39:43.541 --> 00:39:45.760
social tension and disorder.

529
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:50.910
And that was another fear that was very much in the minds of Italians.

530
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.180
But then there's something very specific and that is that,

531
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:58.060
as I said in the beginning of our talk this morning,

532
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.910
that Naples had been made,

533
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:05.911
supposedly cholera proof after the summer of 1884 when a catastrophic epidemic

534
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.720
had ravaged the city and massive commitment of funds,

535
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:17.591
Italian,

536
00:40:17.591 --> 00:40:22.591
but also a Neapolitan and from abroad had been devoted to this rebuilding of the

537
00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:25.084
city.

538
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:30.690
The problem is I've already said that Naples was the center of the Camorra of

539
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:38.970
major criminal syndicate and was a place where funds often disappeared in

540
00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:41.320
mysterious channels.

541
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:46.890
And one of the features of the rebuilding project was not the money,

542
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:48.760
uh,

543
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.760
largely went into undisclosed and corrupt channels.

544
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.650
And so here we have a city which is supposedly been built like the titanic,

545
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:05.520
just hitting another iceberg and discovering that in fact the funds that were to

546
00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:09.160
have made it safe have been misspent.

547
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:14.910
And there was an opposition to this municipal government in Naples,

548
00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:20.640
which was using health as one of the complaints of the opposition parties.

549
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.170
The opposition parties in Naples at the time were Republicans,

550
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.210
socialists,
anarchists.

551
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:33.510
And so part of the danger then from the standpoint of the government of the day

552
00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:39.940
was not to admit this would lead to a major local scandal and wood,

553
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:42.590
if you like,

554
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.860
a legitimate the complaints and accusations of a radical left wing opposition.

555
00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.450
And so a consideration of political stability,
uh,

556
00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:58.340
was also part of the calculation.

557
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:03.490
And this in fact was a motivating factor for the US surgeon general and the u s

558
00:42:04.281 --> 00:42:07.190
government.
That here was a friendly government.

559
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.640
Dot was being lampooned and lambasted by a radical,

560
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:19.330
very left wing opposition and it was better to cooperate them with the

561
00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:23.660
government,
the legitimate government in the face of this opposition.

562
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:25.010
Well,

563
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:30.010
this concealment then went forward and it was orchestrated at the various

564
00:42:30.641 --> 00:42:34.130
highest levels.
The press was censored.

565
00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.760
Health defeatism actually then became something that the police regarded as an

566
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:43.820
infringement and repressed.

567
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:49.160
We've seen the way in which physicians and public health authorities were

568
00:42:49.161 --> 00:42:53.090
censored and were threatened.
Um,

569
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.570
in addition,
it was not discussed in parliament.
Uh,

570
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.420
you and even it wasn't discussed in the Naples municipal council.

571
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:07.430
And if you read the reports and I read the discussions of what was being

572
00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:11.450
discussed and Naples in the summer of 1911,

573
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:16.570
you see a discussion of the need for hiring lots and lots of nurses.

574
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.670
Um,
uh,

575
00:43:19.671 --> 00:43:24.671
the need for many more doctors and you see that they're importing massive

576
00:43:24.951 --> 00:43:29.951
quantities of snow from the APP and nines and the Alps are into the city and

577
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:37.481
it's taken to the catune your hospital and their new few correlate that with

578
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:39.920
what the physicians were doing.

579
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:44.990
They were giving ice to cholera patients on the ward to deal with the tremendous

580
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.020
thirst that they had and to replace,

581
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:52.280
they hoped some of the fluid that they were losing through the course of the

582
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:53.114
disease.

583
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:58.210
So that was all this conspiracy then is not a casual one.

584
00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:03.380
It's organized from the top down and is a very,
um,

585
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:06.170
major and well organized,
uh,

586
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:10.160
plot to conceal the existence of this epidemic.

587
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:14.480
In addition,
then,
what were the consequences of concealment?

588
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.600
I want to argue that throughout this course that public health is dependent on

589
00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:25.490
accurate and timely information.

590
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.420
We'll see that today in a major feature of public health policies is

591
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:38.630
surveillance and monitoring and the availability of information nationally and

592
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:47.001
internationally is vital to contain and prevent pandemic afflictions.

593
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.630
So one of the features,

594
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:56.750
and I think 1911 is a good example of what happens if you don't provide

595
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.520
information.
Uh,

596
00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:04.521
first thing would happen was that this disease spread through many provinces of

597
00:45:04.801 --> 00:45:07.500
Italy.
It was not contained domestically.

598
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:13.550
Fortunately it did not spread to these shores and to Argentina and to other

599
00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:18.810
places where large numbers of Italians went.

600
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.710
But I think that was a no thanks to the Italian government.

601
00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.700
It had to do with serendipity and good luck.

602
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:32.930
What why you could say was that the Italian government with the collusion of the

603
00:45:33.721 --> 00:45:38.721
u s government was placing the health of this country and the health of

604
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:42.000
Argentina in particular at risk.

605
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.300
It was placing at risk.

606
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:50.610
The health also have international visitors to Italy,

607
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:55.760
tourists and people who came to see the celebrations of 1911 and one of the

608
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:03.680
truly unfortunate parts of the concealment effects is that it led to thousands

609
00:46:07.591 --> 00:46:12.591
of deaths of Italians because the patients on the wards of the cartoon hospital

610
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:20.420
and elsewhere in Italy were systematically denied what was then the best

611
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:26.520
available international practice,

612
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:31.670
which is the administration of rehydration therapy as developed by Leonard

613
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:37.670
Rogers and Italian doctors weren't allowed to know that this was the state of

614
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:42.771
the art and the way in which it was possible to save Italian wives reducing

615
00:46:43.891 --> 00:46:48.120
mortality from 50 to 15% or something like that.

616
00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:50.670
So if you look at the cartoon,
your award,

617
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:55.230
what were the physicians doing instead?
We'll instead,

618
00:46:55.290 --> 00:47:00.290
because cholera patients become a tremendously cold and look as though they've

619
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:01.740
been cadaver rise.

620
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.640
They were immersing cholera patients in hot tubs.

621
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:11.160
Um,
they,
because for the same way as their energy was failing,

622
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.060
they were administering them.
Stimulants,
caffeine.

623
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.800
And there were various experiments with other things that were meant to because

624
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:22.590
there wasn't a therapy that was known to work.

625
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:26.970
There were lots of experimental therapies that were being tried,
strict cunning,

626
00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:27.841
which you know,

627
00:47:27.841 --> 00:47:32.841
better as rat poison was also administered to cholera patients in an attempt to

628
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:38.350
revive their energy and they're flagging,
um,
health.

629
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.860
Um,
there was also,

630
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:46.600
there were attempts at rehydration therapy,
but this took the,
uh,

631
00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.700
the form that was now outdated after 19 away of trying to get the patients to

632
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:57.631
suck on ice or to drink or to be injected with,

633
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.560
um,
isotonic,
um,

634
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.860
saint lean solutions that is of the same content of Saul's same salinity as the

635
00:48:09.221 --> 00:48:09.880
blood,

636
00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:14.880
which by 1908 through a century of experience was known to be entirely useless.

637
00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:17.050
Um,
and there were,

638
00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:21.730
these were the kinds of therapies that were being practiced plus simply

639
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:24.790
supportive nursing care.
And as I said,

640
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.810
the hospital was recruiting very large numbers of nurses,

641
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:33.870
so nursing care and various experimental and sometimes heroic interventions that

642
00:48:35.051 --> 00:48:39.430
led to a very high mortality rate.
When in fact 80,

643
00:48:39.431 --> 00:48:44.170
it was possible to save about 85% of patients.
Well,

644
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:48.550
I've run out of time.
And so I'll just say then that the,
uh,

645
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.610
this is how this particular book came to be.

646
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.920
And I ended up writing,

647
00:48:53.921 --> 00:48:57.850
adding on that in order to understand 1911,

648
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
it was absolutely crucial to see 1884 and the steps that had been taken,

649
00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:08.700
unfortunately not so successfully to make Naples collar approved by the early

650
00:49:09.941 --> 00:49:12.820
20th century when sadly it wasn't.

651
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:18.030
And I think there's a story there of concealment as a public health policy that

652
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:23.311
I wanted to alert you to as yet another style of public health and one that has

653
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:28.900
very,
it's not good for your health and has very dire consequences.
