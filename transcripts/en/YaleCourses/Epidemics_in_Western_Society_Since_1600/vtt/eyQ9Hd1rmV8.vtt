1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.690
Okay,
well,
let's,
uh,
let's begin.
And as you know,

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.890
in our class,

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:12.000
one of the topics or themes that we're considering,

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.230
it was intellectual history and lurking in the background of course is the big

5
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:21.600
question of medicine itself and what it is.

6
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:26.040
What is medical science?
What does it mean to have a medical science?

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.020
Well,
this morning,
um,
we'll be considering that.

8
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.860
Is medical science purely the technical application of neutral knowledge or

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
should we think of it as a cultural institution also built by dominant social

10
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:53.481
groups in society that in some way may reflect their worldview,

11
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.410
sometimes may embody their prejudices and may promote their interests.

12
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.070
And at least we should ask the question,

13
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.030
if we accept the biomedical paradigm of disease,

14
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.340
what are the implications of that acceptance?
What are the costs?

15
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.090
What are we giving up?
So this,

16
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.100
that's the big issue.

17
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.700
And today what I'd like to do is to look at a subset of the bigger problem.

18
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.020
And this is the medical specialization that's known as tropical medicine.

19
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.790
It emerged in the 1890s

20
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.860
and it period that is of a,

21
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:48.861
it gained rapidly enormous prestige and influence and is still a major sub field

22
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.470
in medicine.

23
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.640
The discipline thus far has undergone three periods in its history.

24
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.390
The first is the one that we're going to be concentrating on this morning and

25
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:10.521
that's the period from roughly the 1890s until more or less the first world war

26
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
that marks the real heyday of tropical medicine.

27
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.900
The time when it was the cutting edge of medical science,

28
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.140
when it made a series of major,

29
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.380
major discoveries and served the most obvious political purposes

30
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.140
there was followed and its history by a second period that lasts more or less

31
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:44.031
from world war one until the 1970s or the next half century of tropical

32
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:46.524
medicine.

33
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.190
And during this period the discipline loses a lot of it's scientific momentum.

34
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.810
Tropical medicine came to be confined essentially to Paris otology and this

35
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.070
period,

36
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.070
the dynamism in medical science moved instead to microbiology and sus offshoots

37
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.380
as immunology.

38
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.240
And that boasted such major developments as antibiotics and a series of

39
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:23.971
effective vaccines and that attracted the lion share of research funds.

40
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.420
So tropical medicine in the period from the first world war to the 1970s made

41
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.790
relatively few major major discoveries.

42
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.470
Then after World War Two and accelerating from the 1970s we see a third phase

43
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.560
ushered in by such things as decolonization and a new attention to public health

44
00:03:55.191 --> 00:03:58.170
and the third world.
And with it,

45
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.360
a new influx of research funds through the World Health Organization and

46
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:08.590
powerful foundations like the Rockefeller and Macarthur Foundation's.

47
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.481
Well,

48
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:15.481
what I want to do this morning is to look critically at tropical medicine.

49
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.690
And by that I don't mean for or against.

50
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.450
What I want to do instead is to look at why it Rose A.

51
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.610
Rose as a discipline.
When it did,

52
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.010
what interests did it serve,
what were its implications?

53
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.760
And I'm going to argue that tropical medicine,

54
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.270
and particularly in this formative early period before the first world war was

55
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.600
clearly socially constructed.

56
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.740
This is a period that coincides with the high tide of colonial expansion.

57
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.800
The age of the scramble for Africa and Tropical Medicine gave expression to an

58
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:05.671
imperial view of the world and it marked the relationship in medical terms

59
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.230
between Western Europe on the one hand and Asia and Africa on the other,

60
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.590
and between the United States and Latin America as a discipline.

61
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.900
It's served as a major instrument also in promoting European expansion overseas

62
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.910
and American hegemony in the Americas and its applications.

63
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:39.241
And then the policies that promoted tropical medicine was not only value neutral

64
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:44.440
science,
it was also an instrument of power.

65
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.730
And we need to bear that in mind.
Now,

66
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.760
the emergence of tropical medicine marked a transition,

67
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.830
a transformation from something that had it,

68
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.170
and that I hope won't be confusing,

69
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.710
but from the middle of the 18th century,

70
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:08.711
more or less until the closing decade of the 19th century,

71
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.070
there had been an older tradition that can be summarized under the label of the

72
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.140
label of diseases.

73
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.140
Of the tropics and there were a couple classic statements of this older

74
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.890
tradition.

75
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.430
One was a work and important work by James Lind and 18th century physician who

76
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:39.131
wrote an essay in diseases incidental to Europeans in hot climates and this was

77
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:48.071
built on the experience of Europeans in the West indies and then there was

78
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:53.951
another work by James Johnson called the influence of tropical climates on

79
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:01.301
European constitutions built on the experience of Europeans in India.

80
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.230
Now what these works and other ones of their kind meant in the expression

81
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:15.130
diseases of the tropics was something particular they meant that in the colonial

82
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:21.680
world in that is the area of hot climate.

83
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:23.630
As it was expressed at the time,

84
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.810
Europeans were subject to special diseases as challenges that arose as a result

85
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:36.551
of conditions peculiar to warm climates and to the resulting conditions of

86
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:42.290
temperature,
humidity and local ecology.

87
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.720
Under those conditions,

88
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.800
the diseases that would afflict Europeans were not,

89
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:53.801
however different in nature from those familiar at home,

90
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.980
the diseases of hot countries were heightened in their variance perhaps and the

91
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.890
constitutions of white people.

92
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.580
We're now subjected to new and unfamiliar stresses that made them peculiarly

93
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:13.640
vulnerable in these climates to disease,

94
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.260
but the issue was simply in the era should we say,

95
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.410
of diseases of the tropics was simply one of kind raw and degree of degree

96
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:32.230
rather than kind the diseases or the tropics where simply intense variants of

97
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:38.291
familiar disease processes and there was an educational corollary to that,

98
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.670
which was that physicians who had studied general medicine and European medical

99
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:52.661
schools were Philly fully equipped to treat the entire spectrum of human

100
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.700
diseases wherever they occurred.

101
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.070
Diseases of the tropics warrant a special category.

102
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.080
There were simply heightened versions of familiar maladies.

103
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.633
In other words,

104
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.700
the concept of disease is of the tropics presupposed a universality of a single

105
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:20.691
medical discipline that viewed the diseases of the tropical world as posing

106
00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:27.081
problems of degree but not have a thoroughly different kind.

107
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.330
We should also say that this idea of diseases of the tropics already did have

108
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:41.601
embodied in it some troubling and important questions that had to do with a

109
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:46.170
colonial or imperial and racial view of the world,

110
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.930
European bodies,

111
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.220
the concept presupposed were different in some way.

112
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.130
For those of Asians and Africans,

113
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.710
they weren't intended for the conditions prevailing in the colonies.

114
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.000
And so the question was where the tropics,
in fact,

115
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.210
inhabitable for Europeans.

116
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.130
You can see this and expressions like darkest Africa,

117
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.470
teaming Asia,

118
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.520
those imply dangerous places and even more the expression of the white man's

119
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:23.814
grave.

120
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.430
And so the question was whether settling in the tropics was going to be

121
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:30.330
possible.

122
00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.960
Was it simply that Europeans needed a period of seasoning another term of the

123
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:41.481
time or a climatization after which they'd be stressed,

124
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.300
hardy,
and able to survive in these new settings.

125
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.190
Physicians who dealt with diseases of the tropics thought of themselves as

126
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:55.440
performing an indispensable service.

127
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.040
One that was useful to European states and especially to explorers,

128
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.660
travelers,
settlers,
colonial administrators,

129
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.960
and of course sailors and soldiers.

130
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:16.190
The service was to provide assistance and advice during the time of a climate

131
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:22.020
discussion,
advice on exercise,
diet,
clothing,

132
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:23.700
and housing.
In short,

133
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:28.701
everything that new arrivals would need to protect themselves from the rigors of

134
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:30.900
the new environment,

135
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:37.370
but the 1890s mark to transition to something different from this view of

136
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:44.691
diseases of the tropics to something that sounds subtly different but was

137
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:47.550
profoundly so,

138
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.420
and that is tropical diseases and tropical medicine.

139
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.520
Now,
what was implied in this transition,

140
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.930
this transformation,

141
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.760
it was a vision of the world in which Asia and Africa for Europeans or possibly

142
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:11.311
Latin America for US citizens were conceived in a really charged fashion as

143
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:19.501
harboring diseases that were conceptually different from other diseases that

144
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:25.951
could not be treated by physicians who had graduated from European medical

145
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:31.531
schools unless they had undergone special postgraduate training.

146
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:38.490
And the implication to was a different form of hygiene

147
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.400
and there was a work that was a foundational text for this new medical

148
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:46.234
specialty,

149
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.840
one of the most influential medical works of the whole of the 19th century and

150
00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:57.511
one that had enormous influence on the relations of the metropolitan powers to

151
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:02.710
their colonial dependencies.
This work was by this men,

152
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.850
a British physician named Patrick Manson who came to be known as the father of

153
00:13:11.381 --> 00:13:16.381
tropical medicine and the work that caused the stir,

154
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:22.170
what's called and said an enormous fat volume and titled Tropical Diseases,

155
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:29.550
Emmanuel for the diseases of warm climates and it was written in 1898 which

156
00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:37.111
isn't an accident and it wasn't also an accident that the father of tropical

157
00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:43.321
medicine was British or that Britain became the world's center of the new

158
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:50.011
discipline Britain at the time being the world's leading imperial power.

159
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.330
Now what were the background conditions that promoted the emergence of this

160
00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:01.680
whole new medical subdiscipline

161
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.380
of first as we said,

162
00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.100
was Britain's position as a great colonial power.

163
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.360
There were others as well that lay behind this new medical specialism.

164
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.650
One was something we've already dealt with and that is the germ theory of

165
00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:28.360
disease and the triumph of contagion ism over auntie contagion aneurysm.

166
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.220
The germ theory had a number of possible implications.

167
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.660
One was the idea as we've seen of clinching the concept of disease specificity

168
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.950
and tropical medicine was built on the premise that some diseases lurking and

169
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:51.700
Africa and Asia now needed new classifications,

170
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.580
belonging and special categories and that to understand them and here was

171
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:01.220
another of its implications.

172
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:06.340
You needed physicians who are trained at special institutions and had a

173
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:08.570
specialized curriculum

174
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.980
and then they could be dealt with by speciphic special remedies and measures of

175
00:15:16.411 --> 00:15:21.360
hygiene that were different from those that had been successful in bringing

176
00:15:21.361 --> 00:15:24.030
about a mortality Revolution in Europe.

177
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

178
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.400
<v 0>Now,
as you all remember,</v>

179
00:15:27.401 --> 00:15:30.910
when we examined the theories of mocks one patent coffer,

180
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:36.690
their germ theory mark the end of an alternative approach to medicine,

181
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.600
one that had flourished at mid century,

182
00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:43.240
particularly in continental Europe,

183
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.420
but was intellectually vanquished by the laboratory methods of bacteriology and

184
00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:50.830
later Paris otology.

185
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.950
This was the idea of social medicine associated with the radical German

186
00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:57.100
physician.

187
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:02.100
Rudolph your cough for social medicine medicine was a collective enterprise and

188
00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:11.371
what was important for physicians to treat not only individual patients but

189
00:16:11.891 --> 00:16:16.891
society as a whole dealing with issues of sanitary conditions,

190
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.980
poverty,
nutrition,
social justice.

191
00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.970
Well the germ theory of disease was a setback for social medicine and I'm going

192
00:16:27.371 --> 00:16:32.371
to argue that tropical medicine one to even a step further and the turn from

193
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:37.270
that direction.
It argued that in the tropical world,

194
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.680
the tree problem,

195
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.460
and we're talking with the period down to world war one,

196
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:47.110
the chief problem was to preserve the health of European settlers

197
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.630
as a discipline until much later in its life,

198
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:58.650
tropical medicine largely ignored the general health of indigenous societies.

199
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.020
This also came to mean something somewhat sinister.

200
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.080
When the logic was applied to the global north and south and black white

201
00:17:12.751 --> 00:17:13.980
relationships,

202
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.400
it seemed to suggest that the bodies of Africans and teaming Asians weren't

203
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.320
medically dangerous,

204
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:28.300
that they were the reservoirs for diseases that pose serious new threats for

205
00:17:29.371 --> 00:17:33.090
Europeans and there was an implication,

206
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:38.180
a possible strategy for hygiene and that was that perhaps the best way forward

207
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.200
was for Europeans and indigenous peoples.

208
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:48.290
To be segregated in their housing arrangements that European should live in the

209
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:54.201
tropical world and special enclaves where the latest prophylactic measures would

210
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:56.364
be applied,

211
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
whereas natives or indigenous peoples could be left as they had been found.

212
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:07.320
Alternatively,
if you read some of the literature,

213
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.400
the uh,

214
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.460
produced by works of European right riders such as summer set,

215
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.433
Mon,

216
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.570
you'd see that the Europeans were advised to take to the hills during the

217
00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:22.980
dangerous summer months,

218
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.580
leaving dangerous natives behind,

219
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.850
but we shouldn't forget the tropical medicine at the turn of the century was

220
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:37.851
also where the scientific action and excitement and medical science we're taking

221
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:43.140
place beyond the germ theory of disease,

222
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.290
tropical medicine and bodied,

223
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:50.291
the various latest developments and above all the science,

224
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:55.370
the new science of Paris otology and it attracted some of the leading figures,

225
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.760
indeed in the development of microbiology to enter this new discipline.

226
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:07.260
This was true,
for example,
of Robert Kaul who came,

227
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.440
made a voyage to Italy to study Paris Tautology in the form of malaria and then

228
00:19:15.361 --> 00:19:17.460
set off for the colonial world.

229
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.540
Pastor at this time had just died,

230
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.780
but his institute saw affiliates or satellite institutes set up at Saigon at

231
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:29.220
Tunis,

232
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.220
Algiers in the 1890s all preaching the new discipline of tropical medicine and

233
00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.280
pastors most famous enabled discipled Emile grew,

234
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:46.560
became a specialist in this new discipline.
To understand it,

235
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:49.500
we need to remember two major breakthroughs.

236
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:55.580
The first was by Patrick Manson in 1883 at that time he discovered something

237
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:01.710
that was radically new.

238
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.870
He was dealing with the disease of elephantiasis and he found that the full

239
00:20:09.581 --> 00:20:14.581
aerial warm that causes it is transmitted by mosquitoes.

240
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:20.330
The first example of a vector borne disease transmission,

241
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.930
this was epic making and not respect and it was also a movement from bacteria or

242
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.430
the wasn't known at the time.

243
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:36.330
Viruses to more complex life forms.

244
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:41.870
The interaction of humans with biologically more sophisticated protozoa or

245
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:47.781
helminths or worms and with insect diseases could now be seen to be part of a

246
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:56.431
much more complicated process and with complicated life forms.

247
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.270
Then there was following this,

248
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.780
the establishment of the mosquito theory of transmission for malaria,

249
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.660
which took place during the end of the decade of the 1890s with two figures who

250
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:18.100
are working independently of each other.

251
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:23.130
But in 1898 established that malaria was a parasitical disease transmitted by

252
00:21:25.121 --> 00:21:28.600
certain species of mosquitoes.
So malaria,

253
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:33.630
which is a disease that will be dealing with after the spring break was of

254
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:39.031
decisive importance in the establishment of tropical medicine and malaria was

255
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.630
the disease that was at its heart and its center.

256
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.260
The two people were in Italy,

257
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:52.290
and we'll be coming back to this in a couple of weeks when we resume classes was

258
00:21:55.121 --> 00:21:58.600
in Italy.
There was Giovanni Battista Good Aussie

259
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.100
who made a very elegant demonstration and very convincing one that,

260
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.370
uh,
human malaria was transmitted by mosquitoes.

261
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:17.460
And he did so by experiments in which he may introduce just one variable in,

262
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:19.961
uh,

263
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:24.961
the exposure during the warm summer months of large populations to biting

264
00:22:26.711 --> 00:22:27.670
insects.

265
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.470
He protected by screening or later by chemical means,

266
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:33.280
uh,

267
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.280
select groups of people while everyone around them was falling ill of malaria.

268
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.120
They lived in exactly the same conditions as those around them except for one

269
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.490
variable that they weren't subject to bite the bites of flying insects.

270
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.500
And thereby he established that it was indeed insects.

271
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.080
Mosquitoes and certain types of mosquitoes will be returning to that.

272
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.490
Not all mosquitoes,

273
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.580
just Milan unoften lien mosquitoes and certain species of them that uh,

274
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.140
transmitted the disease of malaria.
At the same time,

275
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.880
Ronald Ross,
a British physician in India,

276
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:24.720
was working in stead with malaria among the Aav,

277
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.350
that is birds,

278
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:31.410
avian malaria where he demonstrated that it too was transmitted by the bites of

279
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:33.910
mosquitoes.

280
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.630
And he argued by analogy that human malaria was probably transmitted by

281
00:23:40.181 --> 00:23:41.740
mosquitoes as well.

282
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.430
Now this was the age of a ferocious imperial rivalry and Ross was the first

283
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:53.201
British scientists to discover the pathogen of a major disease and he became a

284
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:55.250
national icon.

285
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.630
The British answer to pastor or call,

286
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.940
he won the Nobel prize.

287
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:07.240
And along with Manson became one of two decisive figures and the founding of the

288
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:13.160
discipline of tropical medicine.
And it was quite interesting that,
um,

289
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:18.220
there was an extraordinary collaboration between mountain and Ross in India

290
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.920
where Ross wrote home what he was finding under his microscope in India and sent

291
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.910
that back to Manson who,
uh,

292
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.940
worked with him in suggesting new directions for his research and pushed him

293
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:35.840
forward.
So in many ways,

294
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:41.020
the discovery of the transmission of malaria belonged to Manson as well as Ross.

295
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.010
Well,
in any case,
malaria became the template,

296
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.520
the ideal type of tropical diseases.

297
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.830
And in Manson's great work,

298
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.860
malaria occupies the largest amount of space in the volume.

299
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.580
The reasons being that it was a perfect Lee vector transmitted disease,

300
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.430
a perfect parasitic disease.

301
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.580
The plasmodium that causes it,

302
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.490
as we'll see in a couple of weeks,

303
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.020
lives in a closed cycle and never exists free.

304
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:22.310
And the environment,
human beings don't happen upon it.

305
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:28.180
And the plasmodium has an extremely complicated life cycle in both men and

306
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:30.230
mosquito.

307
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:35.980
And the involvement of the mosquito also is scientifically complicated.

308
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.860
Um,
in other words,
uh,
uh,

309
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:44.890
which useful and important that glossy was a naturalist as well as a physician.

310
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:51.940
So Paris otology was scientifically interesting and intellectually.

311
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:55.010
So to study malaria,

312
00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:59.150
ology one needed to be a physician but also an entomologist,

313
00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.810
a naturalist,
and to have a knowledge of the basic sciences.

314
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.450
So in nine 1898 for a whole generation,

315
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:13.750
Paris otology replaced bacteriology as the cutting edge of medical science and

316
00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:19.310
it became the foundation of this new discipline,

317
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.990
the rising discipline of tropical medicine.
Well,

318
00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:28.250
if that's how it emerges,
what is the new discipline?

319
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:35.660
Well,
Manson defined tropical medicine in his great work.

320
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.490
For him,

321
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:42.490
it was a special discipline with diseases of an area defined by geography and

322
00:26:44.851 --> 00:26:47.910
warm climate diseases.

323
00:26:47.911 --> 00:26:52.911
There he said we're unlike the diseases of the temperate zone and they require

324
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.580
therefore a special medical discipline to deal with them and they require

325
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:05.700
physicians who are specially trained in postgraduate institutes.

326
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:07.920
So for that reason,

327
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.040
tropical medicine emerged outside of established medical schools.

328
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.340
Prerequisite presuppose that physicians needed a special curriculum and training

329
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.180
to deal with diseases that were conceptually different.

330
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.600
For example,

331
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:33.110
in 1898 in association with Joseph Chamberlain,

332
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.390
the secretary of state for the colonies,

333
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:41.510
and you can see the role of the state in the promotion of this new discipline,

334
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:47.030
which was seen as important for the promotion of imperial interests.

335
00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.850
And with the collaboration of Patrick Manson,

336
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.940
there was founded the London School of Tropical Medicine with the specific

337
00:27:56.311 --> 00:27:58.320
intention of training.

338
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:03.320
Colonial medical officers in a new medical discipline or very closely associated

339
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.170
was the Liverpool School of tropical medicine.

340
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:16.640
Another idea that mountain said was essential to the new discipline was the

341
00:28:18.481 --> 00:28:22.860
tropical diseases were caused not usually by bacteria,

342
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:28.040
but by more complex biological agents with complex life cycles,

343
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.990
protozoa and helmets,

344
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.760
and that they were transmitted by insect vectors like mosquitoes,

345
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:37.860
the or the sets.
He flied.

346
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.160
Malaria had pride of place.

347
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.640
It was the ideal time to illustrate this.

348
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:49.641
And it's the first disease that Manson discusses on his work and the disease.

349
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:55.020
He discusses it greatest length.
There were others of this type.

350
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.970
Uh,
they're like,
uh,
trypanosomiasis,

351
00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:02.490
which was African sleeping sickness,

352
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.940
which was caused by a parasite awesome.

353
00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:11.160
That multiplies in the human bloodstream and causes skin eruptions,

354
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.470
anemia,
chronic fever,

355
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:18.590
debilitation lethargy and perhaps coma and death was transmitted by the Tetsy

356
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.810
flaw or there was [inaudible] myosis caused by worms with the snail as it ought

357
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:35.031
to alternative host or leishmaniasis or yellow fever,

358
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.750
a viral infection.
It was later discovered,

359
00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.420
transmitted by a certain species of mosquito.

360
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:47.980
Well so far,
uh,
if you were reading mountains work,

361
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.570
you would have found the diseases I've just mentioned would be the ones that you

362
00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:57.430
would have encountered and there was a kind of logical coherence to what they

363
00:29:57.431 --> 00:29:58.000
were.

364
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Diseases of places with warm climates transmitted by mosquitoes caused not by

365
00:30:04.271 --> 00:30:09.271
bacteria but rather by more complex life forms.

366
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:15.180
But Manson then goes on and what we see then is something of a grab bag of

367
00:30:16.811 --> 00:30:21.811
diseases that don't seem to have much of a scientific connecting link.

368
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:27.910
He mentions certain infectious bacterial diseases,

369
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.470
some of them very familiar to you already.
Bubonic plague,

370
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.870
Asiatic cholera.
He adds leprosy.

371
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:42.820
He then moves on to certain nutritional diseases.

372
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.020
Pellagra which is caused by a diff,

373
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.140
a deficiency of Niacin.

374
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:55.141
If your diet consists not of wheat but exclusively of corn or Barry Barry or

375
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:03.310
certain fungal diseases and even causes calls,
heat,

376
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:06.430
stroke,
a tropical disease.

377
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:13.720
Well,
another background factor was institutional,

378
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:19.500
should we call it the institutionalization of this new medical discipline that

379
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:23.950
is,
it coincides with the high point of European expansion.

380
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.980
And this wasn't just a coincidence,

381
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:31.900
it was an important instrument in the,
uh,

382
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.560
domination of African India for instance,

383
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.990
as important as gunpowder,

384
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:43.350
enabling settlers to run mines and plantations traders to travel administrators

385
00:31:44.951 --> 00:31:47.140
to govern missionaries,

386
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:50.860
to preach and soldiers to perform their duties.

387
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.990
So for this reason,

388
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.980
tropical medicine rapidly attracts governmental backing,

389
00:31:56.981 --> 00:32:01.981
certainly in the British case and institutional support and assistance from

390
00:32:02.531 --> 00:32:07.531
powerful economic interests with concerns in the tropical world.

391
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.690
So these institutions in Britain,

392
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:14.560
we've already talked about the London School of Tropical Medicine,

393
00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.800
the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine,

394
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.810
the Royal Society of tropical medicine and hygiene.

395
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.870
And it's embedded in a new major journal,

396
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.320
their journal of Tropical medicine and hygiene founded in 1895 in France.

397
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:37.270
We see the posture institute in the United States,

398
00:32:37.271 --> 00:32:40.700
such institutions as Johns Hopkins,

399
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:42.770
the Rockefeller Institute.

400
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.760
And in particular its international health division,

401
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.450
the American Academy of Tropical Medicine,

402
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.780
the American Society of Tropical Medicine.

403
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.490
And in the US there were a couple of distinctive features.

404
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.260
One was the Association of Tropical Medicine with the military,

405
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:08.570
and it's leading figures,
Walter Reed and William Gorgas.

406
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.760
We're in fact army officers

407
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:17.140
and it was in the western hemisphere to that yellow fever replaced malaria as

408
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.070
the quintessential tropical disease.

409
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:28.120
Some of the institutional links can be seen in specific cases.

410
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:29.390
And example,

411
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:34.391
that's recently been studied somewhat intensively is the relationship of the

412
00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:43.910
Harvard Department of Tropical Medicine to the colonial establishment of

413
00:33:43.911 --> 00:33:46.130
American power in Liberia.

414
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.600
And in particular the Firestone rubber plantations.

415
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:55.870
And one can see there the clear role of tropical medicine in promoting if we

416
00:33:57.981 --> 00:34:02.981
like the expansion of company interests to extract resources from Liberia.

417
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:11.860
This was an important illustration of the uses that tropical medicine Ah,

418
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.970
could be put to,
well,
what were some,

419
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.930
if that's what tropical medicine was as a discipline,

420
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.360
what were some of its implications?

421
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.290
The implications of the world view that it suggested.

422
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:33.890
One
is that Africa,

423
00:34:33.891 --> 00:34:38.690
Asia,
and Latin America had something in common.

424
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.260
Uh,

425
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:44.260
this was an artificial construction of European American imagination.

426
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:49.870
There were seen as reservoirs of disease is that threatened Europe,

427
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:56.770
Europe protected by the ramparts of civilization and medical science,

428
00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:02.630
so tropical medicine embodied down to a later period.

429
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.660
Certainly in this period down to the first world war or Eurocentric worldview.

430
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:14.890
It was initially not responsive to specific locations as the tropics where

431
00:35:16.161 --> 00:35:21.161
artificially constructed as some single homogeneous place.

432
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.610
<v 1>Okay.</v>

433
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.260
<v 0>The natives of the tropics,</v>

434
00:35:25.261 --> 00:35:30.261
we're also conceptualized as somehow dangerous harboring a vast array of lethal

435
00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:35.280
and highly contagious diseases.

436
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.610
Another implication

437
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:44.180
<v 1>was the tropical medicine was concerned for the early in the early decades of</v>

438
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:46.230
the new century,

439
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.270
primarily overwhelmingly with the help of Europeans,

440
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.530
sutlers administrators' missionaries and soldiers.

441
00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.390
There was little concern for the health of the indigenous population.

442
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.011
Indeed,

443
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:07.011
the medical problems of the colonial world that received attention were those

444
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.420
the threatened Europeans,

445
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.500
not the health problems and the indigenous population.

446
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.780
There was little attention to the social and economic determinants of what we

447
00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:23.220
might today call third world problems,
health of health,

448
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.970
such as poverty,
labor conditions,
malnutrition,

449
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.640
and there was a neglect of major diseases that were often the major health

450
00:36:32.641 --> 00:36:34.890
problems of the local population,

451
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.150
say dysentery or gonorrhea,
pneumonia,

452
00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:43.200
tuberculosis in recent years.
In fact,

453
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:48.620
the blindness of the past has even resulted in new international attention to a

454
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:54.441
group of diseases termed neglected tropical diseases that cause large scale

455
00:36:55.831 --> 00:37:00.660
suffering through poverty such as poverty,
low productivity,

456
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.030
poor pregnancy outcomes,

457
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:08.540
but not for decades were received little funding or attention from policymakers.

458
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.820
Okay.

459
00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.290
<v 0>More ironically,</v>

460
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.480
a major issue not considered after World War One,
as I said,

461
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.540
was the health of an impact of colonialism itself on the inhabitants of the

462
00:37:28.551 --> 00:37:30.680
tropical world.
That is,

463
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:35.770
there was no attention to the way in which colonialism itself contributed to

464
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:41.381
environmental degradation or promoted labor mobility and unsanitary conditions.

465
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.070
The way in which it promoted unplanned urbanization,

466
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.730
low educational attainment and poverty.

467
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.003
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

468
00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.670
<v 0>In fact,
this period,</v>

469
00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:02.730
the first period of tropical medicine from 1892 just after the first world war

470
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:05.650
was a time,

471
00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:10.890
one of the times of the greatest epidemiological disasters in the tropical world

472
00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:17.010
with virgin soil epidemics like small pox and measles and the impact of what was

473
00:38:20.891 --> 00:38:25.660
called constructive imperialism,
railroads,
roads,

474
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:26.650
trade,

475
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.650
the transportation revolution all enabled a pandemic of bubonic plague from the

476
00:38:34.031 --> 00:38:39.031
1890 to 1920s and epidemic influenza in 1918 and 19 to occur in the tropical

477
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:46.030
world as well.
Colonial wars,

478
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:51.150
the involvement of the colonies in the two world wars had major disease impacts,

479
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.970
so did the ecological impact of railroads,
factories,

480
00:38:57.971 --> 00:39:02.050
mines and plantations,
and the recruitment of migrant labor.

481
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.110
So justice in the case that we examined at greater length in your reading of

482
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:13.111
North America disease played an important part in European expansion.

483
00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:20.980
Another implication was public health policy in Europe and North America.

484
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:29.280
Hygiene had given rise to a broad gauge sanitarian movement,

485
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:36.240
one that reformed urban living conditions through what we might call a in

486
00:39:36.901 --> 00:39:40.270
introducing a new jargon into our course,

487
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:44.980
horizontal programs of public health.

488
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.760
That is improvements that dealt with living conditions across a broad spectrum

489
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.380
of diseases.

490
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:59.370
We've seen that in the sanitary movement and the tropics.

491
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:00.460
Instead,

492
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.640
metropolitan powers apply to different vision of what was called vertical

493
00:40:06.311 --> 00:40:10.840
hygiene or tropical hygiene.
Now,

494
00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:15.841
vertical campaigns of public health targeted instead single diseases,

495
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:22.140
and they were designed to protect above all Europeans against the most menacing

496
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:27.400
epidemics.
That was tropical hygiene.

497
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:32.110
Then something different from what was practiced at the same time in Europe was

498
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:33.520
one of the implications.

499
00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:38.760
Another implication was a new prestige and authority for physicians.

500
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.880
Ros and Caulk,
for example,

501
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
now became advisers to metropolitan governments as did Manson.

502
00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:54.660
It meant also another implication was perhaps what we might call a selective

503
00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.300
historical amnesia.

504
00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:04.290
Many of the diseases identified as tropical had only recently been present in

505
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:11.170
Europe and they weren't eradicated by temperature,

506
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.530
but by broad social and economic improvements.

507
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.180
Malaria itself had been a European disease as you know,

508
00:41:19.181 --> 00:41:21.790
bubonic plague and cholera.
Awesome.

509
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:28.320
And then tropical medicine was clearly an instrument of cultural and ideological

510
00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:30.244
hegemony.

511
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.720
It was a justification and rationale for colonialism.

512
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.100
Europeans felt that they had health and civilization to offer,

513
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.620
and that medicine was a means of winning acceptance of the colonial prejudice,

514
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.390
uh,
presence.

515
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:52.840
So tropical medicine provided a narrative of European progress,

516
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.410
rationale,
rationality and civilization,

517
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.630
overcoming ignorance,
superstition,
darkness,

518
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.790
and the witchcraft of natives.

519
00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.480
Patrick Manson was very explicit in his vision of the relationship of medicine,

520
00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:15.920
an empire.
And as simple sentence,
he declared,

521
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.700
I believe in the colonization of the world by the white race.

522
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.400
Well,
that was the early period of tropical medicine,

523
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:32.480
uh,
between 1890,
more or less.

524
00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.290
And just other period after the first world war.

525
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.960
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

526
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.960
<v 0>Later we see a transformation in the discipline and I don't want to argue that</v>

527
00:42:44.111 --> 00:42:49.111
it's the same today as it was at the eve of the first world war.

528
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:56.100
Radical radical changes in tropical medicine came through a number of

529
00:42:56.621 --> 00:43:01.120
influences.
One was the second world war itself,

530
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.370
which was in part,

531
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:08.140
and although there were deep contradictions involved in it,

532
00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:11.860
it wasn't part,
at least a war against racialism.

533
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.733
Um,

534
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:19.090
the discipline was affected by decolonization.

535
00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:20.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

536
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:25.700
<v 0>Also by the rise of American hegemony it Germany after World War show with new</v>

537
00:43:28.081 --> 00:43:29.460
priorities.

538
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:35.870
It was influenced by globalization as an explicit idea and its implications that

539
00:43:38.131 --> 00:43:43.131
we all live in a single disease environment and that what happens in distant

540
00:43:44.431 --> 00:43:49.431
parts of the world or also vitally important for the entire world population.

541
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:52.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

542
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.640
<v 0>And then there was,</v>

543
00:43:53.641 --> 00:43:58.641
what was very important also was a transformation in funding because of those

544
00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:05.910
factors around then during the 1970s,

545
00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:11.210
the World Health Organization introduced a major new emphasis on tropical

546
00:44:12.241 --> 00:44:16.230
diseases and with it in 1975,

547
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:18.600
a major new research project.

548
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.620
The same happened with the Rockefeller Foundation in the 1970s and then the

549
00:44:26.521 --> 00:44:29.340
MacArthur foundation there afterwards.

550
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:35.060
And this meant a new dynamism scientifically for the discipline of tropical

551
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:40.440
medicine.
And also,
uh,
with that,
uh,

552
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:45.441
major attention are reversing an earlier trend with an emphasis on global health

553
00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:53.091
programs that would be applicable everywhere and that would include major

554
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:59.151
attention to the health of the population of indigenous peoples in areas would

555
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:06.540
had been neglected by an earlier phase of tropical medicine.

556
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.210
And so the entire discipline,
if we like,

557
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:14.330
which transformed after World War II and became something that no longer

558
00:45:14.731 --> 00:45:19.731
embodied a colonial position and no longer embodied,

559
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:24.750
um,
the idea that it was the bodies of Europeans,

560
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:29.870
that jurors are privileged protection rather than the health of indigenous

561
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:32.970
peoples in other parts of the world.

562
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:38.060
So tropical medicine was a very important instrument of colonial power in the

563
00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:44.040
period down to the first world war,

564
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.590
and it was slowly transformed,
um,

565
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.380
in the interwar period and radically so,
um,

566
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.020
after World War II.

567
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:57.530
So I hope you'll bear that in mind as you think about the issue of what is,

568
00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.980
are the implications of medical science and what are its implications for the

569
00:46:04.111 --> 00:46:07.350
kinds of society and the world that we live in.
