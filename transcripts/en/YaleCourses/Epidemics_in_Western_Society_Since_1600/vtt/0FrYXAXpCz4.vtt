WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.240
And with that I'd like to turn to our subject for the morning,

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.260
which is about the third.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.290
It's the third in our series of lectures on bubonic plague and I'd like to talk

4
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.010
about the effects or some of the effects of Boob onic plague on European

5
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:23.580
culture.

6
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.580
We've been trying to suggest that plague had a major impact on European society

7
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.820
and I want to be arguing that that impact was felt not only on political events

8
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.540
but also on culture and intellectual life.

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.990
And I'd like to look at that this morning,

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.320
but I wanted to remember that when we're talking about those effects,

11
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.930
I'll be trying to say it was the effects not only of play gets self as a

12
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:55.110
disease,

13
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.290
but also the impact of the organized reaction to plague of the anti plague

14
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:06.591
measures and the sense that for the first time society had means that were

15
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:11.661
effective and could protect itself against this dreadful outside visitor.

16
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.270
Well,
let's start again at the beginning and as you know,

17
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:23.271
there is a biblical interpretation for the themes of this course and this is the

18
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:30.210
one that you're now well familiar with.
This is the fall.

19
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690
This is Adam and Eve,
uh,

20
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.500
as painted by the greatest of all,
perhaps the greatest of all,

21
00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:38.640
plagued painters.

22
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.870
Jacobo Tintoretto who was a painter in Venice and lived from 15,

23
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.770
18 to 1594.
Well,
you know,

24
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.800
this is the story of genesis that Adam and eve tasted of the fruit,

25
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.460
that they were forbidden and as a result,

26
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.820
they were expelled from the garden and for the first time became subject to

27
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.750
death and also to disease and illness.

28
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.070
And if we move forward,
uh,

29
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.070
this is the next step.
You saw the original sin.

30
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.770
This is massage shows,
uh,

31
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.860
one of the great painters of the Italian renaissance.

32
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.070
This is his painting and the Brancaccio chapel in Florence of the expulsion from

33
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:30.300
the garden.
And you know,
they're looking extremely miserable.

34
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:35.301
Not only are they going to die and become ill and experienced pain in

35
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.510
childbirth,
but they're also,
and I'm sorry about this,

36
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:41.980
they're going to have to work.
So,
uh,

37
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
this is a tremendously painful experience and you can see the pain written and

38
00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:51.060
their faces,
uh,
of Adam and eve.

39
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.510
So that in a way is a story of our course.

40
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.050
And I'd like to talk now about some attitudes towards what followed that his

41
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.630
illness and death.
Just before the arrival of the block,

42
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.280
and I'd like to refer to the work of a French historian who died fairly recently

43
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.420
and was one of the great,
perhaps historian of death.

44
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.210
His name is Felipe Audios.

45
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.590
And he had an idea that before the black death,

46
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.240
he talked a bit as death tamed.
That is,

47
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.890
there were ways that people had beliefs,
practices,

48
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.750
and rituals that help them to face the issue of our mortality,

49
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.240
to cope with loss,

50
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.520
to heal the tear that was caused in a family or community,

51
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.220
the loss of a member of a family,

52
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.330
and also to express grief and Depay ones,

53
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.830
last respects.

54
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.430
And there were two great aids in doing that.

55
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.780
One we might say was the RS Modi MD,

56
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.150
which was the art of dying.

57
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:09.130
There were certain rules that you should be aware of that would prepare you for

58
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:13.570
the final moment and the passage from this life to the next.

59
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.590
And then there were what were called a Momento Morty,

60
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.220
which is a reminder of death.
That is a reminder.

61
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:26.221
You should surround yourself with reminders that it's time to get ready because

62
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:31.780
any day could be the last and death could come very soon.

63
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.770
We'll see the art of dying portrayed and instructions sometimes in paintings or

64
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:42.120
engravings also in books.
Uh,

65
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.850
how did I properly according to Christian doctrine,

66
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.650
who should be there?
What are the last rites?
That is extreme unction,

67
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.140
the final confession of sins,

68
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.330
the last communion and [inaudible],
the funeral rites,

69
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.820
the laying out of the body,
the wake,

70
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.890
the procession with perhaps a town crier announcing the event,

71
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.250
the funeral service and a burial ceremony with the blessing and internment and

72
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.540
consecrated ground.

73
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.930
And finally a funeral meal for surviving friends and relatives.

74
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.100
Leading themes in this are,
um,

75
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.990
themes of solidarity,
dignity and community.

76
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.410
And in this slide if the artist more and we see a dying person and habiting two

77
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:39.910
worlds,
the natural world,
he's about to leave with possessions,

78
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:40.690
friends,

79
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.690
family and home and a supernatural world he's about to enter and that only he

80
00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:47.284
can see,

81
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.590
but as represented by angels and devils vying for his soul.

82
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.650
We can also see in another example by Nicola Prusa,

83
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.450
also seventh great 17th century French painter who this is a painting of extreme

84
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.783
unction.

85
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.900
It's an illustration of the good death to which everyone should aspire.

86
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.420
Now the 17th century,

87
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.080
the time of Defoe's great work also witnessed in Britain the publication of the

88
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:31.121
work of one of the most famous of all riders on the theme of ours,

89
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:33.740
Morty and the art of dying.

90
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.130
That was the extraordinary Anglican preacher and Bishop Jeremy Taylor,

91
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.620
who lived from 1613 to 1667 and wrote two major works,

92
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.850
both of which have gone through edition after edition.

93
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:52.730
They were so popular and so influential.

94
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.030
The first was called the rule and exercises of holy living of 1650 and the other

95
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.430
was the rule,

96
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:06.431
an exercise of holy dying of 1651 Taylor argued that this life is short and

97
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:15.731
unimportant and so we should use our time primarily to prepare for the eternal

98
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:18.710
world,

99
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.520
making certain that we die with our worldly affairs in good order and with our

100
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:30.671
souls in a state of grace prepared to meet our maker on Judgment Day,

101
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.591
his books.

102
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:38.591
Then we're instruction instructional manuals on how to do that and he reminds us

103
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:42.950
that there really isn't a moment to waste,

104
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.240
especially with the threat of plague ever present with sudden death.

105
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.670
That could happen at any moment now.

106
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:59.050
So Felipe rds thinks then the opposite of the good death is death by bubonic

107
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:02.384
plague.

108
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.080
That is something we might call death unleashed a sudden mass death for which

109
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:14.120
society had no defenses and to no prep,

110
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.710
no one was prepared.

111
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.880
This was the sudden death is more as the day pen Tina sudden death,

112
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.320
which was always feared because sudden death catches a victim unprepared with

113
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:30.801
his will,

114
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:35.801
unwritten in this world and his soul in a state of sin that could lead to

115
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:41.531
eternal damnation and the next and death from plague was not only sudden,

116
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.700
but as we know now agonizing and dehumanizing,

117
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:52.210
it often meant that the software was alone and abandoned and it was death

118
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.610
without the attentions of the clergy without funeral rites and proper burial

119
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.200
where your body was hurled unceremoniously into a mass plague pit burned perhaps

120
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.570
thrown into the sea,

121
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.600
picked over by vultures and crows nor remember.

122
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.970
Don't think that this fear of Moore's rape and Tina was something medieval and

123
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:22.080
very distant from us or simply early modern.

124
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.830
The historian drew Faust and her extraordinary recent book on the American Civil

125
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.340
War.

126
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.340
This republic of suffering places the fear precisely of Moore's today,

127
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:39.360
Penn,
Tina,
at the center of her account of the civil war,

128
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.350
it was a widespread anxiety pervasive among the soldiers on both sides of the

129
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.010
conflict and it recurred again,

130
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:52.770
again in the letters they wrote home.

131
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.190
Total war like boob.

132
00:09:55.191 --> 00:10:00.191
Onic plague provides unlimited opportunity for an unprepared in sudden death

133
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.540
that could set us all on the wrong path for eternal life.

134
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.251
Well,

135
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:13.251
literature also gives expression to this new and horrifying reality.

136
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.310
You've seen Boccaccio and his introduction to the Decameron.

137
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.850
You're reading defoe and the Journal of the plague year.

138
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.710
You could read about it again.

139
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.830
Income moves the plague or Edgar Allen Poe's short story masque of the red

140
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:30.114
death.

141
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.870
Remember too that another aspect of Moore's rape and Tina the sudden unprepared

142
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:40.410
death was the fear of premature burial.

143
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.480
The certification of death in the early modern world,

144
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.520
say at the time defoe was writing was extremely imprecise.

145
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.360
The only really certain indication was putrefaction and so those religious

146
00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:02.751
rights of laying out the wake or the funeral procession and so forth were

147
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:07.920
practical that they allow time and they insured.

148
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.370
Observation to be certain that the dead person really was dead before being

149
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:18.000
interred.
But plague.
On the other hand,

150
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.680
we've seen the plague regulations.
They mentioned stead or rapid,

151
00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:26.220
hasty burial with no attention and no observation.

152
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.400
An isolation raised a real danger of being buried alive and in time of epidemic

153
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:38.250
diseases that swept populations,
this fear of death,

154
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.320
which was very pervasive and we'll come back to it when we talk about cholera in

155
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:46.110
the 19th century when funeral,

156
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:51.130
the Sarah Cemeteries had all sorts of experiments with providing caskets with

157
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:56.781
little bells above and a rope underground so that someone could raise the alarm

158
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.010
if they woke up unexpectedly.

159
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.230
So the plague then really led to death unleashed.

160
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.480
So let's look at some of the portrayals of it and painting and sculpture from

161
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:13.120
the plague.
Centuries of this second pound Denman,

162
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.570
remember from 1347 to 1743 here's a bas relief of PR PJ.

163
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.590
This was the plague in Marsay.
Um,

164
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.130
and uh,

165
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.980
I think one can see the extraordinary portrayal.

166
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.540
I wanted to move on them to this particular painting.

167
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.810
One of the most important of the plague years.

168
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.990
And this again is Pusan whom you saw earlier telling you how to die properly,

169
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.340
what the good death should look like,
who should be there and all the rest.

170
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.520
This is his famous painting of 1631 now in the Louvre in Paris called the plague

171
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.960
of Ashdod.
Let remont me remind you,

172
00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:05.290
it's again a biblically inspired painting.

173
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.320
Let remind you of what osh dog was.

174
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:12.640
The story is from the first book of Samuel in the Old Testament.

175
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.620
Asha Dodd was a city in the holy land near Gaza,

176
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:23.220
occupied in biblical times by the Philistines who worshiped the idol Dagon the

177
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.550
Philistines,

178
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:32.550
defied the Israel lights in battle and confiscated the Ark of the Covenant as

179
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:38.311
war booty and set it up in the temple of Dagon in our stock.

180
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.190
And so the book of Samuel tells us,

181
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.120
and so it was the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great

182
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:55.120
destruction and the Lord smote the men of the city,

183
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.220
both small and great,

184
00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.850
and they had Mrr odds in their secret parts.

185
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:06.290
A special reward to any of you who can tell me what an Mri rod actually is.

186
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.383
But anyway,

187
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.620
this slide is about the destruction of the Great Temple of Dagon.

188
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.490
You can see that here.
This may be,
uh,

189
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.480
the Ark of the covenant.
It is,
then again,

190
00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:24.481
we can see it's a representation and painting of plague as being a punishment

191
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.250
for divine anger and for sin.
The,

192
00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.230
some of the things we can note our,

193
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:36.040
the gruesome and particular particular details,

194
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.870
we can see that there are rats scurrying.
Um,
you know,

195
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:44.890
the role that routes played in play.
Let's look here.

196
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:49.120
We can see our friend Rob Roth tourists,
uh,

197
00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:50.860
playing a starring role,

198
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.600
or let's notice again in the foreground,
um,

199
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.560
the attempt,
the terrifying haunting attempt of a baby,

200
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.950
uh,
to suckle.
It's mother who's dying.
I'm sorry,

201
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:06.380
that was in the preceding.
Uh,

202
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.180
and that's here in the foreground a,
and we'll look at this

203
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.560
person here,
uh,

204
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.570
and we can see the pastor by holding his nose because of the stench of the

205
00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:23.690
victims and the fear of Miasma.

206
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.760
Or let's look at another portrayal.

207
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.600
And this is Pedro Gaetano.
Uh,

208
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.760
the plague of the late 17th century,

209
00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.360
or quite a terrifying picture of by [inaudible] Datta the plague of Naples in

210
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.530
1656.
And while we look at this,

211
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:51.110
let's think of the reference that it's making.

212
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:56.110
You can see that things are happening in the heavens and this is Naples being

213
00:15:56.661 --> 00:16:01.050
devastated by the plague,
their plague pits and all the rest of it.

214
00:16:01.051 --> 00:16:05.450
And this picture,
I think we should remember how people thought of this.

215
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:10.040
It seemed to be an acting out of the book of revelations,

216
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:13.760
the day of the apocalypse,
the dacs that I,

217
00:16:13.761 --> 00:16:16.580
the day of Wrath and the Lord's judgment.

218
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.860
When the lamb opened the SA great book closed with seven seals.

219
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:26.870
And that's the reference in Bergman's film to the seventh seal.

220
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.060
And in the book of revelations,

221
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:34.190
let me remind you of what people were thinking at times like this.

222
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.200
In chapter six,
it says,

223
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:41.320
and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I saw and behold there was a

224
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:48.200
white horse and he that sat on him how to bow and he went forth,

225
00:16:48.201 --> 00:16:51.680
conquering and to conquer.
And we need open.

226
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:56.681
The second seal there went out another horse that was red and power was given to

227
00:16:56.871 --> 00:17:01.871
him that sat there on to take peace from the earth that they should kill one

228
00:17:01.881 --> 00:17:05.240
another.
And when he had opened the third seal,

229
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:10.390
I beheld a black horse and he that sat on him at a pair of balances in his hand

230
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.670
and he opened the fourth seal.

231
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:19.180
I looked and beheld a pale horse and he that sat on him was death and hell

232
00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:24.350
followed with him.
At last,

233
00:17:24.351 --> 00:17:29.351
the lamb opened the seventh seal and seven angels appeared bringing the wrath of

234
00:17:30.261 --> 00:17:34.670
God.
There was thunder lightening and earthquake.

235
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.530
The sea turned to blood.
The grasses were burned up,

236
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.480
the water's turned to warm wood.

237
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.590
The Sun and moon were smitten on a bottomless pit open.

238
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.310
And I saw another sign in the heavens,
great and marvelous,

239
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.580
seven angels bringing the seven last plagues for in them.

240
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.010
It's filled up the wrath of God.

241
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:04.550
And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels,

242
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.070
go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.

243
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.760
And the seventh angel poured out his file into the air and then came a great

244
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:19.680
voice saying it has done.

245
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.090
I think that's what's happening in the heavens here.

246
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:30.590
We'll other examples of death unleashed are portrayed in the theme that was

247
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:38.190
common in European painting in uh,

248
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.300
the time of bubonic plague during the plague centuries.

249
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.210
And that's the theme of the triumph of death,

250
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.070
which is often complete with the horsemen of the apocalypse.

251
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:51.870
That I just read you about.

252
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.090
Under usual scene is a great cart pulled by oxen,

253
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.950
driven by the figure of death wielding a great side.

254
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.820
Well before him there goes the angel of death blowing the trumpet and all around

255
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:13.071
you may see dead people and graves that are opening and skeletons.

256
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.490
Let me give you

257
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.830
one of the scariest paintings.
I know.

258
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.010
This is Peter Broil goal,

259
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:28.070
the elder who lived in the 16th century and this is the triumph of death now

260
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:33.180
hanging in the pronto in were in Madrid.

261
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.740
And if you look at the details,
I think it becomes all the more disturbing.

262
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.170
The closer you look at it,

263
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:45.171
you see death coming with his side and mowing down the population in their

264
00:19:47.131 --> 00:19:50.570
mouses,
which is what bubonic plague,
uh,

265
00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:55.230
does in particular.
Or we can look at another artist,

266
00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.860
and this is under on Montana who died in 1506,

267
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.050
his painting the triumph of death.

268
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:10.730
There were other new themes in European art that emerge during the plague

269
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.980
centuries.
And one of these that are showing a minute,
which is not this,
uh,

270
00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:21.981
but we'll be the theme of Vonda toss a new theme in European art during the

271
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:24.330
plague.

272
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:29.330
Centuries when death was unleashed in Europe repeatedly Vonda toss as a theme

273
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.100
flowered in the 16th and 17th centuries.
Now what did it mean?
Well,

274
00:20:37.101 --> 00:20:42.101
Vanitas toss paintings were meant to display the temp rolled goods of this

275
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:46.650
world.
Flowers,
perhaps fruits,

276
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.230
symbols of learning and culture,

277
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:55.231
such as musical instruments or books or signs of earthly achievement in wealth

278
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.880
like gold and jewels.

279
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:03.810
But they're juxtapose to striking and more shocking symbols of what's meant to

280
00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:09.481
be the deeper reality of this transitory fragile life that we live and the

281
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:13.240
imminence of death.

282
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.590
And so alongside these earthly things,

283
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.660
you'll see a skull,

284
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.620
a candle who's flame is just going out an hour glass marking the passage of

285
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:30.460
time,
the crossbones.

286
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.060
And the message is not also is a biblical one vanity from Ecclesiastes.

287
00:21:36.891 --> 00:21:40.330
He's,
let me just read you a sentence.
What profit?

288
00:21:40.331 --> 00:21:44.200
Half the men of his Labor under the sun,

289
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.800
one generation passeth away,
and another generation come

290
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.250
in an age of sudden mass death.

291
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.120
Human achievement was few tile and in permanent.

292
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.390
And you should instead be preparing yourselves for the true reality of death and

293
00:22:04.181 --> 00:22:05.710
the everlasting life.

294
00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.340
Now this we can see directly linked to what you're reading about Jen to fall

295
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:17.640
here we have the bill London bills of mortality and 1664 to five years that you

296
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:21.340
know,
and they're coming to love.

297
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.760
And this is the illustration that introduced the bills and it helps us to make

298
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:32.251
the direct connection between Plagge and the iconography I've just been talking

299
00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:33.130
about.

300
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:38.130
You'll notice that the symbols are the classic Vonda toss symbols of the 17th

301
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:42.790
century.
You see the skeleton,
the crossbones,
the shovel,

302
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.590
um,
and all the rest of it.
All around the edges,
the skull,

303
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.710
the hour glass here,
the time is running out.

304
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.800
And indeed you'll see right here that this is the inscription is Memento Mori.

305
00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:01.350
This is to remind you that death is coming and could strike at any moment and

306
00:23:02.201 --> 00:23:03.700
you had best prepare.

307
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.960
Or let's look at another painting of this century.

308
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:12.190
He's these centuries.
This is Lucas Fortune Nagel.
Well,

309
00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:16.660
this actually isn't,
I'm sorry,
this is a different one,
but let me move.

310
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.640
You can see in this painting again,
the candle going out.

311
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.120
You can see the skull and human achievements,

312
00:23:25.121 --> 00:23:29.950
all our vanity,
um,
as the,
the lesson or this rather,

313
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:35.190
this is the one I was mentioning Luteus Fortunate Eagle in the 16th century in

314
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:40.540
Germany.
This is Hans Bork Meyer and his wife,
uh,

315
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:42.580
painting a 15,
27.

316
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.670
And the point is that they're looking in the mirror,

317
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.550
they shade the true reality of themselves,

318
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.980
which is their skulls after death.

319
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:57.310
And so this is reminding us that this is the true reality that lies beneath all

320
00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:01.490
of us.
Or let's look at another painting.

321
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.860
This is Herman stain.

322
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:08.090
Vike a painting called Vanitas of 1640.

323
00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:12.560
I'm trying to show you paintings from different countries from England,
France,

324
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.680
the low countries,
Germany and so on.
Uh,

325
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:20.681
this is the low countries and this painting hells in Leiden and uh,

326
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:25.370
is quite clearly about exactly what we've been talking about.

327
00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:26.061
The candle,

328
00:24:26.061 --> 00:24:31.061
the skull or the books that are evanescent or more subtly,

329
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:36.710
but quite famously,
this is Hans Holbein,
the youngers painting,
um,

330
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.660
called the ambassadors,

331
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.650
which now hangs in London and the National Gallery.

332
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.180
It's an icon,

333
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.290
ironic commentary on the Court of Henry the eighth,

334
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.780
all about the painting.

335
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:55.730
You see the display of symbols of wealth,
power and learning,

336
00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.530
elegant costumes,
the globe,
the book,
musical instruments,

337
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:05.830
but in some bird juxtaposition to the mall is an apparent smudge in the

338
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:11.690
foreground of the painting.
But if you look at it closely,

339
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.370
what it actually is,

340
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:18.460
is a large and perfectly constructed skull seen from a different perspective.

341
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.110
A technique known as an hour,

342
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:27.140
an a morphosis or let's look at one more Vonda toss.

343
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.190
This is Renard descent on today.

344
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:36.140
17th century painting called appropriately Ivana Toss.

345
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.060
I think you've got the picture.

346
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.460
Another theme of the centuries Ah,

347
00:25:43.461 --> 00:25:48.461
of death unleashed is the theme called the dense dos macabre the dance of death.

348
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.280
Now let me stress that once again,

349
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.680
this is not a school of painting.

350
00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.890
This is part of the AIGA and iconography.

351
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.320
It's the theme in the painting.

352
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:11.080
It appears as a common motif in European art from the mid 14th century to the

353
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:18.011
16th and paintings and prints and very importantly on tombstones.

354
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.400
It began with the black death and with the 18th century and the vanishing of the

355
00:26:25.191 --> 00:26:28.610
plague.
It becomes rarer and rarer.

356
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.860
It more or less fades out.

357
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:36.020
The dos macabre portrays death as a skeleton,

358
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.540
inviting people of all ages,

359
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.630
ranks and sexes to join in the merry dance of death and death is usually armed

360
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:52.400
with a sigh or an outro or dark and often plays a musical instrument.

361
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:57.060
In the words of the Catholic encyclopedia,

362
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:01.920
the Bach death brought before popular imagination,

363
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:07.260
the subject of death,
and it's universal sway as never before.

364
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.050
At this time,
death appeared as the Messenger of God,
some mending,

365
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.600
mend the world beyond the grave.

366
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.480
During those years,
many churches lit and knock,

367
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:25.490
did literal dances of death or transformed it into a play conveying the idea of

368
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:31.881
the fragility of life and the near notice of death and the need for repentance.

369
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.950
There are other examples and I'd like to show you five slides from Saint Mary's

370
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.550
Church of Lubeck in Germany,

371
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:50.120
a glorious mural from 1463 one of the glories of the renaissance in Germany,

372
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:57.290
but unfortunately it was destroyed by allied bombing in the war and so there's

373
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:01.650
only a black and white reproduction that I can show you,

374
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:07.310
but the theme comes across quite clearly and is a good example of the dance

375
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:08.460
macabre.

376
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.910
What it is is a portrayal and separate paintings of a whole society suddenly

377
00:28:15.241 --> 00:28:19.800
summoned by the angel of death,
the bubonic plague.

378
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.450
The first one is the pope and the emperor being summoned by death.

379
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.610
It doesn't matter who you are,

380
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.330
everyone falls victim and time of plague.

381
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:31.831
We're here.

382
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:36.831
We see another level of society that cannon and a nobleman being called again by

383
00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:43.311
death or the third is the parish priests and the artists and who are also being

384
00:28:47.641 --> 00:28:52.641
asked to take part in the dance and then the priest and peasant,

385
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:57.630
the whole of society in other words,

386
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.440
is being stricken by mass death.

387
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.860
And here we have youth,
a maiden and a baby,

388
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.210
so we have a portrayal in a sense of universal death.

389
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.560
This was important in the time of bubonic plague.

390
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:19.350
There was another major development of the plague centuries and this was the

391
00:29:19.351 --> 00:29:23.430
emergence of cults of famous plague saints,

392
00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:25.860
Saint Sebastian,

393
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:30.180
Sun Rocco and St George.

394
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.440
And let's look then at four pictures of Saint Sebastian from four of the great

395
00:29:36.961 --> 00:29:38.820
artists of the plague era.

396
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:43.910
You remember why Saint Sebastian was so important because the hours were symbols

397
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:49.591
of the plague and Saint Sebastian is offering his body to defend humanity

398
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.600
against the wrath of the Lord.

399
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.680
And Saint Sebastian is a theme who becomes very important in these centuries.

400
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.000
For the first time in European painting.
This is Sandro Botticelli,

401
00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:11.350
Lee's painting of Saint Sebastian of 1484.

402
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.400
Or let me show you another major painter.

403
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.950
Raw feels Saint Sebastian,
or let me show you.

404
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:21.610
We will.

405
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:26.610
Nice picture of him or finally from the low countries,

406
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.010
Hendrick tear,

407
00:30:30.011 --> 00:30:34.000
Brogan's early 17th century painting,

408
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.390
1635 Saint Sebastian.

409
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.330
It was also,
as I said,
a time of cult,
the cult of another saint.

410
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.980
And this is sound,
or we can call him son at all call.

411
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.320
You know,
his life already.

412
00:30:50.321 --> 00:30:55.321
He was from Montpellier in France and devoted himself during his travels to

413
00:30:56.951 --> 00:30:59.980
tending the plague stricken,
uh,

414
00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.460
in Italy and protecting the faithful.

415
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.130
He was after his death.

416
00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:11.131
Then his intercession was invoked across Europe and it's called spread from

417
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:14.470
country to country.

418
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:21.820
Often we see Sebastian and Rocco painted together.

419
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:26.440
This is Andrea dominant on know Christ,
embracing the saints.

420
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.150
Sebastian here to his right and son Rocco to his left.

421
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.350
And you can almost always tell that son that Oracle has,
uh,

422
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.760
the blue bowl on his thigh.
Uh,

423
00:31:37.761 --> 00:31:42.190
it's clearly the bubonic plague that's being referred to,
um,

424
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.520
here or Francesco Vicenza Leo,

425
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.520
this is the Madonna,
uh,
between Sebastian,

426
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:56.350
um,
here and sanded Alcor.
Um,

427
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.360
there in addition,

428
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:03.280
that was larger scale than just paintings.
It also,
uh,

429
00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:08.281
affected architecture across Europe and churches were built to sun all go across

430
00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:13.450
Europe,
in France,
in Austria,
in Vienna and Rome.

431
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:19.170
But I think if we're going to talk about plague and its impact on the built

432
00:32:19.211 --> 00:32:22.780
environment and architecture as well as painting,

433
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.790
I think the best place we could go is Venice.
Venice,

434
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.110
as you know,
because of its site in the Mediterranean,

435
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:37.140
at the center of the trade routes was scourged again and again by bubonic plague

436
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.770
and was the place that first devise the anti plague measures.

437
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.830
So Venice has a deep association with bluebonnet plague and it's left its

438
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:52.730
imprint in stone and on canvas.

439
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:57.710
So I'd like to look at some of,
if you were to visit the Venetian Venice,

440
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.800
you would see that it's whole urban landscape is deeply affected by Buena phonic

441
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:04.580
Plagge.
Also,

442
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:08.870
even the gondolas are in fact our reference.

443
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.700
That's why their block two,

444
00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:15.320
bubonic plague from conveying the bodies the time.

445
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.650
This is the church in the of Saint Mary of health of the fifth can built in the

446
00:33:23.361 --> 00:33:24.680
1530s.

447
00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.510
And what it's doing is it after the plague had passed.

448
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.840
This is a church that's built to commemorate the passage of plague and to thank

449
00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:40.811
God for allowing his wrath to be assuage and for health to be returned.

450
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.120
And so that's why we have one of the most important churches in Venice is Saint

451
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.110
Mary of health.

452
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.780
And these are a couple of closer pictures of it.

453
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.410
And that's moving into the interior.

454
00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.300
Let me also show you another church.

455
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:07.540
This is the Church of the redeemer and it's a church also built a at time of

456
00:34:10.791 --> 00:34:15.791
plague to thank God for the assuaging of his wrath and the survival of the city.

457
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.020
A closer picture and the uh,
we'll move on.

458
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:27.590
This is the,
uh,
again,

459
00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:31.490
one of the glories of the nation art.

460
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:37.070
It's called the,
uh,
squallor going on the sun that all call,

461
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:42.000
which is the great school of song and Alcor.

462
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:45.830
Let's remember what the school meant.

463
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:51.250
There were so 300 or so called schools at Venice in the 16th and 17th centuries.

464
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:58.250
What they were is confraternities associations of laymen,

465
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.550
including the leading trades of the city.

466
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:07.390
Some of them had large and wealthy memberships and played a major role in the

467
00:35:07.461 --> 00:35:11.240
government of the city and amassed enormous wealth.

468
00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:17.020
The functions of the confraternities were originally devotional and given the

469
00:35:17.691 --> 00:35:20.420
exposure of Venice to the plague,

470
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.480
it's not surprising that the very largest and most powerful of the schools chose

471
00:35:26.361 --> 00:35:30.590
sons and Oco as its patron saint.
And this is,

472
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.090
it bears the name.

473
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.560
It constructed a magnificent building and commission,

474
00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:39.540
the greatest Venetian artist of the century,

475
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:44.710
jock protein Torah to decorate it in veneration of Sangudo call and indirect

476
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:51.300
rivalry to the Sistine Chapel in Rome.
So let's move inside.

477
00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:53.943
<v 1>MMM,</v>

478
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.390
<v 0>yeah,
we are.
Um,</v>

479
00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.600
and we'll see that we're looking at when these plagues scenes,

480
00:36:01.851 --> 00:36:05.000
we'll be seeing that.
We're going to look at the,
uh,

481
00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:09.380
at the magnificence of the art.
And this is the interior of it.

482
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:14.420
And I just wanted to show you that at the height of the painting is Jane told

483
00:36:14.421 --> 00:36:18.950
Astros Painting of the triumph of sunblock code son Rocco,

484
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:24.010
the great plagues sat achieving his reward in heaven and going up to God plague

485
00:36:26.391 --> 00:36:29.000
also affected across Europe.

486
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:33.470
Let me also say another theme in the urban landscape,
uh,

487
00:36:33.471 --> 00:36:38.471
involved plague columns and you can see these particularly in central and

488
00:36:38.781 --> 00:36:39.710
eastern Europe,

489
00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.920
a great plague column in the center of Vienna or also in Pilsen and the Czech

490
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:54.790
Republic or in here's yet another in Hungary.

491
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.520
Now in these plagues scenes of course,

492
00:36:58.521 --> 00:37:03.521
remember that by definition we're looking at works by survivors who sense of

493
00:37:04.101 --> 00:37:08.810
horror was tempered perhaps by a bit of relief.

494
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.010
If it were possible to have works by the victims,

495
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.010
perhaps the scenes would be even more wrenching.

496
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:22.010
There were also aspects that aren't mentioned in the literature under
unknowable,

497
00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:27.070
but perhaps probable what happened to those who suffered from the plague and

498
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:33.190
then were recovered was their first Tila t affected whether a longterm sub

499
00:37:33.671 --> 00:37:38.671
quilly a neurological deficits where their psychological effects that we would

500
00:37:39.951 --> 00:37:43.430
now term post traumatic speced stress syndrome.

501
00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:49.130
But in our discussion of flag,
I also want to say that there were some,

502
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:54.190
a couple of speculative large scale conclusions that I want to Hinton.

503
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:01.670
The presence of [inaudible] over four centuries as we've just seen had a major

504
00:38:02.281 --> 00:38:06.480
impact on religion,
on culture,

505
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:11.930
on societal attitudes toward life and death and left a major imprint on

506
00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:17.460
architecture,
on painting and sculpture.

507
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:20.070
And in addition,

508
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:25.100
I want to speculate for a moment and say that we might also think that perhaps

509
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.810
the plague and especially not the plague itself,

510
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:31.951
but it,

511
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:36.951
the triumph over it by the means we described last time may have been a factor

512
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:42.670
that helped to transform European intellectual history.

513
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:45.250
Now it's a great,

514
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.630
one of the great cliches that the 18th century,

515
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:54.660
the age of enlightenment was a great age of optimism and belief in progress.

516
00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:02.490
But I'd argue that perhaps the belief in progress required some tangible

517
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.390
material foundation and the,

518
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.400
this was grounded and a new sense that life in fact was becoming more secure and

519
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:19.600
that perhaps mankind couldn't master.

520
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.450
It's an environment and its destiny.

521
00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.980
And so I would argue that it's very significant that the first great medical

522
00:39:30.281 --> 00:39:35.281
conquest of at least public health conquest resulted from the application of the

523
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:42.421
power of the state of administrative measures in the plague regulations.

524
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.690
And it's no coincidence then that the 18th century and during this time the

525
00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:54.541
state came to be seen as a source of redeeming power that could transform human

526
00:39:55.691 --> 00:39:57.100
life in society.

527
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.940
Here was an impetus towards reform and to rethinking intellectually medical

528
00:40:04.991 --> 00:40:06.370
history.
In a sense,

529
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:11.371
one could argue was one factor that helped to sound the death knell of the old

530
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:17.041
regime dramatically in successfully demonstrating human's capacity.

531
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:23.370
That is men's capacity to make his or her own history here was the basis for a

532
00:40:25.301 --> 00:40:30.301
new faith in reason and the creative potential of political power,

533
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:35.530
perhaps it's suggestive to remember the Jones Jacques Rousseau,

534
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.170
the founder of modern,
uh,

535
00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:42.030
revolutionary political thought began his,

536
00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:46.840
and one of the heroes of the enlightenment began his career in Venice,

537
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.010
which for a time he regarded as a model regime.

538
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:56.830
And that his time there included a mentor of month of reflection as the

539
00:40:56.831 --> 00:41:01.590
underwent a term of quarantine.
And the Great Venetian.
Lots of rough tone.

540
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:03.603
But again,

541
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.760
I want to avoid giving any suggestion that I want to propound a germ theory of

542
00:41:10.361 --> 00:41:13.270
history as a historian,

543
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:18.330
I'm opposed by training to Monaco causal explanations of major events.

544
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:25.000
And so what I'm not saying is that the conquest of the plague caused the

545
00:41:25.001 --> 00:41:27.190
enlightenment on not saying that,

546
00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:32.280
I nearly want to note that the conquest over the plug first and we'll be talking

547
00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.710
next week about smallpox second,

548
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.100
were extraordinary influences,

549
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.700
triumphs over the two most feared diseases of the 17th and 18th centuries,

550
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:51.320
the first conquest over infectious disease.

551
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:56.800
And I would say that that wasn't a million miles away from being a background

552
00:41:57.981 --> 00:42:01.940
influence on the coming of the age of the enlightenment.

553
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:08.290
I would also speculate that the triumph over plague first and then small pumps

554
00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:16.850
also played a role in the coming of the industrial revolution.

555
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:18.680
Dot.

556
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:23.680
The plague and small pox had been enormous breaks on demographic growth and the

557
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:31.691
growth of the economy and the conquest of the plague by the 18th century

558
00:42:32.931 --> 00:42:36.490
followed by a victory over smallpox,

559
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:42.370
had a major impact on launching a great age of European population growth and

560
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:49.931
population growth and turn was a precondition for the coming of the industrial

561
00:42:50.691 --> 00:42:52.250
revolution again,

562
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.440
that I'm not saying that the conquest of plague was a mono causal explanation

563
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.990
for the coming of the industrial revolution.

564
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:05.110
I'm saying simply that it was one of many preconditions that it was a growing

565
00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:11.171
population that provided that endless supply of free laborers for factories,

566
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.010
mines and sweat shops.

567
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:21.290
And it also provided a growing market for industrial products.

568
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.680
Demographic change then supplied a large home market for industry.

569
00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.500
And having made that argument with regard to plug next week,

570
00:43:33.501 --> 00:43:38.501
what I'd like to do is to turn to the second major epidemic disease.

571
00:43:38.991 --> 00:43:43.991
If plague was the greatest feared disease of the 17th century and from the 14th

572
00:43:46.461 --> 00:43:50.300
through the 17th in the 18th century,

573
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:53.360
the most feared disease was smallpox.

574
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.620
And I'd like to look next at smallpox.
It's impact.

575
00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:02.770
And on the second great development of a public health measure,

576
00:44:02.781 --> 00:44:04.280
a very different one,

577
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.970
which was the public health measure of vaccination.

578
00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:10.280
So that's where we're going next.
