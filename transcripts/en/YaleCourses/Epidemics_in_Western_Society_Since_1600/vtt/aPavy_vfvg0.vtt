1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.921
Oh,
good morning.

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:06.921
We can start and today we'll be discussing poliomyelitis or polio for short.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.820
And you may be wondering why we've included it at this point,
uh,

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.660
late in the day on our course.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.840
And that's because a number of you have been saying that they,

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.400
you'd like to have the course come right up today.

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.410
And today's newspapers and where I want to deal with polio,

8
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.483
um,

9
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.110
I hope is in light of that request.

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.120
In other words,
we're going to be dealing with polio,
uh,
at this very moment.

11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.420
And in particular with problems of vaccination that very major public health

12
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:47.370
strategy,

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.300
the subject will really be the problems facing the global polio eradication

14
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:58.530
initiative,
which just to remember and remind you,

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.460
is the largest public health campaign ever launched.

16
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.240
It predicted global eradication by 2000 and when it began in 1988,

17
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.360
it used as its model the eradication of smallpox,

18
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.451
as you know,

19
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:23.451
pioneered long ago by Edward Jenner and actually reaching successful conclusion

20
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.860
in 1980 when the World Health Organization certified that the warm glow glow was

21
00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:36.210
free of naturally occurring smallpox.

22
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.770
There seem to be a number of reasons that smallpox could be taken as the model.

23
00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.310
This was the first disease and still the only one major disease actually

24
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.210
eradicated intentionally by human beings by a public health campaign.

25
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.660
It was thought that polio had a number of features that it made it a similarly

26
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.960
good candidate,
just like smallpox.

27
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.220
It was a disease like smallpox that possessed no animal reservoir,

28
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.890
so if you got rid of it in the human population,

29
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.950
it wouldn't again jump species and recur through transmission from animals to

30
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:24.534
humans.

31
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.440
It was also a viral disease and the pathogen has no complicated life cycle.

32
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.850
It's at the other end of the spectrum from,
for example,

33
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.530
the malaria plasmodium,

34
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.930
the acquired resistance is robust,

35
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.550
produced by the body.

36
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:49.551
Naturally that was true of polio as it is of smallpox.

37
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.140
And it was the case that just as in the example of smallpox,

38
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.890
so too with polio,

39
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.070
there seem to be a very robust and powerful tool that is two vaccines,

40
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.370
one injected,
we'll come back to that and the other oral,

41
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.020
the polio vaccines.
But as we speak,

42
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.320
the global eradication program has run into serious and unexpected pro

43
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.650
difficulties.

44
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.880
After it was originally launched in 1988 it went from success to success and

45
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:36.841
seem to be poised for successful eradication if perhaps not by its original

46
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:42.340
timetable of 2000 well then perhaps just a little bit later,

47
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.780
but in 2003 major difficulties over took the campaign and we'll come back to

48
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:51.244
those.

49
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.700
And now the campaign is a decade behind schedule and the elusive goal of global

50
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:04.591
eradication seems to be receding rather than becoming closer.

51
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.050
It's stalled particularly in for endemic countries,

52
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.030
India,
Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Nigeria,

53
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.450
and even spread particularly from Nigeria for an a to an array of other

54
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:22.900
countries.

55
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.860
So the question is whether this stalling is temporary and for contingent reasons

56
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
likely to be overcome or it was eradication on the smallpox model,

57
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.800
a mirage from the start,

58
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.940
and this can be personified in a major debate between two leading figures in

59
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:49.240
international public health.

60
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.470
One is Bruce Aylward,

61
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.880
who's the director general of the global public,
uh,

62
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:00.580
polio eradication initiative.

63
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.270
He is a great optimist and says that the problem is simply a matter of pressing

64
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:13.051
harder when difficulties emerge and he envisages eradication in short order.

65
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.510
Then there's da Henderson and he was the former director of the successful

66
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.950
smallpox eradication program and he was the director of polio eradication in the

67
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.920
region of the Americas.

68
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.630
Originally he was a very enthusiastic eradicator,

69
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.800
but now he's come around to the view instead that eradication was a mistaken

70
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:49.081
concept from the start that it will simply never work with polio,

71
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.100
which is totally unlike smallpox this morning.

72
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:55.090
Fortunately,

73
00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.120
we don't need to make a decision and hopefully air ward will be successful.

74
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.720
But I do think we need to understand how difficult the eradication of a disease

75
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.090
actually is and to remember how exceptional smallpox is as a case.

76
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.860
Polio reminds us that small smallpox was an outlier rather than the norm.

77
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.180
Furthermore,

78
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.210
the polio problem is intellectually interesting and we ought to understand it in

79
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:34.781
order to comprehend tomorrow's press reports on why eradication perhaps didn't

80
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:39.320
succeed.
If that's the outcome.

81
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.660
I don't want to make a prediction because I'm mindful of that great sage,

82
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.930
a Yogi Berra who had an a saying that never predict the,

83
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.130
I'll make a prediction,
especially if it's about the future.

84
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.410
So in any case,
um,

85
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.220
we don't know whether polio will be eradicated or not.

86
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.310
I tend to be a skeptic,
but I really hope I'm wrong.

87
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.400
The polio virus has three types,
polio,
one,

88
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.080
two,
and three,

89
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.280
and it enters the body via the mouth,
uh,

90
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.300
perhaps through contaminated food or water or an unsanitary conditions with

91
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:30.311
direct contact with stools or with the secretions from the throat of a patient.

92
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.680
The virus then settles in the intestinal track and it multiplies there and

93
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.910
that's a picture of the polio virus.

94
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.220
After an incubation period of one to five days,

95
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.280
it then settles in lymphatic tissue along the intestines and in the lymph nodes.

96
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.020
Now normally the virus does no appreciable harm in the digestive tract producing

97
00:08:03.111 --> 00:08:08.111
nothing more than some swollen lymph nodes and depart from that,

98
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.570
the infection can be totally asymptomatic.

99
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.030
In some cases it leads to minor symptoms.

100
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.720
These are brief such as a mild fever and other symptoms that would make you

101
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:28.760
think of it's seasonal influenza,
headache,
nausea,

102
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:29.803
vomiting.

103
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.680
Then the patient recovers with nothing more occurring and that's true.

104
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:43.310
Then of the vast majority of cases that end in that way,

105
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.130
and indeed in the historical literature,

106
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.190
this was termed a board of poliomyelitis because the infection progressed no

107
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:54.470
further,

108
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.880
but in about 1% or so of cases,

109
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.960
there's something much more serious that occurs,

110
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.600
which is the involvement of the central nervous system and that's where the

111
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.290
disease,
if it becomes so established,

112
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.540
does it serious damage.
It destroys nerves,

113
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.010
especially in the spinal cord and the brain.
There's a,

114
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.160
let me show you a rather a schematic rather scary picture of the polio virus

115
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.970
attacking a nerve cell.

116
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.750
When this occurs.

117
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.800
The results are severe pain,

118
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.310
weakness in the muscles and then paralysis and the paralysis can be one leg,

119
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.000
both legs,

120
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.840
the arms and the respiratory system.

121
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.100
The paralysis also is normally irreversible and often leads to very severe

122
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:06.690
deformity or maiming of the affected limbs.

123
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.550
If the muscles involved are those of the respiratory system,

124
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.020
the result can be respiratory paralysis and death.

125
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.930
Let me show you some of images of um,

126
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.880
the work of poliomyelitis.

127
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.330
This is a picture from the 1950s of a child in rehabilitation with paralyzed

128
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:37.050
legs,
braces and calipers or,

129
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:37.920
um,

130
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.920
we can see this is a poster of the campaign against poliomyelitis

131
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.860
or more.

132
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.040
This is the iron lung that was used to save the lives of those who had

133
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:55.560
respiratory paralysis.

134
00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.030
And we can see another iron lung with the child inside.

135
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:05.040
And a terrible picture of that was all too common in the 30s,

136
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:06.540
forties and 50s,

137
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.430
which is a whole ward of children in iron lungs.

138
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.820
So this really was a terrible and cataclysmic disease and it's severe form.

139
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.430
Now what about the history?

140
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.550
Poliomyelitis was used to be called infantile paralysis until the 1890s it was

141
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:35.160
regarded as a minor medical and public health issue,

142
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:40.250
so it really exploded onto the world as a major public health and medical

143
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:45.951
problem only in the 1890s that's not to say that polio was an emerging disease

144
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:52.251
of the 1890s but I'm going to say that something new happened that trends formed

145
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.060
awareness of the disease.

146
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.260
It was thought then originally to be an exotic,

147
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.550
an unimportant,
endemic disease of early childhood.

148
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:09.570
But something happened in the 1890s and polio began to appear as something

149
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:16.000
different,
especially in the western industrial world.

150
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.170
It began to appear as a variable,
an epidemic disease.

151
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.570
It struck older groups of people,
adolescence and grownups,

152
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.720
as well as infants and in it's wake it less clusters of dead and paralyzed

153
00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:32.500
victims.

154
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.400
The first substantial epidemics ever recorded struck Scandinavia,

155
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.270
Sweden in the 1890s in this country,

156
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.300
Vermont in 1894 Scandinavia again in 1905 New York in 1907 Vienna in 1908 and

157
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:56.140
the northeast of the United States,

158
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.290
and a devastating epidemic in 1916 after that,

159
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.990
epidemics of polio became a recurring and terrifying feature of the warm months

160
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.150
of the industrial west in the US.
For example,

161
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.300
polio struck with ever increasing fury reaching a peak of ferocity in the years

162
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.260
1950 to 1954 and by that time it had taken over from tuberculosis as the most

163
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:33.270
feared disease of the era.
Well,

164
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.850
what happened in here?
I think we ought to be careful.

165
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:42.690
Let's avoid an error that misled epidemiologists and public health officials at

166
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:49.261
least until World War II and then sometimes has misled ms medical historian

167
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:51.034
since then.

168
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.760
The mistake was to think that polio was in some simple way,

169
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.010
a disease of the affluent industrial nations of the clean and the prosperous

170
00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:07.370
within them.
In reality.

171
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.460
Polio virus,
as we know,

172
00:14:10.461 --> 00:14:15.461
is transmitted by the oral fecal route and it was ubiquitous in human

173
00:14:16.701 --> 00:14:19.220
populations across the globe,

174
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:25.160
but hygienic advances transformed its epidemiology.

175
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
The sanitary bulwarks of the modern industrial state prevented children from

176
00:14:32.301 --> 00:14:37.301
encountering the virus during infancy and early childhood and therefore they

177
00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:43.820
failed to build an acquired immunity to the disease.

178
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.890
As a result,

179
00:14:46.891 --> 00:14:51.891
the numbers of susceptible people in populations began to accumulate and that

180
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:58.661
provided the basis for periodic large scale epidemics that struck at later ages.

181
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.320
There was a distinguished Yale epidemiologists named John Paul who was very

182
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:14.231
active in the middle decades of the 20th century in dealing with poliomyelitis,

183
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.970
and he argued that the disease should no longer be called infantile paralysis

184
00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.820
under the circumstances.

185
00:15:25.821 --> 00:15:30.821
He said that term should be replaced with the phrase modern polio and modern

186
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.310
polio,
as he called.
It,

187
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.460
demonstrated a strong predilection for relatively prosperous,

188
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.800
older children,
adolescents and adults,

189
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:47.630
and it did so in the economically advanced nations of the world,

190
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.370
northern Europe,
North America,
Australia,
New Zealand,

191
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.510
polio.

192
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.510
In this sense what John Paul called modern polio seem to be,

193
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:04.190
if we could toy with the phrase that's all too familiar to you by now,

194
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.150
it seemed to be a kind of social disease in reverse.

195
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:14.060
That is,
it seemed to cause epidemics among the clean,

196
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.670
the wealthy and the suburban.

197
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:23.110
And so polio became a highly visible epidemic disease that terrified because it

198
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:29.951
was so visible because there was no cure and because everyone seemed to be

199
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:35.411
vulnerable while the disease itself left in its wig after each visitation,

200
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.160
thousands of people who were maimed and crippled as well as the dead.

201
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.300
But the reality was a little different.

202
00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.970
Although epidemic,

203
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:55.150
modern poliomyelitis increased the pace of its ravages in the Western world.

204
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.740
Proof sooner emerged that polio also imposed an unnoticed but equally heavy

205
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:10.670
tribute of suffering and the resource poor tropical world.
In other words,

206
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.730
this was an illusion that it was only afflicting the industrial clean world.

207
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.160
This caused enormous surprise.

208
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:27.850
The prevailing dogma was that poliomyelitis was an affliction of modernity and

209
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:33.761
sanitation and was of negligible concern in the developing world.

210
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.520
But World War Two because to shock,

211
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:43.270
suddenly there was the experience of non-immune us British,

212
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.940
Australian troops stationed in places like Egypt or the Pacific and they're

213
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.340
against all expectations,

214
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:58.200
significant numbers of them contracted poliomyelitis

215
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.700
and then this disturbing finding,

216
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:08.120
which confirmed by evidence from Ciro logical examinations from rectal swabs,

217
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.340
from laboratory analysis of the Microbio bounty in third world sewers and by

218
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:24.861
lameness surveys that is actually counting people who are afflicted with

219
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:31.230
paralysis and places like India.

220
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.880
And the evidence confirm that paralytic poliomyelitis in the tropics,

221
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.810
which actually greater than in the developed world at its height,

222
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.030
but that it was unnoticed.
And why was it not notice?

223
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:53.210
It was not noticed in part because physicians and public health officials hadn't

224
00:18:54.051 --> 00:18:56.460
long taught not to expect it.

225
00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:57.850
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

226
00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.830
<v 0>everyone close the rise.</v>

227
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.940
It was also true because the impoverished children of the tropical world had so

228
00:19:06.401 --> 00:19:10.570
little access to medical care that they simply weren't seen.

229
00:19:10.571 --> 00:19:11.650
They were invisible

230
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:18.150
because the illnesses of the poor were regarded as unremarkable.

231
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.840
And because the poor themselves fatalistically expected that their children

232
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.920
would suffer and die and disproportionate numbers.

233
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.110
So meanwhile,

234
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:37.230
maimed and paralyzed children grew up in the tropical world to join the ranks of

235
00:19:38.981 --> 00:19:42.700
beggars in the streets of Jakarta,
Cairo,

236
00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.800
and Lagos.
Well,

237
00:19:45.801 --> 00:19:50.801
the polio virus was discovered in 1908 by Carl Lawn Steiner,

238
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.240
who's on your handout.
But thereafter,

239
00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.710
the natural history of the disease remains shrouded in mystery.

240
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.180
Still in 1950 the mode of transmission and the portal of entry of the virus into

241
00:20:09.231 --> 00:20:09.920
the body.

242
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.920
We're unknown as was the issue of whether polio virus existed in a single strain

243
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.230
or ends or stereotype or in multiple ones.

244
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.250
Was there one type or many?
Similarly,

245
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.120
the immune mechanisms of the body,
we're not understood.

246
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.960
And in fact,
a critical mistake was made

247
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.720
and this mistake misled the public health community.

248
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.750
We're searchers and medical science for a long period from the 1920s or so down

249
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:52.771
to the 1950s and this was to assume that the course of the disease in human

250
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:59.011
beings was the same as that in monkeys and other words,

251
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.230
there was an extrapolation from the laboratory to human beings.

252
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.740
And these,
this mistake had a number of corollaries.

253
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:13.830
It meant that it was assumed that the portal of entry of the virus was the nose

254
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.520
rather than the digestive tract.

255
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:24.390
It was assumed that the disease primarily attack the central nervous system and

256
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.390
the virus made its way from the nose to the spinal cord and the brain via the

257
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:37.240
nervous system.
Well,

258
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:42.100
in terms of public health and the possibility of vaccine development,

259
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:47.250
these conclusions were entirely counterproductive because they lead to a

260
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:50.590
corollary.

261
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.760
The corollary was at since the disease spread via the nervous system rather than

262
00:21:57.491 --> 00:21:58.540
the bloodstream,

263
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:04.140
there was no opportunity for antibodies to mount a defense and therefore no

264
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:07.750
possibility for developing a vaccine.

265
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:14.970
Then we have enormous campaign of research and public health against this

266
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.660
increasingly feared and terrible disease.

267
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.870
And this was with the foundation of the national foundation of infantile

268
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:32.140
paralysis.
And uh,

269
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.460
it's spawned the march of dimes campaign,

270
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:41.850
which collected enormous amounts of money devoted to research and also to the

271
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:48.550
care and rehabilitation of the victims of poliomyelitis.

272
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.640
Let me just show you some images of the collecting the funds in the 19,

273
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:55.390
uh,

274
00:22:55.390 --> 00:23:00.390
middle decades of the 20th century or a celebrity's took part.

275
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.110
This is Elvis Presley.

276
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.700
I'm campaigning for the march of dimes or the,

277
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.680
you can see Elvis again,
um,
there.
Um,

278
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.200
and most importantly,
uh,

279
00:23:14.201 --> 00:23:17.470
one of the most famous,

280
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.500
probably the most famous of all polio victims was President Franklin Delano

281
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.400
Roosevelt who established the,

282
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:32.430
was the leading figure in the establishment of this foundation and the march of

283
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:37.501
dimes and also another for rehabilitation center in warm springs,

284
00:23:38.351 --> 00:23:39.184
Georgia.

285
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:45.570
Let me just remind you that Fdr was in fact himself a victim of polio who is

286
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.870
paralyzed.
Well,
in 1948,

287
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.620
a major discovery was made by three men who worked together as a team and shared

288
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.230
the Nobel prize amongst themselves.
They,

289
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:10.970
these were John Anders,
Thomas Weller and Frederick Robins,

290
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:16.360
and they discovered that the polio virus could be cultured in vitro,

291
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.860
in non nervous human tissue.
Now,

292
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:24.860
why was not discovery critical?
Well,

293
00:24:24.861 --> 00:24:29.861
first it meant that the cost of research plummeted because you didn't need to

294
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:36.310
have live monkeys to take care of in order to do experiments with the virus.

295
00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:43.540
It led soon to the discovery that the digestive tract,

296
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.360
rather than the nose was the portal of entry.

297
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.490
And it led to the discovery of a phase in which antibodies could attack the

298
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:54.620
virus in the bloodstream.

299
00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.640
And it led to the discovery that polio virus exists in three different

300
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:06.350
serotypes,
polio virus one polio virus too,

301
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.270
and polio virus three.

302
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:13.360
And it was these discoveries that made possible the development of successful

303
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:15.830
development of a vaccine.

304
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.400
And this duly occurred in two major forms.

305
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.670
And this was a momentous development.

306
00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:28.540
The first was by Jonas Salk and that was an activated injectable vaccine tested

307
00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:38.681
in 1904 and administered successfully on mass in 1955.

308
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.080
And Jonas Salk became a national hero and celebrity,

309
00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.110
um,
for this on the cover of Time magazine.

310
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.730
Everyone talked about him and indeed he was later to save himself that he didn't

311
00:25:52.731 --> 00:25:57.731
need the Nobel prize because he was much more famous than the price itself.

312
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

313
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:04.520
<v 0>Second was another vaccine,
a competitor,
if you like,</v>

314
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:10.210
which was alive oral polio vaccine developed by Albert Sabin and tested in 1959

315
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:18.731
and 60 and administered on mass in the 1960s.

316
00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:19.460
Now,

317
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.460
both of these developments were funded by the national foundation for infantile

318
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:25.281
paralysis.

319
00:26:25.281 --> 00:26:30.281
You can see the role of the march of dimes and leading to medical discoveries

320
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.590
almost immediately after the development of these two vaccines.

321
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:41.540
The goal of eradication was taken up as an objective

322
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.980
in the 1950s already.
Albert Sabin,

323
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:51.510
for example,
made around education and article of faith.

324
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.090
He said,
the goal and I'm quoting,

325
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.770
is to completely eradicate poliomyelitis,
to eliminate it,

326
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.790
to make it disappear,
to achieve ultimate eradication.

327
00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.540
Well,
a major question was,

328
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.340
which vaccine should the campaign be based on?

329
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.520
Socks,
IPV.

330
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.410
That is the injectable inactivated vaccine.
Let me try to,

331
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.860
whoops,
uh,
fix this in your mind.

332
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.570
This is a picture of Jonas Salk and as you can see,

333
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.100
he's holding a,

334
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:34.101
about to vaccinate someone with his injectable inactivated virus.

335
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.480
And here we can see him at work.

336
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:44.570
This is how Jonah Salk's vaccine operates with a syringe.

337
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.790
It had a number of drawbacks.
It was an effective,

338
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.360
um,
uh,

339
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:59.130
public health measure and led to a robust immunity,

340
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.120
but it was administered by injection.

341
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:08.330
And in terms of being a worldwide public health tool,

342
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.350
it required qualified vaccinators and not made it too complicated and expensive

343
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.040
for a worldwide campaign,

344
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.000
especially in third world countries.

345
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.610
And since it was a killed vaccine killed by Formaldehyde,

346
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.650
it would stimulate the production of antibodies,

347
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:39.980
but it wouldn't cause what was termed mucosal immunity directly in the human

348
00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:45.300
gut.
Then there was the alternative,

349
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.200
which was developed by Albert Sabin,

350
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.970
which was the attenuated live virus.

351
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:55.830
This Hud,

352
00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:00.720
it was administered initially on sugar cubes that were,

353
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:05.400
uh,
a couple of drops put on them and then people down them,

354
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:10.401
especially children or else it was a pink liquid that was simply dropped with a

355
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:12.780
dropper into your,

356
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.200
down her throat and not could be administered at a fraction of the cost,

357
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:24.060
as I said,
on sugar cubes or as a liquid.
And it,

358
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:29.090
the only skilled that was required of the vaccinator was the ability to count to

359
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:34.911
two because you drop two drops into the throat and that's the,

360
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.640
it took half an hour to train a vaccinator using Albert Saban's oral vaccine.

361
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:47.770
But equally importantly,
the oral polio virus,

362
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:53.310
because a virus to be shed from the intestine into the environment that is,

363
00:29:55.150 --> 00:30:00.150
it took root and flourish in the god of the people of the vaccine knees.

364
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.300
And as they shed,
they would spread,
ah,

365
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:11.310
that is the virus causing an asymptomatic and harmless infection in the guts of

366
00:30:12.851 --> 00:30:14.170
whole communities.

367
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:19.750
Thereby you would raise the herd immunity even if people who weren't vaccinated.

368
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:25.590
So you could miss people with Saban's vaccine and still reach entirely entire

369
00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:28.570
communities.

370
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:34.110
So that was the vaccine than major new tool with its two different forms,

371
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:39.580
socks,
injectable vaccine,
and Sabins oral vaccine.

372
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:45.360
But what the campaign relied upon was something in addition to the new

373
00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.920
scientific tools,

374
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.330
and this was a new operational campaign strategy.

375
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.140
And the campaign strategy interestingly,

376
00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.830
was first devised in Fidel Castro's Cuba.

377
00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:06.090
And the campaign strategy provided a context in which oral polio vaccine could

378
00:31:07.631 --> 00:31:12.030
be maximally effective.
This was taken up in,
was called,
uh,

379
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.610
the tool of national immunization days.

380
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.190
Let's remember how they started.

381
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:23.970
Instead of limiting immunization to those who receive routine vaccinations from

382
00:31:25.181 --> 00:31:30.040
their physicians.
The national immunization days took,

383
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:35.041
is it axiomatic that there was very limited access to medical care?

384
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:42.030
And so the idea was to not bring patients to the vaccinators but to take vaccine

385
00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:47.530
to the people.
So in 1962 in Cuba,

386
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:52.000
the grass root organizations of Castro's revolution,

387
00:31:52.001 --> 00:31:55.540
which recalled committees for the defense of the revolution,

388
00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:00.960
carried out house to house surveys to locate every child on the island of Cuba.

389
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:07.980
And then vaccinators made a return visit to vaccinate every child who'd been

390
00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:10.204
located.

391
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:16.530
This procedure morphed in the United States into what were called Sabin Oral

392
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.070
Sundays,
beginning at Tucson or is Arizona.

393
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.170
And as you can imagine,

394
00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:31.380
these Sabin Oral Sundays weren't sponsored by committees for the defense of the

395
00:32:31.541 --> 00:32:32.410
revolution,

396
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:38.490
but rather by local and county chapters of the Ama and its members volunteered

397
00:32:41.691 --> 00:32:45.710
their services alongside those of local pharmacists,

398
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.860
county health officials,
nurses,
school teachers,
clergyman,

399
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.280
the local press and housewives.

400
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:56.870
And the vaccine was administered in school buildings.

401
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.950
This campaign thus structured with the new tool of vaccine and the new

402
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.860
organizational strategy of national immunization days successfully around a

403
00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:15.161
catered smallpox first in the United States and then in the Americas in 1988 the

404
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.780
World Health Organization then launched the global polio eradication in

405
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.940
initiative.
At the outset,

406
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
it was supported in particular by what was the equivalent of the gates

407
00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:39.251
foundation of its time and that is the resources and international structure of

408
00:33:41.301 --> 00:33:46.160
the 32,000 clubs worldwide of Rotary International,

409
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.760
which was an Ngo,
as I said,

410
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:54.650
somewhat equivalent and it's time to the gates foundation of our own day.

411
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
The campaign also enjoyed the support of the CDC of international agencies like

412
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.690
the g eight as it was then.

413
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:10.100
It's no longer that it's expanded the African Union,

414
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:15.560
various national governments and an army of vaccinators.

415
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.420
From the beginning,

416
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:22.660
the global polio eradication initiative adopted the strategy of combining

417
00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:28.301
Saban's oral polio vaccine with Cuba's operational device of community wide

418
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:32.840
immunization days.

419
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:38.420
The goal was to provide the most susceptible populations on earth,

420
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.540
small children worldwide,

421
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:46.750
every child on the planet to be vaccinated with at least two doses of oral polio

422
00:34:49.191 --> 00:34:50.180
vaccine.

423
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.640
Now let's remember what a Gargantuan effort this actually was.

424
00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:01.420
National Immunization Days were extraordinary events that necessitated the

425
00:35:02.721 --> 00:35:06.710
participation of 10 million people in their organization.

426
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.640
Take the example of India where the national immunization days became the

427
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:19.241
largest single public health events in history when as many as 93 million

428
00:35:21.681 --> 00:35:26.030
children were vaccinated on single days.

429
00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:32.380
Well 19 oh 88 to 2003 the campaign made huge progress.

430
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
In 1988 the World Health Organization estimated that were there were 350,000

431
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:49.401
cases worldwide of paralysis from polio and it believed the disease to be

432
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.080
endemic in 125 countries.

433
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.960
In 1988 itself,

434
00:35:57.961 --> 00:36:02.961
transmission was halted in Europe in 1991 it was halted in the Americas in 1997

435
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:10.880
in the Pacific region and in 2001 there was a world record with a low of 483

436
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:20.270
recorded cases of paralysis in just for endemic countries.

437
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.520
India,
Pakistan,
Afghanistan,

438
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:27.810
and Nigeria.

439
00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:32.050
Let me show you a map of,

440
00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.610
and this is 2008,
as you can see,

441
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.890
and the countries in red are,
those were,
uh,

442
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.960
polio is now endemic and the ones in yellow are places that it spread to from

443
00:36:46.411 --> 00:36:50.070
those endemic countries in 2008.

444
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:52.591
Well,

445
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:57.591
there was a set back in 2003 and what did that indicate already?

446
00:37:00.481 --> 00:37:03.060
Vanquished in the industrial world,

447
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:08.180
poliomyelitis in 2003 remained and dem only in some of the most unsanitary

448
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.380
poverty stricken and insecure places on the planet.

449
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:22.790
This is one reason that it's a mockery to think of poliomyelitis as a disease of

450
00:37:23.611 --> 00:37:27.300
the affluent and the clean polio.

451
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.910
Maya Litas had been driven back

452
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:36.770
to the war torn and remote areas of Pakistan to Muslim dominated states of

453
00:37:38.911 --> 00:37:40.200
northern Nigeria,

454
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:45.410
northern sinned in Pakistan and the states of Bihar and [inaudible] progress in

455
00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:47.124
India.

456
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:53.150
Now the Moslem states of Nigeria and especially Cano as we'll talk about in the

457
00:37:55.711 --> 00:38:00.711
moment where the most striking cases there in northern Nigeria,

458
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.190
the campaign was actually halted by a boycott,

459
00:38:05.191 --> 00:38:08.280
an organized boycott for 13 months.

460
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.310
As a result in Nigeria,

461
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:16.370
the disease flared up causing hundreds of cases of acute paralysis and

462
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:19.230
alarmingly,

463
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:24.260
it's spread from Nigeria widely causing outbreaks of paralysis in 18 countries

464
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:30.620
in west and central Africa that had previously been pronounced polio free.

465
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:32.821
Well,

466
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:37.821
what were the problems that emerged in 2003 I'm going to say that they were

467
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.180
operational,
religious,

468
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.690
political and biological.

469
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:53.400
Operationally you can see the problems and that would emerge and a place like

470
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:59.611
Afghanistan and why that would be a recalcitrant place for public health

471
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:06.010
officials to attempt to eradicate a disease as entrenched as polio,

472
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:11.340
war and lack of security made vaccination campaigns dangerous and sometimes

473
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:15.670
impossible.

474
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.410
But let's look for a moment at a different place.

475
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.590
And this is a map of Nigeria.

476
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:27.070
If you imagine the country and that knots,
the state,

477
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.930
I want to talk about the state of Kano in northern Nigeria.

478
00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:37.650
There we see a problem of that's political and religious

479
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:45.750
Muslim leaders in Kano and that's in a country,

480
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:51.040
the government of Nigeria is Christian dominated.

481
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:55.420
This states of northern Nigeria,
however,

482
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.860
are Muslim.

483
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.640
And they were suspicious in northern Nigeria about western intentions,

484
00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.950
especially after the launching of war in Afghanistan and Iraq.

485
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:15.030
And people began to preach religious leaders that Oreo oral polio vaccine,

486
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.570
these drops,
we're not a measure of public health,

487
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:27.810
but instead a sinister plot to sterilize Muslim children by poisoning them so

488
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:35.251
that as long would recede from the earth and Christianity could replace it.

489
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.970
And this whole thinking was,
um,

490
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.040
ramped up by the issue raised by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,

491
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:53.700
which had conducted unethical testing in Nigeria in a way that inflamed public

492
00:40:55.511 --> 00:41:00.460
opinion especially and led to a major lawsuit against the company.

493
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.110
Furthermore,

494
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:07.030
since the traditional Dogma about poliomyelitis hell did,

495
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:10.990
it was an insignificant public health problem in the tropical world.

496
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:16.020
It was difficult for many to understand why the international community was so

497
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:21.430
intent on trying to rid Nigeria of polio.

498
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:27.420
The Nigerians themselves regarded other diseases as much greater causes of death

499
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:29.260
and suffering.

500
00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:34.380
Why was the international community not concentrated on dealing with malaria,

501
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.540
tuberculosis,
and HIV AIDS?

502
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:43.660
Why all this attention to polio that seem to them a relatively minor problem.

503
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:52.260
And the emir of Kano was unable to discern benign intentions.

504
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:54.583
Also,

505
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:59.980
when it transpired that industrial predominantly Christian nations,

506
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:05.170
we're vaccinating their own populations instead with salk's vaccine.

507
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.890
That is the IPV,

508
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:13.910
while insisting that Nigerians received the oral vaccine,

509
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:17.930
why on earth was dot.
Finally,

510
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:23.050
opposition to the vaccination campaign promoted by the Christian dominated

511
00:42:23.361 --> 00:42:28.361
federal government of Nigeria served as a proxy for sectional political and

512
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:34.100
religious discontents and the minority northern stays.

513
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.640
So the result was a boycott of the anti polio campaign and it lasted until 2004

514
00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.080
at which time Moslem operated laboratories in Indonesia agreed to supply

515
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:53.890
vaccines to Nigeria and other Muslim operated laboratories in India analyze the

516
00:42:56.871 --> 00:43:01.871
vaccine previously supplied to Kano and found it to be harmless,

517
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:07.430
at which point prominent Muslim leaders around the world press there

518
00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:12.140
co-religionists in Nigeria to support the international effort.

519
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:18.070
But by then considerable harm had been done to the campaign was not clear

520
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:19.851
either.

521
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:24.851
That large numbers of Muslim parents would ever again allow their children to be

522
00:43:25.071 --> 00:43:30.071
immunized or that the spread of the virus beyond Nigerian borders was something

523
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:32.840
that could be reversed.

524
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:39.110
So let's say that deals then with political and religious obstacles,

525
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.770
then there are were biological ones.

526
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.660
And to illustrate those,

527
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:49.690
let me go somewhere else and this is we'll tarp progress in a Muslim dominated

528
00:43:52.401 --> 00:43:55.490
state in India.
And again,

529
00:43:55.491 --> 00:44:00.491
you see there the issue of Muslims suspicions and resistance to vaccination,

530
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.270
but I want to turn from those.
Imagine that all of that going on.

531
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:10.690
But I'd like to look at some biological issues that emerged in places like this.

532
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:18.130
The first was whether a polio turned out to be more complicated than smallpox

533
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:23.690
because smallpox had only one serotype.

534
00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.330
Polio virus has types one,

535
00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:30.830
two and three and there's no crossover immunity from one to the other.

536
00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.290
So it was a more complicated disease than smallpox.

537
00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.330
That was a first problem.

538
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.410
And this emerged in the form of what kind of vaccine you use.

539
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.690
One that's monovalent attacking,

540
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:47.810
developing resistance against only one type of polio virus or polyvalent.

541
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.640
Should it be a tried to immunize you at once against one,

542
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.530
two oral three times?

543
00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:01.430
It turned out that polyvalent vaccines for complicated reasons weren't so

544
00:45:01.951 --> 00:45:02.784
effective.

545
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

546
00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.510
<v 0>Another was a problem of monitoring and surveillance.</v>

547
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.760
Unlike smallpox,

548
00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:14.300
vast majority of polio cases,

549
00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.360
we're in a symptomatic and then there was a problem called the uh,

550
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:21.200
interference.

551
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:27.100
Children were found to be vaccinated 20 and 25 times and still not to have

552
00:45:29.091 --> 00:45:31.970
developed an immunity to polio.

553
00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:33.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

554
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.200
<v 0>Why was that?</v>

555
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.340
It turned out that an unsanitary tropical conditions,

556
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:42.210
the intestinal flora of other viruses,

557
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:47.130
particularly enteroviruses in the Senate,
in the digestive tract,

558
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:52.580
could be so dense that the polio virus and the vaccine would be unable to

559
00:45:53.551 --> 00:45:58.551
establish an infection and therefore an immune response.

560
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:07.970
There were other problems that emerged in these turbulent years after 2003

561
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.740
turbulent for the Global Publi oh eradication initiative,

562
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.890
one was that live viruses,

563
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:20.310
this Sabin polio virus,
remember,

564
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.680
it's a live vaccine.

565
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.660
It was unlike the smallpox vaccine.
The smallpox vaccine,

566
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:28.470
as you know,

567
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:33.470
was a vaccine from cow pox that had a crossover immunity to small pox and cow

568
00:46:36.181 --> 00:46:39.090
pox is not a serious human disease.

569
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:40.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

570
00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.480
<v 0>With polio instead what's administered through the oral vaccine is a live virus</v>

571
00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.080
and attenuated.
Strange,
yes,

572
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.200
but it still is the live virus and therefore there is always the possibility of

573
00:46:56.661 --> 00:47:01.661
the virus mutating and reverting to a very on that form and this indeed happened

574
00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.820
causing outbreaks of what's called vaccine associated paralytic polio.

575
00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.840
This possibility wasn't just theoretical,

576
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.080
it happened in the Philippines,
in Madagascar,

577
00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.420
in China and in Indonesia,

578
00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:27.010
reversing progress against the disease outbreaks or that kind of occasion to

579
00:47:27.551 --> 00:47:32.551
quip the quip that it was impossible to eradicate polio without the oral polio

580
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:35.620
vaccine,

581
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.520
but it was also impossible to eradicate polio with it because the vaccine itself

582
00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.000
led to outbreaks of polio.

583
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.200
So vaccine associated polio virus implied something serious that the campaign

584
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:58.410
against poliomyelitis could have no logical end point because it would always be

585
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:05.581
necessary to immunize populations against epidemics that could be initiated by

586
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:08.080
the vaccine itself.

587
00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.240
A very paradoxical situation and the difficulty is all the more intractable

588
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:20.190
because people with immunodeficiency disorders can continue to shed the virus

589
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.080
for as long as 10 years or more.

590
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:26.770
So if the campaign were ever allowed to lapse,

591
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:32.010
the accumulation of non unimmunized susceptibles could result in devastating

592
00:48:32.321 --> 00:48:37.060
virgin soil epidemics among those who had no immunity.

593
00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:38.860
So for this reason,

594
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:43.950
critics have argued that the who campaign involved a semantic trick with the

595
00:48:44.861 --> 00:48:46.180
word eradication.

596
00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:51.730
Traditionally around occasion had always implied the cessation of the need to

597
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:55.810
maintain public protective public health policies.

598
00:48:56.440 --> 00:49:00.760
But vaccine associated polio,

599
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:05.790
paralytic polio meant that planners for this campaign would have to continue

600
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.110
immunization indefinitely.

601
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:12.280
The traditional criterion that eradication implied,

602
00:49:12.281 --> 00:49:16.810
the end of prophylactic measures was quietly drunk and then their,

603
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:20.520
their problems about certification and eradication.

604
00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:25.680
Polio virus is notorious for being silent and undetected and its circulation at

605
00:49:27.221 --> 00:49:30.100
the other end of the spectrum from smallpox.

606
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:35.190
So how would you be able to actually confirm that there were no more cases?

607
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:41.310
And it's also true that another problem that pole symptoms of paralytic acute

608
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:43.444
flaccid

609
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:48.940
paralysis can be caused by other conditions.
There.

610
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:53.770
On your handout,
I won't mention them because I'm rapidly running out of time,

611
00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:55.900
but in my last 30 seconds,

612
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:01.380
I would say that the history of Global Polio Eradication Initiative demonstrates

613
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.800
that the original optimistic belief that polio like smallpox can be rounded

614
00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:13.000
readily eradicated by vaccination was misplaced.

615
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:17.500
Smallpox is exceptionally vulnerable to a top.

616
00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.470
It has no animal reservoirs,

617
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:25.240
no range of Syrah types that confer no crossover immunity.

618
00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:29.850
It's symptoms are almost always memorable and florid.

619
00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:30.830
For the software,

620
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.040
it gives rise and survivors to a lasting immunity and the vaccine used to

621
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:39.440
attacked.
It is effective after a single effort.

622
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:45.160
Polio is a far more formidable enemy that reminds us that the original

623
00:50:46.401 --> 00:50:49.820
eradication is perspective may be illusory.

624
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:55.450
The human condition is to be surrounded by near infinity of infectious,

625
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:58.370
constantly evolving microbes.

626
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:01.580
Occasional final victories are possible,

627
00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.880
but they should be celebrated as exceptions rather than regarded as successive

628
00:51:06.921 --> 00:51:09.290
steps to a garden free Eden,

629
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.680
the normal state is one of vigilance to minimize harm and achieve control.

630
00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:21.100
Polio seems to me unlikely soon to follow smallpox by becoming the second

631
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:27.530
infectious disease ever to be eradicated.
That would be,

632
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.480
uh,
if I had time,
I talk more about it,
but I don't.
So let's stop there.

633
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:34.790
And I don't want to make a prediction,

634
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:39.560
but I think we need to see how complex eradication actually is.

635
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:44.210
And polio isn't like smallpox and many other diseases aren't.
