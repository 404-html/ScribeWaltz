1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.110
This morning we'll take up one of the themes that is to say we've described how

2
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.950
the courses about specific diseases,

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.190
but it's also about a number of overarching themes and one of those is the

4
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:20.160
development of various public health strategies.

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.800
So far as you remember,

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.830
we've dealt with three public health strategies.

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.540
One was the system of plague measures,

8
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.060
sanitary cordons,
lots,

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.360
directos quarantine and all the rest of it.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.990
We've dealt with vaccination as a public health strategy with regard to smallpox

11
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.400
in particular,

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.120
and we've talked about a third policy if we want to dignify it in that way.

13
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.460
And this was the strategy of concealment.

14
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.540
This morning I want to talk about a fourth approach to public health and this

15
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.590
was what's called commonly the sanitary movement.

16
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.610
This was pioneered in Britain in the 1830s and forties and it was then exported

17
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.900
to the continent in North America,

18
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.740
assuming particular forms in France,

19
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:24.741
in Italy with the actual rebuilding of cities in accord with sanitary

20
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.160
principles.

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.150
Now the sanitary movement was the first to define itself as a public health

22
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:37.881
movement and it had two essential meanings for its term.

23
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.770
The first was the prevention of infectious epidemic diseases.

24
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.610
And the second was the removal of filth.

25
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.480
So it's based in a sense on the relationship of filth and disease.

26
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.691
Indeed,

27
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:59.691
many people talk about the filth theory of disease as lying at the basis of the

28
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.800
sanitary movement.

29
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.610
It's focused therefore was on the towns and cities that had sprung up with

30
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.760
urbanization and the industrial revolution

31
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.650
epidemic diseases disproportionately claim their victims in the cities.

32
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.230
And correspondingly,

33
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.770
the legacy of lasting effects was priests specially pronounced in urban areas.

34
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.970
And the sanitary movement is one of those lasting legacies.

35
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.540
Now there is a theory that uh,

36
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.680
we may as well look out just for a second developed by the British physician and

37
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.221
demographer Thomas mccown and it's often called his thesis where he was dealing

38
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.590
with the demographic fact of what he called a mortality revolution,

39
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.590
a demographic transition in which cities for the first time become places that

40
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.720
are dependent for their expansion,

41
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.430
not only on inward migration to the towns,

42
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.580
but on the fact that the longevity and the birth rate come to exceed the death

43
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:24.790
rate,
which was something new,
a real demographic revolution.

44
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And why was this achieved and many people have thought and postulated that it

45
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:36.541
was due to medical science to conscious policy

46
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.130
and those sorts of explanations.

47
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.000
Mccowen instead stresses to factors.

48
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.740
He sees this as largely unplanned and do to improve nutrition,

49
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.570
but also and not the point this morning to the role of sanitation.

50
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.860
In other words,
the population explosion,

51
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.250
the demographic revolution is something that he postulates,

52
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.080
which due to,

53
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.110
not to medical science but rather to the sanitary movement and also to nutrition

54
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.330
well,
what was the background to the sanitary movement?

55
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.500
We've seen and mentioned that there really was a tremendous challenge to health

56
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.520
in this period of the industrial revolution in European history.

57
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.900
There were tremendous changes afoot in British society.

58
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.130
There was the rise of a modern commercial agriculture and with it and closure,

59
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.950
the driving of peasants off the land.

60
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.880
We know about the major demographic growth that was underway by this period

61
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.760
supported by the new agriculture and the fading of the threat of famine and the

62
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:59.230
fading of the threat of plague.

63
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.750
There was the rise of manufacturer and then the factory system,

64
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.140
especially the textile industry and the associated an unregulated horrors of

65
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:16.090
things such as long hours,
low wages,
child labor,

66
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200
you know,
to that across Europe,

67
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.320
urban populations doubled in the first half of the 19th century and in so doing

68
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.420
overwhelmed the infrastructure of available jobs,
the housing stock,

69
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.510
sanitary arrangements and all the rest so that we see the rise of tenement slums

70
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.140
sweatshops.

71
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.130
There was a mass movement of population from countryside to town and with

72
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:50.080
thought went psychological adjustments.

73
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.440
There was a breakdown of older notions of social relations based on paternalism,

74
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.680
of the customary notion of a moral economy based on moral obligation.

75
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.560
And we see in said the rise of the principles of impersonal relations of a free

76
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.651
market economy unless say fair epitomized in the new discipline of political

77
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:20.030
economy with such figures,
of course as Adam Smith,

78
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.930
Ricardo,
Jeremy Bentham,
Thomas Malthus.

79
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.950
The result along with those transformations was a rise of new social tensions.

80
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.540
We've talked about the 19th century as the rebellious century.

81
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.160
Now in Britain,

82
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.630
there were no social and political revolutions,

83
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.720
nothing comparable to 1789 in France or to what happened on the continent in

84
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:57.401
1830 and in 1848 and nine but contemporaries weren't certain at all that this

85
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:03.500
was going to be a lasting fortune for Britain.

86
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.370
And indeed Britain did have a number of signs of severe social tension as well.

87
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.640
There were large scale riots.

88
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.010
One could mention the chartist movement and in the country side,

89
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.040
the movement known as Captain Swing,

90
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.540
so urban and industrial centers.
Also in Britain,

91
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.660
we're perceived as dangerous politically for fear of the so called dangerous

92
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:37.430
classes who rioted perhaps committed crime,

93
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.020
threatened revolution,

94
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.820
and we're dangerous medically as well.
That is,

95
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.940
they were infected with cholera and other diseases and it was cholera in

96
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:56.840
particular.
That was a real prod to action,

97
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.490
this new and most feared disease of the 19th century.

98
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.260
It's not by chance then that the sanitary movement begins in the 1830s and

99
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:14.111
forties and Britain after that is to say the first pandemic and the second of

100
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:17.750
Asiatic Cholera

101
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.430
and it lasts intermittently down through the first world war.

102
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.720
And this really was a vast movement.

103
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.960
It was nothing less than the retrofitting of the urban centers of the nation

104
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.620
with the specific goal of removing filth,

105
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.660
because filth was held to be the cause of disease.

106
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.680
So we're talking about one of the great public works projects of modern history,

107
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.070
the establishment of sewer systems,

108
00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.080
a whole infrastructure of water mains of waste removal,

109
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.670
street cleansing improved unless crowded housing,

110
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.910
the creation of parks and public spaces.

111
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.360
So we can see that Victorian Britain truly was preoccupied with that combination

112
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.800
of excrement and water.

113
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.130
All of this of course presupposed as well.

114
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.230
The emergence of a modern state.
It was state power.

115
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.380
That alone provided the wealth and organizational structures that were needed to

116
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:40.170
carry out this enormous project.

117
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.070
And in turn we can see the causal chain working in both ways because the

118
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:52.251
sanitary movement was and very important factor in reinforcing state power.

119
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It's implementation meant that the state now invaded areas of life formerly

120
00:10:00.301 --> 00:10:05.301
regarded as private and appropriated for itself enormous new powers.

121
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:13.130
And the reformers were supported by Protestant and especially evangelical

122
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:18.360
Christian churches.
Well,
who were the leaders of this movement?

123
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.620
And I think we should turn first of all to this men,

124
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.630
Sir Edwin Chadwick.

125
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.500
This is Edwin Sir Edwin in his younger days.

126
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.020
This may be a slightly more familiar picture of him.
Uh,

127
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.120
I guess maybe at my age.
And then he case,

128
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.740
I'm sure Edwin wrote a major work,
um,

129
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.320
collaboratively he produced it,

130
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:48.321
let us say a that which was called the report on the sanitary condition of the

131
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:53.790
laboring population of Great Britain of 1842.

132
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.321
Now,

133
00:10:55.321 --> 00:11:00.321
Chadwick wasn't a physician at all and this is part of the background perhaps to

134
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:05.100
the thesis I was mentioning earlier.

135
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.550
He wasn't stead a lawyer by training from Manchester and he was already well

136
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:17.901
known in particular for his reform of welfare provisions in Britain.

137
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.240
Uh,
that is,

138
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:26.330
he was responsible in large part from the passage from the old poor law,

139
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.940
which had provided relief as the birthright of every citizen in distress.

140
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.220
That is the right to some form of assistance or aid in time of distress.

141
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.900
Chadwick's idea was to economize,

142
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.140
to minimize the cost of payments,

143
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.160
to discourage the poor from applying for relief.

144
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.340
He wanted to make the experience of receiving relief more painful than the

145
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:02.920
experience of distress itself.

146
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.720
A principal that was dubbed the principle of least eligibility,

147
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.770
the workhouse and other words was to be a place of punishment,

148
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.420
of pain and of suffering.

149
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.230
So work should be in the workhouse more unpleasant than any to be found in the

150
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:24.730
labor market.

151
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.890
And the Diet should be intentionally made to be loathsome

152
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.580
more so than what could be found by the poor outside.

153
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.080
So the poor law bureaucracy was also invoked and was an essential foundation of

154
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:49.581
the information on which Chadwick relied for the sanitary report of the laboring

155
00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:53.790
population of Great Britain.

156
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.960
And this was the man who was the same in both faces with the new poor law and

157
00:13:00.931 --> 00:13:02.640
with the sanitary report.

158
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.750
The sanitary reform was also a stark assertion of state power as a means of

159
00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:13.320
social control.

160
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.160
The intention was to discipline and civilize the working classes in the interest

161
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.450
of social stability.

162
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:27.470
Following in the wake of the report was the establishment of a public health act

163
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.320
of 1848 and Britain and a general board of health and such champions of sanitary

164
00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.500
reform as John Simon,

165
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.700
Thomas Southwood Smith and you know our nut.

166
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.510
Now let's talk for a minute about this men's ideology and his intentions.

167
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.150
The this was a class based movement.

168
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.600
It was top down and centralizing in chadwicks mind.

169
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.020
The poor were largely responsible for their own plight.

170
00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.160
They weren't innocent and they certainly weren't harmless.

171
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.540
His mission was to cleanse and civilize the dangerous classes.

172
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.560
As I said,

173
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.590
he wasn't a physician and his reforms were not based on any new medical

174
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:29.340
discoveries on scientific experimentation or observation to determine what

175
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:35.971
measures were most effective by determining the causes of disease.

176
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.940
Is reform measures enormous as they were were based more on what was the common

177
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:48.280
sense of the period and a priori assumptions.

178
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.950
Public health this way

179
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.120
<v 1>was separate from the development of medical science.</v>

180
00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.100
<v 0>His view,
and this was widely accepted,</v>

181
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.370
was that medicine was about private persons,

182
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:08.490
not so much public policy and his idea was to use public policy to cleanse the

183
00:15:10.631 --> 00:15:15.631
urban environment but not to deal with other social and economic determinants of

184
00:15:18.611 --> 00:15:20.950
disease.
We'll talk about that in a moment.

185
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.150
We need to think not only about what Chadwick wanted to do,

186
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.930
but we also need to think about what he decided not to do,

187
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.280
what wasn't important to him and so we should see this as progress.

188
00:15:33.281 --> 00:15:34.120
Yes,

189
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.070
but progress that came at a cost and we want to know about that as well.

190
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.420
Now an influence on Chadwick's thinking was the essay on population of Thomas

191
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.660
Malthus who believed that there was a law that in every society population

192
00:15:52.211 --> 00:15:57.070
pressure sooner or later pressed against the limits of subsistence.

193
00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:02.980
So real improvement for the poor was likely to be illusionary sort term and

194
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:07.970
perhaps counter productive in the long run.

195
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.200
Really significant improvement couldn't occur according to Malthus.

196
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:16.310
It might even be self defeating,
leading to disease,

197
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.260
starvation and war.

198
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.400
Those great positive checks on population increase.

199
00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.980
That idea of the limited nature of possible improvement was an chadwicks mind.

200
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.680
The poor will always be with us.

201
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:34.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

202
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.050
<v 0>There was also,
as I said,
the filth theory of disease.</v>

203
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.360
Um,
we know it,

204
00:16:41.361 --> 00:16:46.361
we've talked about my asthma and that's long history in European thought.

205
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.081
Well,

206
00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:53.081
filth now was associated very closely with smell and if you are to read the

207
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:59.741
report at some point you would notice that smells constitute an important part

208
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:02.504
of the report.

209
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.860
The report is filled with descriptions of stench.

210
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.610
The authorities consulted by Chadwick,

211
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:16.180
frequently used phrases such as I was assailed by a most disagreeable smell.

212
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.980
And it was clear to me that the air was full of most injurious malaria by

213
00:17:26.151 --> 00:17:30.470
malaria.
That's another word that occurs throughout the report.

214
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.300
And we should note that before malaria came to mean a specific disease,

215
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.010
it meant bad air from the Italian model and audio bad air.

216
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.100
And so this report in Britain in the 1840s is filled with descriptions of what

217
00:17:46.401 --> 00:17:47.780
they called malaria.

218
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:53.250
Let me you an example from the town in the West country of Truro.

219
00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.030
Uh,
the reporting to Chadwick,

220
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:02.120
the reporting official said passing into Saint Mary's parish.

221
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.300
Their proportion of sickness and deaths is as great as any part of truer,

222
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.500
but there is no mystery at all in the causation.

223
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.340
It'll constructed houses with decomposing refuse close upon their doors and

224
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:25.701
windows open drains bring the oozing of pig sties and filth to stagnate at the

225
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:34.971
field of the walls such you're a few of the sources of disease,

226
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.280
which even the breezes from the hills cannot dissipate everywhere.

227
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.670
The reports discovered disease and they correlated the disease with such

228
00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:52.340
findings as poisonous vapor,
more [inaudible],

229
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.900
effluvia filth,

230
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.580
obnoxious of flew via poisonous exhalations,

231
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.070
my asthma and malaria.

232
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.720
The moral of the texts of those conditions also preoccupied those who took part

233
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:10.620
in the report,

234
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.590
vice alcohol in temperance,

235
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.690
and then more poverty and still worse more filth.

236
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:24.710
Poverty was partly the result of depravity and in providence and those in turn

237
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.220
reinforced more poverty and more filth.

238
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.571
Well,

239
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:35.571
there was a political aim behind the sanitary reform and I think we might call

240
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:40.190
this a transformation that Chad would,

241
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.200
was aiming at in the demographic composition of the British population.

242
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.410
In chadwicks mind trade unions,

243
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.400
which he a poured demonstrations,

244
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.760
strikes the chartist movement and all the rest were called by Chadwick wild and

245
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:02.640
dangerous assemblages,

246
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.560
but he noted that they were mainly led by the young,

247
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:13.530
older experienced workman with family responsibilities.

248
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:19.010
He found to be moderate and temperate as a and not to take part in strikes and

249
00:20:21.811 --> 00:20:23.130
social unrest.

250
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:29.420
Therefore a high early death rate and poor sanitary conditions.

251
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.320
We're actually politically destabilizing,

252
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.420
at least in his mind,

253
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:42.200
because they led the early death of workman and hence to an overrepresentation

254
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.410
of the dangerous young and an underrepresentation of moderating older workman.

255
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.960
Well,
if we want to understand and explain this view,

256
00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:01.110
perhaps we could invoke an anachronism to make an analogy and we could use the

257
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:07.561
analogy of a nuclear reactor and compare social unrest to a meltdown of the

258
00:21:10.031 --> 00:21:15.031
reactor core with disastrous consequences will in terms of the reactor to

259
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:20.110
prevent such events.
Reactors make use,

260
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:25.111
as you know of Boron control rods that are inserted to control the rate of

261
00:21:26.501 --> 00:21:31.501
fission of uranium and plutonium and to limit chain reactions.

262
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.420
We'll,
in this way.

263
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:39.690
What Chadwick wanted to do by analogy was to use older people like control rods

264
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:48.300
that would have the calming effect of Preventing Social Meltdown and social

265
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:49.180
revolution.

266
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.930
But to do that you had to do something about infectious diseases to achieve this

267
00:21:55.571 --> 00:21:59.080
demographic transformation of the population.

268
00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.340
So if infectious disease was destabilizing for the state and political order,

269
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.300
a population subject to infectious disease moreover is unlikely to be educated

270
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.670
and to be open to the moral influence of the clergy.

271
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.810
And the absence of cleansing and towns,

272
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:28.140
Chadwick felt would lead also to demoralization and further depravity.

273
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.860
Now and all of this thinking,

274
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.280
let's remember to at what was lost.

275
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:42.450
A striking feature of Chadwick's view was the narrowness of its focus,

276
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:49.660
the cause of ill health in Victorian Britain,

277
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.970
I think we should say not the cause.

278
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:57.060
The causes were undoubtedly multiple and one could think about low wages,

279
00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.610
unregulated factories,
inadequate diet,

280
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.180
poor clothing,
lack of education,

281
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.830
working conditions in sweatshops,
mines and factories,

282
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.590
child labor,
overcrowded housing.

283
00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.910
These I would call social and economic determinants of disease.

284
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.430
And there were voices,

285
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:23.320
particularly on the continent for an alternative public health that would

286
00:23:23.321 --> 00:23:26.530
address precisely such broad interests.

287
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.840
There was an older tradition of what was called a medical police on the

288
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:36.841
continent and the current of thought of what was called social medicine,

289
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.030
whose most prominent figure,
uh,

290
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.990
was this men Rudolph Veer cough,

291
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:49.530
a physician who lived from 1821 to 1902 and was one of the great figures of 19th

292
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:57.020
century medicine,
a physician,
anthropologists,

293
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:02.170
biologist and radical politician.
No,

294
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.290
his view was that disease was not simply a biological event,

295
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.690
but as socially driven phenomenon.

296
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:14.230
And his meaning of the term social medicine was that physicians should treat not

297
00:24:14.421 --> 00:24:19.421
just individual patients but entire societies and that they should pay great

298
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:24.170
attention to matters of the economy,

299
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.180
to diet,
wages,
housing,
child labor,

300
00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.680
working conditions.

301
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:36.730
So veer cough was in a sense the Anti Chadwick Chadwick's intention instead was

302
00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:45.800
to focus on the narrow issue of filth and water.

303
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.560
And his attention was confined.

304
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:54.590
The working classes and the filth in which they lived at stake was the issue of

305
00:24:58.111 --> 00:25:01.110
how broad should have public health movement be.

306
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.800
And perhaps one could say that one of the sad features of the period was the

307
00:25:08.141 --> 00:25:12.700
triumph of the,
now our was to gauge division of public health,

308
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.300
the solution in chadwicks hands.

309
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:21.160
And this was a major event in public health.

310
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:24.430
There's no doubt about it.
I'm trying to say,

311
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.470
not that this was unfortunate.

312
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:31.540
It was only unfortunately narrow Chadwick solution involves technological

313
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.240
measures.
All good in themselves,

314
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.900
drains,
sewers,
water pipes,

315
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:43.900
but they didn't include social,

316
00:25:43.901 --> 00:25:48.901
economic and educational reform and the reforms all came from above and

317
00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:55.471
reinforce a centralizing state rather than finding ways to empower ordinary

318
00:25:57.341 --> 00:26:01.300
people to participate in defending their own health.

319
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.250
Let me give you an example of a tech simple technological improvement.

320
00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.510
It might be hard to recognize when you first look at it,
but,

321
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:15.540
and I'm talking about some very humble movements that have enormous political

322
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.390
and medical consequences.

323
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:24.510
What we're looking at is a sewer main and these were established under the soil

324
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.470
of cities in this period.

325
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:34.530
And one of the technological inventions was to make the sewers egg shaped so

326
00:26:34.631 --> 00:26:39.631
that you would maximize the flow and they would be self cleaning and um,

327
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.270
they would drain most efficiently.

328
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:49.460
So technological innovations of that sort or a part of it now the victory of

329
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:56.451
Chadwick's vision of public health wasn't simply automatic and so it was worth

330
00:26:58.921 --> 00:27:01.080
to keep alternatives in mind.

331
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:07.340
His side was the winning side in a debate of the early 19th century and a wider

332
00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:13.971
view like that of your cough was present but lost the debate.

333
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.830
No,
let's be clear.
In summation,

334
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:26.620
I'd argue that Chadwick's vision of public health was highly successful.

335
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.280
That it was a crucial part of the mortality revolution of 19th century Europe.

336
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:40.220
But at the same time something was lost or broad vision of the causes of disease

337
00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.290
and those causes weren't addressed.

338
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.470
So although what Chadwick achieved was a major in positive advance,

339
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:56.770
it perhaps fell short of what might have been and it German straights,

340
00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:02.410
the practical and positive impact of miasmatic theory and public health,

341
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:04.731
uh,
theory.

342
00:28:04.731 --> 00:28:09.731
And this is perhaps something we want to bear in mind that a theory that is by

343
00:28:11.511 --> 00:28:15.680
now rejected that is my asthma TISM.

344
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.860
The fill theory of disease did operate in such a way as to promote major and

345
00:28:23.361 --> 00:28:28.361
positive health results and one of the causes of this movement was the epidemic

346
00:28:31.161 --> 00:28:36.161
disease that we dealt with the last couple of times and that is Asiatic cholera.

347
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:43.450
We might note there was a side light that may be of interest as well that this

348
00:28:46.061 --> 00:28:47.840
sanitary movement,

349
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:53.140
the literal sanitary movement was accompanied in some places by what we might

350
00:28:55.551 --> 00:29:00.551
call a figurative sanitary movement and that is moral sanitation.

351
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.320
And one of those was particularly notable in France where there was a great fear

352
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.500
of another disease that we'll be talking about slightly later in the course and

353
00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:17.880
that is syphilis.

354
00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.630
Remember the early 19th century,

355
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:26.160
we're dealing with the period in the wake of the Napoleonic wars

356
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.810
and with those wars as always happens there or happen,

357
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:39.620
there was a major upsurge in socially transmitted diseases and in particular

358
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.240
syphilis.
And so this sounded,

359
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:50.250
Terry Movement was accompanied by the Movement for moral sanitation to the

360
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:56.011
registration and surveillance of prostitutes and in France,

361
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.890
those responsible for moral sanitation actually made the link explicit.

362
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:08.550
That is to say that they compared brothels with sewers and sad that they,

363
00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.840
the brothels should become the target of sanitation.

364
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:20.100
So this was a form of moral sanitation that was an offshoot of the literal

365
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.310
sanitary movement that we've is our main theme

366
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:26.171
now,

367
00:30:26.171 --> 00:30:31.171
the sanitary worldview led also on the continent to further off shoots and that

368
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:40.620
I want to talk now about continental form of the sanitary movement,

369
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.520
the rebuilding of cities in their entire team.

370
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.820
This was actually much more comprehensive and systematic.

371
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.700
It means urban planning.

372
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.170
It's more comprehensive than what happened in Britain,

373
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:04.230
which was the retrofitting of cities with sewers and drains and sanitary

374
00:31:06.401 --> 00:31:07.234
provisions.

375
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:12.330
It entailed the actual leveling of whole cities or neighborhoods within them to

376
00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:18.490
start a fresh in accordance with a comprehensive plan.

377
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:24.040
Now,
there were a number of prototypes and France,
Paris,

378
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.790
Leon and Marcee in Belgium,

379
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:31.570
Brussels in Naples,
that is in Italy.

380
00:31:31.571 --> 00:31:33.220
There was Naples as you know,

381
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.730
but also Florence lists Betsy and other places.

382
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.820
But let's begin in Paris because that established the pattern

383
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:48.460
here again,
we see the influence of epidemic cholera,

384
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.420
which ravaged Paris in the 1830s and again in 1849 and this caused an enormous

385
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:00.550
psychological shock.

386
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.960
The idea that civilization was no sure fire protection against sudden and

387
00:32:08.451 --> 00:32:10.300
agonizing disease,

388
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:16.000
there was an unbearable contradiction.
That is city,

389
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:21.001
that is Paris that prided itself at being at the heart of European intellectual

390
00:32:22.481 --> 00:32:23.314
life,

391
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:27.580
at being the leading city and the arts and culture.

392
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:29.760
A world center,

393
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:34.770
as you now know of scientific medicine could nevertheless be devastated by a

394
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:40.580
disease that was associated with poverty,

395
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.750
with filth,
and with the colonial world.

396
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:50.150
Well,
after the revolutions of 1848 to nine,

397
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.130
we have a reactionary and authoritarian regime

398
00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.730
established by Louis Napoleon Bonaparte or Napoleon.

399
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:04.970
The third,
um,

400
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:10.150
that soon became this second empire that lasted for me Tiene 51 till 1870.

401
00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.190
Well,
there's Napoleon the third,
and I want,

402
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:19.760
he undertook a major movement to rebuild Paris.

403
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
And I want to argue that this had enormous sanitary consequences intentionally

404
00:33:25.911 --> 00:33:30.911
so and that the epic experience of epidemic cholera was very important in the

405
00:33:32.241 --> 00:33:33.530
establishment of that,

406
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.620
but I don't want to say that the rebuilding of Paris was solely designed as a

407
00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:45.320
health measure and solely to prevent the return of cholera.

408
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.380
There were other games as well.

409
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.580
Napoleon the third wanted imperial splendor.

410
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.570
He wanted a city that would be worthy of the role of France and the world that

411
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:04.190
would be a showcase for his new political regime.

412
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:08.630
He too was thinking about social control,

413
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:14.470
so there was a political aim that was to destroy the working class slums that

414
00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:18.350
had been the sights of rebellion.

415
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:24.610
The idea was to use urban renewal to remove workers from the center of the city

416
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:32.170
to distant suburbs and in the center to construct wide boulevards that could be,

417
00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:40.180
could not be defended by barricades and that the troops could move quickly,

418
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:45.740
use to move quickly across the cities and cannon balls could fire down the

419
00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:49.730
boulevards to demolish barricades.
In other words,

420
00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:53.300
Paris was to be made revolution proof,

421
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.120
or at least that was the goal.

422
00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.670
It was also a project of public works that is,

423
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.250
it was a means of enormous patronage.

424
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.890
It would provide employment and would diffuse social tensions as well.

425
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:14.950
So powers under Napoleon the third became a vast public works project.

426
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.610
Uh,
enormous shovel ready projects.

427
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:25.690
The workers of Paris then would be employed and therefore largely pacified.

428
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.190
It was thought that this would also have an economic role.

429
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:32.870
The new boulevards,

430
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:37.871
the wide spaces would facilitate the movement of goods and assist free trade and

431
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:40.110
commerce.

432
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:46.010
And then there was the public health objective to improve health to prevent the

433
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:51.150
return of infectious epidemics.

434
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.220
The task was entrusted to this men,

435
00:35:56.790 --> 00:36:00.540
George Oh Smuin the prefect of the sin.

436
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:06.050
And often what was accomplished is referred to as the ost monetization of Paris

437
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:13.130
with the so called great works are good on travel that were undertaken from 1852

438
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:20.240
until 1870 now this project was authoritarian.

439
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.140
The rights of individuals were disregarded,

440
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:30.530
the population was not consulted about being moved and it was an operation of

441
00:36:31.891 --> 00:36:33.570
colossal complexity.

442
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:39.600
All of the affairs of one of the greatest cities in France.

443
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:44.810
The great city in France were gathered into a single pair of hands,

444
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.700
finance,
administration,
transport,

445
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.860
sanitation,
engineering,
architecture,
evictions,

446
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.700
expropriation of land by eminent domain,

447
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.260
slum clearance,
gas fixtures,
and lighting,

448
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:05.880
sewers.

449
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.880
All of this was an enormous assertion then of state power.

450
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:17.190
The means were broad intersecting boulevards.

451
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:22.250
Let me show you the sorts of plans were to have the great boulevards of Paris

452
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.120
that you can see today

453
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:33.630
that such as the rue,
the Rivoli,
the boulevard distrust book,

454
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.090
Sebastopol,
the Boulevard,
San Michelle.

455
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:41.270
The average size width of a street in Paris was to be doubled and underneath the

456
00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:47.901
streets there were to be sewers and drains the words to be water supply and

457
00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:53.530
there were it to be broad parks and public spaces such as the broader Bologne.

458
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.990
The aesthetics were the aesthetics of the straight line.

459
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.420
We can see that there.

460
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:05.421
We can see it also here and you can see the intersection of these broad

461
00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:09.540
boulevards and you can see how these were had mult.

462
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:14.541
We're multipurpose and would allow not only part of the idea was the miasmatic

463
00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:21.201
one that they would allow air and light to sweep through the city and remove the

464
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:27.860
noxious smells and purify and cleanse the city.

465
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:33.390
And you can see as well that they would be good for commerce and for social

466
00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:34.380
control.

467
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
So Paris after Osman was clearly much healthier as a city than before and call

468
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:50.170
Laura did not return there afterwards to the city center.

469
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:56.460
But there is an irony here that cholera did return less vehemently then before,

470
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.110
but in the 1890s,

471
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.670
it did return but not to the center of the city.
And in other words,

472
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:11.820
part of the sanitary problem of Paris was not entirely solved,

473
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:17.370
but was exported to the suburbs and it was the suburbs that experience the

474
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:20.380
return of cholera in 1892.

475
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.090
So we have to see this as an enormous sanitary success,

476
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.010
but one that we want to qualify.
Let me look at much.
Look,

477
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:31.480
this is a map,

478
00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:36.540
a picture of the demolition to convince you of what a major undertaking this

479
00:39:38.981 --> 00:39:43.930
once.
Um,
and there's the,
uh,
uh,

480
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:48.931
view of the new open spaces cleanse with light and air and germ free and also in

481
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:56.260
Napoleon,
the third mine.
It would be also,
um,

482
00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:01.060
make revolution much more difficult.
Well,

483
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:06.450
there was the political sec success as well as the sanitary was a success,

484
00:40:07.751 --> 00:40:09.820
but one that needs to be qualified.

485
00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:15.570
There was an enormous resentment among the working people of Paris at Ost months

486
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:17.973
project.

487
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:23.790
And there was an enormous history from that time down to nearly our own of

488
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:27.410
hostility of the suburbs.

489
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:32.670
Paris becomes not by chance surrounded by a red belt of concluding hostility to

490
00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:38.460
the regime.
And this exploded in the summer,

491
00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:43.480
spring of 1871 in the Paris commune that brought down the regime and led to the

492
00:40:45.941 --> 00:40:50.620
establishment of a republic.
So they're all so political qualifications.

493
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.941
Well,

494
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:56.941
I'll move then to another example very quickly and one that,

495
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.290
uh,
is in the reading and that is the Italian version.

496
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.640
And in particular the,
the Nissan,

497
00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:08.800
the men tall of Naples,

498
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.460
which was Italy's largest city,
as you know,

499
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:17.200
there was a massive epidemic in the city.
This is,

500
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.833
<v 1>oh,</v>

501
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:23.970
<v 0>this is the plan of the de Sana Minto in Naples.</v>

502
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.400
And as you know,

503
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:31.550
it led to the idea and here is something that is actually unique that is to say

504
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:39.370
that we've talked about the retrofitting of British cities and also American

505
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:44.210
ones.
We've talked about the rebuilding of Paris.

506
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:49.540
Those were associated with a variety of disease experiences and they had

507
00:41:51.681 --> 00:41:54.860
purposes other than a single disease.

508
00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:59.980
One can't see through a retrofitting of British cities as due solely to epidemic

509
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:06.140
cholera nor the rebuilding of Paris.

510
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.670
Here in Naples,

511
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:12.671
we have something that's unusual and probably unique,

512
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:17.830
which is the actual rebuilding of a major European city for this specific

513
00:42:19.491 --> 00:42:23.600
purpose of preventing the return of cholera.

514
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:29.620
And the way that the plan was developed reflected the specific medical

515
00:42:30.741 --> 00:42:34.610
understanding of the time of the cause of cholera.

516
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:40.570
And we see here to a form of the fill theory of disease.

517
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:46.250
The rebuilding of cholera was for the single purpose.

518
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:51.370
And the medical theory behind the rebuilding project was the specifically the

519
00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:57.911
miasmatic theory of this physician from um,

520
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:59.840
Bavaria.

521
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.130
Munich in particular who has mocks van Patten coffer,

522
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:09.250
who had an enormous influence on public health.

523
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.440
And one aspect of his influence was not his theory lay at the basis of the

524
00:43:16.341 --> 00:43:17.930
rebuilding of Naples.

525
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:23.590
He developed the most sophisticated of Maya's Madec theories in the 19th

526
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:26.330
century.
And when his aim,

527
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:31.331
the aim then behind the rebuilding of Naples was to thin out the population.

528
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:38.770
Overcrowding was a cause of disease and poisonous vapors arising from underneath

529
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:46.760
the city poison the air,

530
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:51.790
people breathe in the poison and succumbed to cholera and mocks Fenton coffers

531
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.263
you.

532
00:43:56.090 --> 00:44:01.090
So the purpose of the Sana mentor then was first of all to raise the level of

533
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:04.280
the streets.

534
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:10.420
That is to say the danger and the MIASMA was if we like fermenting beneath the

535
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:14.480
streets of the city.

536
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:20.260
So you want to place a greater distance between the population living above and

537
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:26.210
the poisonous Effluvia arising from below.

538
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:31.300
And so the aspiration was to raise the level of the streets to the second story

539
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.510
of the houses.
And there would be,
if you like,

540
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:41.511
then a massive cushion including the mortar of the streets themselves,

541
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:48.710
between the population of the city and the danger lurking in the groundwater

542
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.820
beneath the soil.
In addition,

543
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.890
the idea was that you would have Naples,

544
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.110
there's a picture of the old city that's uh,

545
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.990
in various aspects that's being demolished.

546
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:10.170
And here what I wanted to show was this,

547
00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:15.300
the great access at the center would,
and then there were various cross streets.

548
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.560
The uh,

549
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:21.650
great boulevard at the center was in the direction of the prevailing wind and it

550
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:27.801
was called a bellows of fresh air that would allow the wind to rush through the

551
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:32.350
city,
drawing up the,
um,
uh,

552
00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:37.380
flew via and blowing away the stenches and allowing the sunlight to reach ground

553
00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:40.764
level.

554
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:46.080
And then that would be crossed by a series of wide boulevards as well.

555
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.380
And then under the,
if this happened above ground,

556
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:54.800
there would also be work going on beneath and you would have a whole sewage

557
00:45:55.531 --> 00:45:58.920
mains being built,
uh,
under the city.

558
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.690
So we SANA mental,
this enormous project,

559
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.610
both above and below ground was related,

560
00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.190
was a cousin of the sanitary movement in Britain.

561
00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:16.440
It was a first cousin of the rebuilding of Paris and Leon.

562
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:22.310
But it was distinctive too because it's the only example of a project conducted

563
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:27.360
exclusively for the purpose of defeating a single disease.

564
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:32.490
And that was cholera.
Was it a success?
We'll,

565
00:46:32.491 --> 00:46:37.491
Naples was rebuilt and there's no doubt that the health of the city thereafter

566
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.730
was greater than it had been before.

567
00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:45.720
But unfortunately there too,
there was,

568
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:50.100
there were qualifications.
The rebuilding was marred,

569
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:55.790
marred perhaps partly by the flaws in its conception from the outset,

570
00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:01.940
but marred also by the fact of corruption and the misuse of the funds that were

571
00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:07.440
carried used to carry it out.

572
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:12.560
And so we see thereafter that although Naples was rebuilt in the aftermath of

573
00:47:14.191 --> 00:47:19.191
1884 that there was a return of cholera,

574
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.640
a major epidemic again in 1911

575
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.860
and there was even a small Coda to that,

576
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:32.860
which is another outbreak even in 1973

577
00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.630
so the irony in conclusion,

578
00:47:37.350 --> 00:47:39.960
the sanitary movement in Britain,

579
00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:44.270
retrofitting of cities.

580
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

581
00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:48.240
<v 0>The rebuilding of cities and France,</v>

582
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:53.420
the re Sana mental and Naples did achieve major success.

583
00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:54.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

584
00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:59.860
<v 0>But it's worth remembering that they often weren't based on a medical theory</v>

585
00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.060
that was to endure.

586
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:03.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

587
00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:05.450
<v 0>And indeed in the case of Naples,</v>

588
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.600
it was a medical theory that very soon after the rebuilding was to be discarded.

589
00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:15.170
No sooner had Naples been rebuilt down.

590
00:48:15.171 --> 00:48:17.790
The theories of Patton coffer,
uh,

591
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:22.070
were overturned with the coming of the germ theory of disease.

592
00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.690
So when we're,

593
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:28.750
one of the questions we asked them was the lasting impact of epidemic diseases.

594
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:36.160
And I would argue that one of the senses of lasting impact is one that's

595
00:48:38.151 --> 00:48:42.680
embodied in bricks and mortar and urban planning.

596
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:46.250
And if you visit,
uh,
the cities,

597
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:51.400
then you can see the lasting legacy of epidemic disease and the urban landscape

598
00:48:55.131 --> 00:48:55.670
itself.
