1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.390
Last time,
as you'll remember,

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:08.391
we talked about a general overview of the three pen dynamics as well as the

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:14.460
impact of the plague bacteria,

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.630
which we have here.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.750
You're sending a pestos the star of our show on the individual human body.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.990
This morning I'd like to talk about community responses to bubonic plague first

7
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.790
in terms of orders that is unorganized,

8
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.040
spontaneous responses.

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.180
And then I'd like to look at something really decisive,

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.720
which was organized community responses.

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.810
That is the first form of successful public health ever devised and the first

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.680
victory over a human disease over bluebonnet plague.

13
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.430
So that's where we're headed this morning.
And just so you'll remember,

14
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.780
play gives not a disease entirely of the past.

15
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.020
The third pandemic reached these shores and I wanted to remind you that plague

16
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.100
is still with us and these are the areas in the United States we're play.

17
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:22.281
Got The present day is endemic among wild rodents and it causes every year a

18
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.720
small trickle of,
uh,
cases of bubonic plague,

19
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.870
usually in the southwest of the United States will in terms of community

20
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:39.750
responses,
probably the first

21
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.340
and most spontaneous of all was flight panic and fear of sudden death led people

22
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.650
to depart in haste as the film makes clear,

23
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.980
those who are the first to flee where people of means and those often included

24
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.590
the authorities and physicians themselves and clergyman,

25
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.740
thereby increasing disruption and chaos and magnifying the sense of terror.

26
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.960
I imagine you could,
uh,
for an equivalent,
uh,

27
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.060
if you were to wake up tomorrow morning and here that there was something

28
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:28.131
terrible on the medical front happening in new haven and that Stefano and Rick

29
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.280
Levin had taken the last train out.

30
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.140
I can imagine some of the responses that you might have.

31
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.460
In any case,

32
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.140
let's remember the atmosphere in a city visited by the plague.

33
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.980
The last time you heard a description of Florence and 1348 provided by Boccaccio

34
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.040
and you're now reading,
uh,

35
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:56.880
about to phone and London in 1665.

36
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.660
So let me give you a different,
and also dramatic example.

37
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.820
And that was Naples in 1656 Naples,

38
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.580
one of the largest cities in Europe,

39
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.670
especially vulnerable because of its urban poverty and overcrowding and its

40
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:19.900
status as one of Europe's great port cities.

41
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.440
It had in 1656 the year of this terrible visitation,

42
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.380
a population of 500,000 an enormous city by 17th century standards and 300,000

43
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.200
people died no less in this visitation.

44
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.890
Every activity in Naples ceased at the time there was general unemployment and

45
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:50.260
universal hunger.
The living as in the cliche,

46
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.150
weren't sufficiently numerous to bury the dead.
And I mean not literally,

47
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.810
cadavers were left,
not only endures,

48
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.410
but in all public places.
In the end,

49
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.680
some 60,000 bodies were burned and pyres and 20,000 more were unceremoniously

50
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:12.640
dumped into the sea.

51
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.480
So imagine a great city then with the intolerable stench of decomposition with

52
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:21.724
dogs,

53
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.760
vultures and Ravens picking it cadavers and a total breakdown of law and order

54
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.310
and of Republic Service.

55
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.460
Imagine to the flight of people the sense that the end of the world was at hand.

56
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.651
And indeed,

57
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:43.651
one of the popular images of the plague and art was a block figure on horseback,

58
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.010
one of the dread horsemen of the apocalypse who would come on this final day of

59
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:51.394
reckoning.

60
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.630
So it was from places like this that everyone who could took to the roads often

61
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:03.991
with the fear in their hearts that God and his anger were in hot pursuit.

62
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.100
So the first spontaneous reaction was to escape.

63
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.060
But remember what we said about here,
moralism,

64
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.950
Hippocrates and Galen,

65
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.340
and if you'll remember then looking back,

66
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.270
medical theory at the time sanctioned this particular reaction or led to it

67
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:31.330
logically because epidemics and humoral theory,
as you now know,

68
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.480
were caused by an imbalance in the humors triggered by a poisoned air.

69
00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.020
One of the six are naturals,
a miasma.

70
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.430
In other words,

71
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.490
the disease was tied to the air around a given locality.

72
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.450
And so it made perfect good sense by the medical theory that people had

73
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:56.620
inherited,
that they should escape the locale.
And therefore,

74
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.410
the poisonous my answer,
man.

75
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.820
So the response of populations was mediated by the ideas that people had in

76
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.360
their heads.

77
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.510
By the ways an epidemic was understood or an a fashionable modern phrase,

78
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.070
how it was socially constructed.

79
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.220
Now,

80
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.220
orthodoxy was spawned in particular with an idea of what's called Miasma TISM.

81
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.510
That is to say there was a Miasma,

82
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.920
which is derived from the Greek word for corrupted or defiled.

83
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.600
A miasma was a corruption,
uh,

84
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:38.601
define what or poisoning of the air poisonous Adams emitted by rotting organic

85
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:44.180
matter of infected people.

86
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.420
And the objects they had touched were released,

87
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.270
became an a flew via in the air,

88
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.120
which was poisoned their by,

89
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.210
and once the air had been made poisonous,

90
00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:00.830
it could be absorbed by anyone in the locality through the pores and the skin

91
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:03.350
perhaps,
or by being inhaled.

92
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.280
So the body would then be poisoned like the air.

93
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.080
And so the search in the city was for a corrupting agent.

94
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.190
So what did people who had this idea,

95
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.310
this medical philosophy of Boob onic plague?

96
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.580
Where would their suspicions alight?
Well,

97
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:27.581
first there would fall on foul odors and these were plentiful and an early

98
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:29.150
modern city.

99
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:34.420
There was the night soil that people hurled from their windows and doors that

100
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:39.380
you awful that butchers swept into the streets.
There was the products,

101
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.510
the noxious products of stinking trades like metal or leather working or the

102
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:49.970
reading of him and so on.
This meant that there were,

103
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
the logical consequence would be urban cleanups and saw authorities ordered

104
00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:00.830
cleanups,
collect,
collected,
refuse,

105
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.790
close down certain workshops and trades,

106
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.650
cleanse the streets,

107
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.800
halted work and Abbott wars and ordered the prompt burial of cadavers.

108
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.330
Furthermore,
and Christian Europe water had a symbolic,

109
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.160
we like ritual cleansing attached to it.

110
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.700
It was a purifying quality because of its role in baptism where it cleanses the

111
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:31.460
soul.
So throughout Europe,

112
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.170
cities ordered their streets cleansed with water in times of plague.

113
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.370
They did more though than just cleanse the streets.

114
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:45.610
They tried also to cleanse the air directly and so there were bonfires that were

115
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:48.254
set,

116
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.560
especially with Aaron Mattick would like pine or with software and there was the

117
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.750
firing of Canon with the idea that this too would purify the air.

118
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.980
Those were authorities who took those measures.

119
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.220
There were also ideas of individual self protection and since the cause of the

120
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:17.310
plague was this horrible poisoned air around you,

121
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.940
it was a good idea to have a little file of aromatic spices around your neck or

122
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:30.130
it might be vinegar and tobacco had a certain popularity as people smoked their

123
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.230
way to health in the 17th century.

124
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.920
It was also wise to shut up windows indoors if you're indoors to prevent the

125
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:42.780
poison from entering your home.

126
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.610
The garments of people who were infected also fell under suspicion because the

127
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:54.560
miasmatic poison was held to cling to them.
Uh,

128
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.420
just as you know,
in your own experience,

129
00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.460
the scent of tobacco or perfume can cling to address a sweater or a shirt.

130
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:04.471
Well,

131
00:10:04.471 --> 00:10:09.471
for this reason people also try to protect themselves with special plague

132
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.000
costumes.
Um,
uh,
you can see you,
it'd be very handsome,

133
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:20.230
a dress like that and the idea was not the costume would be waxed,

134
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.260
uh,
because that would prevent anything adhering to it.

135
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.080
In this case,
they weren't thinking about fleas.

136
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.060
They were thinking about the outcomes of the corrupted defiled atmosphere.

137
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.210
And you'll note that there's a prominent feature is the beak here.

138
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.920
Uh,
and it's not because it's a bird,

139
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.630
it's the idea was that in the beak you would fill it with our,
with Herb's,

140
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.410
uh,
that were spicy and would protect you that way.

141
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.090
And you'll notice that the person is carrying a rod and that's not for

142
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:57.490
instructive purposes.
That's to keep people away,
uh,

143
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.220
at a safe distance from you.

144
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.250
So what better way than to be a bit like a verger or let me show you another

145
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.620
example.
Uh,
in here you might have a,

146
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.620
your own brasier of coal that's burning and you might have,

147
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:14.281
so for,

148
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:19.281
or something else that would sent the atmosphere around you and always of course

149
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:24.540
you would have your stick to keep people at a good safe distance to you.

150
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.660
You also took other precautions.

151
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.250
You would approach a plague victim if you suspected that you were encountering

152
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:33.720
one upwind.

153
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.690
And it was said that plague victims could be approached if you stayed up wind

154
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:41.340
and kept your distance.

155
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.820
But for those who approached downwind,

156
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.060
illness was likely and the outcome would depend on a body's susceptibility.

157
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.590
On its organic that would determine the balance.

158
00:11:55.591 --> 00:11:57.820
So the four bodily humors,

159
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.120
if the balance was precarious and he small influence that discourage the APP,

160
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.690
Librium could be fatal such as fear,

161
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.780
a dissolute lifestyle,
a sudden shill.

162
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.100
But this idea of cleansing in early modern Europe could also have more sinister

163
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.700
and ritualistic possibilities.

164
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.730
Then these were derived from ancient popular ideas of magic,

165
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:32.380
of God's anger and punishment for sin.
In other words,

166
00:12:32.381 --> 00:12:33.640
the contamination,

167
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:38.730
it was thought off by many people could have moral causes which had stirred the

168
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:40.750
divine wrath.

169
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:46.350
So vigilant community might well trying to identify and cast out those who were

170
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:49.960
morally responsible for the calamity.

171
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.380
Sin could be the abuse of food and drink,

172
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.820
excessive sleep and idleness in moderate,
in natural,

173
00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.850
unnatural or sinful sex or blasphemous religious practices and beliefs.

174
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:09.661
So let me show you this rather terrifying slide by Zhu lo ne of 1869 which is

175
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:14.200
called the plague of Rome.

176
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.130
And it refers to the Rome Clegg in the 17th century,

177
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.870
a major epidemic.

178
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:25.020
And what we see here is the angel of God pointing out to the event [inaudible]

179
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.023
angel,

180
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:32.100
the home of a center and the plague is about to destroy the centers and side.

181
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.150
This is the idea that people had in their heads.

182
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.330
So with that idea who might be inside,
well,

183
00:13:43.331 --> 00:13:47.470
suspicion felt on prostitutes for example,

184
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.980
and they were rounded up in many places and expelled from towns and brothels

185
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:54.670
were closed.

186
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.320
It might fall also on infidels,

187
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:05.320
religious dissenters,
Jews and Gypsies.

188
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.940
There might be a tax on foreigners and outsiders,

189
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:15.150
which is and lepers who were already suspected of being grievous sinners.

190
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.480
Or for people who had the view that predestination could be seen by your outward

191
00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:24.670
success in life,

192
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.790
whether you were the elect or not was visible by your worldly wealth then

193
00:14:31.631 --> 00:14:36.080
beggars by their poverty and misfortunes.

194
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.400
We're seen as having already received a first installment of the punishment they

195
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.620
deserve for their secret sins.

196
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.670
So in towns throughout Europe closed themselves to outsiders and inside the

197
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:56.630
towns,
undesirables might be rounded up and expelled,

198
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.870
or we're still in some places there were stonings lynchings,

199
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.541
burnings.

200
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:07.541
If the stay full scale pogroms or what we might today call ethnic cleansing.

201
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.970
The poisoning hysteria reinforced this idea and there was often a hysteria that

202
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:22.850
what the poisoning and the atmosphere was not a natural event,

203
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.080
but a crime.

204
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.210
And there were anointed is called [inaudible] or poisoners who are out to

205
00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:32.450
destroy people.
This was a diabolical plot.

206
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.560
And so a hunt was off and on to find the culprits.

207
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.130
Let me give two famous and notorious examples.
Uh,

208
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.390
first an early one,
it's straws.

209
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:48.530
Borg in the 14th century were rumor had it,

210
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.900
you'll remember in the 14th century,

211
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.040
the Jews were cast out of the Iberian peninsula.

212
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.710
And the,
uh,

213
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.800
panic fear was that they were carrying out a plot as vengeance to destroy

214
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:09.500
Christian Europe by poisoning the wells of Christendom.

215
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.790
So crowds at straws,

216
00:16:11.791 --> 00:16:16.791
Borg rounded up 8,000 Jews took them to the Jewish cemetery and burn them alive.

217
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.240
Or let me tell you another example from Milan and 1630 and not really a more

218
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:28.730
cheerful one at all,

219
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.760
although on a smaller scale and it's told in one of the two actually of the

220
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.860
great works by the inventor of the Italian novel and one of the Great European

221
00:16:42.561 --> 00:16:46.670
novelists of the 19th century,
Alessandro Manzoni,

222
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.020
the novel is called the patrol.

223
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.960
And he also wrote a historical work called the column of Infamy.

224
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.330
That is to say Milan.

225
00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:01.390
And here's a picture of the event I want to tell you about as described by

226
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:04.610
Manzoni acting as a historian.

227
00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.700
The city of Milan in 1630 was at war with Spain and to their misfortune for

228
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:17.261
hapless Spaniards were found in the city just as plague was breaking out and

229
00:17:20.061 --> 00:17:25.061
they were accused of starting it by spreading poisonous ointment on the doors of

230
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:31.130
the houses of the city under torture.

231
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.220
They confessed to the crime and were convicted of high treason and then sentence

232
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
to have their hands cut off to be broken on the wheel and then burned on this at

233
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:44.294
the stake.

234
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.260
So at the site of their execution and hence the term we have this,

235
00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:55.440
which is the column of infamy.
You can see the uh,

236
00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.240
prisoners being brought and you can see there being broken on the wheel and all

237
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:03.180
the rest of it in the picture.

238
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.540
And you can also see that there was erected here,

239
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:12.620
the chief criminal Jacob Maury mortar and uh,

240
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:19.250
on the site in Milan after the plague apply was posted.

241
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.620
The column was meant to deter anyone else from ever doing something so

242
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.970
diabolical.

243
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.240
And this plaque was placed in Latin saying what had happened and what the

244
00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:38.211
punishment had been and warning people to commemorate this event that no house

245
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.140
should ever be built on this site.
So this was,

246
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.290
and this is the inscription on the plot.

247
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.870
So those were reactions.

248
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.500
Another reaction was one of mass repentance to Preetish propitiate an angry

249
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:04.200
divinity.
And to do that,
how did you go about it?

250
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.590
One way was by outdoor per sessions,

251
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.960
confessing your sins,

252
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:15.080
repenting and urging your neighbors and everyone else you encountered to do the

253
00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:19.440
same.
There were religious revivals.

254
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.630
The play gears were marked in particular by a new cult of saints,

255
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:30.110
the ones held to be most willing to intercede on behalf of humanity and to

256
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:35.370
divert the divine anger.
There was a great cult of the Virgin Mary.

257
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.820
There was a cult of St Christopher,

258
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.120
but in particular have two new saints who had an extraordinary vogue during the

259
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.410
plague year.

260
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.410
The first was Saint Sebastian and the other was on that ACO or saint rock.

261
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.520
Let me,
uh,
here is Saint Sebastian.

262
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.760
And if you look,
think of the iconography,

263
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:04.790
you'll remember that when we talked in the first lecture about homer,

264
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:10.430
we saw the Depaulo took hours to shoot the plague to destroy the Greeks.

265
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.880
And so there has been a constant idea symbolically of arrows as symbols of the

266
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:19.440
plague.

267
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.440
And Saint Sebastian is someone who was willing to give his life to save his

268
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:30.480
fellows by absorbing the arrows into his own flesh.

269
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.910
He was martyred by the arrows,

270
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
and this was sad to be his way of defending humanity.

271
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:38.680
So he,

272
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.680
there was a great vogue in this era of Saint Sebastian who was invoked to help

273
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:49.510
human beings to avoid the plague.
Another was Sung Rocco.

274
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.820
Now who is he?

275
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.850
He was an aristocrat from [inaudible] and according to legend,

276
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.190
he gave his riches away to the poor and set off on a pilgrimage to Italy where

277
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:06.640
he had the great misfortune of arriving.
And you know,

278
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:11.641
it was a misfortune and 1348 at the onset of the black death,

279
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.960
he however,
fell ill but survived.

280
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.620
And then he stayed to tend to the hill only eventually to return to France where

281
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:29.491
he faced arrest and finally died in prison like Saint Sebastian.

282
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:35.380
He was a man who was held to be willing to sacrifice his body,

283
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:39.910
his wealth and his life to save the people of God.

284
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.370
So images of these saints,

285
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:47.110
and we'll look at this next time when we look at the artistic representations,

286
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.290
the legacy of bluebonnet plague on the arts.

287
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.440
Images of these saints in particular proliferated in this period at the

288
00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:01.330
entrances to houses and people's bedrooms and public squares as a protection

289
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.480
against the plague.

290
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:09.190
And there was a vogue in these saints names that parents gave their children.

291
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.590
Another way to propitiate I said per sessions,

292
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.440
one of the most mysterious movements of the plague,

293
00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:23.441
years in the early time of the third pandemic was a mass movement known as the

294
00:22:25.631 --> 00:22:26.710
flatulence.

295
00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.460
Here the adherence vowed to devote themselves for a month to mass pilgrimage and

296
00:22:34.721 --> 00:22:39.310
repentance.
They carried the cross,
they prayed,

297
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:44.340
they listen to preachers and they underwent public whipping and indeed self

298
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:48.850
flagellation in order to satisfy God's anger.

299
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.860
And when you come to look at the film by Ingmar Bergman,

300
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:58.750
the seventh seal,
one of the depictions in not one of them,
uh,

301
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.670
scenes that will be most interesting to you is uh,

302
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:08.730
the capturing on film a of this procession of the flatulence.

303
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.960
You see them praying,
uh,

304
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.730
and beating themselves and each other with whips.

305
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.140
We,

306
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:22.140
we'll see next time too that this affected the iconography of European art from

307
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:25.420
the 14th century through the 17th.

308
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:31.350
There is a theme we'll see next time of the dance of death,

309
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:36.790
the so called Dos Macabre,
uh,

310
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:41.290
of people being rounded up by the grim reaper.

311
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.980
There are also what are called Vanitas symbols,

312
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:51.100
which are symbols in art of how life is very insecure that it's brief and can,

313
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:57.200
it can end very predict unpredictably.
Now,

314
00:23:57.201 --> 00:24:01.160
these weren't a school of painting or an artistic style.

315
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.480
They work the iconography,
they were themes that painters depicted.

316
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:11.170
And it may also be that portraying the disease in this way was it kind of

317
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:14.600
exorcism of the mysterious scourge.

318
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.120
And this was a powerful reminder of the transients of all things.

319
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.720
There were also popular superstitions in these days from astrology.

320
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:30.050
There was the belief that certain metals or precious stones,

321
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:35.350
rubies and diamonds had protective properties against the plague as did certain

322
00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:37.730
magical numbers.

323
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.560
And it won't surprise you that one of the great numbers that you could conjure

324
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:46.790
with was the number four,
you know,
the drill four elements,

325
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:51.770
four temperaments,
um,
four evangelists,
um,

326
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.720
four humors,
four winds,
four seasons and so on.

327
00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.590
So the number four was very powerful and protective.

328
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.190
Another aspect of plague,
of course,

329
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.730
was that there were people who profited from it,
profiteering,

330
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.730
the great cities and grip of plague.

331
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.840
We're lens of opportunity for rogues of every sort.

332
00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.320
So the epidemics of disease broaden their train outbreaks of crime and swindling

333
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.760
thieves plundered the homes of those who had fled.

334
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.790
Remember those who had fled where usually the wealthy and charlatans pedaled,

335
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:35.990
every variety of magical men are remedies,

336
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.010
wall astrologers sold comfort and advice.

337
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.450
Healers charged astounding sums for practicing.

338
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.130
They're dangerous arts.

339
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.380
Those were forms of spontaneous reaction to play.

340
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.840
What I'd like to do next is to talk instead about something very different that

341
00:25:56.841 --> 00:26:01.520
I promised,
which is organized response by authorities.

342
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:06.760
And this is the first form of organized public health that eventually leads by

343
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:13.841
the late 17th and AOD 18th centuries to the first victory of human beings over a

344
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:17.330
major infectious disease.

345
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.550
So let's look at what those public health measures were.

346
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.481
Well,

347
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:28.481
empirical observation and time of plague gave rise not only to spontaneous

348
00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:32.060
reactions that we've described,

349
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:37.210
but also to a new idea that began to spread alongside medical orthodoxy and new

350
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:41.240
idea,

351
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.240
the idea of contagion that somehow the plague spread in an unspecified manner

352
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:50.280
from person to person.

353
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:56.060
This idea was largely rejected for centuries by learned official medicine,

354
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.800
which clung to the older idea of my asthma,

355
00:27:00.801 --> 00:27:03.570
autism of Galen and his system.

356
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:09.380
But it became an important idea in popular culture and in the thinking of

357
00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:12.180
certain medical heretics.

358
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.690
It was fully developed by Flocka Storto and we've mentioned before of Padua in

359
00:27:19.111 --> 00:27:21.780
Italy in the 16th century,

360
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:27.650
but also by the German Jesuit Kitcher in the 17th century.

361
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.160
The theory was that of his so called contagion viva them,

362
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:37.340
which consisted of animal qls of some sort of public policy,

363
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:44.270
was to deal with flag was first devised in the northern Italian city states in

364
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.440
the 14th and 15th centuries,

365
00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:54.000
places like Florence,
Venice,
Milan,
and genuine,

366
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.950
and then were adopted elsewhere and France and Spain and northern Europe.

367
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.310
What was involved,
as I say,
was momentous,

368
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.920
the world's first system of public health,

369
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.810
and it turned out to be an organizational idea of genius.

370
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:15.500
The embryo of the system was established during the black death and then became

371
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:21.470
increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive through the middle of the 16th and

372
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:24.360
17th and then the 18th centuries.

373
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.860
But the Achilles' heel early on was that the system was narrowly municipal or

374
00:28:32.611 --> 00:28:34.290
local and scope.

375
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.040
A quantum leap was made that turn to make it more effective.

376
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:45.170
And the 17th and 18th centuries when the idea was taken up by early modern

377
00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:50.160
states that devoted the military power of the state to the effort,

378
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:56.030
you'll note the operation of magistrates in their power in London as you're

379
00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:58.680
reading defoe in the 17th century.

380
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.700
So the early vision combined by this time with the necessary power over a

381
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:10.470
sufficiently large area to make success possible.
Now,

382
00:29:10.471 --> 00:29:13.710
an interesting aspect of the situation is this.

383
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.050
The authorities took action,

384
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.840
although there was no medical understanding of war,

385
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.850
at least nothing that we would regard with Rhett retrospectively as an

386
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:30.210
efficacious understanding of the disease they were facing.

387
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:35.720
They acted more or less in the dark and in the process took measures that were

388
00:29:36.061 --> 00:29:41.061
sometimes extreme and heavy handed that often wasted resources.

389
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:46.210
And we're sometimes actually counter productive.
But in the end,

390
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:51.330
the path they pioneered led to the first victory over a major human disease.

391
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.110
So let's look at the policies.
What were they?

392
00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.720
First of all was a new institution originally.
That is,

393
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:04.980
they were called health magistrates.
Um,

394
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:10.320
we now know them as boards of health and these magistrates or boards of health

395
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.250
as they came to be known later and are still known.

396
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:20.310
We're endowed with extraordinary powers during emergencies that gave them,

397
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.610
they combined in their hands a plentitude of legislative,

398
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:29.611
judicial and executive authority and matters that related to public health.

399
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.560
By the late 16th century cities in the Van Guard of the movement even had

400
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:36.490
permanent health,

401
00:30:36.491 --> 00:30:41.491
magistrates and their example was followed across Europe.

402
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.800
That was one thing,
a new authority.

403
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:49.801
Then a second plague measure was compulsory burial.

404
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:56.940
And there were so many dead and a major epidemic that you wanted to dispose of

405
00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:02.650
them quickly before they poisoned the atmosphere and you couldn't bury them

406
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:07.540
individually.
And so they were cast into common pits,
plague pits,

407
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.450
and this was followed by the destruction,

408
00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:15.451
by fire of their personal effects and the banning of funerals and funeral

409
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:20.500
processions abandoning of the laying out and the wake.

410
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.820
And the problem of burial was an important issue.

411
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:29.910
And every outbreak of plague priests and grave diggers were decimated and there

412
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:36.301
weren't enough people left then to dispose of the dead in normal ways and it

413
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:43.510
must be remembered that this generated terror in itself,

414
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:48.990
the presence of large numbers of unmarried cadavers and as city or the indignity

415
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.170
of disposal of hurling,

416
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:59.220
newly dead people into improvised pits heightened the horror of the disease.

417
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:06.510
Another feature of the plague measures was the control of movement,

418
00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.120
the control of the movement of people from plague infested regions by quarantine

419
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.480
and squads of soldiers turning people away from city gates and opening fire on

420
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:22.480
those who tried to cross the line.

421
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:29.010
Another feature of the to these times was the isolation of the infected in pest

422
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:35.851
houses known across Europe as lots ciretos or alternatively,

423
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:42.570
as you know from people were simply shut up together with their families in

424
00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:48.671
their own homes and forbidden to open the door while guards enforced the rule

425
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.730
and being were stationed outside.

426
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.540
Most fearful of all was a measure called general quarantine in which everyone,

427
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:04.630
an infected infected neighborhood was sealed inside his or her home for 40 days

428
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.790
with watchman outside to arrest or even kill those who tried to escape.

429
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:19.100
Let me show you a slide.
Um,
well this is actually not the one I had in mind.

430
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:24.250
This is Marsay and I'm 1720 to 22 during the time of the flag.

431
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.910
And if you look carefully,
you could see,
um,

432
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.140
many of the events that we've been describing taking place in the foreground.

433
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.370
But instead of that,

434
00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.750
I'd rather concentrate on this because this has to do with your reading and

435
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:39.950
Daniel Defoe.

436
00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:45.010
This is London in 1656 that you now know and love and you can see here the bond

437
00:33:46.021 --> 00:33:49.220
fires and attempt to purify the air.

438
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:54.370
You can see these are watchman stationed outside to prevent people leaving.

439
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:59.450
There has houses and you can see the homes that have shut up and sealed with

440
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:01.490
people inside are marked.

441
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.540
But these are the homes of plague victims.

442
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.160
So those were important,
those regulations.

443
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.990
Then there were lots of rest to us.
The pest houses,

444
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.350
and these shouldn't be confused with modern hospitals.

445
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.570
There weren't places if cure,

446
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:25.600
but rather barrack like places of horror and death were inmates died on mass

447
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.920
where people were locked up,
not so much to be cured,

448
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.980
but to spare the city of the danger of inhaling deadly vapors from their

449
00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:37.430
contaminated.

450
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:42.430
Bonnie's the pest house was really the anti chamber to eternity.

451
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.880
And the word lots of recto comes from the biblical reference to Lazarus who was

452
00:34:50.001 --> 00:34:53.120
raised from the dead.
In any case,

453
00:34:53.121 --> 00:34:57.110
let me show you a slide of a lots of recto.

454
00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:02.290
This is a picture from the 19th century by Goodall of Napoleon in the pest house

455
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:08.470
of Jaffa.
And this is,
um,

456
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.400
a picture by 10 to her death to all of whom will see much more next time.

457
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.230
This is Sun Ra called member.

458
00:35:15.231 --> 00:35:18.890
I promised you Sung Rocco who stayed behind,
uh,

459
00:35:18.891 --> 00:35:23.891
who visited Italy and time of plague and fell ill himself,

460
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.950
uh,
revived and stayed behind to 10,

461
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:32.460
the dead or dying.
And here we see him in the lots of Modesto,

462
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:36.380
which is pretty much a place of dread and horror.

463
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:41.890
And people were conveyed there and this was important to buy carters and the

464
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:45.480
carters also inspired fear.

465
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:50.960
People were forcibly gathered up and her old into their mournful heaving

466
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:56.991
conveyances and these were dreaded almost as much as the ds themselves.

467
00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:03.650
This fear often was due to the fact that these petty officials risk their lives

468
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:07.260
and an as an investment through extortion,

469
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.270
healthy men and women could be threatened.
The ill could be blocked,

470
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:16.260
mailed so they could be left to die at peace in their homes.

471
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:21.530
Burglars could be sold information on empty houses and often they were drunk as

472
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:26.190
they consume spirits to fortify their courage.

473
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.420
Another part of the plague and regulations was the control of markets and

474
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:37.611
provisions to guarantee the supply of food to an afflicted locality so that

475
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:42.510
people wouldn't die of famine as well as disease.

476
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:48.950
The health magistrates or boards of health had also the power to close brothels

477
00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.980
and arrest prostitutes.
As I've said,

478
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:58.040
they often attempted to purify the corrupted atmosphere with bonfires and with

479
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:02.220
sulfur and gunpowder well taken together.

480
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:07.340
All of these plague measures were a draconian and when first applied they

481
00:37:08.451 --> 00:37:11.520
probably increased fear and chaos,

482
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:17.090
promoted flight by people desperate not to be locked in a dying city or Carter

483
00:37:17.561 --> 00:37:19.290
to way to [inaudible] house.

484
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.180
And this may have assisted the spread of plague itself.

485
00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:30.080
Anti plague regulations were causes of suffering and they often met in various

486
00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:35.991
parts of Europe with fierce opposition and cause civil disturbance and social

487
00:37:36.451 --> 00:37:37.410
tensions.

488
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.000
They involve the infinite horror of the pest house,

489
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:47.280
the separation of family members,
the burning of precious possessions,

490
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:52.110
the Prohibition of Processions and gatherings,
the Prohibition of movement,

491
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.070
the closing of markets,
the denial,
a funeral observances.

492
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.360
So from Moscow to London,
all across Europe,

493
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:05.310
the passage of plague was marked by demographic disaster,

494
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:10.920
by social tensions and economic disruption.

495
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.880
Great cities took on the appearance of ghost towns and these scenes were

496
00:38:17.831 --> 00:38:22.831
repeated for centuries after 1347 without breaks here and there,

497
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:29.630
every generation and great European wide pandemics several times a century.

498
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:32.941
As you know,

499
00:38:32.941 --> 00:38:37.941
the normal pattern was that the plague lay waste to a locality for months and

500
00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:44.071
then the disease Abdin faded away as mysteriously as it began.

501
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:50.340
And this true left a legacy for the fee for the final departure of the plague

502
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:57.330
was a sign that God had been appeased and was a testimony to the wisdom of their

503
00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:03.211
repentance and perhaps to their decision to hunt out the guilty.

504
00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:04.330
And there Mitch,

505
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:10.170
and let me remind you that this still is mark in the landscape of urban Europe.

506
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.880
And I'd like to show you an example and this will be the castells Sant Angelo

507
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:19.624
right here,

508
00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:24.660
one of the most common tourists sites out in sites of memory and modern rum

509
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:31.030
today.
That's a general view.
Let's close in a little more closely.

510
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:36.490
And uh,
here we can see as we're approaching the Costal Sant Angelo,
um,

511
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.200
I want you to see,
so I'll have a next picture.
We'll,

512
00:39:40.201 --> 00:39:41.920
we'll look at the tall,

513
00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:47.070
and this is one of the major landmarks in a major European city today.

514
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:49.091
And what is it?

515
00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:54.091
It's due to play tag at the top of the castells Sant Angelo is the arch Angel

516
00:39:56.170 --> 00:40:00.430
Gabriel and what he's doing is she thing his sword.

517
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:02.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

518
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.440
<v 0>As a sign,</v>

519
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:08.700
the divine wrath had been appeased that God had relented and let the scourge of

520
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:14.830
the population of Rome was no more.

521
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:16.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

522
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.230
<v 0>For a modern epidemiologist,</v>

523
00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:21.910
this thinking might be quite different,

524
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.550
but a vital link in the great chain of infection had been broken in the chain of

525
00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:28.450
transmission,

526
00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:33.640
perhaps that the infected population of black routes had been destroyed,

527
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.250
that all of the susceptible members of the human population had already
perished.

528
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:44.390
That the new onset of winter and cold weather had reduced the activity of fleas.

529
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.180
But in any case,

530
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:51.240
the point I want to make was that eventually the plague measures and regulations

531
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.360
were or at least seemed to be effective.

532
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

533
00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:01.770
<v 0>Especially after the 17th century with the increased military power of an early</v>

534
00:41:02.741 --> 00:41:07.741
modern state that deployed standing armies and naval forces to apply the policy

535
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.180
rigorously and over a substantial territory.

536
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

537
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:20.030
<v 0>Venice provided perhaps the first important example that was soon imitated in</v>

538
00:41:22.141 --> 00:41:27.141
country after country until western Europe was medically isolated by quarantines

539
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.070
lots,
Sorentos and sanitary coordinates.

540
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.160
Let me talk a little more in detail about the Venetian idea of public health.

541
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.610
It was not in Venice was a great port as you know,

542
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:45.730
that the ports of Europe could be protected by isolation from an invasion by

543
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:50.690
sea.
To achieve this objective,

544
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.720
the authorities constructed a great fortress on the outline islands to which all

545
00:41:56.871 --> 00:42:01.871
arriving ships from the eastern Mediterranean or directed there.

546
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:07.061
There were impounded for six weeks while they were scrubbed and fumigated.

547
00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:13.330
Crews and passengers were disembarked at these fortresses and quarantine for 40

548
00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:18.470
days on the cargo and passengers.

549
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:22.490
Personal effects were unloaded,
turned in the sun,

550
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.140
fumigated in air,

551
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:29.230
and only at the end of 40 days we're good to ship and passengers released to

552
00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:31.550
enter the city.
It will.

553
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:37.360
The theory was that by strict quarantine and he pestilential vapors would be

554
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:43.010
given time to disperse and so the city might be spared.
Well,

555
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:46.250
let's look at a couple of lots of ref toes.

556
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:49.130
This is a port call of less spate Sia.

557
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:53.810
And the point I'm trying to make as if these were very complicated,
uh,

558
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.640
and authoritarian institutions,
their fortresses no less.

559
00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.180
This is,
um,
uh,
at Naples,

560
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.190
the island of Neesy Duh.
Or at Marsay.
This is the,

561
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:12.250
uh,
great,
lots of recto on Faroe Island.
Well,

562
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:16.520
Sis was simple.
In principle it was a maritime quarantine,

563
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:21.290
but to be effective,
it presuppose state power.
Uh,

564
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:26.350
lots of retro was a fortress for thousands of passengers and crew had to be

565
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.130
policed,

566
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:33.160
provision an isolated from all contacts with the city required the strong naval

567
00:43:34.491 --> 00:43:36.620
presence to,
to compel,

568
00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:41.621
unwilling and possibly terrified sea captains to anchor within these waters and

569
00:43:43.491 --> 00:43:48.491
to prevent attempts at evasion or escape within the lot Sorento,

570
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:54.410
there were detailed,
complex regulations to ensure that hundreds,

571
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.440
sometimes thousands of passengers in different stages of quarantine would be

572
00:43:59.931 --> 00:44:03.980
isolated,
not only from the city,
but also from each other,

573
00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:09.350
and that the items of the ship's crew would all be properly fumigated and

574
00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:10.910
exposed to the sun.

575
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:16.810
The idea of quarantine was an empirical result of long experience and its

576
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.840
establishment to be successful.

577
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.960
Presupposed the bureaucratic navel and administrative resources of the early

578
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:31.040
modern state.
Well,
looking back with modern understanding,

579
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.760
you would probably conclude that the medical theory underlying the Venetian

580
00:44:35.761 --> 00:44:39.930
system of quarantine was flawed by modern standards.

581
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:45.020
There were no pestilential miasmas and many of the rituals of purification were

582
00:44:45.701 --> 00:44:46.740
to no effect.

583
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.520
But the idea of lengthy and military enforced isolation was highly effective in

584
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:55.320
practice,

585
00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.860
40 days exceeded the incubation period of the disease and so were sufficient to

586
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:08.310
guarantee that a person then released was medically harmless.

587
00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:10.140
At the same time,

588
00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:15.030
the period of quarantine was long enough to ensure the death of inflected fees,

589
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.880
fleas,
and of the bacterium itself.

590
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:23.340
So an inaccurate theory produce sound administrative procedures.

591
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.520
The Venetian lots rhetto backed by the Venetian fleet demonstrated that it could

592
00:45:29.461 --> 00:45:34.461
in practice protect the city from disaster and within a generation other than

593
00:45:35.631 --> 00:45:39.760
Mediterranean powers,
imitated the experiment building lots.

594
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:44.400
Ciretos Naples,
Genoa,
Valencia,
Marsay,
Corfu,

595
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.980
and all ships from the east.

596
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:51.060
We're compelled to dock them by the end of the 17th century,

597
00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.310
the port cities of Europe,

598
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:58.340
we're no longer some menaced by see the disease continued to be imported,

599
00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:04.340
but what's contained with just two major failures in 1720 bubonic plague spread

600
00:46:05.971 --> 00:46:10.971
from the lots of red toto to the city of Marsay killing 60,000 people.

601
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:16.310
And then in 1743 the last burst of epidemic plague in Europe at Messina and

602
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:21.660
Sicily.
Meanwhile,

603
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:26.690
there was the overland threat and this was seen to by the hops Berg Empire,

604
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.460
which dis do in the course of the 18th century,

605
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:37.880
initiated in perfected a great permanent cordon sanitaire of soldiers stretching

606
00:46:39.211 --> 00:46:41.670
across the length of the Balkan peninsula.

607
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.480
The Austrian Coordin was 10 to 20 miles wide during threat of plague and 1200

608
00:46:49.591 --> 00:46:50.910
miles long.

609
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:56.090
It consisted of a great permanent line of soldiers and century posts station to

610
00:46:56.911 --> 00:46:58.710
present people from passing.

611
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:04.070
So one of the great armies of Europe assume the task of isolating western Europe

612
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.040
from the East Justice,

613
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:13.070
the Matsuura Ciretos and a buy in the ports isolated it by sea,

614
00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:19.860
thousands of soldiers,
12,000 during time of epidemics.

615
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:21.600
We're stationed to do that.

616
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.550
And it was the case then by the 18th century,
bubonic plague,

617
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:31.580
the scourge of five centuries was entirely eliminated and didn't return to

618
00:47:32.801 --> 00:47:35.770
western Europe.
Let me look.
Uh,

619
00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:39.400
this was a slide of a,
it could be anywhere.

620
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:44.200
It happens to be the city of Bari and you can see the cordon of soldiers

621
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:48.760
surrounding the city and protecting it from bubonic plague.

622
00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.960
And it might be sad as well that occasionally the pope reinforce the physical

623
00:47:55.571 --> 00:48:00.571
sanitary coordin with a spiritual one that is threatening anyone who crossed the

624
00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:04.690
line with communication.
Well,

625
00:48:04.691 --> 00:48:09.310
this was the world's first victory and the conquest of disease,

626
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:14.790
the greatest epidemic disease in European history had been eliminated not by the

627
00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:18.370
advents of medicine or scientific knowledge,

628
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:23.550
but by the deployment of the military and bureaucratic power of the state or

629
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:25.000
certainly.

630
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
So it seem though we might wonder if other perhaps imponderable factors or also

631
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:36.420
at work,
the replacement of our friend the block route,
um,

632
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:41.520
whom you now know and love that was very sociable and like to live close to

633
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:46.831
human beings by the brown route that was shy and retiring and kept its distance

634
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:53.580
or there were improved standards of sanitation and hygiene or people talk about

635
00:48:55.361 --> 00:48:56.200
the impact.

636
00:48:56.201 --> 00:49:01.201
Perhaps it was climatic change that was decisive and people point to the little

637
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.860
ice age which began in the 16th century and reached Minima of temperatures,

638
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:09.071
uh,

639
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:14.071
about 1650 and again in the 17th seventies and then gave way to warming in the

640
00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:16.990
19th century.

641
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.520
And we see this in works of art in Dutch painting.

642
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:26.550
The 17th century gave rise to great vogue of winter scenes that you don't really

643
00:49:27.311 --> 00:49:32.311
see in the modern Netherlands when the canals froze in the 17th century and

644
00:49:33.131 --> 00:49:35.140
people were able to skate on them.

645
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.610
And there weren't many other examples of winter scenes of painting.

646
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:43.390
This was how cold it was in the 17th century.
Indeed,

647
00:49:43.391 --> 00:49:47.920
it's swept all of Europe.
The River Thames froze in London.

648
00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:53.110
The balls took,
froze that one could travel by sled from Poland to Sweden,

649
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:58.840
and these weren't good conditions for your [inaudible] and the fleas that were

650
00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:02.170
inspectors.
But we've run out of time,

651
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.960
but at least we've contained the plague.

652
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:10.350
And next time we'll look at its impact on European culture and thought.
