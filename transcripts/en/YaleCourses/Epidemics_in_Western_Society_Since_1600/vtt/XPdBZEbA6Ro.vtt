1
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.390
Oh,
well,
good morning.
We'll uh,
we'll get started.
And as you know,

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.230
this isn't,
there isn't going to be a lecture this morning at all.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.440
We're going instead to have a review session in which I'll be very much

4
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:21.000
dependent on your having questions and are having a joint discussion.

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
So what I'm expecting to be able to do is to,

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.340
when you have questions or want to contribute to,

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.860
I've got some questions as well.
Um,

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.400
we can put our heads together and there'll be a microphone.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.430
I hope that we can pass around and there everyone will be audible.

10
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.950
So the first thing I should say is just to talk just for a minute about the exam

11
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:51.231
itself because I've now written it so at least we can say on that much,

12
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:56.850
I'm the world's authority.
So the exam will look like this.

13
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:58.830
There will be two parts.

14
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.190
The first part will be the ID section and that will have,

15
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.640
uh,
let's see,

16
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:10.641
you've got the list of identifications and I've literally just chosen 10 of

17
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:12.324
them.

18
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.480
And that will constitute two points each or a total of 20 points for the ID

19
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:21.630
section.

20
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.630
And so you can work out how to budget your time and not regard clearly.

21
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.310
You're not meant to write an essay,

22
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.430
just even bullet points or short paragraph is all that it's expected.

23
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.320
With regard to the identifications.

24
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.680
The second part of the exam consists of three essays and I'm at that is three on

25
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:50.211
the list of three and I'll ask you to write on two of them and each of the

26
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.180
essays.
Therefore we'll count 40 points.

27
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.010
So section part two of the exam,
we'll count 80 points altogether.

28
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.100
So that tells you how you should budget your time.

29
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.110
The essay questions are much more important than the identifications.

30
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.220
Um,
so that's really the structure of the exam.

31
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:15.800
I can't think really of anything else that I can say about that.
Uh,

32
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.040
but let me see if anyone before we turn to substantive issues.

33
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.190
Does anyone have any questions about the format of the exam or what's likely to

34
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:28.800
be on it?
I can repeat what I've said before.

35
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.980
The exam period itself is notionally three hours though.

36
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:39.660
You also get an additional half hour as a grace period.
Dot.

37
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.760
I understand is the elk system.
And Will um,
uh,
adhere to that.

38
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.810
The exam will also,
I wanted to stress this.

39
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.990
It will cover the whole of the course from the beginning and it won't simply be

40
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.250
on the last part of the course since the mid,
the mid term.

41
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.370
It will cover everything that we've dealt with since January down to g today.

42
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.190
So are there any questions before we turn to the substance about the format of

43
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.440
the exam or what you could expect or not expect or anything of that nature?

44
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.440
<v 0>Do we need to bring in any of their meetings on the [inaudible] section?</v>

46
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.550
The question was do you need to bring in readings on the ID section?

47
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.170
The uh,
I think that depends entirely on which id you deal with.

48
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.320
Some of the ideas are directly based on the reading that you've done.

49
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.710
You've done.
So for example,
if I asked,
um,

50
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.770
Daniel Defoe to identify,

51
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.540
it would be really odd if you didn't bring in the Journal of the play gears and

52
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.180
why it was important.
Um,
okay.

53
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.970
But if I asked you about,

54
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.440
say the Paris School of medicine that you didn't actually have readings on,

55
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.240
then it wouldn't be necessary.

56
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.420
So it really depends on the nature of the particular id in question.

57
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.203
<v 1>Okay.</v>

58
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.800
<v 0>Um,
anything else about the exam?</v>

59
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.480
Okay,
thanks.

60
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.720
Then let's move on to the substantive part of the review and,

61
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.360
uh,
the issues that we've been dealing with in the course.

62
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.600
And I thought one way we might start would be for me to ask you a question,

63
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.630
which is,
uh,

64
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.660
what do you think I should as sensibly ask you about on the final,

65
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.710
uh,

66
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.710
what would make good final exam questions for you based on the material that

67
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:48.814
you've covered.

68
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.300
<v 0>And then we could put our heads together a little bit to think about what might</v>

70
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:58.530
be some elements are the answers that you provide in them.

71
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.910
Does anyone have a question that I want to ask you?

72
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.930
It's never too late.
I could change the questions I,
I wrote yesterday.

73
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.333
<v 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.630
<v 0>You think I should ask you nothing.</v>

75
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.300
It's always a possibility too.

76
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.500
Um,
okay.
Well,
I've got some thoughts,
um,
if you like,
uh,

77
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:35.420
for things that we might want to deal with.
Uh,
one was,
uh,

78
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.110
this,

79
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.610
and I'm going to ask and see if any of you would like to help me think through

80
00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:44.600
this particular issue.
If we're dealing with,
uh,

81
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:49.601
the impact of a major epidemic diseases on society,

82
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.850
what would be,

83
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.880
is it true to think that it's really the overall mortality that provides the

84
00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:03.881
major way in which we can assess whether this was an important event or it

85
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:04.910
wasn't?

86
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.910
It's not how we judge the significance of the passage of an epidemic disease

87
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.980
through society.
Do we,
uh,
is the body count,

88
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.330
in other words,
the most important factor,
or is it something else?

89
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.313
How do we,

90
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.320
what factors determine whether an epidemic disease really is a significant

91
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.990
historical event or it isn't?
Oh,

92
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.190
do you have any thoughts on that particular,
yeah.
Issue.

93
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.440
That's why.
Yes,
please.
Thank you.

94
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.660
Okay.
Thanks very much.
Did everyone get,
could you everyone here?
Uh,
the,

95
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.060
the counter that through an answer would be that it's not just the mortality,

96
00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:17.780
but we need to look at the morbidity.
And even more than that,

97
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.900
we need to look at the class or the profile of the victims of the epidemic and

98
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:29.201
then it makes a big difference whether the victims of the disease are the

99
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:32.660
elderly and perhaps infants.
In other words,

100
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.720
whether it seems like a normal event in the life of that society or whether it

101
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:44.090
targets instead a different patient population.

102
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.240
If it targets people in the prime of life,

103
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:49.760
it's experienced in a very different way.

104
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.910
So clearly the class profile is important and not just the,

105
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.120
um,
the mortality or even the morbidity.

106
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:00.740
Are there other factors?
Yeah.

107
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:04.720
<v 1>Mortality mattering.</v>

108
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:09.640
Is that like you didn't really have much of an impact on assigning anything?

109
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.290
We'd ask him why?
Because people are stupid.

110
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:15.220
They didn't have like a really big morbidity,
small mortality answer that like,

111
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.790
okay.

112
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.350
<v 0>Oh,
that's great.
Let me just see in fun.
I'm wondering if you could help me out</v>

113
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.110
then people will be,
everyone will be able to hear.
Okay.
Um,

114
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.730
see it works.
We're in luck.

115
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.480
Maybe you could start again.
I don't think everyone can hear you.
Your question.

116
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.043
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.150
<v 2>Um,
Oh God,
that's weird.
Um,</v>

118
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.710
one argument in favor of mortality mattering is that at flu,

119
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:47.090
which didn't really have that much,

120
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:50.390
if the lasting impact on society had a really,
um,

121
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.140
high morbidity but a really small mortality and everyone knew that and so they

122
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:55.710
want like panicked when it

123
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.053
<v 3>came.</v>

124
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.180
<v 0>Okay.</v>

125
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.180
So there's the idea then that we shouldn't retreat too much for mortality,

126
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.320
that it really does matter and I'm really happy that you did something very

127
00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:09.040
important,

128
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:14.040
which was not just to leave this matter hanging in the abstract but to talk it

129
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.340
to a particular example.

130
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.900
And so it's really important that you bring in particular diseases to clinch

131
00:09:22.901 --> 00:09:23.710
your argument.

132
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.710
So talking about influences exactly the way that the argument ought to go on

133
00:09:29.711 --> 00:09:34.660
weighing that versus other diseases that were different.
So,
so that's good.

134
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.140
Thank you.
Um,
right.
Someone else?
Oh,
there we go.

135
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.690
<v 3>Um,
at the same time,
I think that at the same time,</v>

136
00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:46.220
I think that what that really speaks to is more the reaction of society to

137
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:50.690
something so that it's important to say that it's not just a number that
matters,

138
00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:55.520
that mortality rate isn't so much the important part as much as how people were

139
00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:59.330
able to kind of incorporate that into their lives.
Because as we were saying,

140
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.780
blue wasn't necessarily the most striking example to people.

141
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.170
However,
I think that certain,

142
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:14.290
even even times like tuberculosis where you have people who are dying but in

143
00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:20.081
very much longer periods so you have more time for reactions and literature and

144
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:22.230
art.
Um,

145
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.780
and those have just as much of an impact and in fact it really lasting impact

146
00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:31.781
because we still have those pieces of epidemic art and literature to look back

147
00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:36.080
on to see how they had impact on society.

148
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.760
<v 0>Okay.
Thanks very much.</v>

149
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:43.680
So you want to complicate the matter even more.

150
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.840
It really depends on how it's perceived,
uh,

151
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.160
perceptions and also that's reflected in the arts and in literature.

152
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.300
And you're giving the example of tuberculosis and the time period.

153
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.420
And how are lasting the impact is so that tuberculosis has an,

154
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:08.210
a one of its reasons for having such an impact was that it was such a slow event

155
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.840
and was with society for so long and people reflected on that and it impacted

156
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:20.010
the arts and culture.
Um,
absolutely.
I think that would be,

157
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.740
so we've gotten now in order to deal with this,

158
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.870
we've dealt with influenza and tuberculosis as contrasting,

159
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.490
uh,
factors,

160
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.240
contract to diseases in very different ways.

161
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.040
And it's certainly true that also on the exam we will be dealing,

162
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:38.821
uh,
ask,

163
00:11:38.821 --> 00:11:43.821
I'll be asking you to be comparative in your discussion of diseases and to bring

164
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:48.580
in more than one disease in order to,
uh,

165
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.800
deal with major questions that cut across the whole of our,

166
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.120
okay.
Thanks.
Any,

167
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.380
anything else we want to put into our answer to this question?

168
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.170
Uh,
would it be good to deal with just to,
uh,

169
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:11.520
diseases and dealing with that,
with this be a,

170
00:12:11.521 --> 00:12:16.521
would you get an a plus for bringing in influenza and tuberculosis?

171
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.600
Uh,

172
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.600
what other diseases might be important in considering this question?

173
00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.670
Yes,
thanks.
Mike is arriving

174
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.810
this one.
There we go.
We're sorting it out.

175
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.430
<v 3>Okay.
Um,
you might consider cholera because,
um,
it was sort of the,</v>

176
00:12:47.431 --> 00:12:51.480
the opposite of tuberculosis and that it,
it had a very rapid onset.

177
00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:53.890
And so the specific surrounding,
uh,

178
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.020
the disease itself had an effect on how it was perceived as something

179
00:12:58.021 --> 00:13:01.050
frightening,
um,
and,
and something rose.

180
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.860
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
so you would throw cholera into the mix.</v>

181
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.220
And I think the reason you're say five understood.
You,

182
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.150
you're saying that this should take us into another whole realm,

183
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:18.270
which is to deal with the symptoms because there was something particularly

184
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:23.620
frightening and disgusting about Asiatic Cholera and not condition.

185
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:24.640
It's impact.

186
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.340
People were really terrified by its arrival because of the nature of its

187
00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:30.520
symptomatology.

188
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.930
So that's another dimension that we ought to consider.

189
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.320
It's not just morbidity,
not just mortality,

190
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.720
not just the profile of the victims,

191
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.490
but the kind of suffering that the disease imposes on its victims.

192
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.840
So the symptomatology is tremendously important.

193
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.520
Okay.
Anything else on that question?

194
00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.530
Where are our grade is going up all the time?
Uh,
you know,

195
00:14:00.531 --> 00:14:03.920
several examples,
specific cases.
Um,

196
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:08.990
that's comparison.
That's all,
uh,
extremely important.
Uh,

197
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.890
anything else anyone wants to throw in on this question?

198
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.783
Uh,

199
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.150
so collectively we've got an a plus on,
on this.

200
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.900
Uh,
okay.
Well,
pat ourselves on the back and let's,
uh,

201
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.580
let's move on and see if there are other issues we might like to discuss.

202
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.860
Um,
what is it?
I'll,
let me see.
I'm wondering,

203
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.510
I mentioned,
uh,

204
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.400
something in passing and throughout a phrase,

205
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.061
uh,

206
00:14:44.061 --> 00:14:49.061
which was that we might want to consider some diseases in our course.

207
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.100
Uh,
diseases of modernity.
A,

208
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:55.700
I'm wondering if that's actually a useful concept.

209
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.790
It may be that I misspoke or,
uh,

210
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:03.820
is modernity in some senses of factor that promotes our vulnerability to high

211
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.840
impact epidemic diseases or at least certain ones among them?

212
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.370
Is that true or is that,
um,
you know,
is that wrong?

213
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.883
<v 4>Great.</v>

214
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.840
You really do.
Yeah,
I,
yeah,

215
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.060
I can hear you now.
All right.

216
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:43.090
I might put a finer edge on up for the class by asking them if any real progress

217
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.640
in social or medical response to epidemic disease as occurred over the time span

218
00:15:49.491 --> 00:15:50.324
of the course.

219
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:56.140
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
how were we?
In other words,
are we more vulnerable now?</v>

220
00:15:56.141 --> 00:16:01.141
We're much less vulnerable as a result of public health policies and

221
00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:05.890
understanding of infectious diseases since,
uh,
let's see,

222
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.120
poor Daniel Defoe,
uh,
lived through the bubonic plague.

223
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.620
That's sort of your question,
right?

224
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:12.510
<v 5>Precisely.</v>

225
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.850
It struck me that you're interrupting for say it struck me that your definition

226
00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:19.030
of a disease of maturity refers to structural factors,
right?
So for instance,

227
00:16:19.031 --> 00:16:22.050
the role of like mass transit technologies,

228
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.040
perhaps like urbanization in the betting,
the spread of disease.

229
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:27.550
Isn't that the sense of disease of modernity or,

230
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.180
<v 0>um,
I think you're right.
I'm a who knows what I meant when I said that,</v>

231
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.770
but it would seem to me if we were retrospectively to try to make sense of a

232
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:43.250
phrase like that.
We,
and this is important in all,
here's the general point.

233
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.830
For any answers that you give in an exam,

234
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.810
you would have to provide a definition of what it actually means.

235
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.860
A modern deeds,
a lovely phrase,
but it doesn't really,

236
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.890
it's meaning is not self evident and it was only your grade would rise very

237
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:05.630
significantly if you weren't just to talk about Moderna.

238
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.790
But you were actually to do what you just did,
but to say,
what does that mean?

239
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.600
And point to factors such as urbanization,

240
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.700
mass transit,
population growth,
um,

241
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.010
things like that that give it a meaning.
Um,

242
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.100
and possibly also the development of an understanding scientifically of the

243
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:33.101
biology and the medicine of the diseases and therefore public health policies

244
00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:35.750
and practices.

245
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.870
So that I think would be a much better way to approach this idea of whether it's

246
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:45.980
a disease of modernity or not.
And I'm just wondering,
what would you say,

247
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.390
are we less vulnerable now then?
Um,

248
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.170
London was at the time of defoe or,
um,

249
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.190
is it still the same or are we vulnerable but vulnerable to different kinds of

250
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:04.110
diseases are at least here in the,
in the West.
Okay,

251
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:08.160
great.
The microphones,
I'm arriving quick.
Ah,
okay.

252
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:09.870
We'll come to you immediately after.

253
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.650
<v 2>Um,</v>

254
00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:16.650
I would say that we're more vulnerable to the spread of disease and two

255
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.540
diseases,
uh,
that are a result of over sanitation,

256
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.260
but there were also more capable of dealing with them scientifically and

257
00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:27.160
technologically.

258
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.760
<v 0>Okay.
So it's um,</v>

259
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:34.920
neither at you're rejecting that opposition of being more or less vulnerable

260
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:41.070
were more vulnerable in certain ways and less vulnerable and others.

261
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.710
So perhaps we're not as susceptible to certain diseases in the same way,

262
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.670
but we're susceptible to other diseases in different ways.

263
00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:55.840
Maybe the mode of transmission is an important factor,

264
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.320
but you want it to say something too.
So let's come to you.

265
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:03.913
<v 1>MMM.</v>

266
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.580
<v 2>Is this working?
Yeah,
it's working.
Okay.
Um,
I also think that in a way though,</v>

267
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:12.390
we're sort of like shifting from one vaguely misconception of disease cause I

268
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:16.380
would hate to another because like in the earliest modes of disease prevention

269
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:16.771
where you know,

270
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:20.700
quarantine and I'm just like whatever they could kind of like sanitation like

271
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:21.534
with Chadwick.

272
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.680
But then we moved to this like magic bullet thing once we figured out that it

273
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:28.440
was the germ theory and like for a really long time and I think like it's still

274
00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:31.440
sort of process is this idea that we can hear something just by finding like a

275
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:34.440
magic drug and that isn't really how it works.

276
00:19:34.441 --> 00:19:36.150
And there are a lot of other factors.

277
00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:39.150
And even though like we sort of acknowledge that sometimes I don't think that

278
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:43.200
it's necessarily permeated our efforts to like to,

279
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.570
to cure a lot of different diseases.
Like with AIDS,

280
00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:48.540
you can kind of see that there's like efforts at education and things like that,

281
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:50.340
but as long as there's poverty,

282
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.960
there's going to be diseases that disproportionately affect the poor.

283
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.750
And I don't think that we're anywhere near solving that problem.

284
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.110
<v 0>Okay.
So,
uh,
I saw,
I understand that you're saying that,</v>

285
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.770
uh,

286
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:08.770
we have made advances and understanding and there are diseases for which there

287
00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:13.790
are public health measures that are effective and there are some times magic

288
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:17.360
bullets,
but we have become rather over,

289
00:20:17.361 --> 00:20:22.361
we overemphasize the importance of treatments and we underestimate the social

290
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.910
economic determinants of disease.
And so,
uh,

291
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.470
diseases thrive on certain social and economic conditions.

292
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.320
And you mentioned poverty for example.

293
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.110
And so until those underlying,
uh,

294
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:46.410
substrates of epidemic diseases are dealt with will always remain vulnerable.

295
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.340
Um,

296
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.340
so that would suggest maybe we should take that on for a second and is not a

297
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:58.210
valid conclusion from the course,

298
00:20:58.211 --> 00:21:01.720
from your readings and all the rest that diseases,

299
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.600
all diseases are diseases of poverty,

300
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.000
which seem to be something you were maybe suggesting or even if you weren't,

301
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.310
I'm suggesting it on your behalf,
uh,
is not,
uh,

302
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.400
a valid conclusion to draw that really the essential driver of epidemic

303
00:21:19.991 --> 00:21:21.880
disasters is poverty.

304
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

305
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.750
<v 0>All diseases are diseases of poverty.
Is that,
is that right?</v>

306
00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.653
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

307
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:35.940
<v 0>Right.
Great.
Thanks.</v>

308
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.050
<v 6>Okay.
Um,
I,</v>

309
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.990
I would disagree with that statement because,
okay.
Although I would too,

310
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.400
we see that in some cases notably cholera,

311
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:55.430
it did only strike the poor and the rich were pretty much unaffected by the

312
00:21:55.531 --> 00:21:59.460
disease.
In terms of uh,
health health wise,
um,

313
00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:03.750
there has been plenty of other diseases that really haven't shown any liking to

314
00:22:03.751 --> 00:22:05.850
any specific socioeconomic class.

315
00:22:05.851 --> 00:22:09.720
Like the flu just came in and since it was so easily spread from person to

316
00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:14.650
person,
um,
even if,
you know,
if you've,
you've,
you are walking into a store,
um,

317
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.640
run by someone of a lower class,
you could easily get that from them.

318
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.770
So I think most diseases,

319
00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:24.330
even though some did strike the poor to a greater extent,

320
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.660
you can't pacify them solely as being diseases of poverty where poverty might

321
00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:34.900
have,
um,
uh,
not embellished.
But poverty might have,

322
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:39.750
uh,
yeah,
the,
um,
it might've made it worse.
So,

323
00:22:39.751 --> 00:22:42.180
uh,
someone in poverty would probably be worse off,

324
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:44.010
do the influencer then Richard Person.

325
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.400
But I don't think it caused most of the diseases we've talked about.

326
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.280
<v 0>Okay.
So,
uh,
you,</v>

327
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:54.400
there is the theory then that it really depends on which disease and that it's a

328
00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.640
gross over simplification to say that poverty is the cause of epidemic disease.

329
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.370
It exacerbates the situation probably for all.

330
00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:12.550
But there are clearly certain diseases that are driven by other factors.

331
00:23:15.801 --> 00:23:18.350
And influenza was a case in point.

332
00:23:18.351 --> 00:23:23.240
There are certain diseases that really do seem to be a equal opportunity

333
00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:26.090
afflictions in that they,
uh,

334
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.520
seem to strike all wrong stuff.

335
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:35.530
Society rather than just certain economic and social classes and influencer was

336
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:40.130
a good respiratory diseases perhaps,
ah,

337
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.990
veer towards that pole.
But then I think you're saying that in any,

338
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:50.530
it's probably not fair also completely to eliminate poverty,

339
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:56.130
that that's a sort of spectrum and some diseases are more responsive to poverty

340
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.060
and others less,
but that even influenza,
perhaps if you're poor,

341
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.870
you don't have access to medical care,
to nursing,
to rev rec,
uh,

342
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.930
and to,
uh,
medications and so on.
And so it's more of a problem,

343
00:24:11.931 --> 00:24:16.520
but it's a universal problem nonetheless,
if I understood you right correctly.

344
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.200
Okay,
good.
Thank you.

345
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

346
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:24.300
<v 0>Um,
I think you'd be right.
Um,
and I think it would be good if the end,</v>

347
00:24:24.301 --> 00:24:26.760
the answer are,
uh,

348
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:31.820
let's say we give them more coherent answer if we gave a range of diseases and

349
00:24:33.421 --> 00:24:34.770
dealing with the answer.

350
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.760
So I'm at one end of the spectrum and others at the other,
right.

351
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.040
So influenza would be great,

352
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.480
but it would be a mistake just to put influence into the answer.

353
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.150
We'd want to give contrasting examples.

354
00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:52.200
So the answer then as many historical answers is,

355
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.800
has to be qualified in nuanced and just a sec,

356
00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:59.970
all diseases are diseases of poverty is probably quite wrong.

357
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.500
Okay.
There was a nother you were going to,

358
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.493
<v 1>oh,</v>

359
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.053
okay.

360
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.550
<v 0>Okay.
Well,
why don't I be a really,</v>

361
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:23.840
really nasty person and ask if you could help me out.

362
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.460
Um,
how would you rank them?
I enter

363
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.680
you've got lots of people to help you out.
You're not on your own.
Okay.

364
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:36.873
No.
Yeah,

365
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.293
<v 1>yeah.</v>

366
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.650
<v 0>Okay.
So a one end of the spectrum,</v>

367
00:25:45.651 --> 00:25:50.651
we put influenza and that would clearly be the least responsive to poverty as a

368
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:58.280
driver.
The other end of the spectrum,
you'd put Asiatic Cholera,

369
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.230
which is clearly very,
uh,

370
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.190
sensitive to social and economic factors to living conditions,

371
00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:11.060
to Dirk and filth,
to lack of light to overcrowding.

372
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.970
I hope you would then you see in your essay,
uh,

373
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:18.740
poverty to a needs is not self evident.
What it means.

374
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.780
Why is poverty of factor,
and I hope you would talk about,
um,
you know,

375
00:26:23.781 --> 00:26:27.890
filth,
uh,
access to medical care,
education,

376
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.330
overcrowding,
bad housing,
um,
sewage.
Um,

377
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.590
those are the things that the cholera thrives in on.
Um,

378
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.510
so you would be right that way,

379
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:43.511
putting influenza and cholera at opposite poles of the spectrum.

380
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:45.750
But once again,

381
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:50.810
we have to remember that this is not absolute because wealthy people also

382
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:53.970
succumbed to Asiatic cholera,

383
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.380
just in much smaller numbers.

384
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.500
Um,
okay.
Right.
Thanks.

385
00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.160
<v 6>Um,
I think I would put,
uh,</v>

386
00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:09.560
malaria and to a lesser extent the plague on the collar side of things in

387
00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:12.680
malaria because,
um,
they,

388
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.910
it was a big working condition disease and a lot of people who were in the lower

389
00:27:16.911 --> 00:27:20.240
classes worked in the rice fields were and worked in,
in,
uh,

390
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.780
in lived in areas that they couldn't have the simple protection against

391
00:27:23.781 --> 00:27:28.090
mosquitoes.
And I said plug to a lesser extent on the,

392
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.580
on the Colorado side,
because as we saw in journal,
oh,
play gear,

393
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.650
a lot of the richer people were able to leave London and a use financial means

394
00:27:36.651 --> 00:27:39.970
to get away from the disease.
And even though it spread,
um,

395
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.560
the poor people couldn't do that and they had to stay.

396
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:44.840
<v 0>Okay.
So we have,
um,</v>

397
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:49.990
a couple of other examples of diseases that might be a along the level of

398
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.700
poverty being driven by poverty and malaria was an example because of the

399
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:03.050
particularly labanear laboring and living conditions.

400
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.970
It's partly an occupational disease and so it strikes a peasants and people who

401
00:28:07.971 --> 00:28:12.971
work in conditions that make them vulnerable and it's a house disease that

402
00:28:12.981 --> 00:28:16.670
depends on overcrowding and living in housing.

403
00:28:16.671 --> 00:28:20.940
That's a porous to flying insects.
Uh,

404
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.880
so poverty clearly is important to the spread of malaria.

405
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.530
We've seen,
uh,
to some extent that plague has some,

406
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.900
it could be argued either way,

407
00:28:32.901 --> 00:28:36.500
but you're absolutely right to introduce plague as something,

408
00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:40.910
a case to be argued as to whether it is or isn't.
A,

409
00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:45.650
I'm wondering what about,
uh,
some other diseases transmitted differently?

410
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.780
You,
one factor might be then you might say it might depend partly on means of

411
00:28:50.781 --> 00:28:53.150
transmission of the disease,

412
00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.480
perhaps airborne diseases less driven by poverty ones.

413
00:28:58.900 --> 00:28:59.270
Dot.

414
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:04.160
That travel by the oral fecal route or by vectors might be important.

415
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.300
What about sexually transmitted diseases and it's syphilis,

416
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.620
a disease of poverty.
Um,
you wanted to,
uh,

417
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.920
<v 3>I would put aids and syphilis towards the flu end of things.
Okay.</v>

418
00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.573
<v 1>Although</v>

419
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:28.330
<v 3>by modern maps of where these diseases are highly</v>

420
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.630
prevalent,
it would seem otherwise,

421
00:29:32.631 --> 00:29:36.140
but I think that there is actually,
you know,
a sort of

422
00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.070
not poverty based for that.
So,

423
00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:47.030
<v 0>okay.
So,
uh,
we have a candidate then for,
uh,</v>

424
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.410
two other candidates to go at the influenza end of the spectrum,

425
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.200
syphilis and aids.
Um,

426
00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.970
I'm wondering if everyone would agree with that.
Yeah,
please.

427
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.650
Oh,
sorry.
You go ahead first.

428
00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:02.601
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

429
00:30:02.601 --> 00:30:07.601
I would put aids more towards the middle of this spectrum because aids did have

430
00:30:07.671 --> 00:30:10.010
a predilection for marginalized groups,

431
00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.450
but at the same time it could affect anyone,
including,
you know,
a,

432
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:17.450
a heterosexual man from a wealthy family.
Um,
so,

433
00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:21.170
so I think it sort of goes in the middle.
If I could add one to the list,

434
00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.440
maybe I would put SARS as closer to the flu end of the spectrum.
Because it,

435
00:30:25.441 --> 00:30:26.510
it did seem to,

436
00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.410
and this adds to the idea that airborne diseases are less driven by poverty

437
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:31.310
because,
um,

438
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:36.310
it did seem to affect everyone but at the same time did hit areas that had

439
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:43.310
strong health infrastructure and that helped to quell the disease.
Someone.

440
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:44.810
<v 0>Okay.
I'm wondering,</v>

441
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:50.040
I like your answer and I'm just wondering if with HIV AIDS you,

442
00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:55.060
we would want even to make distinctions in that HIV age seems to have different

443
00:30:55.941 --> 00:31:00.941
phases and different epidemiologists according to different circumstances and

444
00:31:01.881 --> 00:31:05.960
not in the industrial west.
It seems to be a disease,

445
00:31:05.961 --> 00:31:10.640
more marginal groups at least at the moment at use not to be.

446
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.330
When it was first introduced into the United States for example,

447
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:19.420
it wasn't example of a socioeconomic marginality but rather people who because

448
00:31:21.351 --> 00:31:24.720
of sexual orientation or uh,
their,
uh,

449
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.440
through blood supplies and so forth.

450
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:32.470
But it would seem that if you were dealing at a global level now with AIDS in

451
00:31:32.541 --> 00:31:34.040
Africa for example,

452
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:38.900
poverty does seem to be a very important factor in,
in the disease.

453
00:31:38.901 --> 00:31:40.130
Would you not agree with that

454
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:45.340
<v 3>or,
yeah,
definitely.
I think,
um,
in,
in countries where there is more,
well that's,</v>

455
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.710
it's seen more as a chronic disease.
So definitely.

456
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.820
<v 0>Great.
Well thank you.
So,
um,
we could even talk at devops,</v>

457
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:57.830
break some of the diseases down into different periods in their,

458
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.890
uh,
their transmission and you wanted to add something.
Oh,

459
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.170
that was that what you wanted to add?
Okay,
cool.
There's another,

460
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:10.730
<v 7>oh,
thank you.
Um,</v>

461
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.460
I was just going to say that tuberculosis should be added to the list probably

462
00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:17.260
more on the end of,
um,

463
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:22.430
influenza simply because they kind of regarded it as a disease of the rich for

464
00:32:22.951 --> 00:32:25.590
some time.
And the disease of genius,

465
00:32:25.591 --> 00:32:29.480
I think it was because of the people that it affected.
And um,

466
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.820
<v 0>okay.
Uh,
so there's,
uh,</v>

467
00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.840
the thought that may be tuberculosis ought to be added to the influence and of

468
00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.680
the spectrum in that it seemed to be looking back on the 19th century experience

469
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:48.830
of the disease,
it was even described as a disease of beauty of genius.

470
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:53.980
And it clearly we can make a long list of high society people,

471
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.490
celebrities,

472
00:32:55.491 --> 00:33:00.491
artists are kings and Queens who were afflicted by tuberculosis.

473
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.100
And I think that if you are dealing with the 19th century,

474
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.570
that would be a splendid argument to make.
And I agree with you entirely.

475
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.980
I'm just wondering though,

476
00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.270
if we come forward fast forward in time to today,

477
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.600
then I think we have to say that the epidemiology of tuberculosis today is

478
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:24.881
different and that it thrives on pre existing conditions on overcrowding.

479
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.530
Um,
aunt.
So I think the,

480
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.480
the time period can also be important.

481
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.160
Tuberculosis has retreated to areas of poverty,

482
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.880
I would argue are now,
would you agree with that?

483
00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:42.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

484
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.120
<v 7>Yeah,
I was going to say that.
Um,</v>

485
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:48.410
what do you were just talking about how like different time era is actually can

486
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.410
delineate whether or not it is a disease of poverty here,

487
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.420
not just by the people that it affects the effect it has on the society at the

488
00:33:58.990 --> 00:33:59.823
present moment.

489
00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:01.270
<v 0>Okay.
Thanks very much.
Yes.</v>

490
00:34:01.271 --> 00:34:06.271
So I think we're seeing that I'm describing a d I diseases as diseases of

491
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:12.080
poverty is really a complex,
uh,
and also,

492
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.610
um,
debatable position.
And it depends on what diseases,

493
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.190
where,
when,
and so forth.

494
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:21.860
So it's actually one needs to break down.

495
00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:26.840
What poverty is and one needs to have a spectrum of diseases.

496
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.710
Uh,
but I think we're dealing with it much more effectively.

497
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.420
And I think one of the things we see is it,
the more complexity,

498
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:39.560
the more nuance,
uh,
the better our answer is becoming.
Also,

499
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:41.150
the more interesting,
uh,

500
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:46.240
I think it's rather a blend and not very convincing answer to say simply all

501
00:34:47.901 --> 00:34:50.300
diseases are diseases of poverty.

502
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:55.450
And I think we now see that actually the situation is much more complex than not

503
00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:00.140
that poverty is an important factor,
but it doesn't simply,

504
00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.770
we can't reduce our course to that one variable.

505
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.810
Okay.
Um,
in the meanwhile,
have you thought of other questions that,

506
00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.490
uh,
that we ought to be dealing with in our course?

507
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:20.130
Or should I put it another way?
Are there major themes in our course?

508
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:25.140
What could we make maybe a short list of themes that you should be thinking

509
00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:27.570
about as you do your revision?

510
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:31.710
What are the major themes that we've been dealing with this semester?

511
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:36.810
Uh,
disease and poverty as an example.
Um,

512
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.490
are there other themes

513
00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.513
<v 1>go for it?</v>

514
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:47.581
<v 8>Um,</v>

515
00:35:47.581 --> 00:35:51.180
I guess another theme has been the magic bullet theory of combating disease in

516
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:54.960
the idea that any disease can be solved basically by,

517
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.890
I'm coming sort of coming up with some sort of scientific cure that uh,
such as,

518
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.570
uh,
I guess the Queen in the case of malaria.
Um,

519
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:07.620
I guess in the case of right Queenie and then DDT in the case of malaria.

520
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.120
And I guess that theme has been one that has sort of been one underlying,
um,

521
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.830
what has been sort of this tram for age of American medicine and one that I

522
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:19.680
think,
uh,
at least in emerging and reemerging disease,

523
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:23.580
is it something that we're increasingly viewing as not exactly the most

524
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.530
effective way of dealing with it,
but that one disease.

525
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.710
<v 0>Okay.
Thanks very much.
Yes.
One of the,</v>

526
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.800
another theme of our course has been the tendency to think of finding a magic

527
00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:39.000
bullet to each infectious disease.

528
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.290
And you were just starting to do what I think would then be really important if

529
00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:45.900
that were a question on the final,

530
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:51.020
which is to look at what is the history of magic bullets and have they actually

531
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:56.630
delivered on the promise associated with them and examples that you gave.

532
00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.900
Um,
let's see.
Quinine with regard to malaria,
um,

533
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.930
or later on Ddt with regard to malaria.

534
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.490
And how's that,

535
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:14.030
would that be with malaria be a good example of a disease that's been highly

536
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:17.460
responsive to magic bullets?

537
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:19.543
<v 1>Huh?</v>

538
00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:24.580
<v 0>And you were shaking your head,
ah,
do you want to add to your head shake,</v>

539
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.643
<v 1>um,</v>

540
00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.910
mass treatment?
And it was all sort of,

541
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.200
<v 3>um,
to malaria.
And there were other social factors that weren't considered.</v>

542
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.370
Um,

543
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:44.370
and people were thinking at the time that if we applied a DVD for a certain

544
00:37:44.771 --> 00:37:46.930
amount of time,
the malaria eradicated forever,

545
00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.770
but that certainly wasn't the case.
And conditions could change in the disease.

546
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.210
I think it was the case,
um,
in near,

547
00:37:55.211 --> 00:37:58.990
near Italy where they built the dam and then during the war the dam was broken

548
00:37:58.991 --> 00:38:01.990
and then later the disease came back during the war.

549
00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:06.840
So these measures aren't permit as they thought they were.
They initially were.

550
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:09.580
So in that sense,
this magic bullet,
um,

551
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.840
can't be the permanent,
I don't answer.

552
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.700
<v 0>Okay.
So we have,
um,</v>

553
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:19.260
a problem with malaria.

554
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.320
There was this great euphoria of thinking that a magic bullet could be found and

555
00:38:24.811 --> 00:38:28.380
quinine and Dee Dee tee,
we're examples.
Um,

556
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:33.620
but they ended up not actually delivering on the promise.

557
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.510
Chloroquine would be yet another example,
uh,

558
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:41.260
of a magic bullet for dealing with malaria.
So I would agree entirely.

559
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:46.320
Malaria would be a wonderful example of enormous expectations of a magic bullet

560
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:52.060
as a solution.
And yet we see that in fact,
uh,

561
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:57.090
the biology of the disease is much more complicated than being dealt with and

562
00:38:57.941 --> 00:38:58.774
not way.

563
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:03.780
And we've seen resistance being developed by mosquitoes and by plasmodium.

564
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.840
And so the promise of the magic bullets with malaria turned out to be a tool and

565
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:16.300
they're useful,
but they haven't rid the world at all of the disease.

566
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.970
And there was,
you wanted also to say something.

567
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.160
<v 3>Yeah.
And I think to go along with that,
um,</v>

568
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.920
there's another reason why magic boats can't entirely work in,

569
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:28.330
that's another theme of the class,

570
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:31.240
which is the idea of disease as a social construction.

571
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.620
And the fact is that even if a magic bullet can,
um,

572
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:40.290
have a great effect on the biology or the symptomatology of a disease,

573
00:39:40.931 --> 00:39:45.931
I think Barnes is the author who really went into the idea that in order to

574
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:51.280
really attack a disease,
it,
it goes into the substratum of society,

575
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:56.140
into our ideas about disease and what we placed,

576
00:39:56.141 --> 00:39:57.690
the stigma that we place on.

577
00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.320
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
so,
uh,</v>

578
00:40:00.321 --> 00:40:03.320
we can't just think in terms of magic bullets,

579
00:40:03.321 --> 00:40:06.650
we also have to think about the ideas in people's heads.

580
00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:10.850
How do they understand the disease?
What's the social construction?

581
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:14.750
And you gave the example of tuberculosis,
um,
as,

582
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:19.250
as a good example.
Okay.
I would entirely agree with that too.

583
00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:20.210
Um,

584
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:25.210
I'm wondering if there are other examples of magic bullets that have either

585
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:29.930
delivered on the promise or have failed to deliver on the promise.

586
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:36.210
What we've talked about,
malaria,
quinine,
DDT,
chloroquine.

587
00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.610
Um,
what about other,

588
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:43.170
I have magic bullets played a role in our course with other diseases.
Yeah,

589
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.273
go for it.

590
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:55.800
<v 2>The original magic bullet was this with syphilis though,
right?
Penicillin.
Um,</v>

591
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.500
and I think that was a pretty good example.
I mean,

592
00:40:58.501 --> 00:41:02.010
brands point in a magic bullet is the,
it didn't really,

593
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:04.850
I mean it helped but it didn't really slow the incidents.

594
00:41:04.851 --> 00:41:08.180
Like it would sort of go Creston waves where there were,
you know,

595
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:11.340
people who were soldiers in the army and they would get prostitutes and then it

596
00:41:11.341 --> 00:41:15.390
kind of didn't really matter whether there was a cure for syphilis or not

597
00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.290
because like they just wouldn't have access to it.
Like even if they,

598
00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:21.300
even if they can track to the disease.
So,
um,

599
00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:25.200
education and other programs like that are just as important as,
um,

600
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:27.810
drugs when it comes to preventing something like an STD.

601
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:29.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

602
00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:34.370
So the history of syphilis would be another good study for whether magic bullets

603
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:41.381
are the way to eradicate or control a major diseases.

604
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:45.590
And you,
you use the example of penicillin,
which is a good one,

605
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:49.640
but I think we've had with syphilis even further back,

606
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.470
other things that at the time were thought of as magic bullets,
uh,

607
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.510
mercury before that.

608
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.920
And salverson would be other earlier,
uh,

609
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:02.870
ideas of,
uh,

610
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:07.400
considered magic bullets that also didn't eliminate the disease.

611
00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:12.580
The diseases tend to be much more complicated than to be simply amenable to a

612
00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:15.320
magic bullet solution.

613
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.060
So syphilis is another example along with malaria,
right?

614
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.340
Uh,
are there other examples?

615
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:23.250
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

616
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:27.030
One instance where this magic bullet idea did it seem to work was in the case of

617
00:42:27.031 --> 00:42:28.580
smallpox where,
um,

618
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:33.680
a vaccine was developed and given to all the population such that the disease no

619
00:42:35.461 --> 00:42:40.461
longer had a host of humans or reserve pool of posts in effect,

620
00:42:40.951 --> 00:42:43.230
and the disease eventually was radicating.
Um,

621
00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:47.760
and I think that's one example where this magic bullet was,
um,

622
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:52.180
was effective,
but it was a very special case,
um,
in the,
in,

623
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.310
in the case of smallpox because this cow pox vaccine was very effective.

624
00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.920
And I think we talked about how,
um,

625
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.780
it's very much disease specific and smallpox seem to themes to be an exception

626
00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:07.080
rather than the rule in terms of how magical it can work.

627
00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:08.820
<v 0>Okay,
thanks.
Um,</v>

628
00:43:08.821 --> 00:43:13.821
so we need to be careful or even in our CEP skepticism about magic bullets that

629
00:43:16.231 --> 00:43:19.470
there may be cases when they can actually work.

630
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:24.650
And a good example being smallpox in which the vaccine how's actually eradicate,

631
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:30.660
it's naturally occurring smallpox from the world.
So there are examples,

632
00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:31.830
but then one ha,

633
00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:35.970
you were also saying what lesson should be drawn from smallpox?

634
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:40.440
And you were saying perhaps one of the lessons though is it smallpox is

635
00:43:40.441 --> 00:43:41.274
atypical.

636
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:46.430
It had certain specific features about it that made it particularly vulnerable

637
00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:51.420
to attack by vaccination,
but,
uh,

638
00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:56.450
we can't throw out then the hope for finding tools that will actually eradicate

639
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.863
diseases.

640
00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.190
And smallpox is an example of something that really did work.

641
00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.330
Yeah.
Okay.
Any other examples?

642
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.890
It ought to be thrown into our mix.

643
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.793
<v 1>MMM.</v>

644
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.820
<v 0>How about TB?
And streptomycin would be,
uh,</v>

645
00:44:15.821 --> 00:44:19.360
another example I would think of,
um,
uh,
um,

646
00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:24.570
something that seemed after World War Two that it would be possible to close all

647
00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:31.160
of the sanitary IA and that was largely happen.
And the,
uh,

648
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:36.170
outlook seem to be that TB would be eliminated by this magic bullet.

649
00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.700
But we see again,

650
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.880
the problem of drug resistance and we're living now in a world in which there's

651
00:44:45.211 --> 00:44:50.040
multiple drug resistant tuberculosis.
And so once again,

652
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:50.970
the,

653
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:55.970
we have an example of a disease that's been much more recalcitrant because we

654
00:44:57.091 --> 00:45:00.630
see the,
I guess,
um,
that Darwin was right,

655
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.750
the influence of evolution and its impact on,
uh,

656
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.300
the microbes surrounding us.
Um,
okay.

657
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.110
Is there another major theme of our course?

658
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:16.980
We've seen magic bullets.
We've seen,
uh,

659
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.120
poverty.
Uh,

660
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:24.140
we've seen modes of transmission as major impacts on disease.

661
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:29.460
Uh,
we've talked about mortality,
morbidity,

662
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.110
and whether how you,
what are the contributes symptomatology,

663
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:38.880
what are the factors that contribute to the impact of a disease on society?

664
00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.250
We have just a few more minutes.
So I'm wondering if we have,
uh,

665
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:47.220
at least one more candidate for a major theme of our course.

666
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.073
Yeah,

667
00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.140
the evolution of public health strategies in response to the epidemic disease.

668
00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:03.110
Okay.
Uh,
that's not fair.
You read my mind.

669
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:08.770
I was thinking of exactly that and I did want to say that it would be

670
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:13.930
unfortunate if you went to the final examine our course without also thinking

671
00:46:14.661 --> 00:46:19.661
about public health as a major theme that we've covered in our course.

672
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:23.540
And let me just,
shall I,
could we make lists now?

673
00:46:23.541 --> 00:46:25.520
We don't have time for a discussion,

674
00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:30.530
but what are some of the major forms of public health strategy that we have

675
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:31.603
talked about?

676
00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.480
Okay.
Okay.

677
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:44.100
Quarantine and might be,
we might and large that by saying,

678
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:49.220
could we talk about plague strategies of defense against infectious disease,

679
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.460
meaning quarantines sanitary,
cordons,

680
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.150
possibly lots of the out toasts and pest houses.
Um,

681
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.430
all the rest that go with that.
Yes,

682
00:46:59.431 --> 00:47:02.580
that's a recur and that's not only against plug,

683
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:07.581
but plug strategies were rolled out again and again and our course,

684
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:12.180
we've seen them applied not very helpfully against cholera.

685
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.420
We've seen them also a plagued strategies being applied against HIV AIDS in the

686
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:24.880
early days.
Um,
okay.
So that's one style of public health.
Um,

687
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:28.740
what other measures of public health have we seen?

688
00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.533
Yeah.

689
00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.500
Steelman educational campaign.
Okay.

690
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:41.860
You've got a list here that saw three more styles.

691
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.050
We've seen vaccination as,
uh,

692
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:50.190
you remember going back to Edward Jenner and that was a long time ago,

693
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:54.990
I admit,
but,
um,
that's important to remember.
Um,
there were,

694
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.720
we've also seen concealment and we saw concealment.

695
00:47:58.721 --> 00:48:02.350
In the case of star SARS,
it came a occurred,
um,

696
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.940
in the case of cholera in our course.
Um,

697
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:11.040
we've talked about education as a impact on public health.

698
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.880
Are there other styles of public health that we've come across?
Yes.

699
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:19.080
Okay.
Uh,

700
00:48:19.081 --> 00:48:23.580
we've seen public health based on my asthma twosome and,

701
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.030
uh,
with the fill theory of disease and uh,

702
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.580
therefore,
uh,
sanitation,
introducing,
uh,

703
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:36.420
urban cleanups,
sewer systems,
um,

704
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:40.410
even the rebuilding of cities.
Uh,
as we saw under oh,

705
00:48:40.411 --> 00:48:45.411
small town in France and we saw that in the rebuilding of Naples also.

706
00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:50.190
So those are additional styles of public health.

707
00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:54.810
Um,
anything else anyone wants to throw in?

708
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:56.390
<v 1>Huh?</v>

709
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.550
<v 0>Or is there a maybe another question,</v>

710
00:48:58.551 --> 00:49:01.880
a final sort of question or theme of the course?

711
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:06.930
We've just briefly suggested public health and a few dimensions.
Um,

712
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:11.360
there are others and I hope that you'll dig out,
dig them out.
Also,
are there any,

713
00:49:11.361 --> 00:49:14.630
is there any final question that anyone wants to,

714
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:16.243
<v 1>to bring up?</v>

715
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:22.833
Yeah.

716
00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:35.500
<v 0>Okay.
Okay.
We could discuss also the way in which,</v>

717
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:35.990
uh,

718
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:40.990
the modern state has played a role in the control of disease and that we can see

719
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:42.020
that,
uh,

720
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:47.160
in tuberculosis through dispensary's Sanatoria we can see that also playing a

721
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:53.470
role through malaria.
And the same sort of idea of,

722
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.920
uh,
of dispensary's again.

723
00:49:57.070 --> 00:50:01.570
And there are other diseases as well.
The state playing a role in education,

724
00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:05.620
the state playing a role in the plague measures also.

725
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:09.610
So I think we can see the role of the state as a major player.

726
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:14.710
A central player in public health could indeed be an important theme of our

727
00:50:14.891 --> 00:50:18.070
class.
Uh,
but having said that,
uh,

728
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.850
another theme is stomping,
uh,
when we've run out of time.

729
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.590
And so I'll do that and wish you good luck on the final and thank you this

730
00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:30.400
morning for helping us put our heads together.
And I liked euro.

731
00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.410
Your comments.
Thanks very much.
