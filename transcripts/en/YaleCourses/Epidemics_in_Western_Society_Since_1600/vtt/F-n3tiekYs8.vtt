WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.890
Done.
I want to turn to the next topic,

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.000
which is Mark's a new unit in our course.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.900
That is to say until now we've dealt with bubonic plague in a series of talks

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.800
and uh,

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.810
in your first section meeting now I'd like to look for comparative purposes,

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.650
uh,
a very different high impact disease.

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.150
And this time and next we'll be dealing with smallpox.

8
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.470
So I think you deserve an answer to the obvious questions.

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.180
Why smallpox and why at this stage in the course.

10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.370
So I want to give you a little bit of explanation,
uh,
to see where we're going.

11
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.590
The first has to do with a,

12
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.180
what I might call a varied intellectual diet.

13
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.840
And I want us to deal with diseases of very different types.

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.300
And so we'll have to examine the impact of different kinds of infectious

15
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:10.140
diseases.
Plague was a bacterial disease.

16
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.510
Smallpox instead is viral plague was transmitted by vectors.

17
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.030
You know the drill.
Now the role of routes and fleas.

18
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.510
Smallpox instead is spread by contact and airborne inhalation of droplets.

19
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.150
Plague is a classic epidemic disease in the sense that it's an outside invader

20
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.590
that ravages a locality for a season and then departs smallpox is different and

21
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.250
that it can be both endemic and epidemic.

22
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.150
So we'll see a different dynamic.

23
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.610
It's also true that the social responses to smallpox,

24
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.780
we're quite different.

25
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.650
Plug was associated with terror and social disruption and in the new world will

26
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:13.191
see that it had an even more dramatic impact on the native smallpox did on the

27
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:15.810
native American population.

28
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.020
But in European conditions it was a familiar and Dominic disease with a less

29
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:24.360
dramatic,
uh,

30
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.570
as a cause was less dramatic as a cause of social tensions and disruption.

31
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.740
We'll see to that.
In terms of impact,

32
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.110
uh,
for chronology,

33
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.640
it makes sense to look at smallpox at this stage in our class.

34
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.180
It had long been present in human history,

35
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.570
but there was an upsurge in smallpox in the 17th and 18th centuries that

36
00:02:55.441 --> 00:03:00.370
accompanied the surge in dumb,
the demography of Europe.

37
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.300
And it also reflected the transformation of social and economic conditions

38
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.480
associated with the commercialization of agriculture,

39
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.600
the onset of industrial development and rapid unplanned urbanization.

40
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.270
With those associated pathologies such as overcrowding,

41
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.440
both at home and in the workplace.
So in those conditions,

42
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.960
smallpox was a great killer and it succeeded Plagge as the most dreaded disease

43
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.510
of the late 17th and the 18th century.

44
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.580
So in a sense,

45
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:44.581
we're moving from boob onic plague the most dreaded disease of its era to in a

46
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:50.500
sense in terms of fear,
uh,

47
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.560
to smallpox as the next most dreaded disease of the next period in the 18th

48
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:00.340
century.
But there's more to it than not.

49
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.840
Small pox,

50
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:05.950
as you'll see in our reading and in our lecture next time,

51
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.340
was also extraordinarily important in terms of its impact in the new world.

52
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.210
It led to a demographic catastrophe for the native American population largely

53
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:21.670
spontaneously,

54
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.530
but there were also intentional acts of genocide involved.

55
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.400
So we're going to see in terms of one of the themes of our course that disease

56
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.940
and particularly small pox,

57
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.210
played an important role in the big picture of history in conditioning or

58
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.941
creating factors that were important in European settlement in the new world.

59
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.370
And that led to the introduction of African slavery as the native American

60
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.400
population had new immunity and perished from small pox and therefore could not

61
00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:05.170
be enslaved,

62
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.780
whereas Africans possessing immunity were important to replace them.

63
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.430
Another major feature and reason for dealing with smallpox has to do with

64
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:22.180
another theme of our course and not as public health.

65
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.190
We've already dealt with plague measures of public health.

66
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.600
You know what they are.

67
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.490
The plague measures boards of health quarantine,

68
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.170
lots of Raftos,

69
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.790
sanitary cordons or emergency burial regulations.

70
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.450
Smallpox by contrast was to lead to a very different but highly effective style

71
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:47.890
of public health.

72
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.550
That is first inoculation and then vaccination associated with Edward Jenner

73
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.470
even more spectacularly.
Then plagued measures.

74
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.740
Vaccination ultimately promoted a victory over smallpox leading in 1982 it's

75
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.781
total global eradication at least naturally occurring smallpox,

76
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.930
the first and still as we speak,

77
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.730
the only human disease to be so intentionally eradicated.

78
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.430
Unlike plagued measures,

79
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.990
vaccination was a powerful tool of public health.

80
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.140
Successful vaccines have subsequently been developed against other diseases.

81
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.760
Measles,
Rubella,
whooping cough,
tetanus,
diptheria,
rabies,

82
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:45.200
polo,
polio,
but again like plague measures.

83
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.380
Vaccines have been controversial and we'll be talking about when vaccines form

84
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:57.311
an appropriate strategy and eradication has been ever more elusive for diseases

85
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.460
other than smallpox.

86
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.610
It may be that smallpox is a special case rather than as many hoped on model for

87
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:11.870
the eradication of diseases sequentially.

88
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.900
One after another we'll be looking also out smallpox because of its demographic

89
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.420
and economic effects.

90
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.660
We talked in terms of play of a mortality revolution in terms of geography,

91
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.990
demography and also of its impact on industrialization,

92
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:38.140
smallpox and the successful containment of smallpox to inoculation and

93
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:44.861
vaccination also had a major impact on that mortality revolution and therefore

94
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:49.190
also on economic development.

95
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:55.030
We'll be looking also at cultural impact and we'll see that smallpox also

96
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:57.760
produced,
uh,

97
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.790
the cult of certain new saints that it to became a theme in the arts and

98
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:07.520
literature and more speculatively.

99
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.670
We talked last time about the possible relationship of the successful conquest

100
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.230
of plague on the coming of the enlightenment.
Well,

101
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.260
smallpox provides us with a second instance of the successful deployment of

102
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:29.480
human means to control a major cause of death and anguish,

103
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.930
making life more secure and longer.

104
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.070
It's suggestive that a number of leading filas off,

105
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.830
we're avid proponents of inoculation,

106
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.920
including Voltaire and conduits say,

107
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.460
so we'll be dealing with those issues.

108
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.700
But this morning what I'd like to do is to concentrate on something more narrow,

109
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.630
which is the nature,

110
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.660
but forms the basis for our understanding of the impact of this disease.

111
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.920
It's nature as a disease,

112
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.220
how it affects the individual human body.

113
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.690
And what were the treatments,
uh,
in the 17th,

114
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:11.340
18th centuries.

115
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.900
So let's begin with smallpox as a disease.

116
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.710
Smallpox often called nicknamed for reasons.

117
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:22.530
We'll soon see the speckled monster.

118
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.490
There is a,

119
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.500
it's a virus belonging to the family of orthopods viruses that includes very ola

120
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.400
major,
very ola minor and cow pox.

121
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.170
We'll talk about cow pox,
uh,

122
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.080
next time because if it's influence in the development of vaccination,

123
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.440
but our theme will concern very all a major and very ola minor,

124
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:56.600
especially very all a major which is the causative agent primarily of smallpox.

125
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.850
This is a picture of very old nature,

126
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.700
the largest of all viruses,

127
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.840
first seen by the microscope in 1905.

128
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.010
This causes classical smallpox.
There's very old,

129
00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:16.680
a minor as well.

130
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.120
That first appeared in the 20th century and work for our purposes,

131
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.700
we can afford to ignore it.

132
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.190
It was of minor impact and now like very old major,

133
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.200
it's extinct as well.

134
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.840
Now one question is what's a virus?

135
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:43.070
We talked about the term microbe micro being the generic term from microscopic

136
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:49.881
organisms including bacteria like our friend Yersinia Pestis,

137
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.730
the causative agent of Boob,

138
00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:57.731
onic plague and viruses like very all a major and very ola minor.

139
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.760
The pathogens that cause smallpox plague,

140
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.960
which caused by bacteria and those as you know,

141
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.680
and we'll be studying more on science hill,

142
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:16.020
our union cellular organisms that are definitely and unequivocally alive,

143
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.490
they reproduce by dividing.

144
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:25.491
They contain DNA plus all the cellular machinery necessary to read it and to

145
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:31.920
produce the many proteins,
the enable it to live and reproduce.

146
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.760
Viruses are something different and here there's a possible confusion lurking

147
00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:39.930
for the historian.

148
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.920
The word virus itself is ancient in the humeral system.

149
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:47.101
In fact,

150
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:52.101
when diseases were seen to arise from assaults on the body on the outside,

151
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.840
one of the major environmental insults that was thought to lead to disease was

152
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:01.810
the corrupted air or Miasma.

153
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.920
And this was influenced by a poison that might be called a virus.

154
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.530
So if you do research on medical history,

155
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.620
you'll see the term virus used in an old sense for many centuries.

156
00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:23.460
But the virus in present medical discourse is a term that dates it's modern

157
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:27.280
usage from the early 20th century,

158
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.850
and it refers to parasitic particles,

159
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.720
perhaps 500 times smaller than bacteria.

160
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.980
Their existence was established by elegant scientific experiments,

161
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.900
uh,
in the first years of the century,

162
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.630
completed by about 1903,

163
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:51.640
but they couldn't actually be seen until the invention of the electron

164
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:56.641
microscope and the 1930s and they're functioning wasn't understood until the DNA

165
00:12:58.661 --> 00:13:01.240
revolution of the 1950s.

166
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.170
So viruses we now know,

167
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:10.470
consist of some of the elements of life stripped to their most basic of virus

168
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:17.230
really is nothing more than a piece of genetic material route.

169
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.910
In a protein case,

170
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.800
there are particles that are interrupt on their own.

171
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.460
Viruses lock the machinery to read DNA or to make proteins or carry out

172
00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.100
metabolic processes.

173
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.640
They can do nothing on their own and they cannot reproduce by themselves.

174
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.100
Their survival depends in stead on invading living cells.

175
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:51.010
Once inside they hijack the cell and its machinery.

176
00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:57.090
The genetic code of the virus and the virus after all is almost nothing else

177
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.220
gives the cell the message that needs to reproduce more virus,

178
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.530
thus transforming cells and to virus producing factories.

179
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.400
And in the process they destroy the host cell.

180
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.600
As they produce more and more viruses and destroy more and more cells,

181
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.450
the effect on the human body can be severe,

182
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.540
even catastrophic depending on the capacity of the immune system to contain or

183
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:33.250
destroy the invasion.
So here we have an esense,

184
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.580
the opposite of a hippocratic idea of disease.

185
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.220
The body assaulted not from the outside,

186
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.120
but rather from a parasitic pathogen.

187
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.410
Deep within there is an exotic debate,
of course,

188
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.480
are viruses alive.

189
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.000
Those argue that they are alive,

190
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.870
not that they're capable of transmitting genetic material.

191
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.050
One of the key indications of life.

192
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.680
Those who claim they're not alive,

193
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:09.130
note that on their own there are nerves that they can't carry on metabolic

194
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:11.720
processes or produce proteins.

195
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.350
Viruses they know are the ultimate parasites.

196
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:21.790
Virologists often say that whether you decide that viruses or alive or not is

197
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:28.001
ultimately a matter of disciplinary perspective or perhaps even personal

198
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:29.300
preference.

199
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.840
The re reassuring point for us as it perhaps accepting theology,

200
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.980
the answer doesn't really matter in any case,

201
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.040
what we need to know is that smallpox was caused by a virus and a virus that has

202
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:48.470
no animal reservoir.

203
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:54.070
The disease was restricted entirely to human beings and that will prove to be

204
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:59.240
important in making it eventually a good candidate for eradication.

205
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.210
The name for the virus,
Vario,
Lola,
derives from the Latin,

206
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.870
various meaning spotted.
And in England,

207
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:12.950
the disease in fact was popularly called,
as I've said,

208
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:14.300
the speckled monster.

209
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:20.210
So here's the picture of the smallpox.
Oops,
it's going out.

210
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.840
There it is.
And that's a schematic,
um,

211
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.550
uh,
image of a smallpox virus.
And as I said,

212
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.580
there is a mutation that occurred in the 20th century calling causing the rise

213
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:40.640
of Arriola minor as well as Vario,
all major,

214
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.200
but we'll be concerned exclusively here with Vario,
all major,

215
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.520
the main cause of smallpox historically.
Well,

216
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:53.090
how was it transmitted
here?

217
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:58.100
We need to remember that smallpox is an exceedingly contagious disease.

218
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.480
A smallpox patient sheds millions of infective viruses into his or her immediate

219
00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:11.861
surroundings from the rash and from the open sowers and the sufferer's throat.

220
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:19.360
The patient is infective from just before the onset of the rash until the very

221
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:24.230
last scab falls off weeks later.

222
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.450
Not everyone of course,

223
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:31.451
who is exposed as infected living along with people with immunity and leaving

224
00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:34.340
that aside,

225
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.700
it has been estimated that the chances are about 50 50 that is susceptible

226
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:44.921
member of a household would contract smallpox from an ill patient in the home.

227
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.340
The dominant mounter of spread manner to spread smallpox was by contact.

228
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:57.981
Infection droplets breathed out in face to face contact with a susceptible

229
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:02.460
person and inhaled by that person.

230
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:08.270
Normally the spread was in the context of intense contact over a period of time

231
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.170
that is a family member or someone on a hospital ward in an enclosed workplace,

232
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.630
an office,
a factory,
a mine,

233
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.620
the school classroom and army barrack or refugee camp.

234
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.580
And it's most easily transmitted in dry cool seasons.

235
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.610
That's the primary mode of transmission.
There are two more,

236
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:38.100
however,
that are,
uh,

237
00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.130
more relatively secondary.

238
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.510
A second mode of transmission is by what are called another bit of jargon here.

239
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.270
Fomites a phone might is simply an inanimate object capable of carrying

240
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:58.890
infectious material from one person to.
Another.

241
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.970
Examples might be bed linen clothing,

242
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.240
the shroud from an infected person that transmits viruses from one body that is

243
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:12.150
of the sufferer to the next person.

244
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.750
Other examples are simply doorknobs,
eating utensils,
and so on.

245
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:24.210
So that's the second mode of transmission.
There's a third to that.

246
00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:27.240
Smallpox can be vertically transmitted.

247
00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.450
That is from mother to infant.

248
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.470
So it's possible for an infant to be born with congenital small punks.

249
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.520
Well,
if that's the mode of transmission.

250
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.420
What about its epidemiology?
Well,

251
00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:50.421
some favoring factors include large urban populations.

252
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:56.390
It's not coincidental that smallpox raged in western Europe in the 18th century.

253
00:19:59.380 --> 00:19:59.580
Good,

254
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.580
crowded living conditions and workplaces where ideal for its transmission trade

255
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:10.830
and the movement of people,
displaced people,
warfare,

256
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.980
people who assembled and reassembled in crowds were ideal for transmitting

257
00:20:16.051 --> 00:20:17.040
smallpox.

258
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.810
The disease is known to have afflicted ancient Egypt.
Um,

259
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.690
mummies are known to have been victims of smallpox,

260
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:32.220
but the important point is that it became endemic in Europe.

261
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.760
That became the world reservoir of infection from which it's spread by trade,

262
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.690
colonization,
warfare,
and in European cities.

263
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.300
It became above wall a disease of childhood,

264
00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:51.320
but about a of the deaths of children and the 17th century where due to

265
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.980
smallpox.

266
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:59.310
So a reason then for dealing with smallpox now in our course is not,

267
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.110
it was a major upsurge in the 17th and 18th centuries.

268
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.750
How was it named?
Why is it called smallpox?
A small point,

269
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:14.470
but we need to know that it's from a comparative description of its

270
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:16.240
characteristic legions.

271
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:21.370
The great pox is a disease we'll be dealing with a pretty soon,

272
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:26.490
which was syphilis that creates large legions and affects adults.

273
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.790
The smallpox had small lesions and primarily affected children,

274
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.810
at least in countries in which it was endemic.

275
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:44.020
Another point we should know about smallpox is that after infection,

276
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.230
a person enjoys a lifelong immunity.

277
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:53.190
We need to know that because it's a major factor in the public health measures

278
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.640
that the disease eventually generated.
Well,

279
00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:02.200
what about its symptoms?
How does it affect the individual human body

280
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.130
will after inhaling the virus,

281
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:11.190
there's an incubation period which normally lasts something like 12 days.

282
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:18.150
This is important and it's epidemiology because it allowed the spread of the

283
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:23.611
disease because an infected person had ample time to travel before falling ill

284
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:30.570
and therefore time to take the disease with him or her and to spread it.

285
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:37.000
Now I'm going to give some attention perhaps more than you might like when you

286
00:22:37.001 --> 00:22:42.001
see the images to the symptoms of smallpox and there's a reason for that part is

287
00:22:44.681 --> 00:22:48.250
that smallpox is tremendously,

288
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:53.170
terribly terrifyingly painful.
Plus it leads,

289
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:57.910
and this is important too and the way that an impacted society,

290
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.060
it often produces lifelong scarring,

291
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.630
disfiguring and blindness and these in turn spread it fear of it and terror.

292
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:14.670
And so the very word smallpox has a particular resonance in popular imagination

293
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.860
associated with dread.

294
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.900
People sometimes ask,
and of course like this,

295
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.100
which of the diseases we encounter was really the worst.

296
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:33.630
The question doesn't permit empirical verification because no one has ever

297
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:39.481
suffered mercifully all the afflictions we study and had the opportunity to

298
00:23:39.971 --> 00:23:40.810
compare,

299
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:46.890
but it is meaningful to note the impression of those who lived through the times

300
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.840
when smallpox claimed it's legions of victims they thought,

301
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.260
and the physicians,

302
00:23:54.261 --> 00:23:58.970
you treated them that smallpox was the worst of human maladies.

303
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:02.300
That was a term that was set at the time,

304
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.370
and this in fact was the view closer to home of the Illinois State Board of

305
00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:12.371
Health in 1902 where Donald Dr. Donald Hopkins wrote this and the suddenness and

306
00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:21.431
unpredictability of it's a tack and the grotesque torture of its victims and the

307
00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:28.721
brutality of its lethal or disfiguring outcome and in the dread that it inspired

308
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.430
smallpox is the worst.

309
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.300
It's unique among human diseases to the extent that that's true.

310
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:47.350
It's also one of the reasons that smallpox appeals to the malevolent as a

311
00:24:48.021 --> 00:24:50.840
possible instrument of bioterror.

312
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:56.630
It's well known that a major outbreak of smallpox would spread death,

313
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:01.990
maximize suffering and lead to widespread fear flight and social disruption.

314
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.980
The symptoms are important to examine as an integral part of this disease and

315
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.230
more generally,

316
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:17.090
unless we appreciate the distinctive symptoms of each of the diseases we

317
00:25:17.091 --> 00:25:17.924
examined,

318
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:23.380
there's a distorting temptation to allow them to run together the diseases as so

319
00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:29.891
many interchangeable causes of death or point of view that prevents us from

320
00:25:30.741 --> 00:25:34.610
understanding that each of these epidemic diseases,

321
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.790
how to distinctive and different imprint smallpox was the disease that it was in

322
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:46.811
part because of the dread that it generated fear not only of death,

323
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.940
but also of exquisite suffering,

324
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:54.590
maiming disfiguring and blindness.
Only.

325
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:59.360
With that in mind,
can we understand why it's also,

326
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:04.310
uh,
so widely thought to be accounted it for bio terror?

327
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.670
So we'll look at images of the disease and I apologize to those of you who've

328
00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.120
just finished breakfast are just about to have lunch.

329
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.580
In any case,
uh,
first after the incubation period,

330
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.190
there's the pre eruptive stage.

331
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.420
The virus multiplies in the system for 12 days after incubation and symptoms of

332
00:26:32.061 --> 00:26:35.480
disease begin with a viral shower.

333
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:41.530
As the pathogen is released into the bloodstream and spreads systemically

334
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:42.920
throughout the body,

335
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:48.500
localizing eventually and the blood vessels of the skin just below the

336
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.760
superficial layers.

337
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:56.750
The viral reload released and the efficiency of the body's immune response

338
00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:03.140
determine the severity and type of the disease onset is sudden with fever of a

339
00:27:05.771 --> 00:27:10.560
hundred to 102 degrees and a general malaise.

340
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.520
This stand is the beginning of perhaps a month of excruciating suffering and the

341
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:20.760
danger of spreading contagion.

342
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:25.530
The early symptoms are fever,
vomiting,

343
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.750
severe backache,
splitting,
frontal headache,
and in children,

344
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.730
sometimes convulsions.

345
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.520
Sometimes the disease is so overwhelming that it leads to what's called

346
00:27:38.521 --> 00:27:40.350
fulminating smallpox,

347
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:45.800
which causes death within 36 hours with no outward manifestations at all.

348
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:52.550
Although postmortem exams reveal hemorrhages and the respiratory tract,

349
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:56.160
the alimentary tract or the heart muscles.

350
00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.560
Let me give you a description of a hyper acute case of that kind.

351
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.600
Physicians wrote after three to four days.

352
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.900
The general the patient has the general aspect of someone who's passed through a

353
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:16.800
long and exhausting struggle.
His face has lost.

354
00:28:16.801 --> 00:28:21.801
All expression is mask like and there's a want of tone in all muscles.

355
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.370
When he speaks,
this condition becomes more apparent.

356
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.410
Speaking is with evident effort and the voice is low,

357
00:28:31.411 --> 00:28:32.700
a monotonous.

358
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:36.930
The patient has listless and indifferent to surroundings.

359
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:41.250
The mental attitude is similar.
There's a loss of tension,

360
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.430
a lengthening of reaction time and effective control and the most four minute

361
00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:48.000
cases.

362
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
The aspect of the patient resembles that of someone suffering from severe shock

363
00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:54.450
and loss of blood.

364
00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.410
The face is drawn and pallid respiration is sign or gasping.

365
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:04.260
The patient tosses about continually and cries out.

366
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:10.100
His attention is fixed with difficulty and he complains only of agonizing pain

367
00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:15.510
now in the chest now in the back,
the head or the abdomen,

368
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:21.380
but normally smallpox wasn't four minute quite like that and passed.

369
00:29:21.751 --> 00:29:26.751
The patient passed on to the next phase which was the eruptive one exhibiting

370
00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:33.260
the classical symptoms of smallpox that led to its diagnosis on the third day

371
00:29:35.851 --> 00:29:37.290
after onset.

372
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.440
The patient usually felt a little better and in mild cases he or she could

373
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:48.931
return to normal activities with the unfortunate effect that this spread the

374
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:50.830
disease further.

375
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.090
But concurrently a rash appeared,

376
00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.580
a small round or oval rose colored lesion,
none.

377
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:04.990
As a Mac you'll that's up to a quarter of an inch in diameter.

378
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.920
The molecules appeared first on the tongue and palate and then within 24 hours

379
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.280
it spread to cover the body down to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet

380
00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.860
on the cheek and forehead,

381
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:26.010
the appearances of severe sunburn and indeed the sensation felt by the patient

382
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.370
is of scalding pain or intense burning.

383
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:35.770
There is a characteristic pattern called centrifical distribution.

384
00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:40.890
That is that the rash is least spread on the trunk of the body and most densely,

385
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.010
uh,
apparent on the face and the extremities.

386
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.020
Let me show you a slide,

387
00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:55.021
a very ill little boy and you can see this centrifical pounder and we're in

388
00:30:55.781 --> 00:30:56.960
which the,
uh,

389
00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:02.310
rash is most apparent on the extremities rather than the trunk on day two of the

390
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:08.110
rash,
a little further into the infection,

391
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.430
the lesions alter.
Um,

392
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.470
the at this time,

393
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:19.650
the molecule becomes harder and generally rises above the surface into

394
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:25.171
structures known as populates with a flattened apex to the touch.

395
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.760
They were said by physicians to feel like buckshot embodied in the skin.

396
00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.120
And there we can see the picture of a face,
uh,

397
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.610
at that stage of the disease.

398
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.990
The disease then moves on by the fifth day of the rash when fluid begins to

399
00:31:44.351 --> 00:31:49.351
accumulate and pockmarks which are then raised and firm to the touch.

400
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.670
So we'll pass on now called vesicles.

401
00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.010
They've grown in size,

402
00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.220
they've changed in color from red to bluish or purple and they've transformed to

403
00:32:03.191 --> 00:32:06.700
solid from solid to blister like fluid.

404
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.580
It's umbilicated as well.

405
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.940
The process of what's called [inaudible].

406
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
The rise of this stage of the rash takes about three days and lasts a further

407
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:20.464
three.

408
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.160
It's at this stage at the physical diagnosis of smallpox becomes reliable with

409
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:30.670
the disease presenting its most distinctive appearance,

410
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.340
the patient experiences,

411
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:38.640
increasing difficulty in swallowing and in talking you too lesions and the

412
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:45.641
mucous membranes and the palate and the throat and uh,

413
00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:50.060
there's a child,
uh,
at this stage of the disease.

414
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.390
Then by the sixth day of the rash,

415
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.920
Pos begins to form in the pockmarks.

416
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.770
The patient feels much worse.

417
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.340
Septicemia can set in the puss jewels as they're now called begin to fill with

418
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:13.240
yellow fluid and the lesions become globular in shape.

419
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.690
A process that takes about two days and is fully there,

420
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:21.530
fully matured on the eighth day of the eruptive phase.

421
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.740
The patient feels dreadful at this point.

422
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:29.360
Fever has written in proportion to the severity of the attack.

423
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.580
The eyelids,
lips,

424
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.050
nose and tongue are tremendously swollen and we can see

425
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.960
a picture of an adult at that phase of the uh,

426
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:48.110
the infection.
At this point,

427
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:53.111
the patient is almost totally unable to swallow or talk and deteriorate slowly

428
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:58.700
being drowsy most of the time and restless at night.

429
00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:04.510
Often he or she is in a condition of delirium and thrashes about me even tried

430
00:34:05.781 --> 00:34:10.781
to escape the psychological effects weren't simply a sign of high fever.

431
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.120
They resulted also from the involvement of the central nervous system in the

432
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:22.121
infection and the neurological effects and [inaudible] could often be lasting

433
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:28.150
and result in long term impairment done by the ninth day of the rash.

434
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.530
The puss fuels were from and embedded in the skin.

435
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:38.420
And for this reason we're likely in this was important in the impact of the

436
00:34:38.421 --> 00:34:43.421
disease to leave permanent scars and deep pits on the face or wherever they

437
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:48.010
appeared on the Bondi.
If you can imagine by um,

438
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.290
uh,
uh,
at this stage.

439
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:58.300
Another unpleasant aspect at this stage was that a terrible sickly smell

440
00:34:59.481 --> 00:35:04.481
developed the Federer of smallpox that physician claimed that it was impossible

441
00:35:05.931 --> 00:35:09.410
to describe but was found to be overpowering.

442
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:15.670
It's now nearly impossible for the patient to drink and even milk caused intense

443
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:18.830
burning sensation in the throat.

444
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.520
The patient experience is great loss and weight as much as 30 to 40 pounds and

445
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:28.820
an adult and may suffer from frank starvation.

446
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:30.501
In addition,

447
00:35:30.501 --> 00:35:35.501
there's a complete loss of muscle tone while the face in severe cases takes on

448
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.010
the appearance of a cadaver,

449
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:43.730
making the patient almost unrecognizable even to his or her closest relatives,

450
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:46.380
the scalp,

451
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.360
maybe one large lesion and tangled with here and lesions.

452
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:56.361
As you can imagine under the nails of fingers and toes were exquisitely painful.

453
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.080
And then I want to show another disturbing image,
but this was important.
Uh,

454
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.070
though you can look away if you like,
which was uh,

455
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:11.090
the lesions of the eyes because smallpox was a major cause of blindness as well

456
00:36:12.751 --> 00:36:15.900
as death and disfigurement in this period.

457
00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:23.070
Well after about 10 to 14 days of rare scabs are pure and these contain live

458
00:36:25.181 --> 00:36:29.820
smallpox virus as well and are highly effective,

459
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:34.440
ineffective,
and important in the spread of the disease by fomites.

460
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.310
At this point,

461
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:41.910
the fluid portion of the postural is absorbed,

462
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.390
leaving behind the solid part.

463
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.470
Large areas of the skin make begin to peel off,

464
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.830
leaving deeper tissues raw and exposed.

465
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.310
These areas are all painful and contribute to the frightening appearance and the

466
00:36:58.591 --> 00:36:59.820
misery of the patient.

467
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.540
Fatal cases often occurred from about the eighth day and an important reason was

468
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.870
toxemia because these lesions were susceptible to infection.

469
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.980
So attentive nursing,

470
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:18.981
good hygiene and sound nutrition reduce the likelihood of that sort of

471
00:37:19.231 --> 00:37:24.000
complication.
And to that degree,
at least the prosperous,

472
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:28.110
the wound nurse and well cared for,
we're more likely to survive.

473
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:33.510
The appearance of the patient was often described by physicians as

474
00:37:33.511 --> 00:37:34.590
mortification.

475
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:40.490
There's still living patient taking on the appearance of being mummified and the

476
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:46.071
skin of the face fixed in a grotesque mess with the mouth permanently open.

477
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.240
The appearance of scabs and crusting though was a favorable sign in terms of

478
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:55.110
prognosis for the patient.

479
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.040
But they did lead to one final tournament of the disease,

480
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.510
which was an intolerable itching that accompanied that period.

481
00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.320
Indeed,

482
00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.320
a Marge portion of the scarring that resulted from smallpox was undoubtedly due

483
00:38:09.871 --> 00:38:14.871
to patient's scratching and tearing at their lesions where the appearance and

484
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:20.661
distribution of the postures was of major importance for diagnosis.

485
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:26.030
And it could be what was called discreet small where the rash was.

486
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.833
Um,

487
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:33.020
each lesion was distinct and separated from the next.

488
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:38.990
And this meant that you had a case fatality rate of as low as about 9% you had a

489
00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:44.350
90% chance of survival.

490
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:50.770
If instead the lesions were much closer together,
semi confluent,

491
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:55.771
it was called the case fatality rate rose to something like 37% or in cases of

492
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:03.421
what was called confluence smallpox in which the lesions touched one another and

493
00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:09.430
formed a network surrounded by islands of unaffected skin.

494
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:13.540
The case fatality rate was about 65%

495
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:19.630
so the appearance of the lesions was very important in your prognosis.

496
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.470
The rarest form was hemorrhagic smallpox,

497
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.170
which had 100% mortality,

498
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.360
so called because the natural clotting mechanisms of the blood were impaired and

499
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:34.600
the victim died of massive internal hemorrhaging.

500
00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.120
Overall,

501
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:42.150
the case fatality rate for smallpox was estimated to be about 30 to 40% the

502
00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:48.040
virus then attacked not only the skin and the throat,

503
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.240
but also the lungs,
the heart,
the liver,

504
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:57.510
and other internal organs and could result in hemorrhaging and death.

505
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.900
A major danger was also secondary bacterial infection of the lesions,

506
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:08.560
a very common cause of mortality.
Meanwhile,

507
00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:13.450
the lesions of the mouth and throat were of great epidemiological importance

508
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:18.780
because they're the source of the viruses that commonly formed droplets in the

509
00:40:20.261 --> 00:40:24.220
air and in fact others also,

510
00:40:24.221 --> 00:40:28.690
the tongue became swollen and ms shapen,
there was difficulty breathing.

511
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.960
The patient became course swallowing was difficult and all of that was important

512
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.400
and there were other sources of anguish and suffering,
blindness,

513
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.750
scarring and disfigurement,
respiratory complications,

514
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.250
but after the drawing up of the rash,

515
00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:53.940
the patient began to recover and among the population that survives,

516
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.760
the symptoms declined and the patient regains strength and possessed a lifelong

517
00:41:01.421 --> 00:41:05.920
immunity from a second exposure.
All of this led,
of course,

518
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:07.030
as you can imagine,

519
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:12.300
to tremendous fear of the disease as in this picture of Arriola.

520
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:18.160
Well,
how did physicians deal with this disease?

521
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.200
Smallpox no longer occurs naturally anywhere on the planet,

522
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:28.590
but it's worth remembering that there is still no specific remedy or cure for

523
00:41:28.931 --> 00:41:31.000
the disease.
Treatment.

524
00:41:31.001 --> 00:41:36.001
Should a case appear today would be largely supportive depending as Volvo on

525
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:41.900
intensive nursing to keep the lesion scrupulously clean,

526
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:46.790
to prevent bedsores,
and to minimize the breakdown of the skin.

527
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.410
In addition,

528
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:53.410
modern medicine would replace lost fluids and nutrients and would administer

529
00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:56.990
antibiotics not to deal with the virus,

530
00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:01.040
but with the bacterial infections that are its complications.

531
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:06.140
But what were traditional remedies?
Some of them were surprising.

532
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.920
One was a great vogue in the color red.

533
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.710
There was a vogue to hang red curtains around the bed of a patient.

534
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.070
Read furniture was broadened to the sick from,

535
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.890
and patients including Queen Elizabeth,

536
00:42:21.891 --> 00:42:25.940
the first of England were wrapped in red bank blankets.

537
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.080
Later on,
the discovery of ultraviolet rays,
in fact,

538
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:35.081
gave new impetus to this traditional mania for red and red glass went up on

539
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:39.680
windows in the late 19th century.

540
00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:41.900
Medical journals were published.

541
00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:46.250
Studies suggesting also that red light could be soothing to the eyes of the

542
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:49.970
sufferer and that perhaps it prevented scarring of the skin.

543
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.220
So that was one factor.

544
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.940
Another idea that was very common was to open the postural with a golden needle

545
00:42:58.611 --> 00:43:02.330
to drain the fluid.
And then sometimes,
uh,

546
00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:07.331
the lesions were cauterized and an attempt to prevent scarring procedures that

547
00:43:07.781 --> 00:43:09.620
were exceedingly painful.

548
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:15.310
The next idea was what was called the hot regimen to pile the sufferer with

549
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:20.381
blankets to induce him or her just sweat profusely to rid the body of the over

550
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:26.321
abundant humor or the patient could be immersed in a hot bath light and fresh

551
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:33.281
air according to this therapeutic fashion were deemed to be harmful and the

552
00:43:33.441 --> 00:43:37.700
patient was kept in the dark if possible,
with minimal ventilation.

553
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:43.270
Sunlight was said to aggravate the disease and increased scarring and sometimes

554
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.940
patients were given an internal notification.

555
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:52.150
So terrifics to help the evacuation of the excess humor humor.

556
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:58.600
The opposite was also tried the so called cold regimen to keep the room cool and

557
00:43:59.661 --> 00:44:04.460
frequently just sponge down the patient with cold water to place icebags on the

558
00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:05.294
face.

559
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:10.420
Then there was purging and bloodletting.

560
00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.110
Uh,

561
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:17.110
there was also the administration of opiates in the 19th century and especially

562
00:44:17.391 --> 00:44:22.391
morphine to calm the patient in delirium is stringent eye drops.

563
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:27.090
We're resorted to an a particular leap.

564
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:32.100
Perverse theory with no empirical basis was the idea that on the face could be

565
00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:37.581
reduced or prevented by causing more intense irritation of the skin elsewhere so

566
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:42.420
that mustard,
plasters,
mercury,

567
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:47.130
and corrosives were applied on the back in order to save the face.

568
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:53.280
There are also all kinds of local applications to the face to try to prevent

569
00:44:53.281 --> 00:44:57.450
scarring.
Nitrate of silver mercury,
Aja Dean,

570
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.630
mild acids,
a lotion of sulfur.

571
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.970
All of those had their vogues.

572
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:08.240
There are ointments and compresses of virtually every substance known to men.

573
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:13.620
Some physicians held the theory that there preparations would soften the lesion

574
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.570
and mitigate scarring,
so indeed ingenious doctors applied lint,

575
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.700
boric acid or glycerin,

576
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:25.920
or they covered the face with a mask leaving holes for the eyes,
nose,

577
00:45:25.921 --> 00:45:30.510
and mouth,
where they wrapped the face and hands in oiled silk.

578
00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:36.560
Alcoholic beverages were administered to deteriorating patients to revive their

579
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:41.871
energy and sometimes delirious patients were actually tied to their beds.

580
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.280
Some doctors recommended restraints such as splints and later stages to prevent

581
00:45:50.671 --> 00:45:54.600
patients from scarring and faces by scratching.

582
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.560
After hearing of all of these treatments for smallpox,

583
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.740
perhaps you'll appreciate the work of Thomas signum in the 17th century.

584
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:08.280
Uh,
the so called English Hippocrates,

585
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:13.580
who decided that the wealthy and noble who received extensive attention and

586
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:20.211
treatment for smallpox perished of the disease more frequently than the poor who

587
00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:24.120
had no access to treatment.
And He,

588
00:46:24.121 --> 00:46:28.770
his advice was that the best physician was the one who did the least.

589
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.190
It was an advocate of therapeutic minimalism.

590
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.580
He advised instead a simple,

591
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:40.581
cool regimen giving his patients fresh air and light bed coverings.

592
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:46.470
Well,
that's how the disease afflicted the human body.

593
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.930
What I want to do next time,

594
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:54.080
now that we understand this terrible disease and the suffering at cause is to

595
00:46:54.721 --> 00:46:59.130
deal with its impact historically it's effect on society.

596
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:03.630
And to look at the development of a public health strategy,

597
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.880
which was to be vaccination.
