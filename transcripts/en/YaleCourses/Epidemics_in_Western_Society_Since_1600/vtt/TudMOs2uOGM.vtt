1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.670
I'd like to welcome you back and hope that you all had,
um,
really good brakes.

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.780
We'll be talking this week about malaria,
uh,

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.600
both today and on Wednesday.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.200
And I think I may be saying a couple of things that you may find surprising.

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.360
I suppose to,

6
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:25.740
this may be an assumption that when I mentioned malaria,

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.040
that most of you think of it as an exotic tropical disease and probably think

8
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:38.211
that it's very distant from us and has relatively little to do with the modern

9
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:43.911
world or with modern history and probably nothing at all to do with the United

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.450
States and with those of us here.

11
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.590
But the point I wanting to make this time and next is that the reality of

12
00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.861
malaria is quite different from not that when we've come to talk about this

13
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:06.630
disease,
I could say that of all human diseases,

14
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.980
it's one of the oldest and some question,

15
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.040
a question that some of you might ask me is of all the diseases in our course,

16
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.830
which is the one that in the aggregate has caused the most human suffering and

17
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.354
death.

18
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.800
And I think that of all of the diseases in our course,

19
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.930
it's probably malaria,
which has,
uh,

20
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
has not primacy the relationship if human beings to malaria has been so enclose

21
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.960
and so extensive that we could also say that we as a species and malaria as a

22
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:53.121
disease have evolved together and that the human genome bears the imprint of our

23
00:01:55.351 --> 00:01:57.120
experience with malaria.

24
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.140
Good examples of that are a couple of genetic diseases that I'd like to mention

25
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.520
or one that may be familiar to you.
Also,

26
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.370
one being sickle cell anemia,
um,

27
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.690
a second being thalassemia and the third being what's called Duffy negativity.

28
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.090
Now all of these are genetic diseases and they have in common the feature that,

29
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.130
um,
there's a difference between the trait,

30
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.970
which it's a recessive in all three cases.

31
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.980
They're recessive features.

32
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.220
And so a Hetero Zygote that is a person who has just one,

33
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.680
um,
uh,
the w x chromosome rather than accent.
Why?

34
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.460
Uh,

35
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.460
expressing the trait for the disease enjoys a protection from,

36
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.220
but if in fact you have,

37
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.250
are a homozygote and have it done both x and y chromosomes,

38
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.990
and you develop this syndrome for sickle cell anemia,

39
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.050
uh,

40
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.050
instead you have a terrible disease that leads to,

41
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.600
uh,
it causes sickle cell.

42
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.430
It affects the quality of the hemoglobin and the red cells,

43
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.050
and therefore it leads to anemia,

44
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.200
occlusion of blood vessels,

45
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.820
sometimes hypoxia and serious respiratory diseases.

46
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.520
So it's a fatal illness in many cases.

47
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.030
But if you have the trait,

48
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.270
then in a highly malarial area,

49
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.480
you have a great selective advantage in enjoying a great deal of resistance to

50
00:03:58.511 --> 00:03:59.344
immunity.

51
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.410
And so in terms of heavy human evolution and intensely malarial areas,

52
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.450
there was a strong Darwinian,
uh,

53
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.420
pressure for the retention of the sickle cell trait.

54
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.600
The same would be true of Thalassemia,

55
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.560
which affects not the quality of the red cells,

56
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.910
but rather their quantity and leads to,
again,

57
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.240
a terrible complications in,
uh,

58
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.300
in homozygotes and,
uh,

59
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:35.830
with asthma.
Um,
and,
uh,

60
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.460
terrible anemia or Duffy negativity,

61
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.520
which is another genetic disease that leads again to terrible diseases.

62
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.320
Another feature of malaria,

63
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.470
apart from the fact that our genome has actually been strongly influenced by our

64
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:57.640
history with malaria is that until very recently,

65
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.110
it extended more or less across the globe affecting not only the tropics in

66
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:08.800
Africa,
Asia and South America,
but also the north,

67
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.550
including most of Europe and North America.

68
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.970
So I thought I'd show you a map of malaria in the United States in the 19th

69
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:23.050
century.
Uh,
just to give you an idea,

70
00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:28.051
this is 1882 to show you how extensively prevalent it was in this country as

71
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:35.380
recently as the late 19th century.
And indeed it comes up.

72
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.090
Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a book on malaria in New England.

73
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.390
This is a map of 1912 when it's receded a great deal and is primarily a disease

74
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:47.434
of the south.

75
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.530
But remember that it had a major impact on public health in this country until

76
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:55.900
the end of the Second World War,

77
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.720
which is when it was eradicated in the United States.

78
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.050
It's sobering to remember,
for example,

79
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.390
that the Centers for disease control,

80
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:10.391
the CDC in Atlanta was originally founded as an anti malarial agency.

81
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.590
And that the disease played a major role and the settlement of the West and in

82
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.780
the economic and social development of the south.

83
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.360
And if you read Mark Twain for example,

84
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.450
you can read a great deal about shivering along the banks of the Mississippi

85
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:33.641
River in terms of our discussion of relationship of diseases to the big picture

86
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:37.724
of history.

87
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.600
Malaria is also one of the diseases that I think helps us to make the case must

88
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:48.140
effectively malaria.
It's now believed,

89
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.070
played a major part in the fall,
for example,

90
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.130
of the Roman Empire when an epidemic of Falciparum Malaria,

91
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.000
um,
led to the disruption of agriculture and the Roman legions.

92
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:07.030
And I'm not trying to say that malaria caused the downfall of the Roman empire.

93
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.280
I'm saying that it was a major factor leading to the kinds of military problems

94
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.010
and social dislocation that we can't ignore.

95
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.880
And discussing that major series of events,

96
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.210
it's led to major impacts on the outcome and on the conduct of warfare one need

97
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:34.061
go back only to the Second World War when malaria was a PR major preoccupation

98
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.960
of the armies on both sides of the conflict.

99
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.560
It had an enormous role and impact on European expansion and colonization.

100
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:51.070
And one of the great challenges to colonial expansion in the Indian subcontinent

101
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.600
and in Africa was what to do about the problem of malaria.

102
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:02.240
It's affected the pattern of human habitation and settlement,

103
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.540
the way that cities and towns are built across the landscape where human

104
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:13.721
habitation often was a form of prophylaxis from malaria and people live far from

105
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:20.771
swampy areas and often on high ground above dangerous wetlands.

106
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.590
Low down malaria is also a major factor in economic development and under

107
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:33.721
development today in ways that we'll be discussing a decisive factor in its

108
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:41.441
prevalence and in its history has always been the relationship of human beings

109
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.710
to agriculture and the environment.

110
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.240
That is to say that intensive forms of agriculture with a modern livestock

111
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:57.780
raising practices,
modern crop rotations,

112
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.430
what are management,

113
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.610
ecological sanitation with improved housing and conditions of diet,

114
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.200
wages and clothing have led wherever they've been introduced to a spontaneous

115
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:19.011
recession of malaria and much better health outcomes.

116
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.470
And this has been a major factor in the divergence between the global north and

117
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:26.700
the global south.

118
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.360
The north with modernized intensive systems of agriculture and in the south and

119
00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:38.741
said the persistence of extensive forms of practice that are conducive for

120
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:44.280
reasons we'll be examining to the transmission of malaria.

121
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.580
So malaria both reflects and reinforces developmental differences and

122
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:54.690
disparities.
Now,

123
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.780
let's remember that malaria is vitally important in our world today.

124
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.790
Let me give you an example of some of the,
uh,

125
00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:10.710
the pictures that represent the global burden of malaria.

126
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.280
And let me show you a map of where malaria is prevalent today.

127
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:23.490
That is in the 21st century.
Indeed at the moment,

128
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.050
one can say the statistics are extraordinary.

129
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:34.100
About 500,000 people becomes seriously ill of malaria every year,

130
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:40.710
approximately a million people die of it.

131
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.130
The majority of them being children under five and pregnant women concentrated

132
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.920
particularly in sub Saharan Africa.
In fact,

133
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:57.921
one can say that a child dies of malaria in Africa today,

134
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.890
every 30 seconds,

135
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.970
making this disease of global public health emergency along with HIV,

136
00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:11.700
AIDS and tuberculosis.

137
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.720
Let's look at more particularly the areas.

138
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.960
This is the epicenter,
if you like,

139
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.180
of the,
uh,

140
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.780
present day resurgence of malaria as a major,

141
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.200
major public health problem.
Uh,

142
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.320
and there are malaria kills 3000 children every day of the year.

143
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.830
The burden of malaria though,

144
00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.860
is greater than statistics for mortality and morbidity suggest it is.

145
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:50.910
For example,

146
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.360
one of the worst possible complications of pregnancy.

147
00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.790
It leads to high rates of miscarriage to maternal death through hemorrhaging and

148
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:09.511
severe anemia and all of the sequella that follow from severe low birth rate.

149
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.660
Malaria also can be transmitted vertically that is transplacentally from mother

150
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:25.021
to fetus and can lead to the birth of infants who are congenitally infected.

151
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.610
We also need to remember that it will say in a moment that malaria is a major

152
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:38.080
immunosuppressive disease and its victims therefore,

153
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.580
are highly susceptible to other opportunistic infections,

154
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:47.170
especially respiratory infections,
tuberculosis,

155
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.180
influenza,
pneumonia.

156
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:55.290
In those areas of the tropical world where malaria is hyper endemic and

157
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:58.810
transmission continues throughout the year,

158
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.200
the population at risk can be infected,

159
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.220
reinfected and super infected every single year.

160
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:10.540
If the victims of malaria survive,

161
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.260
they possess a painfully acquired immunity,

162
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.950
but it comes at a terrible price because repeated bouts of malaria lead to

163
00:13:21.371 --> 00:13:25.540
severe neurological deficits and cognitive impairment.

164
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:30.760
The results are ineradicable,
poverty,

165
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:34.870
illiteracy and compromised economic growth,

166
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.760
a stunted development of civil society and political instability.

167
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.280
We'll be talking in a moment about Ronald Ross,

168
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.120
who was the Nobel laureate who was one of two people who discovered the mosquito

169
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:55.390
theory of transmission for disease.

170
00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:01.000
And he wrote quite movingly that those malaria doesn't,

171
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.090
in areas where malaria is prevalent,

172
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.600
those it doesn't kill it.

173
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.980
Enslaves malaria.
In other words,

174
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:17.040
in our present world as a major contributor to inequalities between north and

175
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:22.981
south and to the economic and political international dependency of Third World

176
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:29.170
countries and the tropical world.
Well,

177
00:14:29.171 --> 00:14:34.171
let's talk about the malaria also will be of interest to us because it's an

178
00:14:36.161 --> 00:14:39.430
extremely complex disease.

179
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:44.850
And so we need to spend a little bit of time talking about how it's transmitted

180
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:51.090
and about its effects on the human body in order after that to talk about how,

181
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:57.740
uh,
the discoveries that led to,
it's our understanding of it.

182
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.800
And to the impact on society and on history.

183
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.520
Well,
until the end of the 19th century,

184
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.180
malaria was thought to be explained by a theory that you already know by Miasma

185
00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:16.940
tourism.
In other words,

186
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.630
malaria was a form of bad air.
In fact,

187
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:25.631
that's what the word means from the Italian mollay bad and audio air.

188
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:31.510
So malaria was bad air that somehow a susceptible person inhaled and it caught

189
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:39.040
in his or her body or it was absorbed perhaps through the pores of the skin and

190
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:45.110
led in susceptible people to this terrible fever.

191
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.930
It was also sometimes called Paulo [inaudible] from uh,

192
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.150
the word for swamp.
So it was swamp fever.

193
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.750
So the disease then was absorbed or breathed in in some way.

194
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.630
In fact,
malaria isn't one disease,

195
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.650
it's a family of four different diseases caused by a parasite with an extremely

196
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.220
complex life cycle.

197
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.520
The parasite is known as the plasmodium and there are four species of plasmodium

198
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.040
that cause human malaria.

199
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.860
And I have them on your handout there,
plasmodium falciparum,

200
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.690
plasmodium vivax,
plasmodium Velodea,

201
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:40.460
and plasmodium of all.
Then for the purposes here,

202
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.250
the first to plasmodium falciparum,

203
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.520
plasmodium vivax are the most important medically and historically

204
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.510
and the ones we'll be talking about mostly now,

205
00:16:55.511 --> 00:17:00.511
the plasmodium differ fundamentally from the other microbial pathogens we've

206
00:17:02.261 --> 00:17:06.700
examined so far in the course bacteria for example,

207
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:11.760
and viruses and that they're much more complex lifeforms with complex life

208
00:17:12.911 --> 00:17:15.970
cycles that we need to unravel.

209
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:21.930
Plasmodium were discovered in 1884 by our phones.

210
00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:22.894
Love it all.

211
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.983
<v 1>MMM.</v>

212
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:30.370
<v 0>There he is.
A French army doctor working in Algeria.</v>

213
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:36.870
It turns out that the plasmodium don't exist free in the environment at any

214
00:17:39.101 --> 00:17:40.840
stage of their lives.

215
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.890
Instead they're adopted to live either in the body of human beings or in the gut

216
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.720
of certain species of mosquitoes.

217
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.193
<v 1>And</v>

218
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.820
<v 0>there we are.
Um,
this is an,</v>

219
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.590
an awfully Miskito um,

220
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.440
having doing its thing that is to say,
uh,
having a blood meal,

221
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:18.580
which is the way that malaria is transmitted from person to person.

222
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.950
The plasmodium this again,
in a more schematic way,
um,

223
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:31.030
it gets the point across about the relationship of human beings and the mosquito

224
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:36.610
plus Modia migrate in the body of the insect.

225
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:41.270
To the salivary glands in the biting apparatus.

226
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.900
So abiding mosquito like this one is an effect and extremely efficient vector.

227
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:56.080
It's sometimes referred to as a flying syringe because what it does the mosquito

228
00:18:57.711 --> 00:19:02.711
does is to inoculate the plasma Modia directly into the bloodstream of the host.

229
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.480
At this stage,

230
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:12.980
the parasite will move to look at what happens next.

231
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.000
The first thing we have is the mosquito,
uh,

232
00:19:17.001 --> 00:19:18.590
taking a blood meal

233
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:25.010
and inoculating the plows Modia directly into the bloodstream of the unfortunate

234
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.610
victim.
At that stage in here,

235
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.670
we'll see one of the points about the plasma Modia is that it undergoes a series

236
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:42.981
of morphological changes and becoming distinct stages in the life in its life,

237
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.720
both in the human body and in the body of the insect.

238
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:55.220
Initially when it's injected,
it's known as a sport zone,
right?

239
00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.560
And what it does next is it migrates after just a few hours after inoculation.

240
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.190
Say you were bitten,
uh,
right now,

241
00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:08.340
within a few hours,
uh,

242
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:13.370
the plebs Modia in your bloodstream would have migrated to your liver.

243
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.520
And this begins the incubation period in which the plasmodium reproduces.

244
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:27.860
That is a sexually in the liver and uh,

245
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.080
you'll see it's reproduction.

246
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.280
And then after a number of,
uh,

247
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.860
just a number of days or weeks,

248
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.410
it's released again now in a new phase,

249
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:48.520
this time known as a marazonal right into the bloodstream.

250
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.610
So returns at that point to the bloodstream.

251
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.760
One of the points of the migration to the liver is not when it's in the liver,

252
00:20:58.151 --> 00:21:02.500
it's safely beyond the detection of the human immune system.

253
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.950
And so it reproduces safely in the liver and then emerges on much more numerous

254
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.250
into the bloodstream and a new phase in its life cycle.

255
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.700
So at this point in the bloodstream,

256
00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.560
what happens is that the mirror is white,

257
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.740
such what they're now called the new name of the parasite for that phase.

258
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.620
It enters into,

259
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.710
it attaches itself to and enters into red blood cells or erythrocytes.

260
00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:39.850
<v 1>Okay?</v>

261
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.990
<v 0>Once safely in side,
the red blood cell,</v>

262
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.560
again,
it's not detected by the immune system,

263
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.710
it reproduces asexually

264
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:57.150
and you can see it doing so until at a certain point it has destroyed the red

265
00:21:58.211 --> 00:22:03.211
blood cell and ruptures the red blood cell and the parasites return.

266
00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:07.830
Once again to the bloodstream.
I have,
uh,

267
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.190
this is a picture,
these are of,
uh,
the,
uh,

268
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:17.270
by electron microscope of the actual rupturing of red blood cells and the

269
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:23.710
emergence once again of the parasites that have just reproduced,

270
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.370
uh,

271
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:29.370
returning to the open bloodstream at that point.

272
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.900
Um,
the much more numerous mirrors,

273
00:22:34.901 --> 00:22:39.901
the lights keep repeating this process of invading red cells,

274
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.410
reproducing,
destroying the red blood cells,

275
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.920
and then bursting them at periodic intervals.

276
00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.760
The interval of time that it takes is determined by the species of plasmodium

277
00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.600
for Plasmodium Falciparum and Vyvanse acts,

278
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.820
it's every 48 hours.
And so,
um,

279
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:07.460
for plasmodium Malariae,

280
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.810
it's every 72 hours.
Now,

281
00:23:11.811 --> 00:23:16.340
eventually among the brood of mirrors,

282
00:23:16.341 --> 00:23:21.250
no whites that is,
let's see again,

283
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.270
um,

284
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:27.270
after it's gone through a number of cycles they produce among their offspring.

285
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:31.870
<v 1>Okay,</v>

286
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.150
<v 0>what are called to new,</v>

287
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:39.210
morphologically different stage in the lifecycle.

288
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:44.910
And that is gametocytes that are male and female and these are in the open

289
00:23:46.551 --> 00:23:49.310
bloodstream.
And then the next,

290
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:54.080
an awful lean mosquito that takes a blood meal as it does.

291
00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:59.081
So it sucks up the male and female gametocytes that reproduce sexually.

292
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:07.181
This time we see them here in the God and the body of the female mosquito.

293
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
And then that begins the phase of life in the body of the mosquito,

294
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:22.030
where once again we find it reproduces and eventually it leads to the production

295
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.080
of sporozoites that migrate once again to the biting apparatus,

296
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.370
the salivary glands of the mosquito,
the mosquito again,

297
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.230
texts and ineffective by,

298
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.160
and then it's next blood meal and the whole cycle.

299
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:45.250
This complex cycle of both asexual reproduction in the body of men and sexual

300
00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:51.360
reproduction in the body of the mosquito,

301
00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:56.280
the cycle is then complete.
No,

302
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:02.520
let's return for a second to,
uh,

303
00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:07.560
the plasmodium and to the insect.
And,
uh,

304
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:12.240
let me just deal with the fact that in order,

305
00:25:12.241 --> 00:25:14.280
the reason that the female,

306
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:18.840
and it's only female unlawful liens that,
um,

307
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:22.230
take blood meals on human beings.

308
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:25.260
And the reason that the female,

309
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:30.280
an awful lean does that is that it needs blood in order to mature it's eggs and

310
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.810
to lay them having taken a blood meal,

311
00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.510
it's then able to,

312
00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:43.290
she's able to mature her eggs and at that point,

313
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:47.160
um,
lays them and water.

314
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.810
And they pass through the cycle of Larva poop pay.

315
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.970
And then the adult Oskido known as an amalgam,

316
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.140
know what happens at that point.

317
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.800
It takes about a week for the eggs to develop as large a pool pie and then adult

318
00:26:05.561 --> 00:26:06.730
mosquitoes.

319
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.600
And then the mosquito is ready to take flight and to visit you and me.

320
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.980
Now from the breeding site to the blood meal,

321
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.110
the anomalies,

322
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.880
mosquitoes have delicate wings under normally week flyers.

323
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:30.270
So normally she flies about no more than three kilometers or so from her

324
00:26:30.791 --> 00:26:31.700
birthplace.

325
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:37.380
Most species of an awful Lee's avoid sunlight that dries up their wings and they

326
00:26:39.311 --> 00:26:43.150
avoid strong winds.
But as they take,

327
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.870
they're able to orient themselves to places of human settlement.

328
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:49.891
Why?

329
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:54.891
Because on their antenna there are sensors that are highly stimulated by a

330
00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:01.290
carbon dioxide in the air.

331
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.710
And so,
um,
this,

332
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.740
the carbon dioxide plume arising from human settlements and human bodies enables

333
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.910
the mosquitoes to be attracted to them having arrived at closer range.

334
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.280
The mosquitoes then detect with other sensors,

335
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.830
odors emanating from sweat.

336
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.470
They're also attracted by light and then it close range.

337
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.620
They finally use their vision to settle on the site of the body most suitable

338
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:43.070
for their feast and human beings cooperate in this enterprise and not an awfully

339
00:27:45.141 --> 00:27:50.141
lean mosquitoes feast between dusk and dawn and they thereby attack sleeping

340
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:55.710
bodies,
lying mostly motionless.

341
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.700
Now when you hear the buzz of the harmless culex mosquito that buzzes noisily

342
00:28:03.331 --> 00:28:06.030
around you and attracts your attention,

343
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:11.420
you can be happy because most an awful liens that transmit malaria are silent

344
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.350
and therefore don't disturb their hosts.

345
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.710
Now you're probably wondering

346
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.920
how is it that transmissions maintained if a fee,

347
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.510
most the vast majority of mosquitoes don't transmit malaria,

348
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.070
only the females of certain species of an often liens,

349
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.580
and I've included two on your handout as being most important to us.

350
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.570
Anopheles Gambiae,

351
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:48.290
which would be my candidate for the most deadly insect for human beings on our

352
00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:54.171
planet and a [inaudible] which had was one of the most important vectors of

353
00:28:57.211 --> 00:29:00.450
malaria in Europe and in parts of Africa.

354
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:06.170
Or you're probably wondering if a female anopheles mosquito lives on average

355
00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:11.901
just a few weeks and needs to be infected herself before transmitting the

356
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:16.290
disease.
How can transmission be maintained?

357
00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.320
There's a couple of facts that we need to remember.

358
00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:24.380
First is the vast numbers of mosquitoes involved in areas where malaria is

359
00:29:26.011 --> 00:29:31.011
endemic in most areas of high end emissivity no more than 2% or so of female

360
00:29:34.201 --> 00:29:39.050
mosquitoes are infected at any given time,
but on average,

361
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:43.420
a human being can be thousands of times in a year.

362
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.980
And it's also true that an insect like an awful Lee's gone ba is famished and

363
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:53.560
doesn't feed a single time.

364
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:58.950
But having entered a place of human settlement feasts repeatedly moving from one

365
00:30:00.281 --> 00:30:01.900
body to another,

366
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:07.230
thereby ensuring that crowded conditions in crowded conditions,

367
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:12.510
one malarial patient is a major source of danger to all of those around him or

368
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:17.380
her.
Well,

369
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:20.680
that's the story from the standpoint of the mosquito.

370
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.130
What happens to the human victim?

371
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.580
What are the symptoms of malaria?

372
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.700
How does the disease have its impact on the human body?

373
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:37.870
Well,
after the incubation period,

374
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:43.950
symptoms begin when the plasmodium have achieved a critical threshold number in

375
00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:47.710
the bloodstream,

376
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.360
and it's then that the classical symptoms of malaria begin with their onset.

377
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:02.020
Now,
uh,
let's remember,
return to our

378
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.520
diagram.
The,

379
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.970
this process of reproduction of entering that is to say the,

380
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.290
um,
parasite enters the blood cell,

381
00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.430
reproduces,

382
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.640
bursts the blood cell and returns to the bloodstream occurs simultaneously for

383
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:31.480
an entire brood throughout the bloodstream.
And in other words,
the,

384
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:34.930
this is happening at the same time throughout the body.

385
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.500
And it's when the,

386
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.560
there are sufficient numbers of the parasite in the open bloodstream that the

387
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:49.171
immune system of the body can detect the parasite and it's then that symptoms

388
00:31:50.171 --> 00:31:54.130
begin
the,
uh,

389
00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:58.390
term for malaria.
Also,
it has many names.
This disease,

390
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.270
it was often called intermittent fever.

391
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:06.940
This process of synchronicity was known as gold.
Geez.

392
00:32:06.941 --> 00:32:11.590
Law after the malaria ologists Camilo Golgi who discovered it,

393
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.630
and he talked about the different timings of fever,

394
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:21.620
Turshen fever.
That is to say every,
um,

395
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:26.670
48 hours or quartan fever every 72 hours or quotidian feared fever.

396
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:33.750
You can also have a about of intense fever every 24 hours.

397
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.710
And that means that you have more than one species of plasmodium in your

398
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:42.440
bloodstream.
You don't have to choose just one.

399
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.310
You can have several species and several,
um,
uh,

400
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.350
types in your bloodstream at once.
If that occurs,

401
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:55.970
you can have a fever,
intermittent fever every 24 hours.

402
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.150
So the recurring classic symptoms.
Then ours,

403
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.200
this intermittent fever recurring at regular intervals,

404
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.320
like a train schedule,
so you have recurring power,

405
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:14.321
sexisms of high temperature plus chills for few sweating,

406
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.300
headache,
general malaise,

407
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.610
exhaustion,
and with it often nausea,

408
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.340
vomiting and diarrhea.

409
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:34.300
The precise symptoms depend on the species of plasmodium and the most very Olin

410
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:38.210
is plasmodium falciparum,

411
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:44.110
which causes the most frequent life threatening complications and plasmodium

412
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.850
malaria and DoVall lay are the most mild.

413
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:56.770
You see that by entering the red and attacking red blood cells,

414
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:04.060
the parasite initiate a cascade of consequences.

415
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:12.100
The red cells can become mush shapen and they adhere to one another in clumps,

416
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.500
thereby causing blockages and bud cells,

417
00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.860
blood vessels that can be rapidly fatal depending on the organ that's affected.

418
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.880
A frequent cause of mortality is cerebral malaria in which there are blockages

419
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.093
in the brain,

420
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.430
but the heart can also be affected or the gastrointestinal system.

421
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.960
And if malaria attacks the gastrointestinal in particular,

422
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.200
it mimics the symptoms of Asiatic cholera,

423
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
destruction of the red blood cells also as a cause of profound anemia.

424
00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:02.600
Another important symptom of the disease is um,

425
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.660
and this is a child who's a malaria patient and what you see as a painful and

426
00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:12.270
pronounced swelling of the spleen.
Ah,

427
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.300
this looks one of the classic signs of malarial infection,

428
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:22.070
as I've said.
Also,
malaria is a terrible,

429
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:27.250
and it's affects on pregnant women leading to hemorrhaging and miscarriage and

430
00:35:28.971 --> 00:35:33.920
also to congenital malaria with infants born with the disease.

431
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.700
Malaria also is a disease that's a major immunosuppress suppressive disease.

432
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:47.870
It suppresses the immune system of the body and therefore gives rights to

433
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:52.920
complications,
especially respiratory diseases,

434
00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:57.630
as I mentioned earlier,
pneumonia influence on tuberculosis.

435
00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.720
So we should say that the tuberculosis emergency in the present day and the

436
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:09.921
malaria emergency are interlocking and interrelated that malaria provides the

437
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:17.121
substratum for rampaging reemerging tuberculosis.

438
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.920
I also said that recurring bouts of malaria lead to neurological damage and in

439
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:33.141
the worst cases to estate known as Kikexia and which your person is

440
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:42.890
indifferent to his or her surroundings as unable to learn to be productive,

441
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.130
to take part and civil society.

442
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:53.460
Now another feature of malaria is that it can lead to relapses.

443
00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.160
That is with plasmodium vivax.

444
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.280
You remember that after the plasmodium is injected into the bloodstream,

445
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.160
it migrates to the liver.
Well,

446
00:37:05.161 --> 00:37:10.161
in plasmodium vivax the parasite does emerge but not all of the parasites.

447
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:17.990
They continue to Nussle in the liver and they're beyond the detection of the

448
00:37:19.711 --> 00:37:24.711
immune system and they can then even after the patient thinks that he or she has

449
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:26.640
recovered,

450
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.180
there can be a relapse when the plasmodium parasites reemerge from the liver

451
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:34.620
into the bloodstream.

452
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:39.680
This can be months later or even years later after the initial infection.

453
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.010
Immunity that is,
AH,

454
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:50.060
once you've had lots of bouts of malaria and you survive,

455
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:55.290
you develop a partial immunity and acquired immunity,

456
00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.440
but it is short term and it's also at considerable cost in terms of neurological

457
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:09.000
damage to the body.
Well,

458
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.240
the impact on society,
as you can imagine,

459
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.020
is severe and we'll be talking about that next time,

460
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.970
but it leads this disease.

461
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:23.120
You can the symptoms listing the symptoms helps us to understand that someone

462
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:26.160
like this as an adult who's anemic,

463
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.610
who has perhaps respiratory diseases,

464
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:34.730
moves painfully and slowly and is therefore not a productive worker and

465
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:37.990
agriculture or an industry.

466
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.880
So malaria leads to backward systems of cultivation,

467
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.260
low productivity and lack of investment in agriculture.

468
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:52.950
It leads to the desertion of hold of some of the most fertile areas,

469
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:59.040
land because it's particularly dangerous and known to be some.

470
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.430
It leads then to poverty,
to illiteracy,

471
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:09.090
and indeed malaria and poverty are mutually reinforcing and a kind of vicious

472
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:12.220
downward spiral.

473
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.000
Poverty makes people vulnerable to the disease.

474
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.500
Poverty that is,

475
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:22.060
makes people vulnerable because it causes them to live in poor housing,

476
00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.720
overcrowded housing,
housing,
that's volume,

477
00:39:25.721 --> 00:39:29.380
the porous and vulnerable to flying insects.

478
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:36.180
It also leads to them to occupational hazards and having to work in areas where

479
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:42.700
the disease is prevalent.
It leads to poor diet,

480
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:47.880
which makes people more vulnerable to inadequate clothing,

481
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.370
which makes them more vulnerable to biting insects.

482
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:55.750
But Malaria and turn then leads to for further poverty,

483
00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:01.680
the burden of looking after the ill that falls on families and communities,

484
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.400
low productivity,
low wages,
limited education.

485
00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.520
This was what Ross meant when he says those malaria doesn't kill it in slaves.

486
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.490
Well,

487
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.490
when was the mosquito theory of transmission unraveled and how so?

488
00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:28.260
The idea that mosquitoes were involved in this disease wasn't at all obvious.

489
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.160
It wasn't obvious because well,
first of all,

490
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:38.161
scientists and physicians knew that there are lots of places where there are

491
00:40:38.381 --> 00:40:42.940
gazillions of mosquitoes and no malaria.

492
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.990
It was also clear that mosquitoes,

493
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.080
there was no clear correlation between bitten being bitten by mosquitoes and

494
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.580
developing the disease.

495
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:59.970
And so the dominant theory in the 19th century was of Miasma TISM as the cause

496
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:08.570
of the disease,
the unraveling of the disease.
Uh,

497
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.890
you'll remember this man,
Patrick Manson,

498
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.650
the father of tropical medicine.

499
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:20.370
He was also one of the figures who is most closely associated in the development

500
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:26.910
of tropical medicine and of the mosquito theory of transmission,

501
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:31.480
which he discovered for a different disease called full area.

502
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.170
And then he had the idea that perhaps if malaria can be transmitted by

503
00:41:36.171 --> 00:41:37.004
mosquitoes,

504
00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:42.100
possibly malaria could as well and suing get joined forces he worked Manson for

505
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:47.600
in London.

506
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.900
This is Ronald Ross who was a British military physician working in India.

507
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:01.300
Now India was a tremendously important place in terms of malaria.

508
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:02.204
Let me just,

509
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:07.300
there was a book that you might be interested in and that I would recommend to

510
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:08.900
those of you who are,

511
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:14.020
which is the correspondence between Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson that led them

512
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.120
to the discovery of the mosquito theory of transmission.

513
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.810
Now Mount Ross worked in India and he noted that,

514
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:27.440
uh,

515
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:32.440
malaria amongst the general population of India in the 1890s led to 5 million

516
00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:37.330
deaths.
Um,

517
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:42.610
and he said that it was the greatest problem of public health in India.

518
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:45.320
I think on the whole,

519
00:42:45.321 --> 00:42:49.550
he wrote that of the Indian population of 400 million,

520
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:54.730
it causes directly or indirectly 10,000 deaths a day and depart from this amount

521
00:42:57.381 --> 00:43:00.530
of sickness,
malaria is of all diseases,

522
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.780
the most important and political,

523
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:07.810
agricultural and military affairs he wrote since it renders large tracks of

524
00:43:09.171 --> 00:43:13.430
fertile land,
uninhabitable impedes cultivation,

525
00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:18.640
planting and public works and is the most very vicious enemy that armies in the

526
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:24.050
field have to contend against.
On the whole,

527
00:43:24.051 --> 00:43:29.051
I think we're justified in claiming that the malaria question is as important as

528
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:34.730
famine or boob.
Onic Plagge
well,

529
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:39.230
in India,
what Ross and Manson did was to discover,

530
00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:40.400
let's go back to

531
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.880
picture of the life cycle of malaria.
Um,

532
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.920
they traced through microscopy,

533
00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:58.280
the we're able to detect in the body of the mosquito after it had bitten.

534
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:04.170
Uh,
and they did experiments in which they are among not human beings,

535
00:44:04.171 --> 00:44:05.310
but birds.

536
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:10.550
And they discovered that it was possible to detect the plasmodium responsible

537
00:44:11.881 --> 00:44:16.320
for avian malaria under the microscope in the body of the mosquito.

538
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.800
That was a first major insight that the mosquito was in some way implicated.

539
00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.160
But then they went further and they followed the process by which the,

540
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.030
uh,

541
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:35.030
it changed various phases in the body of the insect and reproduce.

542
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:40.880
And they traced the f the migration of the pliers parasite to the biting

543
00:44:42.601 --> 00:44:44.850
apparatus of the mosquito.

544
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:50.480
And then they were able to take healthy birds and have mosquitoes who were known

545
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:57.111
to be infected feast on them and to produce malaria experimentally on birds.

546
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:04.020
And so in 1898 if you were reading this correspondence,

547
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:07.630
there's a Eureka moment in which,
um,

548
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:12.740
Ross announces that he's discovered the mosquito theory of transmission and

549
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:14.550
proved it,

550
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.560
and he claims that he feels like captain cook the explorer,

551
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.760
or possibly like Napoleon.
Um,

552
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:28.710
and he was not,
however,
a naturalist and he didn't know,

553
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:33.630
he didn't know about the speciation of mosquitoes and the mosquitoes he

554
00:45:33.631 --> 00:45:34.680
described,

555
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:39.270
he described as dappled brindles or light brown.

556
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.380
He didn't know about species of an awful least mosquitoes.

557
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.800
And it's at this point that we should mention then a second major figure.

558
00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:53.550
Oops.
Uh,
anyway,
we'll see.
It doesn't matter.
Uh,

559
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:58.080
Giovanni Battista Ghidossi who was,
uh,

560
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:03.110
the next figure in the development of the mosquito theory of transmission.

561
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:08.580
And he does so for human beings.
Um,

562
00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:13.700
and what he does is he discovers that it's possible,

563
00:46:14.010 --> 00:46:16.290
uh,
and a place called Cappaccio.

564
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.740
He takes railroad workers in the midst of a major malaria epidemic in the summer

565
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:27.890
and he introduces one variable in their lives from a control group of railroad

566
00:46:29.011 --> 00:46:31.620
workers and the surrounding peasant tree.

567
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:36.770
And that is that one group he has living at from dusk until dawn in well

568
00:46:39.451 --> 00:46:43.230
screened houses.
And this difference,

569
00:46:43.231 --> 00:46:47.790
protecting them from the one factor which is a from miss,

570
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:52.820
the bikes of mosquitoes prevents there being a contracting malaria.

571
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.400
This was one place in which he did that.

572
00:46:56.550 --> 00:47:01.200
And then he also did the,
uh,
a different experiment,

573
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.140
which was to use Quinine,
which,
uh,

574
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.120
kills malaria parasites in the open bloodstream.

575
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:14.270
He gave it prophylactically to a series of workers as a control group in a place

576
00:47:15.871 --> 00:47:19.110
like Australia during the summer malaria season,

577
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:24.230
and found that he could protect them as well from malaria by caping establishing

578
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.460
a chemical barrier between the mosquitoes and human beings.

579
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:35.970
And then he took the further step of actually taking mosquitoes who are known to

580
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:41.971
a feasted on people ill of malaria and took them to a hospital in Rome,

581
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:48.120
known as the Santo Spitty to hospital where he had a volunteer on the second

582
00:47:48.581 --> 00:47:51.250
floor who was,
uh,

583
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:56.310
in a room where at night they released hundreds of intentionally infected

584
00:47:57.911 --> 00:47:58.900
mosquitoes.

585
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:04.170
And a couple of weeks later they had their Eureka moment when,

586
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.200
uh,
he had a spike and a temperature of 104.

587
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.320
And they knew that they had successfully transmitted malaria by human

588
00:48:13.361 --> 00:48:18.361
experimentation to someone who had been healthy until mosquitoes infected with

589
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:23.890
the disease had been allowed to feast upon him.
So,

590
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.640
uh,

591
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.640
this is then by happens between 1898 and 1901.

592
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:35.730
And this then is a powerful factor in the development of tropical medicine,

593
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:42.180
but it also leads to programs to combat malaria having discovered the pathogen

594
00:48:44.591 --> 00:48:45.940
responsible to it,

595
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:50.970
the plasma Modia and the vector female anopheles mosquitoes.

596
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.880
We see the development of public health programs to destroy the disease either

597
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:02.730
by attacking the plasmodium with,
um,

598
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.800
chemical therapy that is through quinine or by killing mosquitoes.

599
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:10.150
That is vector control,

600
00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.680
the idea of possibly being able to eradicate malaria.

601
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:15.790
And next time,

602
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.820
what I'd like to do is to follow the practical application then of the

603
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:23.440
discoveries we've talked about today,

604
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:28.680
about the lifecycle of plasmodium and have an awfully mosquitoes and see how

605
00:49:29.471 --> 00:49:33.400
that leads to the development of public health strategies.

606
00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:38.520
And I'd like to talk about how those strategies are being used in the real world

607
00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:43.210
today to combat this crisis of this dreadful,

608
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.990
um,
vector born disease.
