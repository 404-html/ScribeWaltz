1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.350
Okay.
Well good morning and we can get underway.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.890
So far as you know,

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.270
we've dealt with two major epidemic diseases,

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.660
plague and small pox and we'll be examining quite a number of more beginning

5
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:23.010
next time with Asiatic cholera.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.250
But our course,
as you remember,

7
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:31.251
I explained in the beginning isn't simply one epidemic disease after another.

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.760
There are also other themes that are very important to us.

9
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.330
One of those is already taking shape,
I hope,
uh,

10
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.940
in your minds and in your section discussions.

11
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.020
And that is the history of public health strategies.

12
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.980
That is ways in which society's organized to defend themselves against the

13
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:01.950
incursions that we're discussing.

14
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.150
And we've noted the first form of public health,

15
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:11.151
which consisted of those draconian plague measures and we'll see that they

16
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:15.570
aren't confined only to bubonic plague,

17
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.810
but there'll be cropping up again and again,
uh,

18
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.020
in the course of our our lectures.

19
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.980
And you've also seen that smallpox broad about a second major style of public

20
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:32.880
health and not as vaccination.

21
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
And clearly we'll be returning to that as well.

22
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.500
So public health is a major theme of our class.

23
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.310
And a third major theme is also crucial and that's the history of ideas and

24
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.040
especially medical ideas.

25
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So we were examining one way of thinking about the course might be as an

26
00:01:56.701 --> 00:02:01.701
examination of the career of what might be called scientific medicine from

27
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:08.211
humorless them through several subsequent incarnations down to the modern

28
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:11.610
biomedical paradigm.

29
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.720
In later weeks we'll be looking at the germ theory of disease at the debate

30
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.750
about contagion,
aneurysm and anti contagion ism.

31
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.110
We'll be looking at the idea of Sa Tropical medicine as a concept and its

32
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:29.280
implications.

33
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.420
But this morning I want to take another step by looking at a very crucial moment

34
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.100
in the development of modern medicine that took place,

35
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.130
this development between the French revolution and the middle of the 19th

36
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:50.004
century.

37
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.310
And it occurred in Paris and is universally known as the Paris School of

38
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.443
medicine.

39
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.720
This is a development that was so important that sometimes it's referred to

40
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:08.491
maybe just a shade glibly as the moment of transition from medieval medicine to

41
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.030
modernity.

42
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.560
So our plan this morning is to look at this,

43
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.400
um,

44
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.400
through first understanding major new developments that were a series of shocks

45
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.870
to the old humoral system of Hippocrates and Galen.

46
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.120
We'll see firstly,
some crises there.

47
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.810
The second thing we'll need to do is to look at positive precursors to the

48
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:50.200
developments of Paris.
As is so often the case,

49
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.350
it's misleading to think of the Paris school as suddenly appearing out of

50
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:56.170
nowhere.

51
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.170
It had its bases intellectually and institutionally in a series of prior

52
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:07.480
developments.
Those were preconditions that made it possible.

53
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.350
Then we'll look at what actually happened in Paris roughly in the period 1794 to

54
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.300
1848,

55
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.640
the establishment of a new concept,

56
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.240
a new embodiment of scientific medicine.

57
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.341
And the,

58
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:32.341
this is a step that laid the preconditions for the germ theory that came later

59
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.690
in the century for reasons we'll be discussing.

60
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.760
And then the last thing we'll do this morning is to look at the achievements,

61
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.810
but also the limitations of what happened in Paris.

62
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.150
Now in our career in scientific medicine,

63
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.040
we've noted the first embodiment in antiquity.

64
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.570
Uh,

65
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.570
we've talked a bit about Hippocrates and his establishment of the importance of

66
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:11.371
naturalistic causes of disease instead of magic explanations.

67
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.010
The rejection,
if you like,

68
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.070
of religious or demonic interpretations of disease and Hippocrates,

69
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:26.041
his hands disease was clearly a natural phenomenon with naturalistic causes.

70
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.920
We should remember that this had an importance for medical epistemology.

71
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:40.120
By epistemology,
I mean,
uh,

72
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:44.230
what do we know and how can we know it?
What are its,

73
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:48.580
what's the basis of knowledge?
What are its sources?

74
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.690
And we know that Hippocrates and his corpus of writings as stylish or embodied a

75
00:05:56.441 --> 00:06:01.441
medical epistemology that held the knowledge in matters of healing is derived

76
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:07.790
from direct observation at the individual patient's bedside.

77
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.180
It's therefore often referred to as this first incarnation of a scientific

78
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.740
medicine as bedside medicine.
The locusts,

79
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.770
the source of knowledge is at the bedside through empirical observation.

80
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.670
We know too that this had as a corollary and educational program that how do you

81
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:37.550
learn medicine?

82
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.850
You do so by apprenticeship to doctors on their rounds to the domestic bedside

83
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.300
where the essential task was to observe.

84
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.380
Then we saw another development in scientific medicine and this was in the form

85
00:06:57.481 --> 00:06:58.800
of Galen aneurysm.

86
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:05.720
This is to say that humor realism in Galen writings was primarily concerned with

87
00:07:09.601 --> 00:07:11.220
the ancient texts,

88
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.200
texts that Galen considered essentially infallible.

89
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.190
They were to be enhanced and he thought that he was the person ideally suited to

90
00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:28.500
do that work,
but they could never be overthrown.

91
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:33.890
There was no possibility of a conceptual paradigm shift or conceptual

92
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:38.490
revolution.

93
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.460
<v 0>This was what was called library medicine.</v>

95
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.730
In other words,
for Galen,

96
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.200
there was a new understanding of medical epistemology.

97
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.950
Knowledge was derived from considering the ancients from a careful study of

98
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.780
their techs,
so it's textual lead based medicine,

99
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.200
and it had of course an educational corollary and indeed until 1794 in France

100
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:12.140
for example,

101
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:17.560
you call education consisted primarily of lectures on the classics delivered in

102
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:24.491
Lawton and have a program of reading the ancients in the original languages.

103
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.840
This was library Madison?
No,

104
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.850
the whole humeral system as we've been looking at it underwent a series of

105
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.910
shocks and intellectual criticisms.

106
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:50.060
It didn't seem to fit all of the evidence that emerged.

107
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.740
Let's look at a couple of these shocks to the humeral system.

108
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.000
One we've already mentioned,

109
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.180
and that was the great work of William Harvey and the circulation of the blood.

110
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.820
Now this meant Harvey's work,
uh,

111
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:12.000
although he didn't take the step of rejecting Galen aneurysm.
Nonetheless,

112
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.270
it's true that his work undermined,

113
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.360
uh,

114
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.360
gain Lynn's anatomy and it undermined humoral physiology.

115
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.760
So this was ultimately than Harvey's discoveries were incompatible with the

116
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.860
medical thinking,
uh,
of his time.

117
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.540
We've mentioned also that the chemical revolution,

118
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.320
the work of people like lawful ICA was extremely important and it was important

119
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:52.610
and undermining humoral alyssum because you know that the humoral a approach was

120
00:09:55.741 --> 00:10:00.741
based on a theory of the four elements or the four humors.

121
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.210
Um,
essentially on Aristotelian,
uh,

122
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.680
natural philosophy.
Chemistry,
however,

123
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.880
undermined the humoral elements,

124
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.500
the four elements,

125
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:21.210
and began to replace them with a whole lead,
different,

126
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.880
uh,
set leading ultimately to the periodic table.

127
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.940
So the whole basis of the four elements comes to be undermined by the chemical

128
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:34.050
revolution.

129
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.630
And indeed there is a uh,

130
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.360
development of what's called [inaudible] chemistry,

131
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.840
which is the view that health is the balance of chemicals in the body and that

132
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:53.001
healing consists primarily of finding the right chemical to correct the

133
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.690
imbalance.

134
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.930
So medicine in this view becomes reduced more to chemistry.

135
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:06.020
An important figure in this is Paracelsus who lived from 1493 to 1541,

136
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.960
and was known as the Martin Luther of medicine,

137
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.940
a Swiss healer,
and to rebel against Galen aneurysm.

138
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.770
Indeed,
he burned.

139
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.800
He boasted that he himself had burned the masters texts.

140
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.540
He was a leading figure in the development of yachts,
row chemistry,

141
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.780
which was particularly strong in the low countries.

142
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.220
He introduced a number of chemicals to medical science such as zinc and Louden,

143
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.200
them,
uh,
or opium.

144
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.280
Another shock to the system,
of course,

145
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.300
was the spirit behind the scientific revolution.

146
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.720
The Scientific Revolution was empirical.

147
00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:02.190
It was a democratic process and it rejected the cult of authority.

148
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.210
Authority could be challenged by anyone's observed observations and

149
00:12:12.211 --> 00:12:13.260
measurements.

150
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

151
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:19.440
<v 0>And this was ultimately incompatible with Galen system of worship of the ancient</v>

152
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:23.500
texts.

153
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.260
Then there was the experience that we've been looking at the last couple of

154
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.670
weeks of epidemic diseases.

155
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.810
Epidemic Diseases created problems for humoral interpretations.

156
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:44.330
How was it that so many people in a single place and time had this marked

157
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.480
imbalance in their humerus

158
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.100
and there came to be alongside the galenic system,

159
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.050
the idea of contagion instead,

160
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:09.110
which was a non humeral idea indeed off Frauca storto develop this uh,

161
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.840
strongly and it gained a wide purchase in popular culture.

162
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:24.140
And the search came to be for some agent responsible for epidemics,

163
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.580
not humors,
but perhaps it chemical.

164
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:35.210
Even some people postulated that it might be a living thing of some kind.

165
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.780
So all of these were severe criticisms for the humeral system.

166
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.920
But although Galen Ism then,
uh,

167
00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.890
had these loose threads,
if we might say,
well,

168
00:13:56.891 --> 00:13:59.720
this,
we have four 17,
94,

169
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:04.670
no consensus arose around an alternative to replace it.

170
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:11.140
We might make a distinction between medical science also and medical practice.

171
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:12.651
Uh,

172
00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:17.651
that is the scientific basis of Galen aneurysm was eroding.

173
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:18.920
But,
uh,

174
00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:23.090
until indeed the late 19th century medical practice,

175
00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:27.980
what physicians actually did at the bedside remained traditional.

176
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.110
So we see critiques of Galen Ism abounding,

177
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.870
chipping away at its foundations,

178
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.200
but there was no new medical science that was robust enough to create a new

179
00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.910
medical practice.

180
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:53.000
Note also that when we talk about coming of the Paris school,

181
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.630
something that we,
a couple of things that we won't be pointing to.

182
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:03.190
This new revolution in medicine that occurred in Paris was not based on some new

183
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:08.660
development in the natural sciences.

184
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.000
It wasn't based on a technological breakthrough.

185
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.960
It wasn't based on some pathbreaking medical or scientific discovery.

186
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.980
So let's look now with that as the background.

187
00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.390
Uh,
this new incarnation of medical science,

188
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.520
the Paris School of medicine,

189
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:40.370
which was a conceptual revolution in the understanding of disease.

190
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.290
It marked to transformation in medical epistemology,

191
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.380
where is the source of medical knowledge and also in medical education.

192
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.100
And it led to a new position for the regular physician in society with new

193
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:02.591
claims to authority in competition with various competitors like homeopaths or

194
00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:07.640
members of various medical sex.

195
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.680
This new medicine comes to be called hospital medicine.

196
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.120
And there are a number of classic studies if you want to read further about it

197
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.520
than I thought you'll be glad to know aren't on the reading list,

198
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.710
which I'm not extending.
Uh,

199
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:28.670
but there are places that on a purely voluntary basis,

200
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.120
I hope that you'll be going to read more about it.

201
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.480
One is the work of Irwin ackerk net,

202
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.930
who's one of the founders of the modern discipline of the history of medicine.

203
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.870
And he wrote a work medicine and the Paris hospital or there's um,

204
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.820
my colleague here at Yale,
John Harley Warner,

205
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.910
who's written against the spirit of system,

206
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:00.820
which is a study in particular of um,

207
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:06.010
American physicians and students and their experiences as they made a medical

208
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:10.670
and intellectual pilgrimage to Paris.

209
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.450
Or there's a famous book,
um,

210
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:19.660
by Michelle foo call called the birth of the clinic.

211
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:25.090
And I will wish you luck with that particular work.

212
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:30.670
It's one of the classic studies that everyone refers to with regard to the Paris

213
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:34.250
school and its importance.

214
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.460
But let me just tell you anecdotally that I've read it while I think four times.

215
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.300
The first time I read it in French.

216
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:47.060
And thought there was something wrong with my French.

217
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.350
So I read it in English and decided there was something also wrong with my

218
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:53.590
English.
Um,

219
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.760
and then my third and fourth times I think I decided maybe there was something

220
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:00.800
wrong with Fuko,
but I'll,

221
00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:05.070
I'll leave that for you to judge and make your own decisions.
In any case,

222
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.130
it's one of the classics in the literature and it covers the ground we're

223
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:13.050
dealing with this morning.
Well,

224
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:17.190
what were the sources of this new medicine?

225
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:18.721
Uh,

226
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:23.721
first I would say there's an institutional basis that made it possible and that

227
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:31.401
is the hospital hospitals already existed but not as places of treatment so much

228
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:40.320
as safety nets or dumping grounds for the aged,

229
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.600
the incurable,
the orphaned,

230
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.700
the industrial revolution and urbanization,
however,

231
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.760
radically increased the numbers of patients and the hospitals were often

232
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:59.091
associated with philanthropy and the Church and powers the great center of

233
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:07.290
Western your urban center of culture and also became the locus for some of the

234
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:13.350
most famous hospitals in Europe,
the Otl Dhea,

235
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.700
the shot Italia,
and the PTA that we'll be seeing in a moment.
Um,

236
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.070
and so for a second,
and I think it's worth doing a little bit,
uh,

237
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.820
taking you for a moment on a bit of medical tourism.

238
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.940
Um,
and in doing so,

239
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:34.941
we'd go to the center of Paris here when we see the location of the hotel Dhea

240
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.140
hospital here in the middle of the sin on the yield Delacey tick.

241
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.610
The otl deer was perhaps the oldest hospital in the world.

242
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:56.930
It had a history of providing care on this very site ever since the seventh

243
00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:58.584
century.

244
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.500
And it was the largest general hospital in Paris.

245
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.050
And as you can see,
it's located at the very center of the city.

246
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.600
This is its architectural plan.

247
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.930
It was a very large structure by the end of the old regime in France,

248
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:27.290
it had four great wards that could accommodate 4,000 patients,

249
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.230
often a sleeping several to a single bed.

250
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.020
We can see another picture of it.

251
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:39.050
This is a picture of the entrance to the church and the hospital,

252
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:45.060
uh,
taken an 1871 at the time of the Paris commune.

253
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.510
And we can see it's present day structure.

254
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:52.540
This is the great courtyard of the hotel Dhea.

255
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.280
And I'm pointing it out to us because it's impossible to understand the Paris

256
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:02.281
school of medicine and the new understanding of medical science without taking

257
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:07.681
into account the great hospitals of Paris that were it's site and were crucial

258
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.350
in the development of this.
It's ideas.

259
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.620
This is the Oto deloss shoddy tay,

260
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.390
another one of the great hospitals.
And this is,

261
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.253
uh,

262
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:24.930
the hospital of the PTA because Ip tit.

263
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:26.523
Um,

264
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.860
so the new plus battles become places of instruction under the control or

265
00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:37.300
auspices of a centralized state.

266
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.650
There are large and have an enormous array of patients and the dire dedicated,

267
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.560
and this was crucial to furthering scientific knowledge.
Indeed,

268
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.650
they're more dedicated at this stage to furthering knowledge than to treating

269
00:21:56.171 --> 00:22:00.670
people.
Then there,
if that's an institutional basis,

270
00:22:00.671 --> 00:22:02.680
then the great hospitals,

271
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:07.120
they're also philosophical origins for the Paris school.

272
00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.840
First is the enlightenment with it's questioning of authority.

273
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.260
It's skepticism,
it's empiricism.

274
00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.330
And then I'd like to turn to John Locke in particular.

275
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.480
<v 1>Okay.</v>

276
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.200
<v 0>Uh,</v>

277
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.200
the great figure from 1632 to 1704 and his crucial work,

278
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.180
the essay concerning human understanding of 16,

279
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:42.181
19 which some people regard as so important that they place it at the very

280
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:48.451
beginning of the whole movement of the enlightenment will lock postulated as you

281
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:55.950
already know that the mind birth was a blank slate or Tabula Rasa

282
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:04.990
and his idea was what's called philosophic centralism.

283
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.440
That is that ideas and knowledge gained by the mind are not in nature but are

284
00:23:13.521 --> 00:23:18.521
derived entirely from sense impressions and reflections on those impressions.

285
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.670
<v 1>This is all</v>

286
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.910
<v 0>the cover of the essay concerning human understanding.</v>

287
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:34.150
So we have in lock then a radical idea of epistemology,

288
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.890
the source of knowledge,

289
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.120
hence the word sensualism is the five senses,

290
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.550
uh,
used to conduct a rigorous examination of nature.

291
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.090
So lock also in his epistemology,

292
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:55.010
not only saw the source of knowledge but set rigorous limits to what we can

293
00:23:55.011 --> 00:23:57.620
know,
putting God for example,

294
00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.680
beyond the realm of knowledge and establishing rigorous steps for being certain

295
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:05.510
of the things that we can know.

296
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.430
Then there's another very important figure,

297
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:14.840
and this is someone we've also mentioned before,
uh,

298
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:17.180
who's becoming an old friend to us.

299
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:22.510
This is Thomas Synonym of the 17th century who wasn't fact,

300
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.610
a close friend of John Law and it's called variously the English apocrypha teas,

301
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.960
the father of English medicine.
Well,

302
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.720
pseudonym was politically a radical.

303
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:40.120
He was a puritan,
um,
uh,

304
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:45.150
a left wing Protestant who rebelled against the crown in the civil war in

305
00:24:48.141 --> 00:24:52.370
England and served in fact as an officer and Cromwell's army.

306
00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.020
He was also radical in his medical ideas.

307
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.680
His prescription for medical practice was rooted in the idea of centralism.

308
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:10.270
He called for a rigorous return to observation of the patient and he himself

309
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:17.290
called for the idea of abandoning theory and all preestablished medical systems.

310
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:26.380
The advance of medical knowledge would proceed by a systematic comparison of

311
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:32.950
case by case setting aside the classics and setting aside general system and

312
00:25:35.631 --> 00:25:36.710
general theory,

313
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:43.420
oddly sitting them did not wholly reject humoral medicine,

314
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.060
but his ideas,
in fact,

315
00:25:47.061 --> 00:25:49.940
we could say we're and his practice,

316
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.940
we're still influenced by Hippocrates.

317
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.370
But what he did was to suspend ideas of general theory.

318
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.460
And returned from the text to direct observation of the patient at the bedside.

319
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.040
In some sense he was skipping over Galen and returning to Hippocrates.

320
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:16.030
He believed that the physician should trust his own independent reasoning based

321
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:17.960
on experience.

322
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.700
He distrusted bookish learning and university education,

323
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.760
although he himself had attended Oxford and in return he was scorned by the

324
00:26:28.851 --> 00:26:31.880
medical and academic elite of his day.

325
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:38.280
Pseudonym gave his attention also to epidemic diseases.

326
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.530
He studied smallpox,
malaria,
tuberculosis,
and syphilis.

327
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.071
Indeed,

328
00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:49.071
he would be a good figure for talking about the impact that epidemic disease had

329
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:54.951
on the undermining of humor realism and the rise of a new scientific paradigm.

330
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.440
He's known also for his work on hysteria and on gout from which he himself was a

331
00:27:05.381 --> 00:27:06.250
great sufferer.

332
00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

333
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:09.960
<v 0>In his work on malaria,</v>

334
00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:14.700
he also did something roundup on nearly new or reaching the conclusion that he

335
00:27:14.701 --> 00:27:18.390
was dealing not with the humeral imbalance in general,

336
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.680
but rather with a specific disease entity.

337
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:28.510
Indeed he thought he was one of the harbingers of the idea that diseases are all

338
00:27:29.361 --> 00:27:33.950
specific entities rather than a single disclosure.

339
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:39.500
And he suggested that the time might come when they would be classified in the

340
00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:41.060
manner of Linnaeus.

341
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.520
He even wrote all diseases ought to be reduced to certain determined kinds with

342
00:27:48.981 --> 00:27:53.981
the same exactness as we see it done by botanic riders and their treatises on

343
00:27:55.071 --> 00:27:55.940
plants.

344
00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.820
Pseudonym also was a new and radical in sometimes embracing the idea of

345
00:28:07.361 --> 00:28:11.890
contagion in his dealing with epidemic disease.
He wrote,

346
00:28:11.891 --> 00:28:13.390
for example,
of the plug,

347
00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.900
besides the constitution of the air,

348
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.310
there must be another previous circumstance to produce the plague,

349
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
namely the flew via or assignment minimum from an infected person,

350
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
either immediately by contact or immediately by some pestilential matter

351
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.610
conveyed from some other place.

352
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.200
So we see here erotically different idea.

353
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

354
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:49.500
<v 0>And he wrote a work of famous work of 1676 called the observer.</v>

355
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.710
Nice.
Mady Chi,
uh,
revealing title,

356
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.560
stressing medical observation.

357
00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:57.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

358
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:02.700
<v 0>So pseudonym is famous for introducing a number of practices into medicine as</v>

359
00:29:02.981 --> 00:29:07.210
well.
He popularized the use of Quinine for malaria.

360
00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.120
He introduced opium into his practice.

361
00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:15.330
He used calling drinks and fresh air to treat fevers rather than bloodletting.

362
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:21.010
And he introduced the cool regimen that we talked about for small pox.

363
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.460
Often he wrote the best advice she could give a physician was to do nothing at

364
00:29:26.831 --> 00:29:27.664
all.

365
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.110
There was another important philosophical influence

366
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.240
and thoughts.
This man,

367
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:41.900
Pr Caba niece of French fellows off who lived from 1757 to 1805,

368
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.300
he was a physician,

369
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:51.670
a physiologist and medical philosopher.

370
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:57.660
He was also an administrator of the hospitals in Paris and an early supporter of

371
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:00.880
the French Revolution.

372
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.310
But the point I want to stress today was not in terms of medical philosophy.

373
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.900
He was essential list.

374
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:13.500
He believed that all mental processes are derived from the five senses.

375
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.790
And therefore in medicine,

376
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.450
the source of knowledge should not be ancient texts,

377
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.180
but direct observation of patients.

378
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:29.490
So that was these series than we've seen institutional foundations and

379
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:34.780
philosophical ones.
I now want to look at a third major,

380
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.730
a foundation for the um,
uh,

381
00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.040
the coming of the power school.

382
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.490
And this is the French revolution itself.
Uh,

383
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.800
this is a famous painting of Eugen Dilla,

384
00:30:47.801 --> 00:30:51.700
qua of liberty leading the people.
Um,

385
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.230
you got the idea,

386
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.360
what I want to stress is a general feature of the French Revolution.

387
00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:02.860
That it was an opportunity to wipe the slate clean,

388
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:09.270
that it was marked around a core new departure that facilitated opposition to

389
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:13.900
older authorities and in specific,
uh,

390
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.990
nature to medical corporations.

391
00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.940
It was also a time of French nationalism,

392
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.240
which urged on that instruction should take place no longer in Latin,

393
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.610
but in the vernacular that is in French.

394
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:36.810
There were also some other specific features that made the French revolution and

395
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:40.450
important moment for the development of a new medicine.

396
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.320
One was of course that this was a time of continuous warfare from 1792 for a

397
00:31:47.831 --> 00:31:52.831
whole generation until 1815 and therefore there was an urgent practical need for

398
00:31:54.431 --> 00:31:57.490
physicians and for adequate hospitals.

399
00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:03.390
It was a time of reform in the structure of medicine as a career under

400
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.380
profession and also of medical training.

401
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:14.420
It was a time too during the French revolution when the hospitals were reformed,

402
00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.420
centralized,
there was only one patient to a bed.

403
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:25.050
They were state owned and centralized and the wards became specialized and this

404
00:32:26.501 --> 00:32:31.501
was crucial for the development of new medical ideas specialize according to the

405
00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:35.830
type of patient being treated.

406
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:42.150
These hospitals were no longer devoted to hospice in orphanage care,

407
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:47.030
but rounder.
They became scientific institutions.

408
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:53.110
Patients were seen as having a service to perform and the name of science and

409
00:32:54.261 --> 00:32:59.261
the advancement of knowledge their bodies were made radically accessible to

410
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:06.221
physicians and students both in life and very crucially also after death.

411
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:13.990
In terms of postmortem examinations alive,

412
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:18.500
the patient was a source of knowledge as physicians conducted physical

413
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:23.501
examinations to study the signs and symptoms of disease with rigor and precision

414
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:29.270
in death,
there are lesions were a source of knowledge to pathologists,

415
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.220
to surgeons who practice their techniques and to out of not a miss and

416
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:37.550
physiologists.
Well,

417
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:42.551
the reform of medical education meant that the locus of medicine was entirely

418
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:46.400
clinical and practical on hospital wards.

419
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.320
You were trained as a physician,
a medical student for three years,

420
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.120
followed by an internship and the faculty of Medicine in Paris.

421
00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:01.300
Now consistent of full time professors appointed by competitive examination and

422
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:07.520
the French revolution was important for its values.

423
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:13.390
Stressing Ameritocracy by the encouragement of ability instead of privilege,

424
00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:20.050
birth and cronyism and buy a new democratic spirit that provided a new dynamism

425
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:23.810
and a world of competition.

426
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:29.620
The new bounders inscribed the new motto of the medical profession were words

427
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:33.950
such as reform,
progress,

428
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.180
observation and precision.
Well,

429
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:40.820
what then those are the preconditions.

430
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.540
What was the substance of the Paris School of Medicine?

431
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.440
And here we see an extraordinary development where one city becomes the world's

432
00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:52.970
center of a new medicine.

433
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:57.080
Powers was dubbed the Universal Faculty of Medicine.

434
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.051
It's students,

435
00:34:59.051 --> 00:35:04.051
students and physicians came from all over the world to observe and to be

436
00:35:04.671 --> 00:35:06.440
trained in Paris.

437
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.640
It's work was concentrated in the Latin quarter.

438
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:15.730
That became a sort of Mecca for scientists and students from everywhere.

439
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.640
Indeed,

440
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.640
large numbers of Americans made a pilgrimage to Paris to study with its masters,

441
00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:30.610
to bring their ideas back to this country and to place themselves in a position

442
00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:35.711
to raise their fees because of the prestige which went with the time spent on

443
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:40.560
the wards.
If Paris,
so in Marin medicine,

444
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:45.620
the rise of the Paris clinic was said to market trend time of transition between

445
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:50.910
the medical middle ages and then beginning of a modern era.

446
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:56.930
This was hospital medicine based on radical empiricism and oppose to abstract

447
00:35:58.801 --> 00:35:59.634
theory.

448
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:04.000
The great motto in Paris was poorly in bulk,

449
00:36:04.001 --> 00:36:09.001
who Voila a read little but see a lot.

450
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:16.220
The basis of knowledge was said to be facts grouped in two great facts with

451
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:22.311
linkages established by statistics and no room for obstructions apart from the

452
00:36:24.481 --> 00:36:27.780
facts and their mathematical linking.

453
00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.590
This was observation based medicine,

454
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:37.190
but it would went beyond the medicine of Hippocrates in that this is a picture

455
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:45.020
of Renee neck represented on a Paris Ward and what he's doing is conducting a

456
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:49.980
physical examination of the patient.

457
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.400
Lynette can fact were invented.

458
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:58.260
He was famous for his studies of masses of tubercular patients.

459
00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:03.350
It's important to know that tuberculosis was rampant in 19th century Paris and

460
00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:04.561
Renee.

461
00:37:04.561 --> 00:37:09.561
Lynette had the opportunity to examine and treat thousands of patients with

462
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:13.110
tuberculosis,

463
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.370
which he himself contracted and he died from it in the end,

464
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.310
at a young age.
Well,
he invented,

465
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:23.880
and this was the point I wanted to stress at the moment,
the stuff,

466
00:37:23.881 --> 00:37:28.881
the scope in 1816 so that the modern physical examination became uh,

467
00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:31.980
more one,

468
00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:37.070
not just observing the patient but examining him or her and the stuff.

469
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:42.000
Stethoscope scope became a homework and symbol of the Paris school.

470
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:47.730
Indeed,
uh,
it became a symbol in 19th century medicine.

471
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.150
Here we see this was the memorial stuff,

472
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:53.970
the scope of the type used by Lynette.

473
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.500
It may have been important also that he was a musician and specifically a

474
00:37:58.501 --> 00:38:01.800
flutist and that may have influenced,
ah,

475
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.720
his method of proceeding.

476
00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:07.530
This is the precursor of what is more familiar to us.

477
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:12.650
He introduced the procedures of Oscultation and percussion.

478
00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:18.650
He tapped and listen to the internal sounds of the body and he described them,

479
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.510
uh,
the,

480
00:38:21.511 --> 00:38:26.340
what he heard in the lungs of his tuberculosis patients as rails,

481
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:31.341
wrong key and all the other modern terms used to describe the sounds that he

482
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:33.204
heard.

483
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.170
Now this vast of patients on the wards was crucial.

484
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.470
A professor of medicine in Paris might examine some 5,000 patients a year and

485
00:38:46.211 --> 00:38:51.211
crucially they produced a new concept of disease that is disease specificity.

486
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:58.290
Disease is were thought to be discrete entities that could be classified.

487
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:02.170
This is the beginning really of no zoology,

488
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:07.230
which is the classification of disease entities labeled variously tuberculosis,

489
00:39:08.711 --> 00:39:09.461
smallpox,

490
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:14.461
etc. Rather than the humeral idea that there's just one disease,

491
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.760
the humeral imbalance or just crazy.

492
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:24.040
Now we have a linen type knows all logy or classification.

493
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:25.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

494
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.220
<v 0>On wards,
and this was very important.</v>

495
00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.760
Another innovation of the power school was not the symptoms on the observed on

496
00:39:36.471 --> 00:39:39.860
the ward after the patient died,

497
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:45.220
if the patient died and very many did were correlated with the lesions in organs

498
00:39:47.571 --> 00:39:52.040
and tissues scene in postmortem examination,

499
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:57.100
so an important part of Paris then was the linking of medicine with pathology.

500
00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.680
Well,
physical examination with postmortem autopsies.

501
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:05.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

502
00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:10.890
<v 0>Third developed came to be another word then associated with Paris,</v>

503
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.440
a couple of words,
localism,

504
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.980
diseases at a particular location and the body solid disk which set them apart

505
00:40:21.361 --> 00:40:26.361
from the fluids that where the humerus instead the location of diseases was in

506
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.090
solid organs and tissues.

507
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:36.360
Now the main diseases in Paris at the time were pulmonary TB,

508
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.980
pneumonia,
typhoid,
heart disease,
puerperal,
fever,

509
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.023
cholera.

510
00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:43.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

511
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.790
<v 0>With these discrete entities.
Now being classified,</v>

512
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.330
we also see the rise of medical specialties.

513
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:56.660
So Paris was important and moving beyond the general practitioner to create

514
00:40:58.321 --> 00:41:02.160
specialties of internal medicine,
psychiatry,

515
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:05.310
geriatric medicine,
pediatrics,

516
00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.940
pathological anatomy,
veneer,
Realogy,

517
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:14.220
and there was a new notion of medical education that is lectures were still

518
00:41:14.221 --> 00:41:15.054
given,

519
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:19.440
but the main place of learning was the hospital ward.

520
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:25.220
We're famous professors like Lundbeck himself or PR Louie conducted ground,

521
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:30.150
conducted their rounds with the red and you have hundreds.

522
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.670
Then there was the autopsy table in the hospital.

523
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
We're observation and ideas based on the ward or confirmed or not.

524
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.760
So the new medical education was practical instruction and it was hands on with

525
00:41:46.731 --> 00:41:51.731
training on the ward from day one and the students who attended attended year

526
00:41:53.541 --> 00:41:58.541
round with no vacation and there was a roll call for attendance.

527
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:03.881
Remember this was introduced at the time of the revolution and then under

528
00:42:04.671 --> 00:42:09.671
Napoleon and under the empire professors even had ranks and wore uniforms.

529
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.660
So the practitioners work doctors.
But there were also,

530
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:22.690
there was an Neil licensing system and students were encouraged to learn through

531
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:29.630
their senses,
through seeing,
hearing,
and touching.

532
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.650
This was centralism not only in theory,

533
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.800
but we might call it applied sensualism with a rejection of dogma,

534
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.970
of theory and of authority.
Simply as authority

535
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:46.670
note too,

536
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:51.730
that there was not an integration into this of the basic sciences.

537
00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:53.120
Uh,

538
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:58.120
this was medical science in a sense on its own without what we would now call

539
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.690
the,
they called the basic sciences accessory sciences.

540
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:08.250
Now,
the weak aspect of the Paris schools,
I'll was,

541
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:09.710
it's therapeutics.

542
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:14.890
This was a medical revolution in terms of medical science.

543
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.920
It was less revolutionary in terms of its therapeutics.

544
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:26.770
The new understanding of disease did not lead automatically to improve treatment

545
00:43:28.131 --> 00:43:30.470
for the patient.
Indeed,

546
00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.090
visitors from Britain and the United States often express severe moral

547
00:43:35.091 --> 00:43:39.950
reservations about what they observed going on in the Paris clinics.

548
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:45.790
There was said to be little concern to alleviate suffering or to preserve life

549
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:53.890
knowledge and its advancement or what counted most the patient,

550
00:43:54.541 --> 00:43:59.541
some visitors said was an object to be observed as in a natural history museum

551
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:04.790
more to serve science than to recover.

552
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.600
One American said in fact that a French version of uncle Tom's cabin ought to be

553
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:16.511
written about hospital patients on the wards of Paris and Eugen suit the Charles

554
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:25.570
Dickens of France who wrote the famous work the mysteries.

555
00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:29.450
If Paris did a caricature of Pr Louis,

556
00:44:29.451 --> 00:44:34.451
one of the heroes at the Paris school who appears his doctor goody farm and in

557
00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.360
Dr Guinea Fall in the story tells his students on the ground on the rounds and

558
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:48.530
the ward of the hospital that the lesions that they're observing,

559
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:54.501
that is the symptoms they can soon look forward to seeing when the patient dies.

560
00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:57.480
So could he phoned,

561
00:44:57.481 --> 00:45:02.481
declares that a patient is a human sacrifice on the altar of science.

562
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.750
So the Paris clinic was also sometimes described by visitors as a theater with

563
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:12.060
patients as stage props.

564
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.600
And we're surgeons saw human bodies as a means to greater manual dexterity

565
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.830
physicians and their students.

566
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.970
We're not taught that their primary mission was to heal,

567
00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.120
but rather to advance science treatment remained what it had been for a long

568
00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:37.890
time therapy.

569
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:42.840
We can see one of the,
uh,

570
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:46.190
linchpins was still vena section war,

571
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.270
a bleeding by leeches.

572
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:53.300
And here we see a picture very widespread on the Paris wards where,

573
00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:54.810
um,

574
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.520
hundreds of thousands of leaches were imported monthly by these hospitals.

575
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.690
Um,

576
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:05.070
and indeed they discover it also made it medical discovery.

577
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:09.690
How do you get a Leech to bite?
Uh,
well I can tell you the answer to that.

578
00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.781
Uh,
you,

579
00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:15.781
what you can do is you can wrap the poor thing in a towel and soak the towel and

580
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:17.610
wine or vinegar,

581
00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:22.700
which irritates it enormously and makes it by the next thing that it can reach.

582
00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:26.130
So,
uh,
the therapeutics,

583
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:31.131
then we're a traditional and not different from what humeral physicians had been

584
00:46:32.551 --> 00:46:37.200
doing for centuries.
The strengths of the Paris school,

585
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:41.970
we're in diagnosis,
pathology,
classification,

586
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:47.280
surgery and anatomy.
It's leading figures,
neck,

587
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:51.480
pure Louis,
pure carbon,
nice Claude Bernard,

588
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.440
but this stimulated imitation and other countries in England,

589
00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.170
Saint Thomas Hospitals and guy's hospital in London,
in Austria,

590
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:09.200
the Vienna school of medicine was directly influenced by Paris and then the u s

591
00:47:09.911 --> 00:47:11.520
of on our own country.

592
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:16.850
The linking of the Harvard medical school with mass general hospital was

593
00:47:17.191 --> 00:47:22.191
directly based on the idea that had originated in Paris,

594
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:24.510
but by mid century,

595
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:29.630
the dynamism of Paris was on the wane and it had to do,

596
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.770
particularly with therapeutics,

597
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.950
there was a therapeutic pessimism.

598
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:41.560
All of the statistical methods of the Paris school revealed that standard

599
00:47:41.561 --> 00:47:46.561
medical practices were of doubtful efficacy and tremendous advances in medical

600
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:52.960
knowledge had done little to advance therapeutics.

601
00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:58.150
Medical Science and medical practice were quite distinct.

602
00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:04.470
So it's in the second half of the 19th century that we'll be looking to yet very

603
00:48:04.871 --> 00:48:05.620
soon,

604
00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:10.620
another incarnation of scientific medicine when scientific medicine moves from

605
00:48:12.791 --> 00:48:17.791
France to Germany and from the hospital ward to the university and to the

606
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:22.600
laboratory.

607
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:28.500
And then we'll see a new epistemology that stresses the laboratory bench as the

608
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:31.180
source of knowledge.

609
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:36.450
And we'll talk about the coming of laboratory medicine and experimental medicine

610
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.800
as a paradigm shift,

611
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:43.900
but all of that would not have been possible and we wouldn't have the coming of

612
00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:48.901
the germ theory of disease if it hadn't been for the idea of specificity and

613
00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:54.601
classification that were developed in Paris between 1794 and the middle of the

614
00:48:57.251 --> 00:48:58.480
19th century.

615
00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:03.760
And next time we'll turn to another epidemic disease.

616
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:08.710
And this is a timely one as we're moving into the 19th century,

617
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.900
and that is Asiatic cholera.
