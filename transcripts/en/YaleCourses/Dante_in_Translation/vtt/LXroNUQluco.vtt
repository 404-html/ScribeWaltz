1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.550
Today we are going to look at three cantos.

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.270
They are connected in a number of interesting ways.

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.140
Cantos nine,
10,
and 11.

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.980
Um,
they describe the,
they focus on,
uh,

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.600
the pilgrims and the guide Virgil being,
uh,

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.430
approaching the city of this.
So we are moving there,

7
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.460
they're moving and we with them away from the area of incontinence,

8
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.730
which is the section of a of him fender.

9
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:42.390
We read through from Canto five to Canto eight.

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.610
They're approaching it with the,
the gates of the city of this,
uh,

11
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.600
in Canto nine.

12
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.490
And the pilgrim experiences a serious impediment.

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.840
And I'm pass,
we would call it,
he cannot go any further.

14
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.230
The guidance of Virgil fails him and we're going to examine why it fails him.

15
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.650
And what is the problem that the pilgrim that we'll have to solve once he is in

16
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.940
Canto and within the city of this,
the first sinners he meets,

17
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.080
uh,

18
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
the so called heretics Harris JAKKS among whom?

19
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.460
Chief among whom is really Epicurus.

20
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:25.260
So they're the epicureans and in many ways you understand or that link between

21
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.980
the city and this philosophers.
Uh,

22
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.630
let me just add one thing.
So you have it.
The,
the,
the ideas a bit clear.

23
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
Dante acknowledges in this philosophical texts that he writes called a banquet,

24
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.910
three schools of philosophy.
Uh,

25
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.940
the so called academics or a strategic Ian's then the stoics and third the

26
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.540
epicureans.
Now he handles,

27
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.550
he just examines a who does epicureans are and for him,
their peers,

28
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.930
those who are guilty of some form of pride if you wish,

29
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.730
intellectual pride.
Since Harris is a question of intellect and nor have,

30
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:10.710
we'll we'll talk about that.
Uh,
they deny the immortality of the soul.

31
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.770
And in fact,
it's a really a problem to,
uh,

32
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.840
to figure out why should Dante think of the MS centers at all in,
in antiquity.

33
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.880
They were viewed as one more school of opinion,
philosophical opinion.

34
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.150
My mind that's not convinced me.
My reason.

35
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.260
That's not find it convincing.
Uh,
the belief in the mortality of the,

36
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.580
so what should I be punished?
It's an intellectual since,

37
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.630
since the logic of Dante's old idea of sinfulness is that are the will has to be

38
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.000
involved,

39
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.300
that will is at the center of the habit of two for the habit to sin.

40
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.370
Um,
well we'll talk about this.
And then in canto 11,

41
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.710
there really is no great action.
Dante goes on explaining the,

42
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.090
so topography of,

43
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.150
of evil goes on explaining the arrangement of sins.

44
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.140
What is the,

45
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.160
what is the principle is a principle of construction of fat and they're now he

46
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.720
turns to Arris,
toto,
we'll turn to Aristotle's ethics first of all,

47
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.460
as the plan,
as the model to array for the arrangement of sense.

48
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.000
And then also we shall see in a very interesting way he will turn to,

49
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.820
he would allude to his physics.
So you see,

50
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.130
he goes on talking about from the,
the uh,

51
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.820
a personal problem at which we have to understand in Canton,

52
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.820
I the crisis of then the questions of the intellect and its relationship to the

53
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.470
world at that in [inaudible] 11,

54
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.690
this idea of what are the dispositions to sinfulness and we shall see and the

55
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.240
turn to Adis Toto.
Uh,

56
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.310
so let me go back to now looking at exactly the crisis of Canto and can tonight,

57
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.070
uh,
Dante is processing progressing in this journey.

58
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:06.550
He reaches the gate of this and now,

59
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.190
and this is around lines 40 foreign three furious.

60
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.980
That's so cold.
Three airiness of Greek mythology.

61
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.190
Our lacto they see for me and Maghera on the Jira,
uh,

62
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.710
they appear and they stopped him.

63
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.070
You cannot get a go into the city.

64
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.890
A city described very much as a medieval city.
Um,
the,

65
00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:32.724
the,

66
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.760
in fact it's a kind of swarm for reasons that we have nothing to do with really

67
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:42.130
ecology.
But the idea,
the medieval cities were built me a,
obviously it was,

68
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:47.120
the land was always more malleable and there was water.
It clearly in the,
in uh,

69
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.530
uh,
that's not the,
the,
the reason for Dante,
but division for the,
uh,

70
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.220
certain ways of understanding medieval medieval cities.
The three fewer worries,

71
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.250
uh,
electro to see for them.
Miguel will stop and uh,

72
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.540
and they call on the dozer who doesn't come,

73
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.710
but the someone Medusa,
that's where they say,
let Medusa calm.

74
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.820
They threatened the pilgrim with the site of the Medusa.

75
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.510
Let me do to calm.
This is,
she's in here.
I repeat.

76
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.470
This is if you had to translate it into,
into,

77
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.180
let's say from English into Italian,
you would use the subjunctive.

78
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.410
May she come?
I wish she came.
We wish she came.
Let her come,

79
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.480
and we will turn him to stone.
That's the threat.

80
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.530
A threat of Petrofac Haitian because according to the myth,

81
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.690
and if you don't know all of it,
for instance,

82
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.900
you may have seen a movie about the middle.
So if you look at the,

83
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.940
if you gaze at the,
the,
the phase of the Medusa,
uh,

84
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.950
one who gazes at the head of [inaudible] was a great a virgin or beauty,

85
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.460
a vessel in the temple of Neptune according to the myth of was violated by

86
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:04.150
Neptune.
And Minerva takes revenge on her by,
uh,

87
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.990
metamorphosing hundred,
this ugly,

88
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:10.700
repulsive figure with a hair turned into snakes.
And yet she has this power,

89
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.790
this magic power of turning old your lookers into stone.

90
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.030
So that's the threat.
Let me do a calm and we will turn him to stone.

91
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.210
They all cried looking down.
We avenged ill,

92
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.420
the assault of Theseus Theseus who also violated the boundaries of hell.

93
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.940
A two free,
uh,
uh,

94
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.050
the every tools and other little story that there were a thesis who was

95
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:40.970
successful in the liberation of very tools,
uh,
uh,

96
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.730
the,
this,
the,

97
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:48.350
the drama involving the pilgrim directory.
This is,
this is a,
uh,

98
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.770
a manners on him.
Turns their back.

99
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.630
This is virtual intervenes and keep that nice shot.
Four,

100
00:06:56.631 --> 00:07:01.040
should the Gorgon Medusa show herself and I'll see her.

101
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.790
They would be no returning above.

102
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.490
Now that's a term.
Listen to this.

103
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.910
My master said this and himself turned me around and not trusting to my hands,

104
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.450
covered my face with this home.
Also

105
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.470
report in corrupts the narrative and talks to us as a poet.

106
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.430
This is the first so called address to the reader.

107
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:31.310
I will talk about this little little technical detail.

108
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.160
This will say this is no longer part of the action.

109
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.370
Now it's no longer the pilgrim at the story of the pilgrim,

110
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:40.940
but the poet who is sitting in his study and who says you,

111
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.240
who are of good understanding the talent says you have healthy intellects.

112
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.100
We will have a good understanding.
Note,

113
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.870
the teaching that is hidden under the veil of the strange lines,

114
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.990
the poet,
uh,

115
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.470
assuming authority terms to us readers.
And in a sense,

116
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:04.580
he needs to be nourished so that he's authority can be constituted.
And he,

117
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.391
he warns us,

118
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:10.391
he admonishes us to engage in what a clear appears is that as an our lego recall

119
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.780
or allegorical operation,
we have to read.

120
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.090
And the language is the language of allegory.

121
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.500
We have to know how to read underneath the,
the veil,

122
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.150
that language.
There's something hidden underneath this.
Uh,

123
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.660
what is the allegory about,
um,
so the,
the,
uh,

124
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:32.980
let me just give you more about the story of the myth of [inaudible].

125
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.430
So you will see the relevance may be of that myth and the,
the,
the,
uh,

126
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:42.020
what I left out of the myth of two,
four,
two,
this,
uh,
uh,
this scene now,

127
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:46.520
as you know,
the Medusa will be conquered,
will be defeated,
right?
Uh,

128
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.520
she will be defeated by the poet,

129
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:54.320
by Perseus who on,
it's the origin of Pegasus,

130
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.470
the,
the whole list of poetry.
A Pegasus,
I'm sorry,

131
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:01.530
Perseus who using the shield of Minerva,

132
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.290
they shield that Minerva had given him.

133
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.040
And by looking not at Medusa Directorate that have faced that accurately,

134
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:13.041
but I did reflected image in this shield in the mirror of the shield of be

135
00:09:13.461 --> 00:09:16.290
nervous managers to see how and we'll kill it.

136
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:20.540
We'll slay the Medusa.
Okay.
Uh,
uh,

137
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.500
in the story within the Avidia narrative,

138
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.501
this is clearly a meant to evoke for us the need for a kind of,

139
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:32.280
not a direct vision,
but a mediated vision,
uh,

140
00:09:32.281 --> 00:09:36.520
this to say through the mediation of poetry for us through the mediation of a,

141
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.920
come back to the scene in a moment,

142
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.720
but through the mediation of the shield can pursues a really take flight kill

143
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.920
and then take fight on the back of a Pegasus.
For us,

144
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.950
the shield of Minerva is the text because at this point is he the,

145
00:09:50.951 --> 00:09:53.430
there is a sort of direct,
uh,

146
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:58.460
con let's say divergence between what the pilgrim is enjoying to do.

147
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.590
Virtual says to him,
don't look shut.
Your eyes end up trusting the pilgrim,

148
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.400
either his quickness.
Yeah,
it must've been all by,
by this situation.

149
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.820
He doesn't understand.
He covers,
he Virgil covers,
uh,
the pilgrim,

150
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:15.654
his own eyes.

151
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.610
It turn the poet addresses us and tells us to open our eyes.

152
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.470
You open our eyes and look,

153
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.890
you can because you have the shield of nerve or you have,

154
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.040
you have this texture mediation that will allow you to escape the direct threat

155
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:36.250
and glance of Medusa.
Uh,
so we do know that the story,
uh,

156
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.050
mercury,
who is the messenger,
um,

157
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.690
if they're clearly the figure of the interpreter,
um,
uh,

158
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.460
that's what the Messenger means or are they the better of the,
of,
of messages,

159
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:51.630
the better of words he comes and,
uh,
managers to,

160
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.770
uh,

161
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.360
make a breach within the wall of the city and the pilgrim and the guide can

162
00:10:57.361 --> 00:11:01.740
continue the descent.
This is really the story.
So,
uh,

163
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.970
what is happening?
What is,
uh,
what,
how do I have to,
can,

164
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.840
can we explain what is this allegory?

165
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.800
Let me say a few things you and understand the whole technique of our legos.

166
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:15.330
Whenever you read the divine comedy,
probably much more than I would ever do.

167
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.860
Others.
Other scholars will tell you that the divine comedy is a vision,

168
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.820
which it is.
And that is our allegorical,
which at times it is a,

169
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.260
and the allegory supposed to explain everything that the pilgrim finds himself

170
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:31.370
lost in the woods.
That not the woods to me it's a word,

171
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.880
but they say it's a state of sin in a way.
Uh,

172
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.910
and there he meets a three beasts that stand for our pride and wrath and

173
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:44.550
whatnot,
three beasts and they may stand for other things.

174
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:49.410
The significance of that initial landscape as you may recall when we talked

175
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:53.800
about about that scene is not all that clear.
And that's part the problem.

176
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.750
That's what I call the land of unlikeness within which the pilgrim who will find

177
00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:03.751
himself the inability to join together signs and there significations the,

178
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.800
the awareness that there are no signs which are so self transparent as to be

179
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:12.010
understood or decor divide in a particular way.

180
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.780
So what is this idea of allegory?
Dante here is clearly asking,

181
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.910
telling us that it is an allegory at work.

182
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.240
You readers have good understanding of healthy minds are look,

183
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.370
uh,
open your eyes and look underneath the,
uh,
the veil of the strange verse for,

184
00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:34.000
so what's the,
why are they so strange?
It's so strange.
What is the story?

185
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:38.440
What's going on here?
What is allegory?
First of all,
I'll go to this,
you know,

186
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.350
that word means,
uh,
to speak.

187
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:46.030
Otherwise it's a figure that is related but not quite to enigmas.

188
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.760
Uh,
within the,
the manuals,

189
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:53.761
the primers of rhetorical primers from medieval in classical times and

190
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:59.170
[inaudible] irony,
you know,
say one thing and you mean another,
uh,

191
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.400
but to say,

192
00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:04.810
this is to say very little because Dante has been very thoughtful,

193
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:09.020
has been think probing this issue very deeply and in,
in,

194
00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:13.030
in a couple of places of his works and the letter took ground that he writes

195
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:14.770
about,
which I will talk later.

196
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:18.970
It's a letter that he sends as an introduction to the first 10 cantors of

197
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.930
paradise can grant the being the load of Verona were done.

198
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:25.600
The had lived for awhile and also in the banquet,

199
00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:30.160
this philosophical texts where he explores the idea of,
uh,
of what,

200
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.350
how it meaning can be arrived at how I have a statement,
how can I go on,

201
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.720
I'm drawing a particular significance or more than one significance or part of,

202
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.930
of estate.
And he distinguishes two types of allegory.

203
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:48.100
Let me show you are two types of allegory and there is a so called Aligote of

204
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:51.220
poets and delegative theologians.

205
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:57.250
How the sea distinguished them.
How would he ask us to distinguish between them?

206
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.040
The [inaudible] of poets is an allegory where the literal English,

207
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.320
the literal sense is a fable is a fiction to say that's the example he gives or

208
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:14.710
futures,
but the power of his language moved stones.

209
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.410
That's an allegory of poets.

210
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:22.950
It really means that the power of the voice of the poet managers maybe to edify

211
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.020
cities.
No.
Yeah.

212
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.180
Whether we need poetic mates for the edification of us of a city.
No,
that's,

213
00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:32.014
that's understandable.

214
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:36.610
Or to say all fuse that by the power of his words came lions.

215
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.360
It's so it's to say that a Fubu shows this,
we may have,

216
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.920
insiders can partly be tamed by the music,
the song that poetry.

217
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.450
So that's the allegory of boards.

218
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.980
The literal sense is a fiction to say that it's an allegory of theologian is

219
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:53.090
completely different.

220
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.950
And the example of Dante gifts is pagan sends us to exodus.

221
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:02.300
The Biblical story of exodus.
You or no?
I take what the biblical,

222
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:05.210
so once again,
move his help,
uh,
the,
the,

223
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:10.211
the biblical story of as the story where the Jews abandon leave the,

224
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.660
this,
the bondage,

225
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:16.661
the slavery of Egypt go through the desert and reach the promised land.

226
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.860
He says this is happening historically true.

227
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:27.040
This is not a fixture of this is the Red Sea did open up and the juice could,

228
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:29.720
could pass through the Red Sea,
uh,

229
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:34.520
could cross the Red Sea that this is history and in the allegory was
theologians.

230
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:39.320
The literal level must be historical.
It must be any event.
Okay,

231
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:41.420
so this is the distinction.
Of course,

232
00:15:41.421 --> 00:15:44.790
the question is what kind of allegory is he using here?
Uh,

233
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.760
but we'll come to that in a moment.
But keep her in mind.
This is a,

234
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.760
I hope it's more than than,
uh,
over Carol surgical archeological interests.
The,

235
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.990
the,
within the allegory of theologians,

236
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:59.750
they're distinguished four levels of extra Jesus because Jesus being a word,

237
00:15:59.751 --> 00:16:03.260
meaning of interpretation of four levels,
the literal,
the moral,

238
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.470
the center level is telling you what to do.
Teaching you,
it's an,

239
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:10.220
has an ethics involved or you read and there is an ethics when you're reading,

240
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:14.320
we have more or less a text is trying to direct your will or tell you what,

241
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.960
what you should be doing.
A topological telling what topological meaning,

242
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.240
what does it mean in terms of,
of your whole life,

243
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:22.760
not just the inaction in a particular case.

244
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.790
And then the so called anagogy or eschatological.

245
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.200
So that the story of the Jews Cross in the wilderness and going to to the

246
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.360
Jerusalem means,
uh,

247
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.590
having a kind of a spiritual conversion.

248
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:39.120
Moral conversion means that Ah,

249
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.320
this is the really the way life or to go and you go from sin to glory or,

250
00:16:45.081 --> 00:16:47.720
or the piece of the city or,

251
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.520
and then analogical and this is the story of this whole,
uh,

252
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.740
it prefigures what the soul or to do in the case of the allegory of poets,

253
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.710
you'll have two levels.
The literal and the moral.

254
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.860
They are a lot of difficulties with this way of distinguishing between the two

255
00:17:03.861 --> 00:17:08.861
types of allegory because both allegory of theologians and allegory of poet,

256
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.920
even if the allegory of theologians refers to events are still words that we are

257
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:16.604
reading.

258
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.780
So there's a way in which Dante seems to Ah,

259
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:25.610
one point dodge the whole thing of how can you really distinguish between the

260
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:30.140
two modes that to rhetorical modes independently,
one from the other.

261
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:35.350
And actually he goes on saying really the differences in how you take the

262
00:17:35.961 --> 00:17:40.910
literal sense in the kind of act of faith that you may have,

263
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.430
that the literature says that the Bible is the word of God.

264
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.910
Then you are reading a theologically.
But if you decide,

265
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.050
and one might say that the Bible really a collection of extraordinary pointing

266
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.130
stories,
then you then you are reading according to the allegory of poets,

267
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.580
how is Dante circumventing this whole issue?
He said,

268
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.760
circumventing the whole issue by saying,

269
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.570
my story may well be taken as a story of allegory of poets,

270
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:11.770
but it's also an allegory of theologians.
Because the literal sense is I,

271
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.270
this is the historical sense is in me.

272
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.330
I am the historical cipher moving through these experiences and therefore it is

273
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:24.390
my life that there will give a particular sense,

274
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:29.391
a particular tooth value to whatever poetic fable I may be related.

275
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.640
We only have taken care of one little problem here.

276
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.810
All the very external to the story,
the allegory of poets.

277
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:40.020
Or I'll go to the theologians.
It's time to decide that this is what,

278
00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:42.060
but what is going on here?

279
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.020
But how are we to understand this?

280
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.580
A threat to petrify fication and you cannot really understand that.
Uh,

281
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.060
but I'm here to tell you they're going to really understand it on your own.

282
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.460
So you have to trust my words.

283
00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.640
The fact is that Dante had written in his youth and number of poems for a so

284
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:06.300
called lady stone and Italian.

285
00:19:06.301 --> 00:19:11.080
It's not as bad as that stone could be a good word.
It was just uh,
uh,

286
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.290
don't know Petra,

287
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:18.240
Petra meaning stone and the passion it was,
it's,
it's an description of a,

288
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.370
a love.
There was unrequited,

289
00:19:20.371 --> 00:19:25.200
but a passion for this woman was such that he felt that his intellect would be

290
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.140
petrified that he could be.
In other words,

291
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:30.900
he was unable to go anywhere.

292
00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.800
It's a statement of despair if you wish,
you know,

293
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.820
whenever you have the sense of a death that is going to take over and,

294
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:41.450
and,
and you are going to be paralyzed in,
uh,

295
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.760
in your will than this is a Petrofac station.

296
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.980
This is what I think is happening here.

297
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:52.010
Dante is engaged in a retrospection to an experience of his past and their

298
00:19:52.771 --> 00:19:57.300
experience with past is now ahead of him,
threatening him.
Once again,

299
00:19:57.301 --> 00:20:00.060
he has to cleanse themselves to move beyond that.

300
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.260
But to explain better this idea of the closing the eyes as it's why Medusa

301
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.560
though he talks of Medusa there and this lady patron is a kind of a loser.

302
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:14.600
Let me give you read the little scene from that I think really explains what's

303
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:19.200
going on and prepares us to,
uh,
move.
Okay.

304
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.620
To move forward to the next cancer canter 10.

305
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.260
It's a little scene from the confessions of Augustan as you know,

306
00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:31.980
a book that,
uh,
Dante knew very well.
Um,

307
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.190
Dante even goes on,
uh,
quoting it,
uh,

308
00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.440
a very strategic places.
So there is not an issue of,

309
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.030
um,
bringing it in gratuitously to explain,

310
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.560
explain the scene.
Actually a direct,
uh,
uh,
it could be viewed,

311
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.660
uh,
forgive the,
the,
the,
uh,
the reversal could,

312
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:59.400
this could be viewed as a gloss on what Dante,
we'll go riding.

313
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.630
They confession is written with,
uh,
it's an intellectual,
uh,

314
00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.810
auto biography.

315
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.560
The story of a young man who will go on,
uh,

316
00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:14.500
being fascinated by various schools of philosophy.
He said,

317
00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:19.170
Manny Keon and then it will turn into,
into a new play.
Tunis,
uh,

318
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.920
goes on,
uh,
uh,
is,

319
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.900
is very flattered by a skeptical,
a rhetorical way.

320
00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:30.370
He's a professor of rhetoric,
rhetorical way of dealing with,
uh,

321
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:35.650
with,
with the values and the world around him.
And then,
uh,
in book nine,

322
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:38.200
he'll go on telling the story in the garden of Midland,

323
00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:41.320
the famous story under the fig tree,
uh,
very emblematic.

324
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:45.640
We could talk about these things,
but why the fig tree Melanne,
uh,

325
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.450
leads many scholars to own wondering where are they a fig trees in Moran?

326
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.190
Isn't it?
The climate too cold?

327
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:57.060
You need really the southern climbs for that kind of thing for getting that the

328
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.350
fig tree is always in the Bible,

329
00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:04.351
appears as the tree under which the profits go and rest in the mistaken belief

330
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.530
that everything is over and that somehow the time for complacency may come

331
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.080
there,
are denouncing it.
Of course,
this is all done in the mode of it.

332
00:22:14.081 --> 00:22:18.190
Then we'll see Asia and that's exactly where,
where,
where Augustine puts himself,

333
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:21.680
I'm under the fig tree and there he go,
goes on,
explore,
uh,

334
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:26.620
experiencing a particular drama but the reading of Saint Paul,
et Cetera,

335
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:32.170
throughout this text.
So this is about your play tourist,
uh,
and uh,
and,

336
00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:36.760
and Manicheans,
uh,
as you know,
uh,
Augustan as you probably know,

337
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:39.760
Augustine goes on refracting about his love of shows.

338
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.530
The biggest one of them at the beginning of book three is his love of theater

339
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.090
and his critique of the theater.

340
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:51.160
Now why do I go to the theater and how to explain the fact that there may be

341
00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:54.670
some,
uh,
a well meaning young men who sees the mail,

342
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:59.620
didn't induce stress and jumps on the scene to free her and goes on talking

343
00:22:59.621 --> 00:23:02.290
about how can I be a spectator?

344
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.930
What does it mean to be a SPEC spectator expectation?
How does it,

345
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.780
what does it mean to be involved?
And then there is another little seen,

346
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:12.310
a friend of his I leap use,
um,
a leap use with uh,

347
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.530
uh,
a Greek intellectual in there in the best sense of the word,

348
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:22.531
a man who believes in the in self mastery and intellectual self mastery and men

349
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.710
who are young men who uh,
witnesses,
uh,
Augustine's hone,

350
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.210
uh,
um,
experiences.
You know,

351
00:23:31.211 --> 00:23:35.200
in narratives you always have sandshore accompanying donkey hotel.

352
00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.170
There is always the other,
uh,

353
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:42.270
the more or less skeptical who gives authenticity and who exactly will go on

354
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.040
making claims for the truth value of what the narrator,

355
00:23:46.041 --> 00:23:50.920
the protagonist will go on to experience him.
His name is Ali [inaudible].
I leap,

356
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.520
you will eventually rejoin.
He's in Carthage.
The grew up together.
Augusta.

357
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.840
Then he grew up together or gas and goes to Rome.
I leap you to rejoin.

358
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.590
I'm in Rome and they go on from there.
Eventually we go to Milan.

359
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:06.170
When in Rome I leap use does what normal is.

360
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:10.160
We would go do the first thing he wants to do is to go and watch the games

361
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.870
played as a Co.
I'm fatigued.

362
00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:17.330
I thought they call a seal and the Games are horrifying games for gas.
He says,

363
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:22.331
how can an intellectual such as you want to go to the games were actually human

364
00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:28.301
beings are being thrown for the delight of the crowds are being thrown to two

365
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.770
beasts to Ryan's a leap years.
Uh,
uh,

366
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.010
of course he tries to justify himself,
but I really want to go.
But you know,

367
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.090
exactly because he'll say,
but I read that you,
because they read you the passage.

368
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.250
I would go.
But because of many intellectual,

369
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:48.251
I promise that at the crucial moments when the sign is given for the animal to

370
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:53.720
devour a,
the human being lying there,
I will not watch.

371
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.430
I work,
not going to turn my eyes away and I will shut my eyes.

372
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.230
Let's see what happens.
This is from book six,
Chapter Eight.

373
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.920
It's a great little story that by the way,
eh,
Eh,

374
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.300
a scholar of romance philology who used to teach here many years ago by the name

375
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:16.301
of Eddie Karbach and great Dante scholar and he wrote this book called Mimesis.

376
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:20.780
He reflects on the scene,
not connecting it with Dante,
but it doesn't matter.

377
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:24.440
I read it first in his book,
uh,
and says,
this is really,

378
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:29.441
it's a little scene that marks the end of Hellenic rationalism.

379
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.940
Let's read this.
And it's interesting just because of that.

380
00:25:31.941 --> 00:25:34.820
Then we'll see how I could apply it to dance.
I think it's,
uh,

381
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.870
it's very clear he had gone to Rome to study law.

382
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:45.180
This is a,
our leafs and there he was carried away way incredibly with,
uh,

383
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.860
uh,

384
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.600
an incredible eagerness after the shows of gladiators,

385
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.820
okay.
For being utterly aversed when the testings are spectacles.

386
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.530
He was one day by chance,

387
00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.610
by diverse of his acquaintances and fellow students coming from dinner.

388
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.460
And they with a familial violence,
hailed him FIM and really refusing.

389
00:26:05.461 --> 00:26:09.380
You're resisting into the amphitheater during this cold war and deadly shows.

390
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.590
He does protesting though.

391
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:17.420
You Hail my body to that place.
This is Olivia's and they are set me,

392
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.040
can you force me also to turn my mind on my,
all my eyes to those shows.

393
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.680
I shall then be absent while present.

394
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.430
And so shell overcome both you and them,

395
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.510
they hearing this lady mourner.
Nevertheless,

396
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.370
these iris per chance to try that very thing,
whether he could do as he said,

397
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.410
when they were calm his data and had taken the places as they could,

398
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.180
the whole place kindled without savage pastime.

399
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.463
But he,

400
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.750
Olivia's closing the passage of his eyes for Bait,

401
00:26:53.751 --> 00:26:58.751
his mind to range a broad set of such evil and what he had stopped his ears also

402
00:26:59.311 --> 00:27:01.560
for in the fight when one fair,

403
00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:06.810
a mighty cry of the whole people striking him strongly over combat curiosity and

404
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:12.420
this if prepared to despise and be superior to it whatsoever.

405
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.700
It were even when scene,

406
00:27:14.701 --> 00:27:19.701
he opened his eyes and was stricken with a deeper wound in his soul than the

407
00:27:20.101 --> 00:27:20.934
other,
uh,

408
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.380
whom he desired to be hold was in his body and he failed miserably.

409
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:28.800
Then he,
upon whose fall that might've noise was raised,

410
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.480
which entered through his ears and unlocked his eyes to make way for the

411
00:27:33.481 --> 00:27:38.280
striking and breathing down of a soul,
bold,
rather resolute.

412
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:40.950
And the weaker in that had presumed on itself,

413
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:44.070
which ought to have relied on the four so soon.

414
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.280
The whole confession is addressed to God.

415
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.450
So it's a confession witness in to God.
So you,

416
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.450
in case you're confused about the references,
um,
uh,

417
00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.730
for so soon as he saw that blood,

418
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.560
he there with drunk down savage anise,

419
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:07.070
not turned away but fix this AI drinking in frenzy unawares and was delighted

420
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:14.490
with that guilty fight and intoxicated with bloody pastime.

421
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:19.650
No.
Was he now the men he came but one of the throng,
he came until,

422
00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.610
yeah,
a true or social too.
There's that brought him there.
What,

423
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.440
why say more?
He beheld shattered,

424
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:33.570
kindled,
carry dense with with him the madness,

425
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:38.070
which should go him to return neuro only with them who first drew him data but

426
00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:40.860
also before them.
Yeah.
And to joy in others.

427
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.220
Yet that's the start with the most strong,

428
00:28:44.221 --> 00:28:49.110
the Most merciful hand pluck him and taught him to have confidence nor in

429
00:28:49.111 --> 00:28:53.190
himself,
but in the,
but this was after and that's really the story.

430
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.980
What is the meaning of the story in the confessions?

431
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.690
I think Augustine is very clear,

432
00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:03.110
the failure of the mind to muster it's home.

433
00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:09.240
Well it's about the crisis.
It's about the weakness of the will to begin with.

434
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.480
But it's also the pride that believe that one can rise above the,

435
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.560
let's say,
the,
the,

436
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.190
the contingency sort of temptations and be in control of one's health.

437
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:25.770
And yet it's a story of a temptation,
uh,
which he,

438
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:28.860
I leap use cannot quite resist.

439
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.370
I think that this is exactly what's happening in Canto nine.

440
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.630
Dante's traumatizing,
not only the failure of the intellect,

441
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.290
he's already been talking about the early part of the cancer,

442
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.860
the failure of Virgil to guide him.

443
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.490
He's discussing now the failure of his will,

444
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.240
at least seen in as an event of the past.

445
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:53.230
But clearly it was seen as something that can happen to him again.

446
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:58.630
The passage to the city can take place after this,
uh,
uh,

447
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.190
this scene.
And,
and uh,
now he enters into,

448
00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:07.570
into the,
uh,
city of this and against the walls of the city.

449
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.590
He finds the epicureans,
uh,
again,

450
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.450
those who all do not believe in the immortality of the soul.

451
00:30:16.451 --> 00:30:20.050
Let me just read the encanto 10.
Some passers by the way,

452
00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:24.550
each Canto 10 of the divine comedy,
there really are Oh Candace,

453
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:26.470
intimately related,
which with each other.

454
00:30:26.471 --> 00:30:28.840
So if you were looking for a paper you want to connect,

455
00:30:28.841 --> 00:30:33.460
Canto tenor of in can throw 10 of Purgatorio Canto tenor of paradise,

456
00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:35.350
I would encourage you to do so.

457
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:40.530
So let me just read a few lines are Dante asks who these are salsa and the

458
00:30:43.961 --> 00:30:45.820
answer he gets this line 12,

459
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.920
all will be shuttin when the return from Jehosaphat's,
which is the valet,

460
00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:53.490
Eh,
uh,
um,

461
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.180
in Jerusalem down in the valley into of Jerusalem,

462
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.400
where according to,
uh,
the,
the law,
uh,

463
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.950
the resurrection of,
uh,
the,
the,

464
00:31:06.951 --> 00:31:09.950
the resurrection of the dead will take place.
That's why they,

465
00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.020
they would be meeting.

466
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.760
It's interesting then that there is this contrast in the cantor between the so

467
00:31:15.761 --> 00:31:20.080
called epicureans who do not believe in the immortality of the soul.

468
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.130
And clearly this,
uh,

469
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.860
this view or this oppositional is one from,
call it between Athens.

470
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:31.000
It's very classical,
Athens and Jerusalem.
You may have heard of this.

471
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:36.130
The city of Athens by the way,
and that word itself means in mortality.

472
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:37.670
The mortality of Ah,

473
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:42.220
thanatos the mortality wisdom that wisdom survives,

474
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:45.700
but not that the,
the,
the,
uh,
the people.

475
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:50.770
So there's a kind of a co called the kind of contrast between the two cities.

476
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.860
Very old,
very ancient,
a contrast.
And now,

477
00:31:53.861 --> 00:31:57.550
and now we have in this part Epicurus and all his followers,

478
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.320
what do we call the epicureans and we just gloss the epicureans a little bit

479
00:32:02.321 --> 00:32:06.340
further from then,
uh,
further than I did before.

480
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.520
There are two types in,
let me throw Griffith.
The epicureans.

481
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.440
They are true types of epicureans.
They,
whenever we think about the epicureans,

482
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:17.400
we think about those,
the vulgar epicureans,

483
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.920
those who think about and worship their stomach,

484
00:32:20.921 --> 00:32:25.180
that pleasures of food and epicurean.
Uh,
in that sense,

485
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.600
I think that Dante is dramatized that kind of epicurean in Canto six when he

486
00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:35.500
needs,
remember Chuck Kozo name means pig.
In fact,

487
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:40.190
we talk about the hogs of Epicurus,
you know,
the herd,
all the epicurious.

488
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.390
But then these,
the noble version of the Koreans can talk here in Canto 10.

489
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.600
Those who are interested in intellectual pleasures,

490
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.990
the pleasures of conversations,
the pressures of friendship,

491
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.040
the pleasures of meditation.
Uh,
and,

492
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:56.940
and there are those who do not,
who,

493
00:32:56.970 --> 00:33:01.970
who removed themselves to the garden do not seem to really care much about what

494
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:06.500
happens around them because the,
in the belief that they should really take,

495
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.480
cultivate the soul and cultivate their own,
uh,
their own pursuits,

496
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:14.480
take care of their own pursuits.
That's what we are having here.

497
00:33:14.481 --> 00:33:19.460
So these are the noble philosophical epicureans,
not the vulgar,

498
00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:24.500
uh,
sold that believe in the,
in the supremacy of bodily pleasures.
Nonetheless,

499
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:28.700
pleasure is the aim of an epicurean ethics.

500
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.590
My pleasure.
Okay.
Um,
so,
uh,
this continues on this path.

501
00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:38.591
Epicurus and all his followers who made the soul die with the body have the

502
00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:43.550
burrito place.
How fitting,
how fitting is the,

503
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.840
the punishment for this crime?
This sin perfect.

504
00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.610
Because these people never really believed in the immortality of the soul and

505
00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:55.730
the air con them to be dead.
That's what they think.

506
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.450
And they dwell literally in sarcophagus.

507
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.730
Sarcophagi dry in,
in,
in tombs.
That's,
that's how they appear.

508
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:08.150
So there is another little detail I have given you some,

509
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:13.210
sometimes when we make wonder about the appropriateness of a sin of a punishment

510
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:15.760
for a particular sin,
but here we have no reason to,

511
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:20.380
to really be surprised at all,
but it's kind of,
uh,
of uh,

512
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.980
Destinee reserved for the Koreans.
But for their question to me,

513
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.030
that's your soon have satisfaction from within and for the desire to about which

514
00:34:29.031 --> 00:34:34.031
there weren't silent and then they're interrupt a all of a sudden now,

515
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.870
Dante's once again involved.

516
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:41.210
And what's he a primary is not just no longer the question we mortality of

517
00:34:41.211 --> 00:34:43.430
souls,
but how

518
00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.060
the political aspect,

519
00:34:47.061 --> 00:34:52.030
the political implications of this kind of belief or political implications.

520
00:34:52.031 --> 00:34:54.560
I sort photo believe,
but believing in the mortality.

521
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:59.561
So how is this refracted onto the political scene as it were?

522
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:03.900
And again,
therefore this is almost a platonic conceit.

523
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.400
The relationship now between non on the body and cities.

524
00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:11.510
We saw it in federal six,
but he sold and city it is this,

525
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.160
is this a solar city?
Uh,
what happens?
How,

526
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.490
how do we experience how livable,
which is officer,
I mean,

527
00:35:19.491 --> 00:35:23.070
it is also a pun.
How livable is this kind of city,
uh,

528
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.120
when it happens and what is the,
what is the relationship?

529
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.510
What is the relationship between various figures?

530
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:33.950
But Dante's singles out are two people.
One,
a wealth in,

531
00:35:33.951 --> 00:35:38.610
want to give a lien.
We are in the middle of the civil war or Florence.

532
00:35:38.611 --> 00:35:42.180
Once again,
it's going to be Farinata,

533
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.890
a Gib Alene and a and the Cavalcanti the father,

534
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:50.160
the old man,
uh,
who is a wealth by the way,

535
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:55.161
that also related to each other because [inaudible] son [inaudible] best friend,

536
00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:59.010
you remember he dedicates his Vita Nuova to him.

537
00:35:59.011 --> 00:36:02.920
He calls him my first friend.
We though about canteen,

538
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.710
had married the daughter or Farinata.
They stand there in their tunes,

539
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.760
ignoring each other.
A niche,
ignoring the paints,
worries,

540
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:13.050
perplexities of the other.

541
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.060
It's a little picture of what it would call any city.

542
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.990
This is the city in the beyond where everybody's scrambling.

543
00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:26.970
Nobody's paying attention to anybody else and everybody believes that one's own

544
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:31.920
passion.
Once one concern is really paramount and foremost,

545
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:35.130
there's nothing that can come equal,
can come near to it.
So it's all,

546
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:39.960
it's a candle that interestingly enough,
his mark by,
uh,

547
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:44.700
interruptions,
uh,
one is speaking,
the other one says,
forget it,
I got to talk now.

548
00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:47.580
It's my turn.
And so it is,
it is the,

549
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:52.790
it is a little vignette of Florence in the year 1300 probably or later,

550
00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:57.930
but 1300 is a good date for,
for us.
So he's interrupted.

551
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.140
Verger and Gunther interrupted by someone says,
or Tuscan,

552
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.760
who makes the way alive through the city of fire and speaks so modestly made,

553
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:09.880
please lead to stop.
At this point.
They tongue shows the,
uh,

554
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.020
native of Noble Fatherland to which high was perhaps I like that.

555
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:20.250
Perhaps too harsh.
Suddenly the sound issue from one of the chest and so on.

556
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.120
So they go on a turnaround.

557
00:37:24.121 --> 00:37:29.121
What ails the says a virgin will see their Farinata who was reasonably wrecked

558
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.150
from the middle up the see his full height.

559
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.600
He appears from the navel up in the tomb.

560
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.600
And now a little historical detail.
Uh,

561
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:44.310
they used to be in Rome.
This church is still there,

562
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:50.060
but it was already there in the year 1300 when Dante went on an embassy to Rome,

563
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:54.600
the church,
so cold of the holy cross in Jerusalem,

564
00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.750
which according to the legend,
it was built with material,

565
00:37:57.751 --> 00:37:59.730
with stones from Jerusalem,

566
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:03.450
had been brought to Rome by Constantine's mother,

567
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.070
Helena in the,
uh,
in the basement of the church,

568
00:38:08.071 --> 00:38:11.880
which would be open to only once a year.
Around the Easter season.

569
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.960
They would be in mosaic showing,

570
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:20.610
and you can cannot say we're the only on Good Friday that,
that,
uh,
the,
the,

571
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.540
uh,
that basement would be open ended up mosaic.
It's no longer there.

572
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.560
It's no longer there.
So I cannot,
I'm not encouraging tourism.

573
00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:30.570
It's just I'm giving you a little,
a little detail.

574
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.840
They used to be a mosaic of the,
uh,

575
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.210
rising Christ from shown from the navel up.

576
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.430
And it's clear here that the representation of funny Nada from the new show

577
00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:51.031
himself from naval up is meant as a caricature of the belief in the

578
00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:53.070
resurrection.
Yeah,
too.

579
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.900
This is really the story of a man who doesn't believe the resurrection.

580
00:38:56.050 --> 00:39:01.030
And I can know graphically damn will go on in focusing insisting on this,

581
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:04.270
uh,
on the counter.
This man doesn't believe in the resurrection.

582
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:07.390
There is another possibility of looking at it.

583
00:39:07.391 --> 00:39:10.540
So that is the description is deliberate.

584
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.360
It's clearly meant to evoke all of that.

585
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:18.190
So that is a great exchange between them who defeated home the tube,

586
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:20.890
the continuous battles between wealth and he believes,

587
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:25.780
and Dante claims that his own family managed to,

588
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.410
uh,
take a good revenge when the time came.

589
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:33.910
And clearly the implication is that more revenge,
ah,
since Dan has been,
uh,
uh,

590
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:38.200
we'll,
we'll uh,
would be necessary that interrupted by,

591
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.230
uh,
they're interrupted by this,

592
00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:45.010
the site of a by the old man,
uh,
uh,

593
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.400
Cavalcanti Ah,
so you look at what the,

594
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:53.890
what the story of the canned toy is.
Funny.
Now the water is about his ancestors.

595
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.120
Cavalcanti worries about his son.

596
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:02.220
So these are the Koreans who have a sense of continuity,

597
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.170
some sense of dynastic continuity.
Oh,

598
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:09.700
within the imminence of personal concerns and family.
So they go,

599
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:11.740
they move beyond the,

600
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.700
the fragmentations of self from the others.

601
00:40:15.701 --> 00:40:19.780
This im tool to have a kind of extended idea of themselves in spite of

602
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:21.430
themselves,
in spite of their beliefs.

603
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:23.800
This is what happens in extraordinary scene.

604
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.370
Then rose to sideline 55 and fallen beside him,

605
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:32.400
a shade showing as far as the chin.

606
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.160
I think he had lifted himself on his knees.

607
00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:40.110
He looked around about me as if he had the desire to see whether someone was

608
00:40:40.111 --> 00:40:44.640
with me.
But when his expectation was all quenched,
he said,

609
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.503
weeping.

610
00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:50.930
If they'll goes through this blind prison by height of genius where this may

611
00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:57.690
son.
And why is he not with the,

612
00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:03.130
that offense clearly is to Dante's best friend to redow whose name also means

613
00:41:03.331 --> 00:41:06.030
that he should be guiding him.
Maybe the old man,

614
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.870
the old father was hoping that the father,
the son,
according to his name,

615
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:14.110
could really be leading the younger poet.
Uh,

616
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:18.090
as he had led him in his early point,

617
00:41:18.091 --> 00:41:21.720
the experiments in Florence and they,
he answers,
he's disappointed.

618
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:26.400
And then in them pants.
As I answered him,
I come,
not of myself,

619
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:30.030
he doesn't even mention him.
Meaning Virgil,

620
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.890
he the weights Yonder is leading me.

621
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:39.260
So this is um,
uh,
the Panam we though,
ah,

622
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:43.530
through here perhaps too.
That's,

623
00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.600
I didn't clear the Texas he had.
My translation is to her and so does yours.

624
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:51.540
But many other translations probably would say something different.
Uh,

625
00:41:52.070 --> 00:41:55.450
I will say two,
one to one.
You're,

626
00:41:55.460 --> 00:42:00.460
we though held in this day and clear boost the herb would mean he's leading me.

627
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:03.360
Virgil leads me to Beatrice,

628
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.930
whom we though held in this and why would we though hell hold Beatrice in this

629
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:11.470
day.
And is this really the story of the Vita Nuova the,

630
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.350
the antagonism between we though and Beatrice,

631
00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:21.110
there's nothing that really suggests all of that to one would be to God or to

632
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.780
some,
some aim that we though held in this day.

633
00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:27.830
And we'll see what that means.

634
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:32.120
His words and the nature of his punishment had already told me his name.

635
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.370
Saw The pride,
does fully southernly erected,

636
00:42:36.371 --> 00:42:40.030
cried how said style he held.

637
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.080
<v 2>Oh,
that's</v>

638
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:46.050
<v 0>Dante uses the past credit.</v>

639
00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:51.110
He held the old man in first because of they use the past presidents that his

640
00:42:52.621 --> 00:42:56.790
son is already dead and mistake,
but equivocation.

641
00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:00.810
He's hailed,
leaves he and hold still strikes,

642
00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:03.120
not the sweet light on his eyes.

643
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.050
When he perceived that I made some delay before replying,

644
00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:10.830
he thought back again and we'll seen no more.

645
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.600
But Bob Farinata is unconcerned.
He goes on saying,
well,
yeah,

646
00:43:15.601 --> 00:43:17.670
you drove us back,
but we drove you back.

647
00:43:17.671 --> 00:43:21.740
Talk brings the subject to the political,
to the stick,

648
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.480
to the war between Wolfson gibberellins so that we really have to ask,
uh,

649
00:43:25.481 --> 00:43:27.360
Dante goes on,
set please.
Before leaving,

650
00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:32.280
reassure the old man that his son is still alive.
Because about a year of,
uh,

651
00:43:32.281 --> 00:43:35.700
of,
uh,
the journey,
uh,
Dante,
we,

652
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.420
those supposed to be alive though he will die very quickly afterwards.

653
00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:44.810
What is this story of political disarray of Florence and the story of the

654
00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.430
encode,
the memory of,
uh,
uh,

655
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.850
dentist friend with whom he had just left the friendship was,
had,
had,

656
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.670
had finished a friendship was over.
Um,
Dante,

657
00:43:56.671 --> 00:43:59.160
for those of you who are interested in the biography of the poet,

658
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:04.470
that one of the early and toughest decisions you had to make was to banish,

659
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:10.200
we don't cover content from the city because he thought that we,

660
00:44:10.201 --> 00:44:13.560
there was a cause of some unrest within the city.

661
00:44:13.561 --> 00:44:18.000
Weedo went into exile and never made it back.
He died,

662
00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.920
uh,
three months later,
uh,

663
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.280
in the swamps of neon of Liguria,

664
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:27.040
a little bit north of Tuscany.
Oh.

665
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:31.040
And so the Dante lives in many ways with the kind of guilt,
personal guilt,

666
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:35.670
I suppose he won't talk about it openly about,
uh,
the,

667
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.160
the what had been happening between them.
So what is,

668
00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:42.990
how are we to understand this,
this scene?
Um,
let me just give you some,

669
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:47.060
some details about some other details about this scandal.

670
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.240
If you go through this blind prison by height of genius,

671
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:54.810
a little bit of irony there.
Cavalcanti clearly there's not understand.
No.

672
00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:59.370
Can he understand that Dante's journey,
the beyond is not due to high to genius,

673
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:04.520
but these are the philosophers and he has a kind of philosophical idea about how

674
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:09.480
certain experiences are going to be possible.
W Y why is not my son with you?

675
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.730
Uh,
I said I come not of myself.

676
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:16.780
He that to one whom your widow held in this day in,

677
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:20.810
uh,
well,
um,
what is,
what has happened here?

678
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:25.820
Who is widowed really we do is what we call in a verus did you ever hear the

679
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:30.300
term [inaudible]?
Probably not.
Other roles.

680
00:45:30.301 --> 00:45:32.730
Dante actually mentions him in limbo,

681
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.880
was an Arab philosopher and the famous commentator of toto and the all the

682
00:45:38.251 --> 00:45:42.600
techs,
he commented the just as now in the Middle Ages,

683
00:45:42.601 --> 00:45:46.470
they would be reading the great classics or philosophy,
especially at very,

684
00:45:46.471 --> 00:45:49.070
very difficult texts such as the on the soul of,

685
00:45:49.071 --> 00:45:52.710
at his photo with it following the commentators have a,
rose was known as the,

686
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.140
the great commentator.
He was the great commentator,
uh,

687
00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.550
of artists photos on this hole.

688
00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:04.910
And he argues that Aristo too does not believe in the immortality of the soul.

689
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.130
That's the argument that he's going to be challenged by Aquinas and by many

690
00:46:11.131 --> 00:46:14.280
others.
But that's the primary.
We look over.

691
00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:18.750
Country follows other rowers understanding about the soul.

692
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.740
So that the one who is here,
uh,
a heretic,
so to speak,

693
00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:27.450
it's not just the old men but also Rido governor can't himself.

694
00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:32.220
Let me say at this point before I go any further telling you more about the,

695
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:37.230
the um,
waste an awareness that,
what does it mean to be an various,

696
00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.160
I did have to raise that point with you.
What does Harrison mean?

697
00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:47.110
Cause I did indicate that in antiquity it was never really thought of as a sin

698
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.640
because it's a question of,
of,
of mind.

699
00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:53.100
The word comes from the Greek.

700
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:57.300
I raises meaning to choose one who is,

701
00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:02.400
um,
he's a heretic is someone who makes it into a particular intellectual choice.

702
00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.570
And to be,
uh,
to be viewed as a sinner,

703
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.790
you have to also indicate some kind of an element of pride behind,

704
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:13.770
uh,
a particular belief.

705
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.660
And so we though is held responsible for spreading,

706
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:22.920
disseminating this idea of a verus Maurice than a virus.
Well,

707
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:28.040
one of the ideas that are that that other rose says is that we in the commentary

708
00:47:28.201 --> 00:47:30.490
on the soul,
that we human beings,

709
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:36.430
we human beings are not even capable,

710
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.520
intrinsically capable of thinking

711
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:44.740
that we are made.
Remember the famous structure,

712
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:46.480
the diagram about the soul,

713
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:51.540
that we are our concupiscence entities and sensitive entities.

714
00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.680
Well also rational entities,

715
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:58.810
but the rationality of curse to us intermittently thoughts.

716
00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:03.811
We even say that in English a thought came to me that reminds me the best way of

717
00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:05.630
understanding our various,

718
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:10.830
we don't think all the time occasionally thought comes to us and there's no way

719
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:11.620
that really,

720
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:16.620
and when we think we are really in existence a sort of break this continuity

721
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:18.850
from the world of feeling.

722
00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:24.440
So there's a fairly tragic understanding making human beings the object of

723
00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:27.700
thoughts,
not subjects of thoughts.

724
00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:31.990
We are not agents capable of producing thoughts,
thoughts come to us.

725
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.990
And uh,
also tragic because it in it,

726
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:38.190
it sort of presents a,
Eh,

727
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:43.470
a break between the sensitive part of our experiences and the rational parts of

728
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:48.550
experiences.
We live like animals most,
most,
more often than not,

729
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.860
we eat,
we drink,
we sleep and so on.

730
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:55.480
Then occasionally we managed to disengage ourselves from all of this and capable

731
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:59.350
of contemplative thought.
At that point we no longer really live.
We are.

732
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.110
We are just,
we are.
We are abstracted from ourselves.

733
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:05.500
We are removed from ourselves.
Not only we don't believe in these ideas,

734
00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:06.730
these ideas shape.

735
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:11.710
One of the most beautiful poems are written at the time of Dante by we Dakar

736
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:15.630
can't himself and the poem is called,
a lady asks me,

737
00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:18.640
I want to tell you what the poem is about.
It's a point where he,

738
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.890
there's a fiction are the poet.

739
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:25.090
We though cover can't imagines that a woman may have been the case,

740
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:30.330
asks him to define love as you pour it are always talking about love and I don't

741
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:34.960
understand what you mean by love and nor do I understand what,

742
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.620
what are the effects of love?
And he writes,
his honor,

743
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.700
this is a long song saying that love.

744
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.730
A lady asked me to talk about the nature of love,

745
00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.250
the function of love and the effects of love.

746
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.240
And it goes on almost scholastically,
taking one case after the other.

747
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:54.480
He begins by saying in the exposition that love is a passion that comes from

748
00:49:55.961 --> 00:49:58.300
Mars,
not from Venus.

749
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:02.880
There is to say the nature of love is always to be,
uh,

750
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:06.430
one of conflict and one of war and chaos,

751
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.730
not one of an ordered the benevolent Vinas.

752
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:12.330
He goes on to saying that it's a,
uh,

753
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:17.370
it induces death and it's characterized by deliriums of the mind is a very

754
00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:22.030
clearly grim idea of love.

755
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:27.300
What Dante's do in this candle 10 is connecting with ideas of love and the

756
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.060
politics of civil war.

757
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:37.510
He finds that there is a strictness necessarily connection and it struck the end

758
00:50:37.771 --> 00:50:42.410
necessarily core relation between the thinking about love of Wheelock,

759
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.280
of our can't take home.
Downto pauses as you'll know from the Vita Nuova.

760
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.330
But he believes that Beatrice can indeed be someone who can lead them to God and

761
00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:55.310
to the knowledge of God in the persuasion that it is not by truth,

762
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:56.720
that you come to the knowledge of God.

763
00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:59.000
If you cannot come to the knowledge of God by truth,

764
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.890
then how do you come to the knowledge of God?
By love,
by thinking about laugh.

765
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.690
That's the way of the,
of the,
the ascent.
And on the other hand,
Dante,

766
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:12.650
we'll have this idea that it,
uh,
that the political,

767
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:16.910
the order of civil,
that the bizarre,
the civil disorder,

768
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:21.911
the civil war is nothing else than the phenomenon of a theory put forth by the

769
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:28.550
Verus a by Guido coupled county.
So this is,
this is really what I think,

770
00:51:28.551 --> 00:51:33.551
that double focus of this scandal love in politics and the connection between

771
00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:38.680
them.
A connection with which,
by the way,
uh,
the Averroes,

772
00:51:38.681 --> 00:51:42.920
Sandia Pq and from Dante links with the epicureans are denied,

773
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:47.300
but he's making this connection imaginatively connection denied by the

774
00:51:47.301 --> 00:51:50.660
philosophers themselves with Ken to 11.
And I,

775
00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:56.420
Dan too.
We'll go on.
We'll have a few minutes and I can talk about this.
Dante,

776
00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:01.400
as I said,
explains the,
uh,
the older of,
uh,
uh,

777
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.770
so the,
on the face of it,

778
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.040
the juxtaposition is clear to the disorder of the city.

779
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:11.480
We are not going to have a reflection,
irrational reflection on,

780
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:15.680
uh,
the,
the older that sustains the,

781
00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.190
the city of hair if there is any disordered place.

782
00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:24.010
It this as if there is a large,
even to the,
these older of a,

783
00:52:24.011 --> 00:52:26.450
of evil.
And the idea is that they are,

784
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:31.510
there's a tripartite division to this to hell.

785
00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.490
The plan of her,
uh,

786
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:38.570
all the sins are divided into three parts since of incontinence that we saw from

787
00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:41.900
Canto.
Uh,
three,
uh,
four,

788
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:46.850
five actually two Canto,
uh,
nine,
uh,
the middle area,

789
00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:50.930
which is called the area of violence and which,
and then the third area,

790
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.800
the scene since of fraud and Dante calls fraud.

791
00:52:55.670 --> 00:53:00.230
They seem peculiar to human beings because it's not just a scene of the will,

792
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:04.910
but there is also the premeditation of the mind,
the complexity of the mind,

793
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:08.670
the since of fraud fraud,
which has also since of treasury.
Uh,

794
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.880
Dante sees the conjunction of will and at the same time at the order of reason

795
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:19.550
in the performance of,
uh,
of that,
uh,

796
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:23.870
of that evil and they can talk,
comes to Eh,

797
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:25.060
with uh,

798
00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:30.060
ends with a question to say is that this is all from the ethics of at the stall

799
00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:33.180
and then the Dante wonders look,

800
00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.880
hearsay you are lines 90,

801
00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:39.930
oh son that he list all troubled side.

802
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:44.520
So does that satisfy me with the resolving of my doubts that it is not as

803
00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:48.870
grateful to me to question than to know,
turn back again a little.

804
00:53:48.871 --> 00:53:52.950
I said to the point,
you know me to explaining everything.

805
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.940
Actually he didn't explain everything.
He never explained heresy,

806
00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:01.470
which we took some time to talk about and he never really explains.

807
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:05.950
Dan tells you never really say anything about usury.
Uh,
the,

808
00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:08.760
the usually offense is the divine goodness,

809
00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:13.110
a loose that not why is usually what is usually exactly.

810
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.460
And the question is why does them to ask this question of usury?

811
00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:20.970
How does he answered it?
Cause that we can understand the why he asks about it.

812
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:24.360
How does he answer?
What usually is a,

813
00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:29.361
let me just read this passage lines 98 and foreign philosophy for one one the

814
00:54:31.411 --> 00:54:33.410
stands he said to me,
no,

815
00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.440
it's not in one place only how nature takes a course from divine mind and it's

816
00:54:39.301 --> 00:54:44.301
art if they're not well by physics and other text of Aristotle.

817
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.110
The ethics has mentioned for us now the physics that will find not many pages on

818
00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:57.350
that you art as far as it can follows nature is the pupil,

819
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:03.020
the master so that your art is to God as it were and grandchild by this too.

820
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:08.610
If you recall to mind genesis near the beginning,

821
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.490
the biblical book of Genesis,

822
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:16.110
it behooves mankind to gain the level of hood ended advancement and because the

823
00:55:16.111 --> 00:55:17.880
usual takes another way.

824
00:55:17.881 --> 00:55:22.881
He despises nature both in herself and in her follower setting his hope

825
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:27.660
elsewhere but now follow me for I would go,

826
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:31.950
the fishes are quivering on the horizon and all the way in lies over cowers and

827
00:55:31.951 --> 00:55:34.380
farther on that is the descent of the,

828
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:39.930
to explain the scene of usually Dante puts forth it,

829
00:55:39.931 --> 00:55:40.860
theory of art.

830
00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.160
That's what's happening as if you usually wear a violation of art.

831
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:51.000
How does he understand that art?
What is art?

832
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:56.010
The he understands artists' work.
That's the best way to explain it,

833
00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.030
right?
Talking about the beginning of Genesis,
when human being,

834
00:56:00.031 --> 00:56:04.380
when Adam was thrown out of the garden of Eden and was told that in order to

835
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:08.730
recover,
retrieve the garden,
he had to call but go to work.

836
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:12.780
That work becomes anesthetic,
not a punishment.

837
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:18.200
He had tests and see work as a punishment but in ascetic exercise whereby one

838
00:56:19.711 --> 00:56:24.220
can regain or transform the wilderness into paradise.

839
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.450
That's really the idea.

840
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:30.340
But I think that is more that is happening here in this connection.

841
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:34.990
But this is the general thrust of the camp.
What is art in the Middle Ages?

842
00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:37.680
You may want to know because first of all,
uh,

843
00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:40.300
I did say that there is a general coherence.

844
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.780
You remember those were the main initial words when I started today.

845
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:48.990
Today's class from Ken [inaudible] to Ken to 11 art is understood by the

846
00:56:50.501 --> 00:56:55.501
scholastics as a virtue of the practical intellect in the older of making and

847
00:56:58.271 --> 00:56:59.800
virtue of the practical intellect.

848
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:01.990
And you may under what is this practical intellect,

849
00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:04.480
how many intellects that we have.
While there's a practice,

850
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:08.320
there's a speculative intellect when Dante talks about the immortality of the

851
00:57:08.321 --> 00:57:11.370
soul and those who do not believe in the mortality of this.

852
00:57:11.371 --> 00:57:13.840
So that's a question of the speculative intellect.

853
00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:17.710
If I went home thinking about God,
suppose that I had this

854
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:23.350
weakness of mine to think about justice for instance,

855
00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.730
of an abstract idea of justice,
you know,

856
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:30.010
particular cases of justice and then I'm involved in an exercise of the

857
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:31.120
speculative intellect.

858
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:36.390
He ends the Canto with the practical intellect and emphasis on the practical

859
00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:39.191
interest.

860
00:57:39.191 --> 00:57:44.191
It's their mind that worries about doing or making and they are not too.

861
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.430
They're not the same thing.

862
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.790
What is the difference to say that there is a practical intellect in the order

863
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:53.530
of doing would be to worried about when you talk about prudence is a virtue of

864
00:57:53.531 --> 00:57:58.430
doing was it's not,
it's not the artisans work to say that,

865
00:57:58.431 --> 00:57:59.360
that it's a virtual,

866
00:57:59.361 --> 00:58:03.460
the practical intellect in the order of making it means that the work of art is

867
00:58:03.461 --> 00:58:07.030
a think that one elaborates.
It's there.
From this point of view,

868
00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:10.520
the issue is never really one of our visit.

869
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:12.370
Tell the truth about whatever.

870
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:17.110
It has its own thinkness it's a thing,
the work of artists,

871
00:58:17.111 --> 00:58:21.430
something made and therefore has made it has its own reality.

872
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:25.150
It its own laws,
its own rigor.
That's one thing.

873
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:30.130
So it's work.
But look at all the images that Dante's using to uh,

874
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:34.270
reflect on this problem.
Philosophy for one,
one the stands,

875
00:58:34.271 --> 00:58:38.800
he said to me notes not in one place only how nature takes a course from the

876
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:43.390
divine mind and it's hot and the know,
well they physics,

877
00:58:43.391 --> 00:58:48.130
which is um,
it's a theory of,
of nature.

878
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:52.720
Really.
It's a theory of motion.
It's a theory of how things grow.

879
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:57.970
Uh,
how things are,
are born,
grow and parish,
right.

880
00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:01.790
Um,
that we'll find not many pages are on that.

881
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:06.040
Your art is fun as it can.
Photos.
Nature is the pupil,
the master,

882
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:08.560
so that your artists to gods as it were a grandchild.

883
00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:12.820
I just want to talk about this metaphors here to make you understand what Dante,

884
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:16.240
Dante understands art on the face of it.

885
00:59:16.241 --> 00:59:20.680
He saying that art must be an invitation of nature,
right?

886
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.800
You had follow nature.
So this does Dante.

887
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:27.800
Then I have a mimetic idea of art.
Not at all.

888
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:33.120
Not at all.
Because look at the metaphors he's using.
Um,

889
00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:39.010
two metaphors.
You're as far as it can photos.

890
00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:42.740
Nature is the pupil,
the pastor,

891
00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:47.150
so that your art is to God as it were a grandchild.

892
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:51.710
Because art follows nature.
Nature is the child of God.

893
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:54.050
So art is a grandchild,

894
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:58.730
but it's an image of fecundity and fertility.

895
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.100
You can understand why dental posters,

896
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:06.101
art finally to usury usually is viewed as the activity that is sterile and

897
01:00:08.331 --> 01:00:12.800
activity that produces what's symbolic money out of money,

898
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.140
money.
So it's a symbolic kind of operation as opposed to it.

899
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:22.250
Dante opposes with Dante casts the virtue of art as work,

900
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.200
but one of production,

901
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:27.980
one of generation that the grandchild of God,

902
01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.720
art is the grandchild of that.

903
01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:34.930
And then there is this other metaphor is the pupil follows the master,

904
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:38.170
which is not a gratuitous metaphor because of their own,
the,

905
01:00:38.171 --> 01:00:41.990
within the context here,
Dante is,
has virtual is teaching him.

906
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:44.990
So there's also almost a kind of flattery if you wish.

907
01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:49.790
One little detail is flattering.
The,
the,
uh,
the relationship.
We are,

908
01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:53.390
acknowledges his discipleship to Virgil,
which he does all the time,

909
01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:58.600
but it implies the educational aspect of art in the most of the technological

910
01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:04.511
sense of the term art educator in the sense that he leads us out of a particular

911
01:01:05.661 --> 01:01:09.650
state of what a cold call it barbarity ignorance,

912
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.630
a darkness,
et Cetera.

913
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:15.840
So he has an educational and no mimetic uh,

914
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:20.950
role because art imitates the productive rhythms of the natural world.

915
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.880
Dante views an art that is open to beginnings to life.

916
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.270
This is the meaning of Genesis,

917
01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:37.271
the idea of genesis and art that all is that is original but not in a romantic

918
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:41.030
sense of originality.
But I not,

919
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.720
that leads us back to the thought of origins,

920
01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.960
the thought of how things come into being.

921
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:53.110
Because only then do we understand how or what the ends are to understand the

922
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:59.030
ends.
We got to know something about the beginnings,
about the seeds that make us,

923
01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:03.330
uh,
forever.
It is that we think we are.
So,
uh,

924
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:08.380
we have gone then from Kenton nine to come to 11 from concerns about the pride

925
01:02:08.571 --> 01:02:11.730
of the mind.
Uh,
the,
the,
uh,

926
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:16.490
which we could even call it would even call the wound the wound of the intellect

927
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:19.900
and the weakness of the will tool.
Uh,

928
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:25.220
the view that really is no distinction between an epicurean thinking about one's

929
01:02:26.401 --> 01:02:30.780
health in the state and a distinct from some kind of theorizing them to see this

930
01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:33.990
connection between them to finally,
uh,

931
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:35.940
an idea of art.

932
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:41.780
I think that this idea of art is also for Dante remedial for the evils,

933
01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:46.680
uh,
that to which we are prone,
Dante,

934
01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:49.410
things that should we apply to ourselves.

935
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:54.740
The same kind of care of rigor with which an artist produces the work of art.

936
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:59.850
Then what do we call the cultivation of this whole main deed?
Uh,

937
01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:04.110
begin to take place.
Okay.
So art,
the tension,

938
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:08.640
Dante's attention to art is part of this ascetic exercise.

939
01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.150
We finish here.
It was,

940
01:03:10.151 --> 01:03:13.720
that will have given us a few minutes as I touched on a number of issues and I'm

941
01:03:13.721 --> 01:03:18.580
anxious to hear your perplexities,
uh,
questions,

942
01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.130
comments,
suggestions,
whatever.

943
01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:29.250
<v 3>Yes.
It makes it so clear that they send me,</v>

944
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.510
<v 0>I really,
I really,
you have</v>

945
01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.810
<v 3>yes.
Because of analytes in,
well,</v>

946
01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:39.060
it's not just because they're thinking something.

947
01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.450
<v 0>The question is with the head ethics that we are not really dealing only with</v>

948
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:48.640
the question of thought or it's a freedom of thought,
but uh,

949
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.050
it's not,
uh,

950
01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:54.820
deals with the fact that so the heretics are engaged in enact of Intel acts of

951
01:03:54.821 --> 01:03:57.280
intellect which are supported,

952
01:03:57.281 --> 01:03:59.890
are shaped by also acts of the will.

953
01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:01.720
That's that it was exactly what I maintained.

954
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.810
<v 3>That makes sense.
But then it,
does he ever really try and explain to them,
I mean,</v>

955
01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:10.160
everyone wonders about the virtuous pagans and why they're there and it seems

956
01:04:10.161 --> 01:04:13.820
that there's
really no failure

957
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:18.280
<v 0>for the before the,
for Dante you mean?
Ah,</v>

958
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:22.770
the question is about the Pagans are the standard thing that there is,

959
01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.560
are not just the failure.

960
01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:26.570
If I understood the question of the failure of the intellect,

961
01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:31.370
but also the failure of the wheel.
Yes.
I think that this is a,
this is the case.

962
01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:36.710
Uh,
we shall see a number of pagans were probably,
we can highlight,
we can,

963
01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:41.180
we can see highlighted some of this,
uh,
this concerns that he has,

964
01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.980
uh,
concerns.

965
01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:48.340
You will read the Ulysses who is represented as engaged in a flight of the minds

966
01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:55.400
that wings of the intellect,
you know,
they are wings of desire,

967
01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:00.500
platonic wings of desire,
and then Francesca can't,
or five,
you know,

968
01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:04.100
you remember she says like a dove,
tell her,
uh,

969
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:08.030
cold by desire,
the open wings,

970
01:05:08.031 --> 01:05:09.140
clearly the wings on his idea.

971
01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:12.450
And then in the case of your list is you're going to have the,
the,

972
01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:17.460
the wings of the,
of the,
of the intellect,
uh,

973
01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:22.210
the mind that tries to reach or the flight or the mind.
Um,
but he,

974
01:05:22.211 --> 01:05:26.060
he tool he tool appears as,
as,

975
01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:28.270
as a rhetorician this to say,

976
01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.860
it would seem that we like to believe that there is a distinction between the

977
01:05:32.861 --> 01:05:37.500
say a metaphysical since the devil,
but physics as a,
uh,

978
01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:42.040
a kind of metaphysical intellectual flight and not is always saying,
look,

979
01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:46.960
uh,
is it taking to all his probe the presence of passions,

980
01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:51.150
the rhetorical aspect of,
uh,
uh,

981
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:56.190
the claims to reach the truth or the plain of truth?

982
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.890
Oh,
yes.
Am I answering your question though?

983
01:06:00.350 --> 01:06:01.630
<v 3>I mean,
it's also just,
you know,</v>

984
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:07.190
which is why they say we're still in house.

985
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.240
<v 0>Okay.
Okay,
good.
Uh,
then,
uh,
uh,</v>

986
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:17.790
I have been missing the mark in answering,

987
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.270
and the question really is how are they pagans in hell?

988
01:06:21.271 --> 01:06:25.200
Because Christ had not yet calm.
And in what way did they violate

989
01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:32.220
the federal return?
Uh,
no,
the answer is no.
No.

990
01:06:32.610 --> 01:06:37.170
Uh,
and they may give you a general idea why it's no,

991
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.220
and then their particular idea,
first of all,
generally is if,

992
01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:45.270
if Dante word to drudge and he does judge the world,

993
01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:50.160
the culture of,
uh,
uh,
let's say Greek,
the classical world,

994
01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:54.410
he puts it most of it in limbo.
That's a judgment.
Then you know,
you're up,

995
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.750
you're really marginal.
You're eliminated to my story.
That's,

996
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.660
that's what he's saying.
Ah,
they'll in paradise,

997
01:07:00.661 --> 01:07:04.200
who will go out of the way to reclaim Plato,

998
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:07.260
Waterstone and all the possibilities for periods.

999
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:12.160
If he were to do that from a perspective which is outside,
I don't,

1000
01:07:13.350 --> 01:07:17.850
he really would be a boring port in my view.
You know,
I,

1001
01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:23.100
you don't believe in the mortality of the soul as his fever saying copiers.
I do.

1002
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:28.090
Uh,
you're a fool and therefore I'm saved and I put you in hell.
That's,

1003
01:07:28.091 --> 01:07:31.200
that's,
that's really not worthy of,
of,

1004
01:07:31.201 --> 01:07:35.610
of of a great mind because one can imagine a peculiar sang by you or the full,

1005
01:07:35.611 --> 01:07:38.940
and you think you are saved.
I know what I have been known.
So you can,

1006
01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:40.950
you can take,
says [inaudible] never does that.

1007
01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:45.330
He does do is take the perspective of the sinners themselves,

1008
01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:50.370
let them talk and gives them a rope with which they hang themselves.

1009
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:54.780
That's really what's happening.
That's the best way to present this argument.

1010
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.650
Uh,
so he's not judging the Pagans.
And I'm coming straight to your question.

1011
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:03.030
He's not judging the Pagans from a Christian standpoint alone.

1012
01:08:03.031 --> 01:08:06.510
That is outside of it for a number of reasons,

1013
01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:10.590
because he believes actually that whatever,
ah,
the,
the Pagans,

1014
01:08:10.591 --> 01:08:13.320
Geraldo Abrasions of the Christian,

1015
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:16.850
the view of the Christian vision,

1016
01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.280
there are no just other to be rejected on the contrary.
And then in particular,

1017
01:08:22.281 --> 01:08:27.281
I can say that they will go on placing some pagans say among the saved he even

1018
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:31.410
places one figure,
uh,
the,

1019
01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:35.360
the Socorro refills who was only mentioned once.

1020
01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:39.800
And we know nothing about him.
I Roman who just,
who's a sailor in,

1021
01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:45.050
in with an ies and only because virtual refers to him as Eustace Rafales use to

1022
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:48.230
survive that just refuse,

1023
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:53.180
which is to me a way which Dante says,
not just the kings,

1024
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.820
but then very simple,
humble,
uh,
um,

1025
01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:02.270
worker can also be safe trade or the emperor Trajan and so on.

1026
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:04.970
So there are a number of other cases in the case of virtual,

1027
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:10.040
I'm not going to go there because I'm going to be on TV for the next six months.

1028
01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:11.970
I don't know,
uh,
how many the,

1029
01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:17.380
because reams of books have been written by people who wish to see him saved.

1030
01:09:17.781 --> 01:09:21.370
I mean,
it's such,
such a good guy throughout in fair.
No.
And,

1031
01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:25.960
and pull gatory on the,
and the people who go on arguing that he,
he might,
uh,
he,

1032
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:26.900
he,
he may be saying,

1033
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:31.280
one thing we know is that he comes as far as the garden of Eden and justice

1034
01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:35.810
about Beatrice is going to arrive.
The pilgrim,
the lover.

1035
01:09:35.811 --> 01:09:36.620
Now,

1036
01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:41.620
Dante trembles at the idea that he or she is the destination of his journey and

1037
01:09:42.141 --> 01:09:45.140
he needs the help of,
of,
of Virgil.

1038
01:09:45.141 --> 01:09:49.580
He turns around and his eyes will never see him again.
He had vanished.

1039
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:53.010
So we know that there is a kind of,
uh,
that seems to be the limitation,

1040
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.590
how far he can go.

1041
01:09:55.850 --> 01:10:00.850
But to say this really to say very little or because within Dante's Cosmo,

1042
01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:07.190
Dante,
Dante is an idea of the curvature of space.
Okay?
The sphere

1043
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:14.680
into a redemption means that all things will go back to the beginning.

1044
01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.340
That's what happens.
So only from that point of view,

1045
01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:24.170
we don't have a lot of thematic or reflections about this aspect.

1046
01:10:24.171 --> 01:10:26.570
Who is going to be saved at the end of that?
Who knows?

1047
01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:30.950
The whole question is the unfathomable quality of God's justice.

1048
01:10:30.951 --> 01:10:33.680
Dante wonders though,
uh,
you know,

1049
01:10:33.681 --> 01:10:36.920
we're talking about Christ and Christ and what about the,

1050
01:10:36.921 --> 01:10:40.880
in those living in the hint on the banks of the Hindus,

1051
01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:44.330
they never heard the name of Christ and they're going to be saved and they are

1052
01:10:44.331 --> 01:10:48.580
just,
can they be condemned?
These are questions that he will not answer.

1053
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.820
He raises this question is in paradise,
so you're a little bit impatient I say,

1054
01:10:53.090 --> 01:10:58.090
but I think that from the point of view of eschatology are he must have an idea

1055
01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:03.950
of otherwise redemption has failed.
If,
if some people are damned,

1056
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:07.100
then there is no redemption.
You see what I'm saying?
Uh,

1057
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:09.320
in the measuring which evil,
if you,

1058
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:14.340
if you get into this metaphysical a framework,
uh,

1059
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:19.140
if they are going to be residues of,
uh,
of,

1060
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.220
of sin,

1061
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:24.330
then that is also rescue of injustice.

1062
01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:29.630
<v 2>I don't know that I answered your question.
I think I did,
but,
oh</v>

1063
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:32.723
yes.

1064
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:38.250
I understand the idea of him just as an allegory for mediation poetry.

1065
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:43.700
But is it also a connection between the figure of the woman and the act of

1066
01:11:43.871 --> 01:11:46.980
Petrick vacation taking about the donut?
Petra,

1067
01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.210
I'm wondering if don is also saying something about the danger of this love,

1068
01:11:51.211 --> 01:11:54.600
right.
The dangers of misplaced love.
Thank you.

1069
01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:59.300
<v 0>The question is,
uh,
about the,
the stove,
the Medusa,
uh,</v>

1070
01:11:59.301 --> 01:12:00.070
and the,

1071
01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:04.430
the part about the mediation of poetry to conquer Medusa is clear.

1072
01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.770
But,
uh,
the question,

1073
01:12:06.771 --> 01:12:11.030
the question also wonders whether this has to do with,

1074
01:12:11.031 --> 01:12:14.300
first of all the fact that the Medusa's have woman and uh,

1075
01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:19.600
and also the pit that pit suffocation is the petrol vacation of misplaced love.

1076
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.470
Is that an accurate,
the paraphrase.
Okay.
And the answer is,

1077
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:26.030
that's a great question.

1078
01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.430
I sense there are your awareness of the fraud,

1079
01:12:30.431 --> 01:12:35.180
the reading of the myth of the Medusa,
uh,
s castration,

1080
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:40.130
s s s a d,
the kind of literalization of the,

1081
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:42.320
the threat at least not cost to you,

1082
01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:46.910
but the threat of castration on the mail from the point of view.
Or maybe it was,

1083
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:48.020
uh,
um,

1084
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.720
<v 2>okay.</v>

1085
01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:54.070
<v 0>I will take the second part of your,
your remark to explain also the first part.</v>

1086
01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.570
I think that this is a question of a misdirected love,
but what Nan has seen,

1087
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.540
um,
I would urge you to go and read the poems about this.
Uh,

1088
01:13:03.541 --> 01:13:07.770
a lady pay tra the Lady of stone,
uh,

1089
01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:12.810
because there are poems were non politically engages in fantasies of violence

1090
01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:18.850
against,
against her.
Oh,
you fuck with get my hands on her.

1091
01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:23.080
That with a passion I requited makes him,
um,

1092
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:27.780
well it's almost sort of sadistic,
sadistic coloring,
uh,

1093
01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:31.300
about about it.
So I think it's clearly misdirected love.

1094
01:13:31.301 --> 01:13:36.301
What he understands though is the kind of death that that sort of desperate love

1095
01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.250
has brought to him.
You can call that,

1096
01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.310
you can view that death is the fear of castration.

1097
01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.450
I think it's an extreme version of that.
So I would agree.
I would agree with,

1098
01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:52.200
with what I hear is behind you.
Okay.

1099
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:56.340
<v 2>Question.
Yes.</v>

1100
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:59.250
Why does he draw us into that allegory?

1101
01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.300
<v 0>I,
uh,
you mean if it's a,</v>

1102
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:08.810
the question is why does he draw us into the link or if it's about petrified

1103
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:10.470
love.
Ah,
right.

1104
01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.020
This is the question and that presume I don't want to explain your question.

1105
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:15.280
I have to answer your question,

1106
01:14:15.281 --> 01:14:19.540
but I presume that your question stems from your,

1107
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.680
your kind of concern you have.

1108
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.730
If it's such a private story,
why us?
In what way are we involved in that?

1109
01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:32.380
This is his story,
right?
Uh,
and the answer that I could give is yes,

1110
01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:35.980
this is,
it can be seen as Dante's own confession.

1111
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:37.600
And the confession.

1112
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:42.610
And that's why I read the passage from Augustan Augustan.
So on confessions,

1113
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.820
a confession that can also be exemplary to us.

1114
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:50.560
And because he thinks,
I think that there are no experiences,

1115
01:14:50.561 --> 01:14:55.280
challenges just reuse,
bubbly,
private,
and therefore I'm sharable.

1116
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:55.850
Uh,

1117
01:14:55.850 --> 01:15:00.850
it's part of the concern of this writing or this writer that anything that will

1118
01:15:00.941 --> 01:15:04.210
happen to him.
We,
we,
we,
I have to say this,

1119
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.100
we are going to find moments when he tells us his night dreams.
Um,

1120
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:14.550
pretty heavy night dreams with treated with an extraordinary,

1121
01:15:14.621 --> 01:15:18.550
I think care.
Um,
but we're going to have this,

1122
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:21.040
we're going to enter into his psyche why,

1123
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.550
of way of entering the psyche because he has to,

1124
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:29.320
to understand not only how shareable are his,
uh,
his,

1125
01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:33.860
his experiences,
but also what is the root of,
um,

1126
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:36.950
the wig.
We make decisions.
Um,

1127
01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.720
dual can we really be ever all the time vigilant.

1128
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:44.260
This isn't the case of the dream and my responsible.
If I,

1129
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:47.950
if I perceive the world in a certain way and my responsible,

1130
01:15:47.951 --> 01:15:49.810
if dreams come to me in a certain way,

1131
01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:52.390
then am I accountable for this kind of dreams.

1132
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:57.630
So the concern is always that of trying to the limit an area where there is some

1133
01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.470
common ground between his experiences and hours.

1134
01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.720
And that's the transactional value.
The Corey,

1135
01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:06.523
<v 3>okay.</v>

1136
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.560
Yes.
I don't know if it's significant,

1137
01:16:15.561 --> 01:16:20.030
but Dante turns to the right.
Yes.

1138
01:16:20.031 --> 01:16:22.970
Did you find that significant?
Just going back to

1139
01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:28.790
<v 0>oh,
of course.
Okay.
This is fantastic.
This,
uh,</v>

1140
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:33.870
the question is,
I have been talking about the fact that in uh,
in in fair,
no,

1141
01:16:33.871 --> 01:16:36.430
Dante goes,
uh,

1142
01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.900
to the left seems to,

1143
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:44.820
which I also said though that that is really very difficult to visualize.

1144
01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.170
So we say counter clockwise or clockwise that he's,

1145
01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:52.920
the seventh is a clockwise in,
in fandom.

1146
01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:57.780
And yet I'm so grateful to you for noticing this.
Uh,

1147
01:16:57.800 --> 01:16:59.610
he had a new fare,
no,
nine.

1148
01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.410
Dante actually goes out of the way to say that he turned to the right and the

1149
01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.370
the,
I don't have a position of my own on this,
but they'll also be,
well,

1150
01:17:08.580 --> 01:17:10.160
this is 24 size.

1151
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:15.370
That heresy is primarily the disease of the intellect.

1152
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:17.620
You know,
you remember that I,

1153
01:17:17.621 --> 01:17:21.470
I specify that that is the will and intellect and they will,
is always the left.

1154
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:26.690
And the intellect is the right.
I think that Dante is,
uh,
uh,

1155
01:17:26.691 --> 01:17:31.340
this is the point where Dante is,
uh,
uh,
sleeping.

1156
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:34.970
It happened to Houma occasionally to fall asleep.

1157
01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:39.530
And this is that the only time that you have caught him,
those enough.

1158
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:41.930
Okay.
Thank you so much.
We'll see you next time.
