1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.200
I,
you may,
you may recall of that,
uh,

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.430
last time we went over the shape of a dentist,

3
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:15.570
Cosmo's remember the,
and the point there,
one of the points,

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.250
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.340
was to show that the context of Dante's experience,

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.800
the way he moves the tail,

7
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.370
he's telling about this extraordinary experience he has.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.410
It's really the whole cosmos.
It's not,
it's not just,
uh,
uh,

9
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:39.030
one's whole,
uh,
our town one's own place and so on.
It,
it really,

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.490
it really takes place within the cosmos.
And we saw her,

11
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:45.180
Dante describes that cosmo was,
uh,
uh,

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.210
he describes it in terms of a physical in the metaphysical or principles as,

13
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.510
hey,

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.510
here's all the materiality and the spirituality of two hemispheres.

15
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.990
All placed in one and a.
The imperian,
Eh,

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.690
is the,

17
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.960
the threshold and the limit of the physical cosmos and the way of entering into

18
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:12.090
the spiritual cosmos.
Uh,

19
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.130
the challenge he has as a port is that to show the relationship between the

20
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:23.100
finite and the infinite,
the way that they are really disjointed.

21
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:23.911
At the same time,

22
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:28.911
they are note the finite universe can only be part of the infinite universe.

23
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.170
And so he describes how the infinity enters the finite and the finite and the

24
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.910
infinite.
This is the heart of the Cantos of metaphysics,

25
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.290
which we'll call that,

26
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.000
which we can call that cancers of physics and metaphysics at the same time.
Now,

27
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.730
Dante moves straight into the Imperian.

28
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.030
He was in the Er.

29
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.720
You remember into the [inaudible] or the crystal lean heaven.

30
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.350
Before that,
there wasn't the heaven of the fixed stars.
25,
26,
37.

31
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.860
Then he moved into the,
uh,
the,
the crystal lean.
Now he's,
uh,

32
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.920
into the,
uh,
Imperian uh,
this is the end of,

33
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:12.090
uh,
of,
of,
of,
of,
of the race for him.
It's the end of the journey.

34
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.120
Uh,
the question will be,
uh,

35
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.600
how he is going to say farewell to Beatrice.

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.090
There'd be a change of the guard.
Uh,
Beatrice,
the role of Beatrice as a guide.

37
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.400
We'll stop.
We'll end with Canto 30 of paradise.
Quite appropriately.

38
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.110
It's suitable.
She's the woman tied with the number 30.

39
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.890
She appeared in Canto 30 of predatorial,
uh,

40
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.950
stays on the stage of the poem for 33 Cantos and now she's going to actually

41
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:47.490
disappear.
He realized that she has disappeared in Canto 31,

42
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.670
but there's a change of the guard because Dante moves from Beatrice to Eh,

43
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.250
uh,
contemplative,
a historical figure,

44
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.210
a or all the time or almost all the time with Dante.
Um,

45
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.240
Bernard of Clairvaux who was a famous monk of a French monk who,

46
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.550
uh,
stands for,
uh,
uh,

47
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.760
tr is written treatises on contemplation and mystical vision.

48
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:20.761
So appropriately he's the one who will usher and pray the Virgin Mary that she

49
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:23.260
may in turn pray her son.

50
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.470
It's a chain of mediations so that the beatific vision may be granted to Dante.

51
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.060
That's going to happen.

52
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:35.650
We can't have 33 and we're going to find out the difficulties that Dante has a

53
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:39.070
both scene,
but above all in recalling,

54
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.330
in recollecting the poem will end up with,
uh,
being assaulted.

55
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.350
Uh,

56
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.350
registering the feet are the unavoidable refit of memory and the importance of

57
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:53.260
forgetfulness.
So we're going to find in Canto 33,

58
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.700
it's sort of a,

59
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.690
a further twist to the metaphor of you remember incantatory three or pull that

60
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.600
order that I mentioned to you where it was happening.

61
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.930
Dante will go on being immersed ritually into the river Liffey and then into the

62
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:12.340
river.
You know,
the two rivers one,
the river of forgetfulness,

63
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.760
the one the river of memory of good memory.

64
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.830
And 90 goes on saying that they really came the,

65
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.330
he was at the point where the,

66
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.870
the two streams where really are originating from the same source.

67
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.940
It is as if memory and forgetfulness,
first of all,
are equated with water.

68
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.710
They're in Canto 33 of purgatorial implying Dell ability.

69
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.170
Uh,
you know,
the,
the water has that quality of flowing,
the fluidity,

70
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:43.840
the ability of both member and forgetfulness.

71
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:47.350
But it was important thing is that they originated from the same place.

72
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.970
It is as if Dante,
we're really preparing what,

73
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.310
what we'll move now front stage in po but at least or 33,

74
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.520
namely the notion of a forgetful memory and the importance of forgetful memory.

75
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:04.951
You have to forget and you have to remember and somehow they too are going to,

76
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.510
to be brought together.

77
00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.700
It's not a mystical proposition that he advances.
It's actually the,

78
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.710
uh,
the way of justifying his poem.
And we'll come to that in some detail.

79
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:22.320
I hope in,
uh,
uh,
when we come to Canton 33,
what I would,
uh,

80
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.820
emphasize or to move now to cancer surgery,

81
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.080
Dante's entering into the heavenly Jerusalem,
uh,

82
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:32.770
which is a garden in the facility.
Uh,

83
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.690
and we'll be described as such.
Uh,
you,
you will see in,
um,

84
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.180
well let's turn right now to this images.

85
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.800
Uh,
oh,
this is really cancer 30 line,

86
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.540
a sequence of images aligned.
Uh,
uh,
32,
uh,

87
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.330
I'm sorry,
110.
And following page four,
three,
seven,

88
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.410
I saw a and 12 line,
112,
I saw,

89
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.510
I saw,
um,

90
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:07.610
rising above the light hole around the more than a thousand tears as a many of

91
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.620
us have returned there above the heavenly Jerusalem is first of all,

92
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:18.210
describe as a theater.
And we ought to really think about it for a moment.

93
00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:22.760
The theater and if the lowest rank,
that's the images of the theater,

94
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.260
uh,
where you have in an auditorium today,
tears,
uh,

95
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.180
and closest with it.
It's so great.
The light.
Why is the expense of this rose in?

96
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:35.930
It's what is the expense of this rose in the pharmacy pedals.

97
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.480
The second image is that it's described to describe this,
uh,
uh,

98
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.490
the heavenly Jerusalem is the Rose White rose and mystical rose.

99
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.590
And that can tell you immediate,
this instant is using,

100
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.930
using the image that this is,
uh,

101
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.080
it derives straight out of a a 13th century French poem called the Romance of

102
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:02.160
the Rose,
uh,
with which Dante had translated.

103
00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:04.610
There's a young man into a sequence of Saunas,

104
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.080
part of his experimenting with Poetic Forms,
but it's also,

105
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.080
it's deeply altered because the romance of the Rose,

106
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.870
which is an extraordinary satirical poem,
uh,

107
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.950
tying to a compendium of all knowledge.
It really has,
it's,

108
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.420
it deals with,

109
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.600
it's a story of about nature and about the reason the connections which were

110
00:07:26.401 --> 00:07:30.860
written regional in nature,
but it's also a story with asexual.

111
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.140
Uh,
FIM.

112
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.410
Dante is clearly taking that language of the romance of the rose and literally

113
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.310
spiritualizing reversing it.
But uh,

114
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.320
the resonances of the original poem are still there so that you are forced to

115
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:49.400
think of,
uh,

116
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.440
of the heavenly Jerusalem is also having some kind of materiality,
a within it.

117
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.270
You can not just say,
well,
I'm taking that image,

118
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.320
place it in a different context and hope that the original,
the residues,

119
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:06.350
the traces of the original image are going to be completely phased.

120
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.980
It's part of the strategy of once again hinting,

121
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:15.160
intimating that spirituality and materiality now are still going to be a

122
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.320
converging here.
So that's the archeology,
let's say,

123
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.020
of this image of the rose.
So a discontinuous line,

124
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.640
next paragraph into the yellow of the terminal rose,

125
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.650
which expands,

126
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:36.010
arises in ranks and the sales orders of praise to the sun that makes perpetual

127
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:40.100
spring.
Beatrice drew me as one.

128
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:44.600
We silent and Fein would speak and she said,
behold,

129
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.250
how great is the assembly of the white robes?
He says,

130
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.970
a procession,
a theatrical performance of souls.

131
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:56.880
The whole of paradise is a theatrical performance and whatever we think of

132
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:57.714
theater.

133
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.890
Now let me just reflect a little bit on this image where we think of a theater.

134
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.100
We understand that it implies the reduction of the world to a spectacle.

135
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.640
That's where the theater is.
The world is something to be seen.

136
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.840
It's also an optical phenomenon or a case to put it in another way,

137
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:19.200
which really does not do any violence on the other text.

138
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.060
A question of the representation.

139
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.680
The world is at a presentation implying that I become the spectator.

140
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.890
I am.
It's their representation for me.

141
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.360
I can really watch this world and see it in its whole totality,

142
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:35.830
just as Dante seat the whole of the universe.

143
00:09:35.831 --> 00:09:38.460
And now he can see the whole totality of the blessed.

144
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.270
This is the whole of the heavenly Jerusalem where all the blessed who will be

145
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:47.190
sitting,
enjoying acting and spectating,
uh,

146
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.690
at the same time.
So two,
three things that I want to say here.
On the one hand,

147
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:56.691
the theater is an image of multiple perspectives,

148
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.030
right?
That's where the theater,

149
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.190
that implies you are sitting there and I'm standing here,
um,

150
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.450
multiple perspectives,

151
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.750
but Dante wants to say that he's enjoying an overall perspective of what we call

152
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.740
a perspective of the whole.
He can see the whole of reality.

153
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:18.000
He sees the whole expanse of the horizon of the world.
So in other words,

154
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:19.680
whatever he's saying about himself,

155
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:25.010
it partakes of and it belongs to the totality of the world.

156
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.250
He's not seeing something isolated or disconnected with the rest of the world.

157
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.650
This is to him what legitimizes a claim to be a visionary poet.

158
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.320
To be truly a visual report,

159
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.030
you have to be able to see the whole of reality,

160
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.360
not just like in her sisters,
your own image,

161
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:52.080
not like someone who is bound to one's own perspective.

162
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:56.340
Once home self,
he sees the whore of the world.

163
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.380
And that's really what I think is the claim or the implications are of the image

164
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.430
of the theater.
The first,
uh,
I think that the need some glossing,

165
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.710
behold how great is the assembly of the white robe.
Okay.

166
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.250
Um,
sense of the magnitude of the spectacle.

167
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.120
Then see our city,
how great it is.

168
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.560
It's circuit.
It has been described a little earlier,
eh?

169
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.880
So in terms of a rose and the garden and now it's a city,

170
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.970
that's an interesting shift in Dante's poem.

171
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.550
It's an interesting shift for a number of reasons because the whole poem now

172
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.370
appears as literally a journey from the wilderness,

173
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.140
not to the garden,
but to city of,
to a garden,
which is a city.

174
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:48.350
It is a way of encompassing the whole movement of the poem within this two

175
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.000
figures.
This is it,

176
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:54.580
this as if the whole impulse behind this,

177
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:58.520
this experience of Dante is a reintegration into what is,

178
00:11:58.521 --> 00:12:03.370
it implies the place where many of the people are as if we're only seeing the

179
00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:06.070
world as a whole.
I want to be part of this hall.

180
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.580
And the way of being part of this whole is this political polling,

181
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.450
this city,
uh,
heavily set it to be sure,
but it's,
it has,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the,

182
00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:20.410
the,
the idea of city always implies some human compact,
some human,

183
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.640
uh,
idea of,
uh,
uh,
of,
of,
uh,

184
00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.300
what do we call usually that Paul is the political,
political reality.

185
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.550
Let me just add something else,
which is interesting.

186
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:32.140
In terms of Dante's imagination.

187
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:37.650
We have a compression of images from the pastoral tradition,

188
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.680
the garden,
and the idea of city.

189
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.650
And we do know that when you read pastoral literature,

190
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.790
you really have usually have this juxtaposition.

191
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.740
It's called between the herbs,
which you know,
is the,
uh,
is the,

192
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:58.700
the terms or the urban.
Now they are the city,
uh,
from the,
uh,

193
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.450
from the reus,
the Rustic,
uh,

194
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.890
a division between gardens and cities.
Uh,

195
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.580
this is the economy on which pastoral literature,

196
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.490
eight logs you call colleagues ideals.

197
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.550
Idyllic literature is usually based on,

198
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.790
on this divergence between the two modes of the imagination.

199
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.630
Uh,
I live in the city and then I want to go down into the villa.

200
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.450
I want to go down to the country.

201
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.910
And as if they were to a kind of a,

202
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.980
almost a hint of a schizophrenia existence that you have with a Roman.

203
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.080
And,
and,
and,
and in Greek poetry,

204
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Dante's doing is literally shattering that distance between the two modes in an

205
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:49.210
eschatological perspective and the perspective which is at the end city and

206
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.280
garden come together.

207
00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.960
It is literally a change both in the idea of the city and in the idea of the

208
00:13:55.961 --> 00:14:00.580
garden.
There are no two divergent modes of the imagination.

209
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.750
They're really cool here within one.
You see what the point is?

210
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.760
The point is that no matter what Dante is touching with his imagination,

211
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.130
all the opposition's,

212
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.570
all systems of contraries of contrary forms,

213
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.960
he tries to always bring them together in a kind of concordance.

214
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.260
Discordance made come cold and again,
which is the idea of music.

215
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.370
It kind of harmonization of all this,
uh,

216
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:33.040
this oppositions in everything that he has,
we so far have been seeing.

217
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.810
But now that it's a further image,

218
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:39.990
which is sort of complicates the problem was see our seats so failed that few

219
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:44.170
souls are not wanting there.

220
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:50.070
This is a kind of line which is really strange because it's implying that uh,

221
00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.380
for all us,
all of us late comers,
there's no room,

222
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.380
there's not even standing room there for us.
So as the,
the,

223
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.470
the places have all been taken,
almost all being taken,

224
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.220
very few implication here are going to be saved,

225
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.140
but then one can make this claim.

226
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:11.170
It follows because he really believes that this is a kind of,

227
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:15.850
uh,
that he,
he,
he has had and what we call it,

228
00:15:15.851 --> 00:15:20.330
an apocalyptic vision that the end of the world is near.
Therefore,

229
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:24.680
he can say only a few seats are available or,

230
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.070
which is really the way I think that because I don't think that [inaudible] has

231
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.730
an apocalyptic vision or this was,
hey,
what I mean by apocalyptic vision,

232
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.430
apocalypse means visionary.
He's a visionary.

233
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.730
Apocalyptic means implies the imminence of the ending of history.

234
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.530
I don't think that he has that idea.

235
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:47.531
I call it man who keeps thinking as he does about the renewal or the corruption

236
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.740
of institutions.

237
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:53.741
They hope that some intervention will come from other human beings or of history

238
00:15:54.261 --> 00:15:56.550
king for instance,
or a,

239
00:15:56.551 --> 00:16:01.551
an intervention from the world of grace and not really have a sense of the

240
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.510
imminence,
consummation of history.
You see what I mean?

241
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:09.560
You wouldn't be worried so much about renewing the institutions.

242
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.820
What are then the line then this line is to can be taken from it and that thing

243
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:14.660
has to be taken to me.

244
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.960
Is that seen from the perspective of eternity as he is really there are a few

245
00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:24.530
seats.
You see what I'm saying?
That if you see it in terms of uh,

246
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:26.900
the totality of,
of time,

247
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.390
then they are not a lot of time has been,
has,

248
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.940
has already passed by and then he will continue a haunting image.

249
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:39.941
I think that sort of gives all this talk of this much reflection from city,

250
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:44.600
uh,
whether Dante's or has an apocalyptic imagination or northern apocalyptic

251
00:16:44.601 --> 00:16:46.460
imagination.
Uh,
look at this,

252
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:51.461
how this absence and the in that gray chair on which that I sort of held by the

253
00:16:51.981 --> 00:16:56.430
crown there is already set over it.
An MTC,

254
00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.710
it's taken.
A crown is on it.
A King is going to be selling.

255
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.720
That's what I call it,
haunting image of Rodeo,

256
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.800
our royal absence and royal presence because it's,

257
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:08.360
you'll see it in a moment what it is

258
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.900
before the shelfs or supper.
This nuptials charrettes,

259
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:18.770
the soul which shall be imperial below of Lofty Harry.

260
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:22.910
This is the emperor,
uh,
who actually died in 13,
13,

261
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:27.260
whom Dante was hoping would come down to easily from the holy Roman emperor come

262
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:31.100
down to Italy to set the eatery straight.

263
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:36.030
There is to say to plicate the violence between the cities,
the,

264
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.810
the whole history of Italian communes,

265
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.160
but he had died prematurely and he's expected in heaven.
But you see,

266
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.880
so there is a way in which they've,
the king,
the emperor is beatified.

267
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:52.030
His seed in heaven is to be assured and yet implying that somehow their violence

268
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:58.860
in history is going to be for the time being continued and prolonged.

269
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.960
So a political,
a political interests that political,
uh,

270
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:09.060
uh,
the,
the,
the keeping the holding on to dentist own,
uh,

271
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.650
fantasies or political renewals that gives their,

272
00:18:12.651 --> 00:18:16.410
for the salt of the tempers or views that Dante may have,

273
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.430
an apocalyptic imagination that brine greed,

274
00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:23.380
that big witch's you has made you like the infant,
etc. It,
uh,

275
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.430
and then Dante goes on.
Uh,

276
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:30.530
the other great problem that Canto ends with a final denunciation about Simon

277
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.420
Margolis and the reference to him.
Fair 19.

278
00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:37.140
This is the high to the university.

279
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:40.170
Can Forget Simon Margot's can in federal,

280
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.930
in team and Bonnie for us the eighth,
uh,

281
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:47.931
gets his juice and shall make him of our nine year go pop a if as the A's go

282
00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:50.790
deeper still,
you remember how they were,

283
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
they were punished being upside down in the ditches and the flames of fire,

284
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.870
Pentecostal flames of fire on the soles of their feet.

285
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.360
This is the way they had been twisting around,

286
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:06.900
turning around the gift of prophecy.
Okay,

287
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:11.190
let me just go on to Ken to 31.
Um,

288
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.630
it's really a farewell to Beatrice and I thought that we were expected so much

289
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:20.340
for arrival in Canto 30 of Purgatorio.
We should see how,

290
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.820
uh,
the farewell,
uh,
takes place.

291
00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.080
Uh,
uh,
and so,
uh,

292
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:34.280
let's turn 10 to 31 lines 40.
And uh,

293
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.450
following page four 49,

294
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.700
I who had come to the divine from the human.

295
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.880
This is Dante speaking for himself to the terminal from time and from Florence

296
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:53.030
to people just insane with what I'm [inaudible] must have been filled truly

297
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.920
between that and the joy was contend to hear nothing and to remain silent.

298
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:03.750
And like a pilgrim who is refreshed in the temple of his vow is he looks around

299
00:20:03.751 --> 00:20:05.880
and hope sometime to tell it again.

300
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.350
So taking my way up through the living light,

301
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.920
I carried my eyes through the ranks.
Now up now down,

302
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:15.810
he looks around to see who,

303
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.200
whom he sees and he actually would go on listing the number of,

304
00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:25.570
uh,
blessed women and men that he sees.
Um,

305
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.700
I killed my eyes to the wrench now up and down and they're looking around again.

306
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.740
I saw faces persuasive to charity,

307
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.700
uh,

308
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.300
used to chat it adorned with another's light and with,

309
00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:45.301
they're all smiles so that this blessed are blessed because they are,

310
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.470
there's some,
some other in them,

311
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.030
they are themselves and that is an other in them tool.

312
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.470
And we'll own smiles.
And every movement graced with dignity.

313
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.680
Already my glands had taken in the whole general,

314
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:10.040
um,
taking me the whole general form of paradise,
what I,

315
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.610
what I called earlier,
the vision of the whole,

316
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.880
the totality that he manages to gazes said,

317
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.250
but had not yet well on any part of it.

318
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:23.550
And that turned with new kindle eagerness to question my lady of things in which

319
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:28.140
my mind was in suspense.
We have now eh,
um,

320
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.890
re vision,
Eh,

321
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:35.070
rehashing if you wish of the scene of Virgil's disappearance when Beatrice is

322
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.070
just about to calm Dante.
So all stricken by and,

323
00:21:41.071 --> 00:21:42.010
and,
and,
and,
and,

324
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:47.011
and sees by tremor at the approaching of Beatrice that he turns around to try to

325
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:51.580
see and get comfort from Virgil and Virgil had vanished,

326
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:56.500
who have now a kind of variant of that say,
Ma Vanishing Act.

327
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.500
One thing I intended and another encountered me,

328
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.530
I thought to see Beatrice and I saw an old man,

329
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.300
Bernard of Clairvaux,
the great enemy of,
uh,

330
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.670
um,
the so called of the philosophers,
but I don't want to get into that.

331
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.610
Clue did like that glorious company.

332
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:23.611
His eyes and his cheeks were suffused with a gracious gladness and his aspect

333
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.930
was of such kindness as befits a tender father and where is she?

334
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.490
I said,
in haste,

335
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:35.910
and he replied to end thy longing beauty sent me from my place and if they'll

336
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:42.430
look up to the third circle from the highest tier,
Tasha,

337
00:22:42.431 --> 00:22:44.560
see her again in the throne.

338
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.880
Her merits have assigned a ha without answering.

339
00:22:50.291 --> 00:22:55.291
I lifted my eyes and saw her when she made for herself a crown reflecting from

340
00:22:55.931 --> 00:23:00.931
her the eternal beams from the highest region with thunder snow mortalized so

341
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:05.530
far where it lost in the depth of the seas was my site they have from Beatrice,

342
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.100
but to me it made no difference for her.

343
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:13.170
Image came down to me and limbed by art between Oh lady,

344
00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:15.441
here he goes,
oh,

345
00:23:15.441 --> 00:23:20.441
now and who my hope has its strength and who does bear for my salvation to leave

346
00:23:20.621 --> 00:23:21.760
their footprints in hell?

347
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.480
Of all the things that I've seen acknowledged that grace and the virtual to

348
00:23:25.481 --> 00:23:28.570
brief from that power and from like goodness,
it is now,

349
00:23:28.571 --> 00:23:31.570
who has drawn me from bondage into liberty.

350
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.160
The great theme of Liberty that we have been discussing,
uh,

351
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.750
especially in purgatory.
Uh,
fancy.
Also,
it's,

352
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.110
it's sealed here in the presence of Beatrice,
uh,
et cetera.

353
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:48.900
Uh,
so this is a,
now he turns to the Faithful,
uh,

354
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:50.480
Bernard,
uh,

355
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.540
you better remember that 10 to 29 ended with,

356
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.740
uh,
uh,

357
00:23:57.741 --> 00:24:01.730
Beatrice very worried that Dante has been expounding.

358
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:06.380
You Remember Canto 28,
29,
they'd been the exposition about angels,

359
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.600
the exposition about creation,
creation as an act of God's love,

360
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:16.820
um,
the,
the ordering and the new ranks of a,

361
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:20.980
of,
of angelic [inaudible] angelic choir.
And then,
uh,

362
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:26.000
Beatrice gets very upset because,
uh,
the,

363
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:31.030
the holy shoe seemed to be to her way of thinking more about the appearance of

364
00:24:31.941 --> 00:24:35.210
things rather than the truths of saints.
You remember that,
uh,

365
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.300
she attacks as human beings on earth.
They do,

366
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.900
they do nothing else then go after false appearances.

367
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:45.440
We are swayed by false appearances.
So that the question was,

368
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:50.600
what does she mean that the truth is she was saying,
let's get back to some,

369
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:55.130
let's bring,
bring,
bring some kind of sense of the real back into play.

370
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.450
In all of this sense of the,
of,
of the truth value,

371
00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:03.340
what we are saying back into this representation.
Uh,
and that was the way it was.

372
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:08.380
The weekend or 29 stopped with Beatrice suspicious of appearances.

373
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.200
Dante now gets into Canto 30 and 31 and goes back to the passion of appearances

374
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.790
and says that to Beatrice that the appearance is exactly what the image is

375
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:27.491
exactly what he has preserved is going to preserve of two things and what they

376
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:33.080
have to be follow from this.
Are you with me in all of this,
uh,
issue,

377
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:37.640
Dante saying here in the encounter with Beatrice,
uh,
uh,

378
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.710
the highest with our answer or lift up my eyes.

379
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:44.711
And so how will she made herself a crown reflecting from her the turn beam.

380
00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.740
This is the language of emerge in the language of reflections.

381
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:53.500
What Dante is saying to Beatrice is that we are always in a world of images and

382
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:58.610
that somehow the images,
the images,
the locals of the sacredness,

383
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.970
but the images also has its own fleet in quality.

384
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.130
And the journey of Dante's to go between the images and the essences.

385
00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.460
Now he's preparing for the final leap.

386
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.690
This is to say that none of this journey was not a journey to be addressed.

387
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.240
It's going to be a journey to God.

388
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.330
Beatrice is a stepping stone for the pilgrims,
uh,
uh,

389
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.420
entering the experience of the beatific vision.

390
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:30.950
So this is what I want to,
uh,
to emphasize.
And in fact,

391
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:37.120
Ken two three one ends with like one that comes line one on 13th,

392
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.580
like one that comes perhaps from Croatia to see our Veronica Veronica is an

393
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:50.751
illusion to one of the pious women who during the calvary ascent of Jesus,

394
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.080
he said to have wiped his face.

395
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.640
And the face of Jesus remained imprinted on her veil.

396
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.680
And so that Veronika became,
uh,
the,
it's the name of the woman Veronica,

397
00:27:04.681 --> 00:27:09.681
but it was sort of understood in the hollow middle ages as Vera it Kona.

398
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:15.720
This was the kind of phony to be sure etymology given to the Veronica.

399
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.460
It was Dante's evoking.
Now the pilgrims who come to,

400
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.640
who got to Rome from Croatia to see the true image left imprinted on the veil of

401
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:31.080
the Veronica.
This is where Dante himself.
Yes,

402
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.940
he is like one of those pilgrims who still seeing the image but wants to move

403
00:27:35.941 --> 00:27:39.780
beyond images,
wants to go and see what lies behind it.

404
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.990
The journey of the divine comedy is the journey within that interstice between

405
00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.170
images and essences.
Uh,
so to speak.

406
00:27:49.171 --> 00:27:52.500
This is Veronica and we're old.
Hunger is never satisfied,

407
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.890
but he says with himself,
as long as this shown my Lord Jesus Christ,

408
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:58.560
very guard was this then your true semblance.

409
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.090
Such was eye gazing on the living charity of him.

410
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:07.950
Who in this world tasted by contemplation of the piece.
So,
uh,

411
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.690
that's how we can,
we are ready to get into Canto 33,

412
00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.620
uh,
which is the final canto and the final vision.

413
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.430
Let's see how Dante carries that off.
And uh,
uh,

414
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.290
let me begin with,
um,
with uh,
uh,

415
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.330
saying a couple of things that are,

416
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.530
there are a number of dramas that will go or are going to be unfolding in Canton

417
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:35.484
33.

418
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:45.170
The first drama is that of a pilgrim who wants to see the face of God,

419
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.950
wants to see the face of God,

420
00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:54.951
wants to preserve the width so that he can be come back and be a,

421
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:59.340
can be able to come back and re retail the story,

422
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.590
tell the story,
write the poem as a witnessing to the vision,

423
00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:05.450
his head.
So it's a,

424
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.790
it's a way of thinking about the relationship between vision and language.

425
00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:14.260
If you want to say it in a very general way are how are the two related to each

426
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:19.410
other?
But the real,
the other drama is how is he going to remember,

427
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:23.940
can he remember in number four,
what does he really see?
These are the,

428
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.330
the number of,
uh,
problems that he faces.

429
00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:30.910
The poem begins with the,

430
00:29:30.911 --> 00:29:34.800
the Canto 33 begins with a prayer,
a prayer to the Virgin,

431
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.210
a Virgin Mary or the virgin mother.
Uh,
and it's,

432
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.300
it's going to be constructed through a series of paradoxes.

433
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:49.690
As you can see,
virgin mother,
ah,
paradoxes,

434
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:54.380
daughter over your son paradox about time,
pedagogues,

435
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.760
about all sorts of reversals of the natural,
older,

436
00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.080
a lowly and exalted more than any creature and where you're off of using

437
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:08.671
paradoxes that challenge the rational understanding of the world.

438
00:30:09.761 --> 00:30:14.410
This is not going to be irrational representation of a,
of what Dante was.

439
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:18.130
See fixed goal of the turtle counsel.
You are,

440
00:30:18.131 --> 00:30:23.131
she who did so unknowable human nature that it's maker did not disdain to be

441
00:30:24.401 --> 00:30:27.910
made.
It's making in your womb.

442
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.440
So Dante goes on now to that Motif of birth with which we began talking from in

443
00:30:36.321 --> 00:30:41.080
fair,
no one when we discussed the Virgil,
this idea of uh,

444
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.010
the,
the,
the beginning,
the idea of a beginning of birth.

445
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.110
It's an image of beginning and an image of a,
um,

446
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:53.530
nature becoming an event.
The idea of nature becoming a historical event.

447
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:56.580
The possibility of it is historical event nay,
um,

448
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.150
in thy wound was rekindled the love,
but who's warmth?
This flower,

449
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:01.961
the flower.

450
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:06.910
This flower really means the whole of the mystical rose that he has just seen.

451
00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:09.340
So the mystical rose begins in,

452
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.580
it's contained in the womb of Mary has broom that's in the eternal peace.

453
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.570
Um,
it's another way of,
uh,
of,

454
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.260
of making this,
uh,

455
00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.000
this idea of I could close this image of the womb as,
uh,

456
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.230
in terms of this is the men's sphere of the mistakes.
Yeah.

457
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.530
Within which,
you know,
the men's field within which,
uh,
uh,

458
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:41.910
the finite and infinite come together and meet the immense fear.

459
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:47.680
It's a circle,
the immense via whose,
whose,
whose center is nowhere,
uh,

460
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:52.000
or whose center is everywhere,
whose circumference is nowhere.

461
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.990
That's the way he's understanding.
And he's explaining,
uh,
uh,

462
00:31:55.991 --> 00:31:57.750
this motif of the,
the,

463
00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.570
the incarnation and what is crucial about this image.

464
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.340
I believe it's first of all,
the humanization of the divine cannot.

465
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.420
This is clearly,
uh,

466
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.620
the divine that becomes divine because it enters history and experiences all

467
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:16.270
that,
the human being's experience.

468
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:21.750
The other element that I think that Dante is pushing forth is the feminization

469
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.690
of the divine in the sense that here,
uh,

470
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:31.950
the divine has become the child of a woman and the woman is therefore part a

471
00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:37.920
taste subsumed as part of this divine,
a kind of feminine.
Uh,

472
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.490
I don't call it is,
I don't really know what that is,

473
00:32:40.491 --> 00:32:44.800
but the feminine and that'll mean that this,
uh,
in,
in,
in,
in,
uh,
it's,

474
00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:48.110
it's a true statement.
I don't know.
Uh,
but it's a feminine,

475
00:32:48.111 --> 00:32:52.400
a theology of Feminine Element in God.
Uh,

476
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.990
so here that water to the moon,

477
00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:58.010
they torch of charity and below I'm a maltose or living spring of hope.

478
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.230
And then the second,
uh,

479
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.740
stylistic theme here is the repetition,

480
00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.230
the iterative mode.

481
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:11.530
Thou lady here skip a few lines and thy loving kindness in his mercy,

482
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:16.640
in the PT,
in the great bounty in the is joined or goodness,

483
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:17.600
they're in a recruiter.

484
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:23.230
What is the point of this iterativeness of the style of reputations,

485
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.190
of Anna Forex style?
I think one of the reasons you may think of others,

486
00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:33.191
but one of the reasons is a language that is falling upon itself as a way of

487
00:33:33.321 --> 00:33:35.810
giving consistency to itself.

488
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.480
The appointment is tied at this point is really dealing with a vanishing

489
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:42.314
tracers.

490
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:47.890
I think that not quite be pinpointed or placed within logical propositions.

491
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:53.650
And therefore the language becomes incantatory as if it were an effort to create

492
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:59.540
a kind of a mood,
sort of a creating a reality through this,

493
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:02.480
uh,
uh,
this mood and do through these iterations.

494
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.600
And then the prayer of Bernard continues this man and in the pilgrim line 30,

495
00:34:09.381 --> 00:34:10.010
20,

496
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:14.660
this man who from the northernmost pit of the universe to here has seen one by

497
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:19.661
one the lives of the spirits in our bags of the but I grace for such power that

498
00:34:20.901 --> 00:34:25.760
with his eyes he may rise still higher towards the reservation.
And I,

499
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.510
this is extraordinary.
We are in a paradise

500
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.570
so far.

501
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.680
Not to stray so far from the temptations of mystical writing,

502
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:42.700
which ends up is evoking identities are represented on representable identities.

503
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.480
Dante distinguishes very carefully to till the end with an eye and he,

504
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:50.040
ah,

505
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.040
there are individualities in this paradise of Dante's imagination and die.

506
00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:00.740
This is Bernard who never burned from my own vision more than I do for his see

507
00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:01.460
the differences.

508
00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.460
I and him are offered to the all my prayers and pray that their capital short,

509
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.410
that polite prayers that will disperse for him every cloud of his mortality.

510
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.900
So the supreme joy may be disclosed to him.

511
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.000
That's the first prayer to the virgin.

512
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:21.410
This I prayed to the queen who can stick with our will that they'll keep his

513
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:24.020
affections pure after.
So greater vision.

514
00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:29.090
So the first danger to the pilgrim is that he may be losing literally his mind.

515
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.950
Uh,
the vision of God.

516
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:36.190
May it face my obliterate his powers of this vision [inaudible] the powers and

517
00:35:38.371 --> 00:35:42.120
the affections,
let that guardianship control his human impulses.

518
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:46.410
See Beatrice and so many of the blessed who clasp their hands for my prayer is

519
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:47.460
an extraordinary vision.

520
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.930
The whole of the cosmos is pray for the beauty.
Dan,

521
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.010
the pilgrims,
beatific vision,

522
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.210
the eyes by God beloved and real and die.

523
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:01.680
This is who was drawing near to the end of all desires.
I am.

524
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.670
I want to emphasize this,
even this language of desire up to now,

525
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.460
the poem has been,
can be called literally,

526
00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:11.850
we could have been calling it so many things,
pulling of hope,
a poem of peace.

527
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.330
It's a poem of exile,
a poem of desire,

528
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.490
Paul of longing.

529
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:22.510
And the prayer is the mode of this longing prayer.
You,

530
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.590
you address,
someone you don't see,

531
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:29.580
hoping that you can be heard and that that your prayers can be answered.

532
00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:31.800
There's a desire for a response.

533
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.760
This is really the mode of Dante's theology.
Uh,

534
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.740
at the heart of his theological universe.

535
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:42.910
There is a sense of constant longing in the sense of being not quite where he

536
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:46.770
wants to be.
Um,
and that who was drawing near to the end of our desires.

537
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.570
I emphasize in that prepare you in case I will not make a point about that very

538
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:56.550
soon,
the language of Dante will change from desire to enjoyment.

539
00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:02.180
He starts getting the sense of the sweetness and this idea of the fullness of,

540
00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:08.130
uh,
of his,
his,
his,
his pleasures are desire we'll shift into,

541
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:12.690
into joy very soon,
uh,
ended before.
So the order of my craving,

542
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:17.160
Bernard signed to me with a smile to look upward,
but radio of myself,

543
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:22.161
I was doing what he wished for my site becoming pure was entering more and more

544
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.800
through the beam of the lofty light,
which in itself is true.

545
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.050
And now the first defeat,
Dante starts recording,

546
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:38.280
um,
the forgetfulness of the experience.

547
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.800
From that moment,
first of all,

548
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:45.060
my vision was greater than a speech with fails.

549
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.380
It's such a site.

550
00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:51.420
How are you going to make a failure become a success?

551
00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:57.050
How from the fact that he is not going to be able to see will become somehow a

552
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:00.510
mode of his own,
not just the humility,

553
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.990
because it would be a success in terms of the pilgrims on humility.

554
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.880
But in terms of the writing of the poem and the right of the poem will be,

555
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.700
there will be a different way of understanding the problem.

556
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.060
You're not just wanting to be a representation of where plenitude of vision,

557
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:16.470
but till the end,

558
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.680
the statement of a longing for a vision that may come and the memory to fails

559
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:26.940
has such access.
Access in Italian is really the language.

560
00:38:26.941 --> 00:38:30.270
I don't know the probably the English is best etymologically it's the same
thing,

561
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.040
but in Italian is the outrage,
outrage,

562
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.290
the sense in which,
uh,
uh,
with,
with,

563
00:38:38.291 --> 00:38:42.160
with the restaurants that that is something,
uh,
uh,
two bold,

564
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:47.180
so an over a kind of hyperbolic and overreaching or is that's really what it is.

565
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:52.630
An access as an overreaching like him that season a dream and after the dream

566
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:57.150
that passion wrote by remains and the rest returns not to his mind,

567
00:38:57.151 --> 00:39:01.720
such a [inaudible] from a vision almost wholly,
almost,

568
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:06.700
almost wholly fades and still their drops within my heart.

569
00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.910
The sweetness that was born from it,

570
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.720
that's all he's going to be left with the sweetness that gathers in the chamber

571
00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:20.050
of the heart.
This has been a journey of the heart.

572
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.790
It is because as I've been saying to you in a number of ways,

573
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:28.110
in that in the past few weeks is the,
the,
the,

574
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.040
the journey to God is a journey of the mind,
but it's a journey of the heart.

575
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:38.200
You have to,
you will come to know God through this idea of the heart.
But also,

576
00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:43.630
you know,
that is really punning on the notion of what memory is.

577
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.220
Because to him,
memory is connected also with the hearth.

578
00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:54.890
What can I remember?
What can I record within me?
Ah,
what is this,

579
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:59.100
this uh,
uh,
uh,
and the only thing that memory can,
can,

580
00:39:59.101 --> 00:40:03.660
can retrieve is this sweetness of the heart.
Such a,
uh,

581
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:05.160
and then he continues.

582
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.140
That's the snow loses its imprint in the sun.

583
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

584
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:16.820
<v 0>The image of the liquefaction of shapes,
the loss of shapes,</v>

585
00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.073
um,

586
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:23.150
water that had been crystallized just dissolves and then an emerge,

587
00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:27.740
which brings us back to the Aeneid.
The third book,

588
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:32.690
the Aeneid that's in the wind on the light leaves the symbols.

589
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:37.190
Oracle was lost.
This is the idea when a,
when an e is,

590
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:41.840
goes to the Sibos cave to find out about the future,
his future,

591
00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:46.610
and it's the symbol opens the gates,
the wind comes and uh,

592
00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:48.080
and,
and,
and uh,

593
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.860
we'll go on scattering all the leaves kept with it.

594
00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:56.860
And so it's the possibility of reading and in visibility of decipher and,

595
00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:01.970
uh,
the actual live tech sort of messiness and confusion.
That's exactly this.

596
00:41:01.971 --> 00:41:06.971
The state of mind in which he seems to find himself all lights Supreme

597
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:11.240
Dantanna's shifts to another mode on his own.
And of course,
sequence of prayers,

598
00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:16.140
all light supreme,
they are so far exalted above,
um,

599
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:21.350
more tokens conceiving grant to my mind,
again,

600
00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.620
a little of what our peers and give my tongue.
This is,

601
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:29.100
this is the kind of the prayer of a,
this is the prayer of,
uh,

602
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:33.800
uh,
that,
uh,
language May,
uh,
missing a page here.

603
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.810
So,
um,
uh,
this is the prayer that somehow language now,

604
00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:42.350
uh,
may triumph over him over,

605
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:47.090
over the threats of forgetfulness.
Forgetfulness threatens him.

606
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:50.540
Why am I insisting so much that it may leave,

607
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:55.190
but a gleam of the glory to the people yet to come?
Uh,

608
00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.800
what Dante is saying is that his poem is meant for the future.

609
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:06.350
Then in effect,
he's am visioning a future.
This is not a poem written for him.

610
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.010
It's not a poem report written for his contemporaries.

611
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.450
It's a positing of a future is to say the opening up to,

612
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.010
and that's what work we'll do.

613
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.480
A work of art invents and prepares a future.

614
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:25.870
So more than an act of remembrance and the commemoration that poem will be what

615
00:42:26.931 --> 00:42:27.764
we call it.

616
00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:33.040
I hope it's a prolapses a proleptic move and movement forward into the future.

617
00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:37.970
But why do I talk so much about memory that nothing seems to be becoming now

618
00:42:37.971 --> 00:42:42.590
utopian.
Uh,
lend me some of your glory.
Let me see your glory.

619
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:47.591
So that spark of it may be left in my text so that the future will understand

620
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:52.070
that and we'll see.
And some fire can come from that spark.

621
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.070
But why this then language,
this insistence on memory?

622
00:42:56.330 --> 00:42:58.070
Because that's the answer.

623
00:42:58.071 --> 00:43:00.890
He's talks about retrieving the memory of what he has seen.

624
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.990
Because the actual constitution of his poem,

625
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.120
he can only write this poem.

626
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.020
He can only have some authority for his voice

627
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:18.520
if he remembers what he has seen in order to ground the poem in the,

628
00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.790
the notion into the,
the vision of God.

629
00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:26.700
Therefore we'll authorize him to say all the things he has been saying about the

630
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:31.520
living and the living and the dead,
the powerful,
and then also powerful,

631
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:34.790
the historical figures and the cultural figures of the past.

632
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:37.010
It's crucial for him to remember.

633
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:42.370
So that memory becomes the actual foundation of his representation.

634
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.620
He has to bring it back,
make,

635
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:50.340
give it a presence to what has gone on in his,
his experience.

636
00:43:50.341 --> 00:43:54.560
And you see what I mean?
So He's forced to go on remembering and yet he cannot.

637
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:59.300
How is it going?
Well does his authority come from then?
If he can't remember,

638
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.400
and he says he can remember very little,

639
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.430
only the sweetness that has been gathering in the,
in his heart.

640
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:08.120
Where does it come from?
And this is the third,

641
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.490
fourth challenge of the poem.

642
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:14.480
I think he continues from the keenest endured of the living

643
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.940
array that I should have been dazzled if my eyes had been turned from it.

644
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.370
And I remember that for this course,

645
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:26.690
I was the boldest sustain it until I reached with my gaze,
the infinite goodness.

646
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.053
Once again,

647
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:34.380
breaking the additive and turning into the meditative prayer,

648
00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.120
sort of begging,

649
00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:41.400
that's the the divine may reveal itself and remain within or bounding grace but

650
00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:43.940
which are there to fix my local,

651
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:48.960
the eternal light so long that I spent all my site upon it in its depth.

652
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.190
That's what he sees.

653
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.830
I saw that it contained the cosmos.

654
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.050
I said book,
that's it.
The whole world.

655
00:44:58.051 --> 00:45:02.610
I called it last time at Cosmo book that Cosmos as a book,

656
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.660
I say as a,
as a,
as a,

657
00:45:06.661 --> 00:45:08.550
as a parchment maybe,

658
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:13.050
but he uses also the image of a book which is different from a volume.

659
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:14.610
The volume is rolled up.

660
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.640
The book is the one which we have a kind of a square structure and the two

661
00:45:21.091 --> 00:45:25.260
together,
uh,
as a kind of allegory wrapped up.
So,
uh,

662
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:29.100
I think I saw a in its depth,
I saw that it contained,

663
00:45:29.101 --> 00:45:31.950
bound by loves in one volume.

664
00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:37.830
That was the word that had used for Virgil at the beginning of the poem or a way

665
00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.080
to give,
continue with it to his,

666
00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:45.140
his quest and his questions begins with the volume of Virgil's book and that the

667
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.960
virtuous book became a,

668
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.120
becomes a prefigure ration of the book of the Cosmos that he sees bound

669
00:45:54.661 --> 00:45:55.494
together,

670
00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.990
that which is scattered in leaves through the universe substances and accents

671
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:05.370
and their relations as it were fused together in such a way that what a tell of

672
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:06.870
it is a simple light.

673
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:12.230
I think I saw the universal form of this complex is compound because in telling

674
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:16.690
of it,
I feel my joy x band.

675
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.420
Now it's the retrieval of or other,
the,
the,
the recovery of this,

676
00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.940
this,
this state of mind,
which is one of drawing which doesn't,

677
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.350
which excludes absence.
Desire has to be replaced by Joel builds.

678
00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:33.750
Desire always entails an absence.

679
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:38.790
We long for what we do not have,
at least at that moment,
right?

680
00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:42.990
Desire is always tied to an experience of lacking.

681
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:48.410
Joy is a tide is tied to an experience of plenitude of a procession somehow at

682
00:46:49.111 --> 00:46:53.970
this point.
And now another mythological figure that I want to focus on,

683
00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.033
um,

684
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.880
a single moment makes for me deeper oblivion.

685
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.120
You see now the,
uh,

686
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:09.170
the dialectics between memory that fails and the Bolivian does its memory and

687
00:47:09.571 --> 00:47:13.950
efforts that remembering and the reality of forgetfulness.
This is the,

688
00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:19.090
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the dialectic between the two metaphors together.
Uh,

689
00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:23.550
it's single moment makes for me deeper oblivion than five.

690
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:27.330
Um,
I'll have time,
a single moment when it's with deeper Bolivia,

691
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:32.540
then five and 20 centuries upon the enterprise that made Neptune wonder at the

692
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:38.230
shadow of the Argo what an extraordinary hemorrhage,

693
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:40.960
right?
Single moment.

694
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:46.120
It's clearly an image to say that I forgot more,
uh,
in one second.

695
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.230
So time doesn't exist here.
It exists in Dante.

696
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.950
Dante still being human.
He still time,
you know,

697
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:57.850
time is at least he can only,
his life can only be measured by time,

698
00:47:57.851 --> 00:48:01.430
but it's in the presence of the eternal incident.
But a single instance,

699
00:48:01.431 --> 00:48:02.680
these is literally,

700
00:48:02.681 --> 00:48:07.681
I'm just closing this single instance made me forget more than what we have

701
00:48:07.811 --> 00:48:12.811
forgotten in 25 centuries from the experience of the Argo allusion to the

702
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:18.220
argonauts and our mythological counter to Dante's own journey.

703
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:22.530
They went for the,
Jason went for the Golden Fleece.

704
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:27.640
Dante's going for the peer visual.
Another,
another little connection.

705
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:32.560
The Canto wonder of Paradiso starts with a reference to the story of the

706
00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:35.950
argonauts,
uh,
the daring of the argonauts.

707
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.580
And now Dante is closing the circle here once again,

708
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.170
but there's a further something else then the story of the organoids is done to

709
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:48.340
retrieves it is that the god is now below.

710
00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:51.850
Neptune is in the depth.
And,
uh,

711
00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:56.940
Dante is now thinking of the divine as being also caught in its hone,

712
00:48:57.470 --> 00:49:01.000
unreachable,
unfathomable depth,
which is a height.
But you see,

713
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:04.800
there are two different perspectives.
More importantly here,

714
00:49:04.801 --> 00:49:07.900
Dante sees Neptune one very good.

715
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:12.901
The daring of man just as Neptune is wondering at the varying of the argonauts.

716
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:18.100
The implication is that he too,
I said this kind of dating,

717
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:22.630
that the divine,
the God may be wondering at his,
uh,

718
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:23.770
his own achievement.

719
00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:28.890
What is crucial is the change of perspective from the depth depth of underneath

720
00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:33.970
the sea to the depth.
I'm up in,
uh,
up in the sky,

721
00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.780
up in the heavens for a dentist,
God.

722
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.820
And then he continues to pass my mind.
Mine.
Dante's so careful.

723
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:46.010
I wish we had time about this to show you.
I mean,

724
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:49.840
I know that there are some graduate students who may want to think about this

725
00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:54.610
whole issue.
How Dante,
Dante's lexicon about mind,

726
00:49:55.030 --> 00:50:00.030
intellect reason is so carefully calibrated and differentiated mind is the

727
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.640
Faculty of Visionary Ness.
It's,
it's,
uh,
it's also the,

728
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.870
it's also the root word of measure.
As you know,

729
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:14.760
Latin etymology is the medieval medieval reminds our,

730
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.660
I always taken with the discovery of the rule words.
It's men's.

731
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:23.000
There was men may measure,
uh,

732
00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.510
comes from the immense,

733
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:28.070
for instance comes from the word for mind.

734
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.220
It is a fee still keeping a sense of the measure for himself.

735
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:38.680
He's still aware of his own particular state is not lost in the immensity of

736
00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:44.180
what's around him.
That's my mind.
All wrapped was gazing fixed,

737
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:48.320
still an intent.
And in kindle with gazing at that light,

738
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:52.520
when becomes such that it's impossible him ever to consent that it should turn

739
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:54.470
from it to another site for the good,

740
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:58.550
which is the object of the will is all gathered in it and apart from it is

741
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.150
defective that will ship which,
which there is perfect.

742
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:05.030
Now language fails,
memory fails.

743
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.000
The second failure is that of speech.

744
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:13.030
Now my speech will come more short even or whatever I remember than an infant.

745
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.180
And you know that the word infant,
which usually things take to be um,

746
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.800
the child literally means a child who cannot speak.
You refer,

747
00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:29.810
you use the word infant for someone who is pre,
uh,
were babbling even right.

748
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:34.340
That's the infant really.
So far,
far in Latin means to speak and infants.

749
00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:38.450
We at Bates his tongue at the breast,
not that the living light,

750
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.400
which I guess had more than a single aspect for it is ever the same as it was

751
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:44.150
before.

752
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:48.800
But my site gaining strength is I looked the ones who'll appearance,

753
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:51.600
I mean I,
myself changing was for me,

754
00:51:51.601 --> 00:51:56.601
transformed in the profound and clear ground of the lofty light appeared to me.

755
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.840
That's the visionary.

756
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:04.840
He has three circles of three callers and the same,

757
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:08.480
the same extent.
And the one seemed reflected by the other.

758
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:13.780
S Rainbow by rainbow in the third seemed fire breeded fourth equally from the

759
00:52:14.871 --> 00:52:17.000
one and the other.
Oh,

760
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:21.980
how scanned his speech and her feeble to my conception.

761
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:26.090
It ends with an avoidable statement of failure,

762
00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.770
a failure of memory.

763
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:32.780
So the memory can be forgetful memory and the failure of speech and able to

764
00:52:33.681 --> 00:52:36.350
contain that plenty to do what he sees.

765
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.950
Vision exceeds language,
seeds,

766
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:44.430
a speech there is more to the text,

767
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:49.450
Dante saying there's more to my experience of the world then what I can say in

768
00:52:50.541 --> 00:52:51.230
words.

769
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:56.230
So there is not everything is reducible or containable within the uh,

770
00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:00.050
uh,
the syllable of,
of uh,
of our,

771
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:05.051
of our language and this to what I saw is that it's enough to call it little or

772
00:53:05.501 --> 00:53:09.950
like a terminal.
Once again they are alone or by this and die self.

773
00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:15.220
A divine that is now are caught within itself and this is self contained.

774
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:22.490
Look at this in thy self alone knows theirself and known to the self and knowing

775
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.700
lovest and smiles on myself.

776
00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:29.890
This is the kind of inner and closure or circularity of the divine in Italian.

777
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:35.490
I have to read through the tenant.
So you'll see line one 23,

778
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:39.450
um oh Lou [inaudible] loan 25,

779
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:44.451
maybe all Lucita solar intact CD solar thing 10.

780
00:53:47.621 --> 00:53:52.621
The older you understand yourself a that they internet and then the I ami air.

781
00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:59.960
Really see how the words keep repeating it flat falling on themselves to convey

782
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.920
the idea of the self enclosed nature.

783
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:09.660
Now this is this something that all his escapes,

784
00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:14.740
Huh?
Uh,
our grasp and escapes Dante's grab some,
Eh,
uh,

785
00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.390
for all of the diffusive nearness of God in the creation,

786
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:23.450
there's an element of the divine that literally is absolutely
self-transcendence,

787
00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.790
just transcends itself.
A completely that's circling,
which that's big,

788
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:32.610
appeared in this reflected light.
When my eyes dwelt on it for a time,

789
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:37.770
seem to meet within it and it's home color painted with our likeness.

790
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:39.210
That's how he sees.

791
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:43.620
He sees our own as he calls it,

792
00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:46.200
a fog line.

793
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:50.700
One 31 nostra a feature our likeness.

794
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:52.950
It didn't say my likeness.

795
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:58.010
It's a poor metaphor that at the end seems to one to retrieve the con,

796
00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.950
the commonality of the common likeness that we have.

797
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.570
What he sees is the incarnation,

798
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:08.550
the human image within God.
Because in God,

799
00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:10.890
that is also the human.
Since we are,

800
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:16.200
if you agree with the principle that we are,
are creations of God,

801
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:18.750
uh,
and that we were created in his image.

802
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:23.520
So therefore there's something human also within the divine.

803
00:55:23.521 --> 00:55:28.200
And then he continues like the geometer who sets his mind to the squaring of the

804
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:31.830
circle,
a famous mathematical served in the Middle Ages,

805
00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:33.870
meaning what of the impossible,

806
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.830
one of the impossible paradoxes of how do you square the circle and the

807
00:55:37.831 --> 00:55:41.030
Geometer's would go on and reflecting on it.
And that's what I'm talking about.

808
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:43.640
Enterprises himself,
the,
the,

809
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:47.920
the science of measurement that,
uh,
uh,

810
00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:52.860
stumbles against this paradox that the geometer and fails like the geometer who

811
00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.220
sets his mind to the squaring of the circle and for his thinking,

812
00:55:56.221 --> 00:56:01.221
there's not discover the principal he needs such will die as a strange sight.

813
00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:06.650
I wish to see how the image was fitted to the circle and how it has its place

814
00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:08.970
there,
but my own wings,

815
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:14.580
the flight of the soul,
the wings of the soul,
right?

816
00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:16.290
The wings of the soul.
You know,

817
00:56:16.291 --> 00:56:20.860
the platonic idea that we go on developing wings,
you know,

818
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.370
the two arrows,
I'm lousy us to prep,

819
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:27.330
to unfold a wings for the site was all,
and it's also pun,

820
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.210
I think on a,
uh,
on Dante's owner name.

821
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:35.170
We've been talking about that we're not sufficient for that had not my mind been

822
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:39.070
smitten by Flash,
but hidden came.
It's swish here.

823
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:43.570
Power failed the high fantasy.
Um,

824
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.520
how many fantasies are there?
There are three.

825
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:49.120
The highest form of the imagination.
That's what he means there.
Eh,

826
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.190
pretty romantic distinction.

827
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:55.830
I mean Coleridge between imagination and fantasy.
Dante,
uh,

828
00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.240
follows up.
Nantais belongs in that same line of thinking.

829
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:05.490
But now my desire and will like a wheel that spins with even motion would evolve

830
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:10.570
by the love that moves the sun and the other stars.

831
00:57:10.571 --> 00:57:14.890
And that's the end of the poem.
Uh,
which hands exactly the way,
uh,

832
00:57:14.891 --> 00:57:17.440
with Dante doing two things.
One,

833
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:21.340
seeing the prime mover and understanding the prime mover,

834
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:26.350
not the way he did at the beginning of Paradiso.
One but love it wasn't the,

835
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:30.770
the,
the,
the I,
the definition of God is the prime mover.
You remember simple,

836
00:57:30.771 --> 00:57:32.860
have a limitation for Dante was a prime mover,

837
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:37.810
moves the universe and somehow then detaches.
This engages himself from it.

838
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:42.070
Now Dante theses that primal,
the motion is emotion of love.

839
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:47.310
The Universe is a universe of love but holds the world together and prevents it

840
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:52.720
from falling apart is exactly this power prevents it from chaos.

841
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:56.440
It's this power called love.
So the whole of the universe is in motion.

842
00:57:56.680 --> 00:58:01.630
Love that moves the sun and other stars and the only thing stable,

843
00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.520
the only thing that makes it go here is,
uh,

844
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.720
is this love by using the same language of love that moves the sun and the other

845
00:58:10.631 --> 00:58:12.970
starts.
Okay.
It's universe of love and the stand that,

846
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.200
<v 1>yeah,</v>

847
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.260
<v 0>none.
He uses the,</v>

848
00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:16.700
<v 1>okay.</v>

849
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:20.160
<v 0>See metrically the same.
The same phrase.</v>

850
00:58:20.161 --> 00:58:23.250
The stars moves the sun and the other stars in new fair.

851
00:58:23.251 --> 00:58:27.840
No at the end of the phone or the end of purgatory.
Fair.
Remember that.

852
00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:31.410
And then now I was,
I,
I was so cleanse.

853
00:58:31.411 --> 00:58:34.110
Then off we'll come back and look at the stars,

854
00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:39.140
the handle purgatorio and then now verge or not finally managed to come back and

855
00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:42.300
see the stars.
Non-Thesis says,
ah,
the,

856
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:44.670
the love that moves the sun and the other stars.

857
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.000
What he's really doing is placing himself immediately with this line right back

858
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.910
on earth.
He's here with us looking up at the stars.

859
00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.620
It's the line that shifts,

860
00:58:55.621 --> 00:59:00.540
allows him to shift from the moment of this vision that he has a vision that is

861
00:59:00.541 --> 00:59:02.640
the vision of uh,
of the incarnation.

862
00:59:02.641 --> 00:59:06.180
At the end is we'll say his own our own likeness.

863
00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:09.960
So he sees us all getting members and then comes back to earth.

864
00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:15.140
But it also means that this line places Dante exactly in federal one,

865
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:22.490
and this is the story of the poem,
this thought of the port.

866
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:27.790
We have been reading the poem as an account of an experience of a pilgrim who

867
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:32.360
goes from the dark wood in fair,
no one to the beatific vision,

868
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:36.170
whatever he remembers of it and then comes back to tell us about it.

869
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.300
What in effect we are also discovering in this reading of the poem is that by

870
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:44.960
the end of the poem Dante says,
now my journey started,

871
00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:47.210
the real journey was this poem here.

872
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.600
So we are in a sense by that last line caught in the circle of dentist telling

873
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.240
in the drum of Dante's story,
we read the poem,

874
00:59:56.241 --> 00:59:58.250
which is that kind of journey for us.

875
00:59:58.251 --> 01:00:03.251
Then we read because we want to tell our own story and then we want to go on

876
01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:08.250
rereading it.
Uh,
once again,
do you see what I mean?
It's a [inaudible],
uh,
uh,

877
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:13.300
if you wish a witty even a way for Dante to say this poem will hold you,

878
01:00:16.550 --> 01:00:21.090
uh,
and it's meant to hold you and I wish it holds you.
Uh,

879
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:25.370
so you can see the poem is both a journey and the telling of the journey

880
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.880
endlessly like the movement of the sun and they have a sash.

881
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:32.730
So this is the end of the poem.
Now what,
let me say that I'm sure that they are,

882
01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:37.600
uh,
questions.
I raised some issues that we have minute,
few minutes and uh,

883
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.570
I'll tell you then later,
where are we going to do next time?
So,

884
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:46.540
<v 1>ah,
please</v>

885
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.800
outline 52,
um,

886
01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.130
that light to blind,

887
01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:14.131
which in itself is true going on here about light and

888
01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:22.370
the light seems to be here.
All right.
What's happening is that Dante is

889
01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:25.243
become,

890
01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:31.060
the faculty improves enough to appreciate that and that has been trying any good

891
01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:37.300
failure now.
But,
um,
how light light is truth,

892
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:41.830
no longer a lumen.
It is very object at this point.

893
01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:50.590
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,
the question is,
uh,</v>

894
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:55.700
in reference to lines 52 line 52 of Paradiso 33,

895
01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:00.940
uh,
we are,
uh,
uh,
Dante says and die,

896
01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:06.100
uh,
who was drawing near to the end level desires.
Okay.

897
01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:11.050
That'd be understand indeed perforce ended perforce the order of my craving.

898
01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:15.160
Okay.
Say Bernard sign to me with a smile.

899
01:02:15.161 --> 01:02:19.190
Total Cup word,
but already over myself I was doing,
but he wished that's,

900
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:24.270
I think federally at least literally clear for my sites becoming pure.

901
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:25.763
<v 1>Oh,
that</v>

902
01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:28.700
<v 0>it's also clear they are,</v>

903
01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:33.010
Dante's experience in a final poems are,

904
01:02:33.011 --> 01:02:37.620
can be reduced to every fine meant of,
uh,
and,
and,

905
01:02:37.621 --> 01:02:42.220
and of the Faculty of Vision,
uh,
physical,
but the,

906
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:45.490
the,
oh,
so clearly spiritual.
Um,
it was,

907
01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:47.500
it was becoming pure,

908
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:52.180
was entering more and more through the beam of the lofty light,

909
01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.520
which in itself is true.

910
01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:58.270
Meaning that I think this means this is also if,
uh,

911
01:02:58.271 --> 01:03:03.100
if the footnote of yours,
it's the,
the footnote is to the famous phrase.

912
01:03:03.130 --> 01:03:08.040
In Thy Light,
we see the light.
Um,
the,

913
01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:11.920
the,
uh,
the idea that we are quite right,

914
01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:16.330
that it's not a light that reveals an object being,

915
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:20.470
uh,
being a true object.
That's really what you,
the point that you're making.

916
01:03:20.471 --> 01:03:22.840
That's absolutely true.
I would agree with that.

917
01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.720
But it's really a statement about the light,

918
01:03:25.721 --> 01:03:30.580
which in itself is a contains highlight.
Is it,
it's kind of a,

919
01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:35.080
that's the meaning of the biblical phrase.
In Thy Light,
we see the light.

920
01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.370
It's not because of your light.
I see the world,
I see myself or whatever.
Uh,

921
01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:44.290
you know,
in their light,
I see the light.
The light is,
uh,
is the light of truth.

922
01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:49.080
That's what he saying.
It's a light of truth in and of itself.
That of truth.

923
01:03:49.081 --> 01:03:54.010
Yes,
it's a light in itself.
But that was your point or,
no,

924
01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:04.480
just a little confused.
That was a function of where the function of light,

925
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:09.140
uh,
here.
Um,

926
01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.950
well the,
I can,

927
01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.210
I can give you a little bit of,
uh,
uh,

928
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:21.200
the idea of what we call the metaphysics of light in,
uh,

929
01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.780
in,
uh,
in Paradiso.

930
01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

931
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:26.810
<v 0>Uh,
Dante begins with the idea that,</v>

932
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:27.763
<v 1>uh,</v>

933
01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:33.550
<v 0>what do we know of the divine is,
is light.
Okay.
I light that,</v>

934
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.540
uh,
the power of which I sent it to,

935
01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.040
the limitation of which is exactly like the doc in the sense that their light

936
01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:46.810
reveals to us the divine,

937
01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.670
but at the same time hides the origin of the lights.

938
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:53.140
You can not see through the light.
Okay.

939
01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:58.380
That's really the understanding of a downtime parodies or one saying the glory

940
01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:04.180
of him.
Who else move soul things?
The glory is an image really means slide.

941
01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:09.220
That I have a claim who moves on things is what I really saw.

942
01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:14.050
Now Dunphy seeing the origin of that,
that light,
uh,

943
01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:19.240
that which has remained forever invisible.
Exactly the way the dog,

944
01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.350
you might say that,
you know,
some of our imagination,
uh,

945
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:28.210
is that we are in the dark.
We don't know what the origins of anything.

946
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:33.190
We don't know the causes that lie beyond,
uh,
perceptions,
right?

947
01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:35.790
Um,
but we don't know the origin of the dark.

948
01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:40.540
And we may even go like mystics believing that the dark is the image is the

949
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:43.420
cover for light.
You know what?
If they said dark,

950
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:45.070
they must be a light somewhere else.
In fact,

951
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:47.350
that dog may occasionally be removed.

952
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:52.770
The worst thing about the mystical language of the divine in terms of right is

953
01:05:53.261 --> 01:05:55.870
that the right itself,
which makes all things visible,

954
01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:00.790
remains in and of itself impenetrable in its origin to the human eye.

955
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.870
Now Dante sees it.
That's the idea of the truth,
right?

956
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:09.460
In daylight,
we see the light.
Okay?
Is that a little,

957
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:14.800
this is not a beatific vision.

958
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:19.420
He has seen a moment of light and the origin of the light.
That's still not God,

959
01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:23.290
but at the beatific,
the old,
the only thing that he remembers,

960
01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.150
the beatific vision is some,

961
01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.020
he doesn't say some sweetness that has gathered in his heart.

962
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:34.030
And what he then sees beyond the general forms,
this is a number of things,

963
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.800
the general form of the cosmos,

964
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:40.801
which is this conjunction of circle and square a book and volume.

965
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:44.480
You know,
if you want to visualize it in terms of,
and I,

966
01:06:44.481 --> 01:06:49.230
I like that image because it really implies that the word,
ah,
that's,
that's the,

967
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.360
it's the theology of the word that seems to come out of that.

968
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:56.210
Then the other thing that he sees is our likeness.
I,
he,

969
01:06:56.211 --> 01:07:00.730
he sends us back to genesis one or the creation of man and is told in Genesis,

970
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:03.130
uh,
let us make,
let us make

971
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.100
man in our image and likeness.
So this is our likeness.

972
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:13.210
But you are talking now about the light and the meaning about this light.

973
01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.590
Is that the light,
what does it mean to say that the light is true?

974
01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:21.520
Not because he reveals and dissipates the shadows.
That would be one way,

975
01:07:21.521 --> 01:07:24.280
one functions of the light.
We liked the light,

976
01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:28.450
the light of the mind to like the sun,
whatever,
because of that,

977
01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:29.590
the artificial lights.

978
01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.770
But there is a way in which Dante's now thinking about what,

979
01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:35.140
what is called metaphysics of light.

980
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:39.280
What is the light in and of itself and the light and not,
by the way,

981
01:07:39.281 --> 01:07:40.510
if you really want to know this,

982
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.810
Dante distinguishes between the word for light and the word for lamp,

983
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.100
Lou Lou tray,
and so on,
light a lamp and so on.

984
01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:51.280
And number of,
uh,
scientific distinctions.

985
01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:56.550
But here he's talking about the vision of the origin of light.

986
01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:01.630
In very light,
we see the light.
That's the meaning of the phrase.
