1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.260
I'm going to give it a short class.

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:08.340
What is known as a short class.
The,
uh,
they call it,

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.850
it's an old idea,
used to call it the Lexia bravest shop class.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.070
So I just want to give you a little introduction to what the courses will be

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.680
like and,
and,
uh,
uh,

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.420
an introduction also about the context of,
uh,
uh,

7
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.970
within which Dante thrives.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.960
Dante grows and [inaudible] writes this poem of his,

9
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.320
a poem there is,
you know,
it's called the divine comedy.

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.180
It's not really the title Dante gives to the poem.

11
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.830
Dante call the poem.

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.910
Simply comedy divine is the,
the,

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.280
the adjective the epithet that readers in through centuries have assigned to it

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.940
to indicate both what struck the message brime quality with techs and also the

15
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.070
content it deals after all,

16
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.370
the fundamental theme of the poem is the encounter of a pilgrim and northern

17
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.200
remain who you'll see lived,
uh,
the 13th century,

18
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.290
14th century,
uh,
and who imagines this journey to God.

19
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.070
So it's divine also because of this particular content.
It's the,

20
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.530
it's a journey.
It's,
it's uh,

21
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.770
it's a quest for nothing less than seen God face to face and come back to talk

22
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:30.570
about it now.

23
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:35.571
Just seeing God and be overwhelmed by it dazzled by it as probably is the,

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.290
uh,
what we know.
And it's most of the,
the tradition about visionary literature.

25
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.320
This is really about writing the poem about this fundamental experience will be

26
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:47.604
reading this poem.

27
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.930
And if I had to give you something of a genre,

28
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.830
it's a very difficult to speak of genres.
They said an epic.

29
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.790
Is it auto biography?
Is it a romance?

30
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.870
I think it's all of the things above.
It's all of these things.

31
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.220
And probably the best way to talk about it is there.
It is an encyclopedia.

32
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.050
What does the word mean?

33
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.070
The word means a circle of knowledge.

34
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.790
It's an old classical idea.
Uh,
it was made,

35
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.090
I could tell you it was made available enough times in the,
in,
in,
in,

36
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.610
by an architect by the name of vitriol,
views,
roads actually.
Uh,

37
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.300
and it talked about integral pedia.
It really means this,
as I said,

38
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:35.301
the circle of knowledge in the sense that to know you have to have a point of

39
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:40.341
departure and at that point of departure will take you along all the various

40
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:44.940
disciplines of uh,
uh,
the so called liberal arts.

41
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.330
And then they take you right back to where you started the beginning and the end

42
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.700
in a liberal education,
we'll have to coincide.

43
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:58.701
You are going to find out things that now you will see with a different view

44
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:01.840
from a different standpoint.
The difference perspective.

45
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.460
Dante writes an encyclopedia,
uh,

46
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.540
which also means an ordering of the tradition of exactly the so called liberal

47
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:13.690
arts.
What are the liberal arts,
why are they call liberal?

48
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.000
They're called liberal to distinguish them from the so called mechanical arts.

49
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.120
This is an old medieval distinct and they're called liberal also because the aim

50
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:27.910
of this art is to free us.

51
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.260
It's as if knowledge has in itself the power to give us some kind of freedom,

52
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.010
free us from all sorts of,
uh,

53
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.140
some various source of tyranny.

54
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.910
That tyranny of action above all the theory of having to do things with your

55
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:46.950
hands that will distract you from the great aims and break their hams.

56
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.710
Har Theory,
contemplation,
uh,
thinking.

57
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.230
So the liberal arts,
what are these liberal arts,

58
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:57.250
the liberal arts I saw called the arts words that distinguish them between arts

59
00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:59.740
of words and arts number.

60
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.220
The Arthur wards are the,
the,
the,

61
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:08.221
the grammar fundamental which encompasses also poetry and history.

62
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.140
They are a dialectics and rhetoric rhetoric,
Thea to persuasion,

63
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.570
the electrics being the art of

64
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.750
deciding what the truth of the statement.
Maybe it's a little,

65
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.420
it was difficult of this art and then there are the arts of numbers.

66
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.810
There are some numbers or let me take geometry.

67
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.230
Music based on rhythm or number and then astronomy.

68
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.020
The aim of this liberal arts would be ethics.

69
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.240
It would be also a theology,
metaphysics and theology.

70
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.600
This is the way the divine comedy is actually structured.
This,

71
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.750
I'm going to show you as we are going to read this poem.

72
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.490
The implication of calling the divine comedy and encyclopedia is that clearly it

73
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.490
deals with education.

74
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.960
You cannot have an encyclopedia.
You Do,
you know,
you,

75
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.570
you do have the answer Copia Britannica,

76
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:10.480
which gives you all the possible in interesting,

77
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:15.481
important items provided in a very disconnected way according to the laws of the

78
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:16.384
alphabet.

79
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.920
But the aim of the encyclopedia is really to educate the reader.

80
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.040
So Dante actually shows in this sense,
it's an autobiography.

81
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.770
The poem is not aware of it shows the process,

82
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:30.100
but which he comes to know the world around him.

83
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.930
So we are going to talk about things that have to do with,
with politics.

84
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.210
I have to do with,
uh,
questions that aren't racist all the time.

85
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.610
What is justice in the world?
How do the claims of justice,

86
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.750
uh,
go along with the realities of,
of,
of passions,

87
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.650
the conflicting,
the collusion of conflicting desires,

88
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:55.450
conflicting parties and so on.

89
00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.710
But also we'll be talking about ethics,
uh,
agency,
you know,

90
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:04.760
and my,
uh,
do I know things and because I know things,

91
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.850
I'm all right or I had my problems a little bit different because my wheel is

92
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:15.570
really weak.
It's an old idea,
the weakness of the wheel.

93
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.480
Um,
and if I know what I should be doing,
we all know we shouldn't be just,

94
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.890
that doesn't really make us just right.
Uh,
we have,
we're the,
the,
the,
uh,

95
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.910
kind of frailty and vulnerability to wanting to do things that we normally

96
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.010
shouldn't be doing.
And we even know that we shouldn't do that.

97
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.270
We'll talking to resist some of these issues,
uh,

98
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.340
in a very lucid and I think the most probing manner possible.

99
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.370
And then he goes on,
uh,
writing this point,
which is,
as you know,

100
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.720
written about going into hell,
literally,
uh,

101
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.680
and trying to rectify the belief that you can really get out of it and,
and,
and,

102
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.710
and rearrange the older your vision about the world and about yourself.

103
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.250
Every time you talk about ethics and every time you talk about,

104
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.590
about politics are real.
Question is,

105
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:11.591
who am I and what am I doing in order to come to some kind of understanding of

106
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.050
the world around myself.
So we'll,

107
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:18.950
we'll be talking about some of these issues in detail and reading in a very,

108
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.250
um,

109
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.250
and assuming way without any or all the various cantos that are indicated in

110
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:30.080
your,
in the syllabus.
But let me go to the other part,

111
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.540
which is really probably the most concrete part.
This is,

112
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.320
I gave you the general scheme of the,
of,
of the lectures.

113
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.280
Let me just talk about,
uh,

114
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.260
the concrete context of Dante's

115
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.570
life contour of his life.
Who is this man?

116
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.810
How did he end up writing a poem that seventh centuries or more after he wrote

117
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:55.380
it?
It's still red.

118
00:07:55.381 --> 00:08:00.381
The still be thought of as one of the major contributions that a human being can

119
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:06.230
make to our culture.
Um,
well he was born as you know,

120
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.470
probably
in a

121
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:16.460
16,
I'm sorry,
two 1265,
uh,

122
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.490
1265 in a city called Florence Act that are by the time Dante was of school age

123
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.380
had 70,000 people,
7,000.

124
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.420
These are little details to impress you about how crucial or important that's
it.

125
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.640
What was 7,000 boys and girls who go to school.

126
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.660
Public schools were available to them.
Dante was one of these people.
He,

127
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.090
he was born in a,
um,
in a family that was somehow,
uh,
uh,

128
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.190
he claimed the,
an nobility and a whatnot,

129
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.840
but actually it was an impoverished family and he was even a slightly

130
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:57.330
embarrassed by the activities of his own father.
He never mentioned him,

131
00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.600
but we do know by poems others had written against him,

132
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.160
attacking him and attacking his genealogy,
accusing the father of,
uh,

133
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.660
uh,
low and being involved in loan and the kind of,
uh,
uh,

134
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.820
uh,
usually,
um,
activities a usurer,
uh,

135
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.170
lending money or high,
very high interest,
uh,
and so on.

136
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.100
When he,
Dante,
two events happened to him.

137
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.470
Private events happened to him when he was a child.

138
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.840
The first is by the time he was eight years old,
his mother died

139
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.510
and the second a little bit connected with it.

140
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.990
It's the fact that when he was nine years old,
he will tell us later.

141
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.130
He met a young woman.
He doesn't even know what her name is.

142
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.020
That's the fiction of,
of his own work.

143
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.110
He knew because she actually was a neighbor.
He calls her,
uh,
Beatrice,

144
00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.010
the way he goes on transferring all the love that he felt a wanted from his

145
00:09:58.471 --> 00:10:00.960
mother owned to this young woman.
Uh,

146
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:05.070
we don't know it unless we're just involved in some kind of second political are

147
00:10:05.071 --> 00:10:08.430
speculations about his life,
the facts.
We don't know.
However,

148
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:13.431
he does talk about her as if she were a mother to,

149
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.740
to him.

150
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.740
He describes her in the poem in very maternal language and the language of her

151
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:24.120
great generosity,
the generosity of love actually.
So these are the two events.

152
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:26.370
And then he goes to school in,
uh,

153
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.510
in Florence and the school for all these teachers.

154
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:35.070
He'd have only one that he really will point out and we'll remember forever.

155
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.720
Amen.
By the name of Brunetto.
Latini.
We'll see him later in hell.

156
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.760
I like money out of students.
They don't want to send a teacher to her,

157
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.010
but not you of course.
But this,
this was,
he does,
he manages.

158
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:54.060
Who was this man?
Why was he so important for,
for Dante?

159
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:56.720
Well,
great authority.
We could call him.
Um,

160
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:03.410
he still talked about if you ever have happened to go to Florence and you read

161
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.340
this,
uh,

162
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.570
a student will come kind of memorial stones that are all everywhere on the walls

163
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:11.310
of the city.

164
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.810
He was one of those who civilize the city of the city of Florence.

165
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:20.280
Where was he do and what did he do actually?
Well,
he was Eric tuition,

166
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.630
first of all,
in the mode of CIS Heronian.

167
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.130
This is a rolling tradition.

168
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.290
Every tradition is to say a woman who believed that politics and rhetoric go

169
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:36.060
hand in hand.
That rhetoric is the art of persuasion within the,

170
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.890
the,
the,
the parliament within the city streets of the city.

171
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.690
Uh,
uh,
where large decisions can be made that can be reached.

172
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.810
This was the essential work of brutality,

173
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.980
play styles himself after [inaudible].
It was not only a great teacher,

174
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.220
he actually translated our end commented works that we have by Cicero on

175
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.860
rhetorical works,
Cicero,
uh,

176
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.760
in the belief that really the political problems are ultimately problems have

177
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:10.000
speech problems of arguments.
Uh,

178
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.810
but he also was a traveler.
He went to,
uh,

179
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.250
we do know that he went to Toledo.
They city of Toledo in Spain.
Uh,

180
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:22.840
he did bring in a translations,
uh,
of,
uh,

181
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:26.440
of,
uh,
uh,
even even a very realistic Texas.

182
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:29.560
I will explain all this terms as we go on.
Uh,

183
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.130
[inaudible] admires him,

184
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:37.140
especially because he stands for the salt of teacher who gets involved in

185
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:42.430
political,
the political realities of Florence.

186
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.070
Dante wants to follow him in that.

187
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.700
Eventually he would meet Beatrice again.

188
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:52.540
A writes a great poem inspired by her,

189
00:12:52.541 --> 00:12:57.130
which we'll be looking at next time,
called the Vita Nuova.
Uh,
the teacher,

190
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:01.330
his teacher Burnet Talatine will die and Dante decides to enter.
We are already,

191
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.920
uh,
1290 decides to enter political life himself.

192
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.560
It was his biggest mistake.

193
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:14.010
It was his biggest mistake because political life in Florence really meant being

194
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.070
in the throes of a harsh partisan battles between the so called Welsh and give

195
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.120
balance.
The,
the issues are not so clear cut.

196
00:13:25.121 --> 00:13:29.710
The world supposedly are those who really believe in,
uh,
the,

197
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:33.900
the,
the loyalty to the church.
Uh,
the others that gibberish,

198
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.780
those who believe in the loyalty to the empire.
Uh,

199
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.260
the two institutions at the time,
things are not that clear cartels as,

200
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.170
as that the sharply separable as that.

201
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.960
We'll talk about some of the details about,
about this,

202
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.310
but Dante becomes an ambassador for the city of Florence,

203
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.370
the way Brunette had become an ambassador for the city of Lawrence.

204
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:59.320
And he goes a little bit everywhere.
He sent to the pope in the year 1302,

205
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:04.680
he sent to the pope on an embassy and he never makes it back to Florence.

206
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:10.770
Machinations had taken place so that he would be banned from the city,

207
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.120
not only been from the city,
his,
his,
his properties confiscated.

208
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.320
And there is the threat on him,
uh,
uh,

209
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:20.860
that should he return and should he get caught,

210
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.530
he would actually be put to death.
The year 13.

211
00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:29.531
Oh two is the beginning of Dante's new education and new experience.

212
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:32.860
He goes into exile and exile,

213
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:37.750
which at the time was thought to be a nothing less then,
uh,

214
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.370
the fiercest condemnation on anybody because we are,
that's the,

215
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.540
the medieval idea.
We are the,
the,
the,

216
00:14:46.541 --> 00:14:51.541
the value of each and every one of us depends on the position that we occupy

217
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.550
within the city.
To be without sat,

218
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.910
not be a holder of a place within the city means that one is actually nothing.

219
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.820
So he goes literally begging from one city to another,

220
00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:09.410
maybe even traveled as far as,
as,
as,
as,
as Paris.
We don't know that,

221
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.690
but exile though it turned out to be a harsh punishment,

222
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.340
turned out to be also nothing less than a blessing,

223
00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.190
a blessing in disguise because it,

224
00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.420
it removed Dante from any sense of loyalty to partisan viewpoints.

225
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.530
He was no longer,
uh,
uh,

226
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.420
he was no longer to be a wealth or a GIB Berlin.

227
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.650
He was no longer caught in this internecine wars.

228
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.800
He now became nothing less than one or could occupy a transcendent viewpoint.

229
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.770
This is what the story of the divine comedy is.

230
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:54.010
How does one go from perceiving the world that aren't oneself in this partial

231
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.930
provisional,
fragmentary manner?

232
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.840
How can one be pulling it together?

233
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:05.170
And the divine comedy is the story of exile being the removal oneself from the

234
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:10.400
city in order to best see what the problems with the cities.

235
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.740
And uh,
he ended his life in the year 13,

236
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:20.741
21 in a city called Ravenna where he was buried.

237
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.630
Uh,
so that's the way he wrote the poem,
uh,

238
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.780
was in exile.
The poem came out of this experience of exile.

239
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.420
He begins his life as an example,

240
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.610
but I think the philosophical text called the banquet in the tradition of,
uh,

241
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.200
of work,
the title of the Symposium Right now on ethics,

242
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.760
he abandons his project,

243
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.330
starts a project on language trying to find a unified,

244
00:16:47.331 --> 00:16:49.880
the possibility of unifying all the languages.

245
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.970
Italy writes a political texts about the necessity of unifying the world with

246
00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.050
this empire.
The monarch finishes that.

247
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.350
But the real process of unification of all these experiences really is with the

248
00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.530
divine comedy.
And we'll be reading that,
uh,
in,

249
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.990
uh,
in a couple of,
a couple of days.

250
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.190
That's all I have to say to you is if there are some questions and then I'll try

251
00:17:19.191 --> 00:17:20.450
to,
uh,

252
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:25.970
<v 1>and those,
yes.</v>

253
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:31.520
What is the question again?

254
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.430
<v 0>The final paper is due within two weeks of the end of classes.
The question was,</v>

255
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.320
when is the final paper due?

256
00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:40.853
<v 1>Okay.</v>

257
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.040
How important is

258
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.320
<v 0>the knowledge of the Italian language?
How important this,
the,</v>

259
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.820
the knowledge of Italian language,
the courses all in English.

260
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.650
We are reading a translation with the original text,
uh,
by the side.

261
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.440
Um,
if you can read it in the Italian good.

262
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.470
If you want to write the paper and Italian,
you're welcome to do so.

263
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.240
But the course is going to be,
we are treating the poem as if it were in,
uh,

264
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.240
in England and English poem.
After all,
someone says,

265
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:22.110
[inaudible] is an American poet.
Uh,
and we could explore that tool.

266
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.010
Other questions?

267
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.730
Okay.
Hey,
we'll see you on Tuesday.
