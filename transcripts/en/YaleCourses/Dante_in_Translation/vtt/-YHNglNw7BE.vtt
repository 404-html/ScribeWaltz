WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.500
With Ken 26,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.220
the purgation of the pilgrim is completed.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.640
He has been going through the various stages of purgatory from pride,

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.360
as you remember to the scene of lust.
And,
uh,

5
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.800
in 27,

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.420
he crosses a wall of fire,

7
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.710
um,

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.710
so that he can be cleansed completely of all the stains that may be residual on

9
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:44.310
his soul and approach.
And then to the,
the,
the garden of Eden.

10
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.230
This is the,
uh,
the action,
uh,

11
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.730
that takes place in 27.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.830
And Cantor 27 comes to a close with,
uh,

13
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.720
a passage that I would like to read to you and comment on.

14
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.820
It's at the end of Canto 27.

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.800
And these are really the last words that Virgil will,

16
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.580
will speak.
We will not hear from him again.
Um,

17
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.100
in fact,
from now on,
the pilgrim will be entitled on his own.

18
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.520
There's no dependency on him because it's sort of a actually very personal

19
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:26.520
moment now that it's a start.
Uh,
and,
and,

20
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:31.040
and we'll see the drama that goes with this time of,
uh,

21
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.240
this,
this attainment of self mastery that,
uh,

22
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.340
Dante goes on dramatizing.
These are the last words,
uh,

23
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.450
that he speaks,
uh,
from lines,
uh,
one 30,
uh,

24
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.570
on,
uh,
uh,
uh,

25
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:53.571
the temporal fire and the terminal that has seen meaning Kruger,

26
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.080
Tori,
and,
and,
and health,

27
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.450
which lasts forever.

28
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.250
My son and I come to a part where of mice I have of myself.

29
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.860
I discern no further.

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.080
This is the limitation of Virgil's vision.
This is from now on.

31
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.240
He will be following even the,
the geometry,

32
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.420
the arrangement of their journey will be completely reversed.

33
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.300
Up to now,
the pilgrim has been a disciple,

34
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.110
therefore one who follows the vestiges of the teacher.

35
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.850
Now the teacher with Ah,
AH,

36
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.340
stages we'll be following a Virgil,

37
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.990
he sees no further.

38
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.260
And actually I can anticipate for you the pathos of Virgil's departures

39
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.190
southern.
The departure when he,

40
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:55.191
the pilgrim most once a month needs him because Beatrice is approaching and the

41
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:57.610
terror that,
uh,

42
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.810
with a terror that Beatrice represents for the pilgrim,

43
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.990
the pilgrim would turn back and his eyes will never see a Virgil again.

44
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.250
Virtual has disappeared an instant before his vanishes and instant before

45
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.370
Beatrice arrives.
As if there's a hiatus,

46
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.440
a Dante's dramatizing the hiatus between the two guides and the tool,

47
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.630
uh,
particular stages of his own self knowledge and,
and,
and life.

48
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.040
So let me continue with this.

49
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.750
Thou that take henceforth they pleasure for God.

50
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.550
What an extraordinary line take them.

51
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.780
Hence supposed to day pressure for guide.
Uh,

52
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840
this is the poem of desire in the sense that what pushes the pilgrim to go on

53
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.550
and a impels them to this journey of discovery and self discovery is really

54
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.200
desire.
Desire is,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

55
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.420
the moving force in him.

56
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.970
But now that language changes now in a sense,
a certain,
uh,

57
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:05.590
the first part of the journey is over and pleasure can become,

58
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.550
uh,
the guide,
uh,
the guidance of his own pleasure.

59
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.100
What he likes is to say,
in a sense,
it's another operational three.
We'll,
uh,

60
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.120
we'll talk more about,
uh,

61
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.830
the relationship between the actual pleasure and happiness,
the way down to,

62
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:24.780
we'll go and dramatizing it.
And,
and thinking about it in,
uh,
in,

63
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.620
in paradise that has come forth from the steep and narrow ways.

64
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.530
See The sun that shines on eyebrow.

65
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.450
See the grass near the earthly paradise.
See the grass,

66
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:39.280
the flowers and trees,

67
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:44.281
which the ground here brings forth of itself alone is this as if by Dante,

68
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:49.630
by taking his own pleasure,
uh,
as his guidance,

69
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:54.310
he's now his reached any Dimmick place is a virtual speaking of,
of,

70
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.680
of the pilgrim as if you were speaking of the ground that thrives,
uh,

71
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:00.250
until the ground,

72
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:05.251
the land producers spontaneously and now he's capable that spontaneous action

73
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.240
and spontaneous,
uh,

74
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.260
decisions to the fair eyes come rejoicing which weeping made come to commit me.

75
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.610
Come to thee.

76
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.600
Thou may sit or go among them,
uh,

77
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.850
to details or expressed very slides.

78
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.530
One is virtual is recapitulating in many ways.

79
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.030
Uh,
this first part of the journey,
the journey that began and in fair no one,

80
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.120
and then see ya in purgatory,
in the garden of Eden,

81
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.450
it began in the wilderness and then is in the garden.
This is,

82
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.170
this is the first step of a,
the first stage of the journey.

83
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.530
You can now are.
He remembers.

84
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:51.730
That's how he recapitulates the fair eyes.
That made me,

85
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.790
that begged me to come to your help when you were a lost in,

86
00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.910
in,
in uh,
in and shipwrecked on the wilderness of in federal one,

87
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.550
so now a virtual is going back to that.

88
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:09.551
The second element is that this is the exercise now though may sit or go among

89
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.330
them now.

90
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.680
This is exactly the major temptation for the pilgrim.

91
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.190
Is he going to think that the journey to the garden of Eden,

92
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.570
which is a journey ahead forward,
but a journey back in time.

93
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.130
The Garden of Eden is behind all of us and yet it lies ahead of us.

94
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.990
The past is really the future.

95
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.140
He must decide whether he can go on or or or or sit here.

96
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.740
It's a first decision.

97
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.890
Is he going to think that the journey is the journey to the complacency's of the

98
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:47.141
garden to the beauty and the traction of the garden or is he going to turn as he

99
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.770
actually will?
We have,

100
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.100
we can say that it was have paradise that he writes into an Nantai pastoral port

101
00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.430
that is to say one a poet who is always questioning the sense of arrival and is

102
00:07:01.281 --> 00:07:05.150
always going on to new departures.
That's really what the,

103
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.380
the virtual is telling him.
Now this is up to you.
You have arrived here,

104
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:14.330
you have arrived there where I am,
where virtual is,
or you can even go further.

105
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.943
This has hell.

106
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.750
There's a peculiar language that resonates behind this kind of moral dilemma

107
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:24.110
which is placed in front of the pilgrims mind.

108
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.920
It's called Félix Gould.

109
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.850
I don't know if you ever have you or those who are readers of Milton may know

110
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.130
what I'm talking about.
Failing schools.

111
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.550
The idea that the fall of man was actually a happy fall because it allows human

112
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:46.130
beings to even want to go beyond that.
So that's,

113
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:48.920
that's exactly what is resonating behind this.

114
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:53.921
And you may sit and therefore turn into an Adam figure who is going back to the

115
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.580
the beauty and innocence,
which the pilgrim doesn't have.
Really,

116
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.760
he has a wisdom now a of the garden or you can go home even further than that.

117
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.473
And then,
uh,

118
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.480
here is the final moment of is this a circle which is now takes over for the,

119
00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:13.901
the,
the,

120
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:18.901
the Purgatorio a itself no longer expect word or sign for me that's,

121
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.550
that's exactly the,
the,
the teaching of the,

122
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.620
of Virgil has been completed and then he ends with three upright and hall is

123
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:33.890
they will,
and it were a fault not to act on its bidding.

124
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.480
Therefore,
over the self,
our crown and mitre,
the,

125
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.250
this is the attainment of the free will.

126
00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:43.310
So the whole purgatorial moves between two Poles,

127
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.350
the pole of liberty,
which was Kato's or object,

128
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.820
the object of his quest through the wilderness of the Libyan desert.

129
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.890
And now the attainment of the,
of the free will,

130
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.990
which allows the pilgrim to view it as a condition,

131
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.330
not just the point of arrival,
but they're necessary precondition for moral life.

132
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.910
You can never really have a free and autonomous moral life all in the measure in

133
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.230
which you think you can have the free wheel.

134
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.070
Now the pilgrim is his own responsibility.
And let me say that once it's under,

135
00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.230
the guidance will be at the issues,
especially when it comes to palletize.

136
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.600
They will be moral problems where he is in the garden of Eden.

137
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.060
We are going to look at in a moment,
but in paradise aesthetics takes over.

138
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.250
It's no longer an ethical problem then to reverse.
Or you may have heard about,

139
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:35.671
you know,

140
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:40.671
reason philosophers who think that life is a range or knowledge is arranged

141
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.340
according to the stages of the aesthetic,
the ethical,

142
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.430
and then the theological Dante reverses this,

143
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:52.431
that the point that seems to be the most mature is that have dealing with the

144
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:57.330
aesthetic one,
which others may view as the superficial,
the elementary one,

145
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.100
the one where we,
our perceptions are going to be engaged.
And then,
uh,
the,
the,

146
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.810
the time of this engagement,

147
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:08.670
even before you can get involved in mature in a ethical experiences than pay

148
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:13.050
changes.
Uh,
all of us are no ethical dilemma's in paradise.

149
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:14.070
Once you are in paradise,

150
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:18.930
you can only enjoy or and get to know the world are all the problems,

151
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:23.640
had intellectual problems,
not moral,
uh,
moral rituals.
So free,

152
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:26.670
upright and hold is a will and we're a full to not to act on it.

153
00:10:26.671 --> 00:10:31.671
It's pitting therefore over thyself I crown and Miter they,

154
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:36.150
this is a kind of secular coronation ceremony,
the crown,

155
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.240
the royal and the episcopal,
uh,
your and the Bishop,
uh,

156
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.170
which is a way of,
of uh,

157
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.440
of of consecrating a virtual access,

158
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:51.441
a kind of lay priest consecrating the attainment of self mastery this moment

159
00:10:53.041 --> 00:10:56.190
which could become a moment of self assertion.
And yet,
uh,

160
00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:59.760
Dante is very careful,
uh,
uh,

161
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.820
in how he navigates a all of this now from 10 to 28 two Canto 33,

162
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:10.500
which is the end of the poem.
We come to an area which is another fragment.

163
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:11.334
You already read,

164
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.030
a kind of segments which we call the literary segment that uh,

165
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.930
with Professor Lumos whom I'm very grateful to,
uh,

166
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.100
covered and explained to you and did with you last last time.

167
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.600
That's a literary segment that goes from 21 to 26.

168
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.740
Now from 28 to 33,
we have a different segment,
which is,

169
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.400
let's call it x,
a pastoral wastage.

170
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.640
It's also the representation of what in a classical literature is called.

171
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.400
L opens are Mainers.
Uh,

172
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:48.960
you may have seen Adam [inaudible] of this and even in limbo,

173
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.820
that's one of them.
This,

174
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:55.821
this lovely spot outside of the world of history where something of a,

175
00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.990
uh,
relaxation can take place.
And it's also which combines our,

176
00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:05.560
actually with a biblical or two enclosed garden up the,
the,

177
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:08.750
of the song of songs,
for instance,
or the garden of Eden,

178
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:13.080
the old two scum cruisers.
Uh,
the interesting thing about,
uh,

179
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.420
Dante's representation of the local somebody knows is that it's never really

180
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.250
outside of history.
It becomes,
that's the assumption.
You know,

181
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:24.040
you have the garden and you have the city.
This is the,

182
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.830
the dual imagination.
You know,

183
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:29.470
whenever life becomes unbearable in the city,

184
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:34.650
you take off and go into your villa in the garden somewhere and find their

185
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.460
relief,
aesthetic relief,
uh,
from,
uh,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

186
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.330
the hustle.
Uh,
the time of hustle and bustle of,
of,
of the city,

187
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.040
Dante combines the two.

188
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:50.041
There's no easier position between them in the sense that the garden of Eden

189
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:56.731
where he finds himself is going to be the place of a very problematical place,

190
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.680
a place where the pilgrim is engaged in a self confrontation.

191
00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:07.390
He experiences some,
uh,
actually,
uh,

192
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.380
terrifying,

193
00:13:08.381 --> 00:13:13.000
a terrifying moments in a Indian counter with,

194
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.440
uh,
with Beatrice.
So the garden of Eden is representing Cantu 28.

195
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.850
And I want to read a few passages.
This is,
uh,
uh,

196
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:24.740
you see how this representation,
uh,

197
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:30.210
is carried out eager now to search from reading from 28 line lines one and

198
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:34.920
following it,
I'll go pretty,

199
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.300
pretty slowly over this eager now to search within and about the divine forest,

200
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:47.290
green and dense,
which tempered to my eyes,
the new day,

201
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.440
I left the slope without waiting longer,

202
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.830
taking the levels of very slowly over the ground,

203
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:58.510
which fragrance on every side.
It's the classic of this as the,
this is the,

204
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.820
uh,
or the,
the,
the,
the,

205
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.930
the warehouse of the pastoral tradition is found here.

206
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.980
Fragrance Asia,
uh,
running brook,
uh,

207
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:14.100
the shades the birds into be rivaling human beings in producing songs,

208
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.980
plenitude of the natural older and,
and,
uh,

209
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.120
even the innocence of the natural odor with the exception of that Dante comes

210
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:25.571
and the,

211
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:30.571
he has been cleansed and gone through the wall of fire to further purify him.

212
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.930
He is not a,
the kind of new Adam.

213
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.700
He carries it with them,

214
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
the stains of experience in the stage of history.

215
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.520
So there is desire,
uh,
that acts in him.

216
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:48.790
But let me continue sweet air that I was without change,

217
00:14:48.791 --> 00:14:52.850
with striking on my brow,
with the force only have a gentle breeze,

218
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.710
but which the flattering bows or bent freely on the part where the holy mountain

219
00:14:57.711 --> 00:14:58.910
throws,
it's for a shadow.

220
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.870
Yet we're not so much swayed from the rectus that the little birds in the tops

221
00:15:03.871 --> 00:15:07.520
and not still practice all the arts,
but singing,

222
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.140
they greeted the morning hours with a full gladness among the leaves,

223
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.380
which kept such undertones to their rhymes as gathers from branch to branch.

224
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:22.040
And the Pinewood of the Cahsi shore where arrows loses its Sirocco.

225
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.340
The interesting thing,
which is some kind of,
uh,
uh,

226
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:30.020
the poignancy of auto biography and,
and,
uh,
uh,

227
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.190
is that Dante's imagining the garden of Eden as the,
uh,

228
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:39.110
the pine wood and yet our Vanda which has completely disappeared since then.

229
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.320
Uh,
actually,
uh,
but,
uh,
it,
it's,

230
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:47.000
you can imagine how he would pick the morning walks in the pine trees around the

231
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:51.280
city and on the way to the,
uh,
the sea.
Uh,

232
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.900
and that for him was,
uh,
uh,
the garden,

233
00:15:54.901 --> 00:15:59.780
this mixture of the ordinary and the great sublime imagination.

234
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.040
That's,
that's what I think he's,
he wants to convey to us.

235
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.430
And now he continues.
And I will ask you a question.

236
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.350
I want you to think about what I'm going to ask you because you are expected to

237
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:16.460
have a shock of recognition in the next three lines.

238
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.710
And these are the lines in English.

239
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.670
I read them in Italian one another little homage to my friend,

240
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.280
Professor Brooks,
uh,
Jack,
Madame [inaudible],
pat,

241
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.360
he lenti pass,

242
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:35.050
then trying to sell antique Tan to Gil [inaudible] River there on the woman

243
00:16:36.571 --> 00:16:37.404
trusts.

244
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.670
She hadn't died and we told she real conversing

245
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.820
[inaudible] [inaudible] can swear he pushy and English is already my small steps

246
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.040
had brought me so far within the ancient wood that I could not see the place

247
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:56.840
where it had entered and low.

248
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:01.460
My going father was prevented by stream with which,

249
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.280
which with,
it's a little waves.

250
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.670
Ben left towards the grass and spraying on its bank.
And this is my question,

251
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.170
what is this?
What to do?
This lines remind you of,

252
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.150
they are meant to remind you of something.
The very beginning of inferno.

253
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:21.050
Very good,
very good.
Which means

254
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.490
that this is now really a new departure for him,

255
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:31.570
which means that the garden of Eden is exactly the wilderness that we saw.

256
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:36.470
And we left behind scene from a different perspective,

257
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.480
which means that the supernatural world is the natural world with a different,

258
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:46.280
through a different Lens and different perspective.
Okay.

259
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:51.360
This is,
he's now reenacting exactly the,

260
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.050
the,
the drama of unfair.
No one,
there's no ship wreck.

261
00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.450
That mountain has been climbed.
You remember that?

262
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:01.170
He tried to climb up the mountains,
have been climbed,
a new departure.

263
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.550
It's going to take place.
So here we go.
Then with uh,
this,

264
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:07.710
this idea of the,
that's what I mean,

265
00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:12.390
the Antipasto will down to the port who dismisses and,

266
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:13.220
and,
and,
and,

267
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:18.220
and refuses and repudiates all the temptations of gardens,

268
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.430
all the temptations,
premature Holton,

269
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.210
premature self enclosure into the,
the fiction of God.

270
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.950
This is really the strongest elements that I would have to point out about

271
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.530
what's happening in Canto 28.
Now,
what does he see?

272
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.740
All the waters are purest here would seem to have some deferment in them beside

273
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:39.991
that,

274
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:44.991
which conceals nothing through its though it flows quite dark.

275
00:18:45.061 --> 00:18:46.260
And the perpetual shade,

276
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.500
which never let sun or moon shine there with Fita stopped with eyes passed over

277
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:56.970
beyond the streamlet to look at the great variety of fresh flowering bowels.

278
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.360
And there appeared to me and the word the now is really where the power and

279
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:07.230
force of an operation and other epiphany of beauty and love to him,

280
00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:12.860
to me as appears of s a southern thing that for one that drives away every other

281
00:19:12.961 --> 00:19:13.550
thought.

282
00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:18.550
A lady all alone who was singing and Colin flowers from flower with which

283
00:19:20.251 --> 00:19:21.510
they're all was painted.

284
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:26.160
This is Matilda has you have read a woman who goes with dancing,

285
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.650
singing and gathering flowers,

286
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:33.630
a true picture of fascination of aesthetic fascination for,
for him.

287
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:34.923
Um,

288
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.350
to give you the sense of how or some resonance.

289
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:45.270
And in case you are still looking for a term,
uh,
the,
the final paper topic,

290
00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.920
uh,
you might want to read.
He said,
uh,
a poem.
Uh,

291
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.940
there is a traditional poetry which is really province are called pastor to Al.

292
00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.960
The pastoral pastoral was in the,
uh,
big practitioner.

293
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.420
Is Dante here?
That's what he's writing.

294
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.690
It's the idea of the night who goes through the woods or the medal and meets a

295
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:11.880
young shepherd.
This gets off.
It's very sensual,

296
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.830
gets off the wood,
Eh,
wounds,
uh,

297
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.330
off the horse and wounds this a young,

298
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.390
young woman and usually ends with a kind of a pun on the x and promises of the

299
00:20:23.941 --> 00:20:28.050
excesses of Paradise.
So it's really a neurotic kind of a song.

300
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.430
But the other practitioner of this,
of this job was Dante,

301
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.430
his own friend Weedo Cavalcanti.

302
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.120
Dante is using the mode and really,

303
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.420
definitely still taking his distance from him.
There is,
there is,

304
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:43.560
this is a love scene.

305
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:48.710
There's nothing of the overtones of violence and erotic violence that we look at

306
00:20:48.991 --> 00:20:53.910
our current,
he had celebrated in his own version of the pastoral,
uh,

307
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.240
so,
uh,
as genre which is common to them.
Now this instead what he says,

308
00:20:58.241 --> 00:21:02.400
pray fair lady who warned Mr Selves in loves beamed.

309
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.860
Now that has just come out of the circle of lust.

310
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:11.140
He has been cleansing himself.
And yet this is the,
the,

311
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.470
uh,
lingering trace of his history,

312
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.030
the lingering trace of his body and his humanity.

313
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.180
Here he goes through the garden of Eden as a foreign men who is redeemed and

314
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:29.120
know quite a redeemed,
certainly not in the Reese,

315
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.160
restore the reinstated into the innocence of the pre lab,

316
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:37.600
say area our garden.
If I'm to believe that looks,
which I want to be tested,

317
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:41.760
one of the hottest at Wa,
make please day to come forward to the stream.

318
00:21:41.761 --> 00:21:44.040
So near that I may hear,
which were singers,

319
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.500
you make me recall wearing what was preserved printer at the time,

320
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.940
her mother La series lost her and she the spring.

321
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:59.080
That's the first and I say a series of three mythological images.

322
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.140
This is the first I think of us preserve data,

323
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.900
but it's also a story of prescription as you know.
Well,

324
00:22:04.901 --> 00:22:07.270
it's stated in the text as the,

325
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:10.600
the story of the young woman who is walking,
uh,

326
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:14.620
picking flowers on the plains of Etna in Sicily.

327
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:19.130
And then death comes and takes her away.
There's a kind of,

328
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:24.180
uh,
death itself,
loving human beings and taking them.
Uh,

329
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.150
that's one myth.

330
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:30.190
The second one is a lady turns into dance with feet close together and so on.

331
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.390
And I skipped a few lines and I do not believe such lights shone from beneath

332
00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:38.840
the lids of Venus went through strange ms chance she was pierce,

333
00:22:38.841 --> 00:22:40.630
but her son.
The second image,

334
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:45.631
I think it's more telling is the story of Venus wounded by the arrows of cubit

335
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.490
and falling in love with cubit.

336
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:53.730
And I think it's more telling because it's dentist way of casting without going

337
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:57.160
into psychoanalysis as echo analytical explanations.

338
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:02.490
But Dante's casting the garden of Eden as also a desire to return to the state

339
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:09.631
of infancy of the child with the mother only to understand that this is really a

340
00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:13.780
fantasy that would lead them nowhere.
And in fact,

341
00:23:13.781 --> 00:23:18.250
the third image is that of a,
uh,
an erotic images again,

342
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.780
but one of a distance,
three paces that ever kept us apart.

343
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.290
But Hellespont whereas nurses past a bridal settlements,

344
00:23:26.291 --> 00:23:31.291
both did not bear more hatred from Rianda that swelling waters between sasters

345
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:36.781
and Abby dose than than that for me because it an open then so that this,

346
00:23:38.321 --> 00:23:43.321
this barrier between a Metallica and the pilgrim between Dante and the fantasy

347
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:51.881
of what the God that movie then may be the mother here is kept and Dante is to

348
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:54.890
continue.
So he goes on to explain,

349
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:58.240
she goes on explaining what uh,
uh,
this,

350
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:03.300
how the mechanics so to say about uh,
uh,
the,

351
00:24:03.301 --> 00:24:07.970
the,
the garden of Eden and then the Canto ends in,

352
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:13.190
and I look at this end from lines one for [inaudible] and [inaudible] those line

353
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:18.200
foot one [inaudible] and following those who know time sang of the age of gold

354
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.790
and though it's happy state

355
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:25.130
perhaps dreamed on Parnassus of this place here,

356
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.920
the human roots was innocent.

357
00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.610
Here was lasting spring

358
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.850
and every fruit,

359
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.930
this is the nectar or which each tells,

360
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.870
I turned that right around to my poets and so that they had heard that a

361
00:24:43.871 --> 00:24:45.140
sentence with a smile.

362
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.120
Then I brought my eyes back to the fair lady from dentist point of view.

363
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:55.420
The perplexity that he feels is the protection of your Virgil and the perplexity

364
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:58.970
of stations.
They know no more than he does.

365
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.690
He knows no more than they do.
Uh,
what is the other,

366
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:07.270
the burden of this passage is that the,
uh,
uh,

367
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.310
clearly Dante's alluding to the bucolic quality of this place,

368
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.430
but it also suggests that in passing that the ancient,

369
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:21.431
actually he says that the ancients porch prefigured the garden of Eden,

370
00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:23.953
uh,

371
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:28.880
in the fabulous visions of the golden age and the Parnassus,

372
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:34.060
he's establishing your link between the poetic visions and the,

373
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.980
this encounter that he has in the garden of Eden,

374
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.500
both projections of the poetic,
uh,
uh,

375
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.730
imagination.
Uh,
uh,

376
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.710
so it also means that the garden of Eden can be like the bucolic fantasy of,

377
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.380
uh,
of uh,
uh,
of the poets.

378
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.640
And Parnassus we skipped 29,
which is a,

379
00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.920
a story of a really the,
uh,

380
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.630
world history here from as an allegory the page and have a,
a,

381
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:04.770
a revelation and a,

382
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.950
I will move to Canto 30,
which will take us a little bit of time.

383
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:14.950
This is the Canto predictably where since Beatrice is the one who was linked

384
00:26:15.981 --> 00:26:16.910
with the number three,

385
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.200
this is the canter where Beatrice will arrive.

386
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.340
And surprisingly,
for those of you who are lovers of this,
uh,
uh,

387
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:30.341
open or hidden symmetries in the poem Canto Fill your paradise is also the

388
00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:33.320
cancer where Beatrice will disappear.

389
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.580
How residents in the poem last for exactly 33,

390
00:26:37.581 --> 00:26:42.110
cantos clearly it's an or an accident.
Her name is three times the good.

391
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:46.950
She's in the over is linked with three.
It's this kind of way of uh,
uh,

392
00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:52.060
the arcane significance of her presence in the pilgrims are in the leverage,

393
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.380
uh,
life.
So,
um,
it can tool that,
uh,

394
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.340
describes a double drama,

395
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:05.090
the drama of Virgil's appearance and the arrival of Beatrice,

396
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:09.870
a change of the guard as it were in many ways.
But you have two different moods.

397
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.500
One of allergy for the,
uh,
loss of,
uh,
of,
of,

398
00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.780
of Virgil and the other one of uh,
uh,

399
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:22.310
sacred terror at the arrival of,
uh,
of,
of,
uh,

400
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.900
of Beatrice.
So it,
uh,
it begins,
um,
he,

401
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.480
he is singing line 17.
Vinny sponsor the banner,

402
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.610
which of course is an echo from the song of songs.

403
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:40.530
So the erotics of the previous candle continuous.
Now here in the US,

404
00:27:40.531 --> 00:27:45.531
since the song of songs is notoriously one of the blind love poem,

405
00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.980
uh,
it continues here in Canto 30,

406
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:55.130
in anticipation of be a bit of the arrival of Beatrice as the blessed shall rise

407
00:27:55.651 --> 00:28:00.420
at the last Trump each eager from his tomb three cloud voice singing Hallelujah.

408
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.920
There rose on the divine charioteer the voice are so great and elder a hundred

409
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:08.910
ministers and Ma messengers of eternal life who claim,

410
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.330
who cried Benedictus we Venus.

411
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.930
This is now an illusion is maybe your notes will tell.

412
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:20.970
You should tell you too.

413
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.800
The greetings of Jesus in the garden when he comes,

414
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.650
I'm sorry to Jerusalem and it says benedict to prevent it.

415
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:33.650
The which means a Beatrice means a number of things.
First of all,

416
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.530
a paper logical connection between garden and city,

417
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.420
which we have already been seeing here.

418
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:44.040
The garden is not opposed to the political,
let's say to the city.

419
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:48.780
It is the history and the garden come together in Dante's imagination,

420
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:53.990
but there's a further type ology that the Beatrice comes the way Jesus came into

421
00:28:54.571 --> 00:28:55.380
history.

422
00:28:55.380 --> 00:29:00.380
Beatrice will come into the soul of the lover so that she is surrounded.

423
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:05.691
She has wrapped in a kind of aura of a christological language and she will

424
00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:10.740
become with grace the way one can experience grace in,

425
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.520
in,
in,

426
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:16.470
in the world through this kind of a direct love on two or oneself,

427
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:20.820
so Latin again and then a third image and throwing flowers up.
Noun,

428
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:25.430
money boost or that Lilia,
plaintiff,
another three state,

429
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.500
three phrases in Latin.
He will go on,
translate and get.
Fourth one.

430
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.800
This is a more interesting image because it's taken straight out of the Aeneid

431
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:37.770
of book six of a virtuous and he it.

432
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.910
So it's already a homage to a who is about to disappear.

433
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:47.530
You see how the dramas here sort of interwoven,
uh,
the idea of,
uh,

434
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.500
what,
what the garden is and how is the garden related to oneself.
One's history,

435
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.780
the idea of the arrival in the meaning of Beatrice into the life of the pilgrim.

436
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.760
And then also the loss of virtual is a poet.
And,
uh,

437
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.040
whatever his vision may be and what are his vision may be,

438
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:08.110
is indicated by this fragments.

439
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:13.370
The fragments reverse to the premature death that Virgil celebrates.

440
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:18.020
And it's very in a giant way in book six of the,
with an,

441
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.270
he is,
uh,

442
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:23.080
has gone down into hades in order to see the whole of history.

443
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:27.220
This is the descent into the oracles,
the father,

444
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:29.710
and to see on Kaiser's,
but it is this whole,

445
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:34.510
the future that is going to derive and stem from him.
Uh,

446
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.010
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,

447
00:30:36.011 --> 00:30:41.011
and crisis will point out to him the shade of a young man who sits on the side,

448
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:45.340
sad,
his name is Marcellus,
who will die too young.

449
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.410
And then they will add or throw Lilly's with open hands.

450
00:30:50.411 --> 00:30:54.450
They're literally being a few Muriel symbol.
All right.
The,
the,

451
00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:58.750
the chrysanthemums for instance,
or some such things and in some cultures.

452
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.270
So it's an image of a premature death,

453
00:31:01.271 --> 00:31:03.910
which clearly is linked also to Beatrice,

454
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.120
but who died in a premature premature death,

455
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:12.300
but also to Virgil because it's the anticipation of the loss of virtual.

456
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.890
It's [inaudible].
It is a safe,

457
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.700
virtuous vision was under the aegis of mortality.
And,

458
00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.670
and feel it,

459
00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:25.730
you'd as if as a virtual could never really be thought of as saved because his

460
00:31:26.341 --> 00:31:30.730
song is a song limited to the world of death.
Uh,

461
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.020
and let's see,
um,
tardis containers.
I want,
so at the beginning of the day,

462
00:31:35.021 --> 00:31:39.940
the eastern part or Rosie and the rest of the sky clear and beautiful as the

463
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:43.220
sun's face come full shaded,
et Cetera,
uh,

464
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.550
with a lady appeared to me,

465
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.640
this is Beatrice Gert.

466
00:31:48.641 --> 00:31:53.641
With all of over white way or look a few elegance.

467
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:59.160
Listen to how he describes the collars,
the fashions,

468
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.560
Gert with all of our over a white veil clouded under green mantle with a color

469
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:08.920
of a living flame.
In my spirit,

470
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.660
I call that the Italian flag.
By the way,
the way she seems to be,
the red,

471
00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:15.820
white and green and my spirit,

472
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:21.060
which now so long has not been overcome with all trembling her presence without

473
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:26.260
having more knowledge by the eyes through hidden virtual that came from her felt

474
00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.110
all love.
Great power.

475
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:34.530
This is a rewriting of the poem of the autobiography of Dante that you remember

476
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:37.620
reading the Vita Nuova.
Uh,

477
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.780
he's experiencing the of Beatrice exactly the kind of effects the she has over

478
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:49.370
him.
Uh,
the,
the core three love,
the sweet new style,
the trembling,

479
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:54.050
the an ability to speak as soon as I love to virtual that smoked on my side,

480
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.900
which already had pierced me before I was out of my boyhood.

481
00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:01.580
I turned to the left with a confidence of a little child that runs to his mother

482
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.310
when he's afraid are in distress.
To say to Virgil,

483
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:07.610
not a drop of blood is left in me that does not tremble.

484
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.300
I know the marks of the engine flame,

485
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:16.930
he's scared and turns to Virgil and he's about to say,

486
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.800
and we'll say the famous lines.
I know the marks of the engine flame,

487
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:27.160
which he said translation of the words Dido will speak when she meets an ies in

488
00:33:30.951 --> 00:33:31.784
Hades,

489
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.740
I know the marks of the ancient Rome and now the image of death and mortality

490
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.260
taken from the Aeneid.

491
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.430
Dante's linking Virgil with that kind of metaphor,

492
00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.550
uh,
in that sort of limitation of passion.

493
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.260
But Virgil had left us bereft of him.
Virtual,

494
00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:54.200
sweetest father Virgil tumor giving myself for my salvation,
not the,
the,

495
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:57.910
all the ancient mother lost avail my cheeks wash with do that.

496
00:33:57.911 --> 00:34:02.240
They should not be staying again with tears.
And this is Beatrice's first words,

497
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.930
Dante,
because virtual leaves the,
we've not,

498
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:11.450
we've not yet for thou must weep for another salt,

499
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:13.080
like an admirable who goes to poop.

500
00:34:13.081 --> 00:34:16.550
I'm proud to say demand the server on the other ships and heart and them and the

501
00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:19.430
work.
So on the left side of the car,

502
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:24.470
we're not turned up the sound of my name,
which is noted here of necessity.

503
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.790
I saw the lady who first appeared to me veiled and that the angelic festival

504
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.790
direct horizon will be on the stream or ready.

505
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:35.030
The veil that fell from her head and circled with Minerva's leaves.

506
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.740
Did Not let her be plainly seen,
royally,
still stern and have be a bearing.

507
00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.420
She continued like one who while she speaks holds back his hottest words.

508
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:48.920
Look at me.
Well I am.
I am indeed.
Beatrice.

509
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.240
How there's thou approach the mountain,
this darn hot.

510
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:57.030
Know that here man is happy.
Um,

511
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.770
well,
a number of things here,
uh,

512
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.070
virtual has disappeared now hours alone.

513
00:35:04.071 --> 00:35:08.990
So that's what I call the self confrontation with his past.
Who is Beatrice?

514
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:14.060
How am I going to account for my failings to be addressed?

515
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.650
And what is this you're going to expect of me?
She's harsh.
Uh,

516
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.530
the line of the harsh language of love to the point,

517
00:35:21.531 --> 00:35:23.720
if I may be a little bit too too,

518
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:26.700
without really lessening the intensity of this passage,

519
00:35:26.701 --> 00:35:31.610
this passage pretty intense.
But I feel that I have to tell you,
uh,
a little,

520
00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.850
uh,
to distract you a little bit for 10 seconds.
Um,

521
00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.870
both this has written about this passage,

522
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:44.310
one of the beautiful,
beautiful essay,
um,
on,

523
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:46.740
on this scene and he says,

524
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:52.340
this is the only time that Dante really made a mistake because we,

525
00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:58.210
it is spoke to me the way he spoke.
She spoke to virtual tool.
Dante,

526
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:02.730
I would have said to her,
look,
if that's the way you feel,

527
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:07.230
I'm going to go right back.
And,
uh,
but [inaudible] say that this is a,

528
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:12.300
this is a contemporary,
a visionary like,
uh,
like Barack is not Dante.

529
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.860
Where we are told is that this is the first and only time in the poem.

530
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:20.630
The dentist name is hurt.
Dante.

531
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.960
She will never call him Donald again.
And he has never been called Dante before.

532
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.430
In other words,

533
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.510
this is the point where the poem from the epic that has been the epic of his

534
00:36:31.511 --> 00:36:35.010
idea,
the epic of hope,
the pilgrim laws,

535
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.020
they can longing and memory,
uh,
between hope and memory.

536
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:45.240
Um,
uh,
the poem of justice.
Now it becomes an autobiography.

537
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.790
Now with his own story,

538
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.590
there is a shift in genre from an epic story,
from the loss of Virgil,

539
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:57.450
the epic poet,
to an autobiographical focus.
Dante,
this is you,

540
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:01.770
the specificity and it reduced the ability of his own experience.
Dante,

541
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.130
he says,
and he will laugh with not with her answer and he will,

542
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.180
he will add that his name has is here,

543
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.000
registered out of necessity.

544
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.260
And what is the necessity that he has?
What's,
what's the necessity about,

545
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:19.410
speaking of oneself,
why would one be go on?

546
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.260
Speaking of us have one speech oneself.
Um,
uh,

547
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.190
I'll that because one wants to be exemplary.
Two others.
One believes that what,

548
00:37:29.191 --> 00:37:34.191
what one has experienced is crucial for somebody else's self knowledge,

549
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:40.370
somebody else's experience or one once who exempt vituperation from his own

550
00:37:41.101 --> 00:37:44.670
name.
It's the,
I'm paraphrasing Dante's words and they,
the way,

551
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.760
the way he registered to them in this,
uh,
uh,

552
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.930
philosophical texts that he writes called the banquet where he speaks about

553
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:56.190
himself and he says there are two people who have spoken about themselves in

554
00:37:56.191 --> 00:37:59.490
exemplary ways.
One is Augustan in their confessions,

555
00:37:59.491 --> 00:38:03.360
a book that I have asked you repeatedly to read and I have read from.

556
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:07.620
And the other one is [inaudible] that I have alluded to in the consolation of

557
00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:08.430
philosophy,

558
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:13.430
the philosopher who is in jail and seeks to find comfort to the,

559
00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:18.540
uh,
the,
the imputations of criminal conduct,
uh,

560
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.860
laid on him by thinking about philosophy and talking about himself.

561
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:27.720
And whereas Augustan of course is discussing his own,
his own conversion.

562
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:32.490
So the idea of the necessity is a,
both a Dante's alluding to,

563
00:38:32.491 --> 00:38:36.820
to auto-biographical texts,
uh,
both of which make it,
uh,

564
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:41.570
uh,
the,
the talking about oneself in need as he calls it,
uh,

565
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.660
a necessity.
Uh,
so this now will continue.

566
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:50.740
And the,
with Canto 30,
uh,
the first thing that she will do,

567
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.090
Beatrice will do,
and we'll turn true canto 31.

568
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:59.530
There's an account of Canto 30,
continues with,
uh,
uh,

569
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.810
the story of how his,
uh,
um,

570
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:07.030
failures when she died is told in the Vita Nuova.

571
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.570
He went on looking for someone who could replace a Beatrice.

572
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.930
And now Dante goes on,
uh,
asking,
uh,

573
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:16.240
actually indulging in a confession,

574
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.620
literally an Augustinian moment and other parts of the autobiographical moment

575
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.150
and a confessional form.
Uh,
and this is a,

576
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.590
let me just read a few,

577
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.820
a few lines here before we move on.
Uh,
oh,

578
00:39:30.821 --> 00:39:33.940
thou that art on that side of the sacred river,

579
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.420
she began again turning against me.
The point of a speech,

580
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.080
which even with the edge that seemed sharp to me and continued with a pause,

581
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.233
say safe.

582
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:48.240
This is true to such an accusation that confession must needs be joined.

583
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:54.090
My faculties were so confounded that my voice began and was spent before it was

584
00:39:54.401 --> 00:39:58.450
released from its organs.
She foreboder little then said,

585
00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:03.820
but thinkers that a phrase that should remind you,

586
00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:08.680
I know that it's too little and they would not be,
uh,
too demanding,

587
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.810
but it should remind you,
um,
what effect this is Francesca.

588
00:40:12.811 --> 00:40:17.811
So this is what what Dante was asking Francesca in Canto five and now it's

589
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:21.040
Beatrice.
The roles are inverted.

590
00:40:21.041 --> 00:40:24.670
Who's asking Dante to resume as if,

591
00:40:24.671 --> 00:40:29.671
where that confession of a feeling that Francesca hidden a gun in Canto five of

592
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.470
of in fair no.
What thing,

593
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.940
what thinkers Dow answer me for they sad memories are not yet destroyed in the

594
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.500
by the water confusion and fear.
Mingle together,
draw forth from my mouth.

595
00:40:41.501 --> 00:40:43.330
A Yes such that to hear it,

596
00:40:43.331 --> 00:40:48.331
there was no need of sight as a cross bow shot with two great strains breaks the

597
00:40:49.151 --> 00:40:50.440
code.
Uh,

598
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:54.190
let me just go on after a with lines 36,

599
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.100
after he even a bitter cy,
I had already,

600
00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:01.630
I had hardly the voice to answer and the lip shaped it with difficulty weeping.

601
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:05.320
I said,
present things with a floor falls pleasure.

602
00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:09.760
Turned my steps as soon as you face was hid.

603
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.910
Uh,
the,
the,
uh,

604
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.970
he's alluding exactly as he did in the Vita Nuova to his change of heart.

605
00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:23.200
As soon as Beatrice died and now we can,
she can change.

606
00:41:23.201 --> 00:41:28.201
And she had style kept silence or denied whether confessors that fault to be no

607
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:32.890
less plain by such a judge it known,
but went from a men's home,

608
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.910
uh,
breaks forth condemnation of his sin in our code that will turn turns back

609
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:40.070
against the edge,
nevertheless,

610
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:44.150
in order that their mason now bear the shame of the wonderings.

611
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:48.340
And then at the time hearing the sirens be stronger.

612
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.450
Lay aside the sewing of tears and Harken social though here,

613
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:56.750
how my buried fresh should have directed the the other way.

614
00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.470
Never the nature outside before the beauties are greatest,
the family members,

615
00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.840
et cetera.
Um,

616
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:07.330
the passage is extraordinary because it helps us to glos retrospectively,

617
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:09.290
eh,

618
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:14.290
but it was a fairly mysterious allegory in a purgatory.

619
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:22.390
You remember where Dante meets the sirens or dreams of this Irene.

620
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:27.480
Um,
and then a lady appeared is hiring is a,

621
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.670
was an allegory of a temptation and erotic temptation.

622
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.620
Someone who wants to rework the pilgrim and promises happiness.

623
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:41.420
You remember,
I'm going to make you happy.
You're on.
You need to go nowhere else.

624
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.170
Uh,
and now,
uh,
uh,
and then we,
there was,

625
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:48.950
there was also the appearance of a,
uh,
a mysterious woman,

626
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:53.740
equally mysterious woman who manages to um,
uh,

627
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.220
send away,
uh,
the,
the,
this hiring.
She,

628
00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:01.910
if she wakes up the pilgrim and the journey there can can continue.

629
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.190
And if you recall,
we are saying,
well,

630
00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.360
we don't know who this mysterious woman is though.
There are a number of hints.

631
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:13.370
I had read this path of the poem before.
You have probably Eh,
and uh,

632
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:15.260
uh,
and this Beatrice,
Beatrice.

633
00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:19.910
So it was a kind of an allegory of the confrontation of two women decided on the

634
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:22.200
one hand and on the other hand,
uh,

635
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:26.930
this unknown mysterious Beatrice.
Now this scene just,

636
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.710
uh,
makes it clear because what be it?

637
00:43:29.711 --> 00:43:33.560
He says you have to make a confession in case shame.

638
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.770
Now bear the shame of the wondering said another time hearing the silence be

639
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:37.604
stronger.

640
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:42.490
Lay aside the soul of tears and Hark and thou shall hear how my bill flesh and

641
00:43:42.491 --> 00:43:46.780
so on.
So she is now glossing the scene of a of this.

642
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:51.780
Irene there appeared in Canto 19 but there is more to it but there's a little

643
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:56.780
phrase that Dante is using,
uh,
and other abilities using for him.

644
00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.940
Another time when you hear the siren,
which means that there's hiring,

645
00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:07.240
it's not just the encounter with this Irene is not just an event that happened

646
00:44:07.941 --> 00:44:08.810
in the past.

647
00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:13.730
It can happen all over again and other time.
In other words,

648
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:18.380
it can still happen in the future,
which means that Danfoss conversion,

649
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.770
which is really what this poem has been telling us especially now,

650
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:26.950
which has reached this kind of autobiographical quality is not over and done

651
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:29.720
with that.

652
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:34.721
It is a conversion has to be understood as unknown going journey and that the

653
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:40.221
future itself is fraught with temptations just as much as it was fraught with

654
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:42.510
fraught with them stations in the past.

655
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.780
What Dante is changing is the other stealing an idea of a conversion or that

656
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:54.171
takes place once and for all and this making is replacing that paradigm with a

657
00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:56.610
different paradigm,

658
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.840
a paradigm of a conversion in its openness to time.

659
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.290
With the idea that it is an ongoing process.

660
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:07.040
So you have a look of what the,
the,
the,
the,

661
00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:11.040
the point that technique is done is remembering a scene of the past and glossing

662
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:14.580
that encounter that amputation was Irene moved away,

663
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:18.210
dispelled by the arrival of Beatrice.

664
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:22.320
Beatrice is talking once again about the siren and other time,

665
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:27.210
meaning I know who she was in Canton 19 of in the dream of pantry.

666
00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.710
I think she may come back again.
And I was,
once again,

667
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.130
this is the anti pastoral imagination of the poet.

668
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.120
Do not believe that you can never stop on the way,

669
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.490
do not ever believe that they are choose.

670
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.020
They're going to be unchallenged or untested in time.

671
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.190
And that thing that this is a way of,
uh,
truly,
uh,

672
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:54.680
casting Dante for what it is that poet of,
uh,
uh,
the poet of,
uh,

673
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.430
uh,
open to the power of the future and,

674
00:45:57.431 --> 00:46:02.400
and drawn to the idea that the future is still a part of his,
uh,

675
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:06.750
his experience.
And then by the way,
he goes on,
which I would really take us up.

676
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.610
But that's the essential point.

677
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:12.670
A truly the though is this is a line 55,
uh,

678
00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:17.690
the o's at the forest shaft of deceptive things to have risen up after me who

679
00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:22.290
was such no longer no young girl or a vanity of such brief worth,

680
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.920
should have been Thai wings downward to a wig,
more shots,

681
00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:28.660
a young chick weights for two or three,
but in vain is,

682
00:46:28.661 --> 00:46:33.390
and let's spread the Rado and so on.
Uh,
this is,
uh,
another,

683
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:37.860
literally the illusion to the poems that Dante wrote for what he called the

684
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.640
[inaudible],
the,
the young woman,
uh,

685
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:46.470
that Beatrice seems to be Ma remind him,
uh,
uh,
uh,

686
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:51.390
of,
um,
and now we come to,
uh,
Canto 33,

687
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.080
the end of purgatory,
uh,

688
00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:59.310
the end of purgatory where I really want to,
um,

689
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.750
uh,
focus on one image,
one image in particular,

690
00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:08.940
which is a which,
which is,
uh,
the image of a prophecy that,

691
00:47:08.941 --> 00:47:12.720
uh,
Beatrice,
Beatrice,

692
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:17.310
we are at the end of time,
pull the Tori and uh,

693
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.080
he goes on,
she goes on,
I'm sorry,
promising eh deliver,

694
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.490
who will come.
Uh,

695
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:28.590
the argument now is no longer about Dante himself.

696
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.580
It's an argument about history.

697
00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:35.020
Is there a deliverance for history?
Uh,

698
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:40.080
is it possible for the whole human family to go back to a condition that at

699
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:45.130
least if you're not the garden of Eden as such,
from the point of view,

700
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:49.470
which we can see at least the towers of the true city.

701
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:53.200
That's the way Dante calls it in the political tract.

702
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.560
Monaca so he's talking about,
uh,

703
00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:00.130
a figure that man to history that will enter history at the end of time.

704
00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:05.310
That's why I stress that dramatic.
The poem is literally poets,

705
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.990
the at the,
at the outer edge of time.

706
00:48:07.991 --> 00:48:11.890
There's no time when we didn't go into paradise once again.

707
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:17.050
So let me tell you what this,
and we'll try to explain it for you.

708
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:21.550
Uh,
lines 30 and falling.
And she said to me from fear and shame,

709
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.470
I will have the free day cells henceforth that was amazed.

710
00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:31.330
No longer speak like one that dreams no,

711
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:36.790
that the vessel,
she's tough.
She's tough.
She's a,
she's attacking him.

712
00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.590
Uh,
uh,
she will be the teacher and from now on,

713
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:46.180
no,
that the vessel,
the serpent broke was and is not.

714
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:50.380
But let him know that it has the blame.
Be assured that God's vengeance,

715
00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:51.880
fierceness,
ESOP,

716
00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:57.480
not for all the time should the eagle probably the eagle of the empire,

717
00:48:57.701 --> 00:49:02.380
but without air that left his feathers on the cars it became became monster.

718
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:07.740
And then pray for I see assuredly and therefore tell of it.

719
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.760
Stars already near to give us the time.

720
00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:17.970
Secure for more check and hindrance when a 510 and five one sent from God shall

721
00:49:21.881 --> 00:49:26.170
slay the feverish woman and the giant who sins with her.

722
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:29.080
And perhaps my doc Taylor famous in this,

723
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:32.590
things persuades the less because in the fashion it clouds their mind,

724
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:33.850
but soon the facts,

725
00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:38.851
she'll be deniers that will solve this hard enigma without loss of flocks and

726
00:49:39.671 --> 00:49:40.504
pour.

727
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:44.680
So she delivers an enigma and enigmatic prophecy.

728
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.010
Enigma is a word that obviously means mystery,

729
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:52.120
but it's also linked to allegory.
You know,
you talk about irony allegory,

730
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:57.040
they'll tropes that drum Marion's place under the same,

731
00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:01.960
a general subdivision would say it's an enigma,
it's mysterious,

732
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:03.220
it's not quite clear.

733
00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:07.180
And the lack of clarity only adds I think to,

734
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.490
to the the fear,
uh,
uh,
in the speculations of,
of course about what this is.

735
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.630
It's a new medical symbol is,
which is recently,

736
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.420
he says it's at 510 and five.
Uh,

737
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:24.190
that's the way through to the 510 and five,
515.
Um,

738
00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:29.570
you do know that numbers we have been talking a little bit about this.

739
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:34.930
Numbers are viewed as containing medieval numerical symbolism views,

740
00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:42.401
numbers as containing the essence and the secrets actually of creation that

741
00:50:42.551 --> 00:50:47.210
would go writing Isidore of Seville goes over writing sensors as take the number

742
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:50.630
away from things and things will perish,
will fall apart.

743
00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.520
What is a Pythagorean idea,

744
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:57.670
but keeps all things together is just this sense of call it musical rhythmic

745
00:50:59.241 --> 00:51:03.840
car,
a numerical ordering.
Uh,
and of course the greater,

746
00:51:03.841 --> 00:51:08.260
the number that maybe everybody knows is a six x six,

747
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:11.810
which is the number of,
of the antichrist.
Right?

748
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:15.260
So Nancy is writing a 500,
one and five,

749
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:20.460
what on Earth could it be?
All of the speculations?
I could,
uh,
I could,
I could,

750
00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:24.620
uh,
they're hilarious of this.
What they could mean.
There are those who believe.

751
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:28.220
Well,
it's really refers to the year 13,
15.

752
00:51:28.221 --> 00:51:31.310
We have no reason to believe that he says verse 800,

753
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:36.490
the Year of Charlemagne declaring the holy Roman empire and five,

754
00:51:36.621 --> 00:51:38.990
one,
five and the issue 1315.

755
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:42.560
So Dante's really thinking about an imminent event in his own time.

756
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:47.090
There's nothing in the text that will allow us to see this and allow us to make

757
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:51.920
it credible.
So what is it?
Uh,
actually it was found that the way,

758
00:51:51.921 --> 00:51:56.921
the best way to describe it is really in written in the x V in a 510 and five,

759
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.970
um,

760
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:06.970
that this is the best way to try to make any sense of this prophecy and of

761
00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:08.980
course,
and other materials,

762
00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:13.000
interpretations that are just regale to you for your own reluctance.

763
00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:18.020
Temporal relaxation.
This was immediately became the,
uh,

764
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:20.990
five x and Dukes.
Uh,
he,
uh,

765
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:25.460
between 19 and 23 and 1943,
this was a prophecy of Mussolini,

766
00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.870
of all people who would come and deliver the,
the,
the,

767
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:33.650
the world and other ridiculous of course interpretation.
But it was fun.

768
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:37.970
But some very good back to simple tennis.
It's amazing.

769
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.390
The two historians,
one actually,

770
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.880
historically when I literally historian and therefore they took two different

771
00:52:43.881 --> 00:52:47.960
views that in the medieval illustrations,

772
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.130
there is a moment,
by the way,
I'm just preamble this.
This is the founder,

773
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:56.400
medieval illustrations of the mass.
There's a moment in the mass with this,

774
00:52:56.401 --> 00:53:00.600
this whole cold,
uh,
uh,
or prayers,
you know,
the,
the,

775
00:53:00.601 --> 00:53:05.310
the idea that Christ is coming Sacramento and they have the,
have the,

776
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:09.680
sure it is truly right and uh,
and dressed and the Latin,
uh,

777
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:14.860
the you used to mass v The d and it's always written like this.

778
00:53:14.961 --> 00:53:18.710
And they explained,
we annex across the joins,

779
00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:20.270
a human and the divine.

780
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:25.480
So that's really the prayer or the enigma of Beatrice is for the apocalyptic end

781
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.920
of time.
The time when,
uh,
uh,

782
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.340
Christ will return to Earth.
The first time he came.

783
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:36.720
First of all as a human being,

784
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.250
five 10 and 500 the second time,

785
00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.960
who will come first of his divinity,

786
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:48.110
so 510 and and and and five the divinity and the humanity.

787
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.150
Second,
the second element,

788
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:56.430
the to humanity and divinity joined together by the x of the cross Drake

789
00:53:57.771 --> 00:54:02.050
discovery,
number of infinite problems that I have.
I hope I'll have,

790
00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:07.440
let me bear with me for a couple of minutes so that I can tell you more about

791
00:54:07.441 --> 00:54:10.980
this.
If this is an apocalyptic symbol,
this was here.

792
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:15.510
You understand what we mean by an apocalyptic symbol,
right?
Apocalyptic prophecy.

793
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.900
The prophecy apocalypse means for visionary coming from the apocalypse of St

794
00:54:21.361 --> 00:54:26.361
John and implying the Dante believes in some kind of imminent end of time,

795
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:31.920
right?
History is coming to an end.
If he believed in this,

796
00:54:31.921 --> 00:54:36.921
and this is to be understood as an apocalyptic symbol of an imminent end of

797
00:54:37.201 --> 00:54:37.920
time.

798
00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.300
This would make Dante what is called a Joa kissed and they have to explain to

799
00:54:42.301 --> 00:54:45.250
you who this man is.
If there's a man by the name of joke,

800
00:54:45.251 --> 00:54:48.240
him of flora who was a,

801
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.610
we'll see him in paradise.

802
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:55.790
Joe hemo flora who had a theory of history in a kind of Chipper,

803
00:54:56.521 --> 00:55:01.470
tight structure [inaudible] flora.
Uh,
the,

804
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:06.480
the idea is that history is pattern on the trinity.

805
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.960
So there is an age of the father which roughly goes from creation to the time of

806
00:55:12.181 --> 00:55:13.710
the biblical patriarchs.

807
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:18.480
Then there is the age of the son that goes from the time of the incarnation to

808
00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:20.760
roughly 1260,
his own time.

809
00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:25.410
This is Joe came flora and then this and the age of the spirit that goes from

810
00:55:25.411 --> 00:55:28.860
the,
the uh,
the time of 1260,

811
00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.700
when thanks to the fraternal orders,

812
00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:37.970
all structures and only institutions will disappear and Hume and mankind will

813
00:55:39.361 --> 00:55:43.290
experience a time of brotherhood and chastity.

814
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:47.400
There'll be no marriages,
there'll be no state,
they will be nothing.

815
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:53.180
And I say California is already anticipated in seen by this great figure of Joe

816
00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:58.070
came of Laura.
If the [inaudible] were Joe,

817
00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:00.840
a joke is that could treat a number of problems.

818
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:06.200
What I have just been describing to you was viewed as a most heretical theory of

819
00:56:07.501 --> 00:56:10.980
history.
Why was it heretical?
Because in effect,

820
00:56:10.981 --> 00:56:15.810
joke him of flora was,
uh,
with this theory and age of the father,

821
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:21.140
the age of the son and the age of the spirit was in effect and doing the unity

822
00:56:21.451 --> 00:56:24.690
of the Trinity,
uh,
this to hey the truth is no longer simple.

823
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:29.710
Telisa together he's dividing the trinet into three distinct parts and no less a

824
00:56:31.331 --> 00:56:33.460
great theologian of the Dantes on time,

825
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:35.770
whom Dante will encounter very soon in paradise.

826
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.590
And they are going to discuss joke Aamer flora together.

827
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.980
Bonaventure we'll go on really,
uh,

828
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:46.720
writing a piece in order to declare joke Aamer flora heretical.

829
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.550
So if this is a,

830
00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:53.740
a very powerful explanation that Dante's regal alluding to the second coming at

831
00:56:54.431 --> 00:56:56.960
the end of time,
the DXV,
uh,

832
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:01.810
when Christ will return to Earth to restore the messianic advent to restore

833
00:57:01.811 --> 00:57:03.590
justice to the world,
uh,

834
00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.960
and it will come first of all in glory of the divinity first and the humanities

835
00:57:07.961 --> 00:57:12.940
second,
both joined by the cross,
the humanity and the divinity together.
Uh,

836
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:17.890
then,
and if it's not an uh,
uh,
is he an apocalyptic writer?

837
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:22.180
I doubted his an apocalyptic writer.
This is no poet.
I know,

838
00:57:22.181 --> 00:57:26.380
and I think we have given plenty of evidence of this or the last two months who

839
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:31.410
cares more about the institutions who believes that the institutions are

840
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:32.344
history.

841
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:36.310
And of course he attacks them in the measuring in which he thinks that they have

842
00:57:36.311 --> 00:57:40.630
to be a revitalized,
refreshed,
and improved.

843
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:44.840
But you cannot go on attacking the institutions,
uh,
from,
uh,

844
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:49.690
without really believing in their vital importance.
In history.

845
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:54.430
It talks about the empire.
He talks about the church.
It talks about,
um,
uh,
law.

846
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:57.400
He talks about,
uh,
uh,
family,
et cetera.

847
00:57:57.401 --> 00:58:01.390
They're old institutions that preserve their enduring importance.

848
00:58:01.391 --> 00:58:03.580
So if it's not an apocalyptic writer,

849
00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:08.620
where is he then I think that this is an allusion to the coming of the second

850
00:58:10.511 --> 00:58:14.760
coming,
but without removing all the joke,
historic,
uh,

851
00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.970
peripheral area that our company that prophecy,
this is indeed the time.

852
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.730
It doesn't refer to the now of history,

853
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:26.590
the first two at a time that nobody can really fathom and nobody can really
know.

854
00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:27.850
So I'm giving,

855
00:58:27.851 --> 00:58:32.851
I have given you a reading of this passage and giving you a glimpse of the,

856
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.660
the logical complications that are usually a company where it would seem to be

857
00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:39.730
such a neat,
uh,

858
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.600
discovery or needs glossing over an image.

859
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:46.060
And of course with a,
this prophecy,

860
00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:50.650
the poem will come to an end and the appointment comes to an end with a Dante

861
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:53.230
who goes,
and then we'll talk about this image again,

862
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:57.100
who has to be ritually immersed.

863
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.950
He will be merged into two rivers,
the river Levy,

864
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:06.240
the liver of forgetfulness,
and the river.
You know,

865
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:11.330
the river of good memories.
It's a ritual roper operational.

866
00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:15.670
This is toward the end of Canto 33 that reminds you of the ritual actions,

867
00:59:15.671 --> 00:59:16.990
a beginning of Canto one,

868
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:21.290
but Dante washes his face and there's two gird his loins with you.

869
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:26.290
Remember with the reed that was growing spontaneously on the shore of a,

870
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.690
of the sea,
but well done.

871
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:33.620
People's own chain is the two rivers leafy and you know,

872
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:38.090
the live flow out of the same source.

873
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:44.060
And then he says like tool,
lazy friends,
friends who are fond of each other,

874
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:48.800
they go on parting leisurely.
That's the image that users,

875
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:54.160
what is interesting is that his thinking of memory and forgetfulness,

876
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:56.410
the leafy and you know,

877
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.800
as entailing a child so that there's no Eurasia,

878
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:04.850
which is not at the same time and memory that each contains the other.

879
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.140
And Dante we'll go has a lot to say about forgetful memory,

880
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.700
especially in the,
the way the poem will be written.
And finally,

881
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:16.490
uh,
uh,
with a line,
the product,

882
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:21.290
the whole poem ends with the whole Purgatorio ends with align that obviously,
uh,

883
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:25.370
remind you of,
uh,
um,
the,

884
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.480
the uh,
the video end of the inferno from north most holy water.

885
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.540
This is Canto 33.
I came forth again,

886
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:34.880
remade even as new plants,

887
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:38.620
the very language over the beginning of Purgatorio one,
uh,

888
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.370
renewed with new leaves,

889
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:44.390
pure and ready to mound to the stars.

890
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:47.610
Dante once again now is,
uh,
uh,

891
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.800
at the top fold to the story and he will fly next like lightening on to the moon

892
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.600
and we shall see him and this guy in the planet today,
epic.
Cosmological.

893
01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:04.250
I pick that,
uh,
we'll start on the next time,

894
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:08.070
but now I'm sure you have,
uh,
uh,

895
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:13.070
questions and we'll go doing okay with timing.
So,
so please,

896
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:15.920
uh,
shoot.

897
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:20.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

898
01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:36.650
Yes.
Great.
Perfect.

899
01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:46.340
Could you just expand on how that fits in the be the

900
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.310
perfect progression,
not understanding

901
01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.090
very good question.
Help us understand or become closer to God.

902
01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:01.870
<v 0>Yes.
Uh,
the,
the question is that I spoke about,</v>

903
01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:05.080
uh,
Canto 30 of Purgatorio.

904
01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:09.940
I spoke about the transition formal transition from,

905
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:14.860
uh,
the,
the,
the structure of the epic with a virtual,

906
01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.490
the poet of the epic.
And then moving on to effect,

907
01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:24.210
I spoke of the autobiographical,
uh,
first of all that we're,
we're,
Beatrice,

908
01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:28.950
uh,
refers to Coles,
Dante by name.
So it's his story.

909
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:32.100
Dante don't cry because Virgil has disappeared.

910
01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.730
I'm going to give you a chance to cry for other reasons and then goes on into a

911
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:39.210
confession,
which is an Augustinian form.
But also it's true.

912
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.520
I mentioned that is a transition too.
I mean,

913
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:45.570
I did say that in a paradise is,
uh,
is,

914
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.310
is the world of aesthetics where the ethical or ordering,

915
01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.790
uh,
is liquidated in a certain sense.

916
01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:58.791
So the question is how does this respond to the whole arc of the poem?

917
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.200
What kind of,
uh,
how,
what am I,

918
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:04.620
what am I really saying about the whole experience of the poem to make,

919
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:09.180
make the aesthetic,
uh,
essential for knowledge?
That's,
that's the argument.

920
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.500
And that is true.
I,

921
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:14.640
I really welcome this question because that's the way I'm reading poetry as

922
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:19.320
opposed to whatever way of knowing I have.
I keep saying this,
uh,

923
01:03:19.321 --> 01:03:23.710
that it's really a way of knowing.
Um,
uh,
oh,

924
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:24.810
from her point of view,

925
01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:28.760
a philosophical kind of a poetry realizing and keeping in mind that there are

926
01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:29.990
always distinctions and,

927
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:35.170
and ongoing quarrels between poetry and,

928
01:03:35.361 --> 01:03:39.290
uh,
and philosophy.
Uh,
but Lisa is say,
uh,

929
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:41.400
like any true ethics.

930
01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.360
This is a general pronouncement that doesn't make it,

931
01:03:45.361 --> 01:03:48.540
but it's a kind of premise to what I'll be saying later.

932
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:52.270
Any through ethics can only be successful in the measuring,

933
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:57.280
which it stops operating.
That's when the ethics is really,
uh,

934
01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:00.510
uh,
you can say that it has done its job as it were.

935
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:05.630
So we enter a world where now is the world of paradise and uh,

936
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.570
and Dante goes on,
uh,
representing this,
this world.

937
01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:12.970
He'll never forget the earth.
It's,

938
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:17.580
I have to qualify that even in paradise.
He's going to look at the earth.

939
01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:22.730
He celebrates the greatest aspect of human life.

940
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:27.600
Uh,
work,
love things that join,

941
01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.820
join the community together.

942
01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:34.770
He will see also the distortions that are going on where they are in the,

943
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:39.030
in the empire,
in the,
the political life or in the life of the church.

944
01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.000
This also this,
every time that there is a retrospective look,

945
01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:46.680
there is a kind of dismay that he will feel.
So there is,
there is all of that,

946
01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:51.300
but the emphasis is on the,
the world of paradise is about dance.

947
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:56.670
It's about songs is about,
it's about love.

948
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.820
It's about stars were in each other.

949
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.640
It's about spectacular.
Uh,
Ms. Hanson,

950
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:08.010
the pyrotechnics of a,
that he is about the different forms of light.

951
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.030
What is this about exactly what I call the aesthetic experiences are all a

952
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.470
poetic,
uh,
artistic experiences?
Well,

953
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.520
the first thing you have to keep in mind,

954
01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:23.521
this damn Tiberi things of a theology that is really like poetry and the origin

955
01:05:25.651 --> 01:05:30.100
of this poem that he's like poetry in the sense that both are part of,

956
01:05:30.101 --> 01:05:33.040
or if you wish,
and even won't even call it theology,

957
01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.680
but let me call it finish that sentence is a theology says,

958
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.610
I put it in the sense that it's,
it's a playful theology,

959
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:44.640
a way of understanding that the essence of God now can be seen in his comical,

960
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.040
uh,

961
01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.870
figuration a god who is the artist that God,
who is,

962
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:57.130
who,
who,
who thinks that this is the way in which human beings we're supposed to.

963
01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:59.260
When it first created in the garden of Eden,

964
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.860
where we're really in a garden meant to play.

965
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:04.780
And that's where we're going back to.

966
01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.570
It's a way of casting the divinity and the most as beauty,
uh,

967
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:14.020
a duty that that also encompasses,
uh,
uh,
the good.

968
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:18.870
But beyond that,
beyond a playful or Ludic theology,

969
01:06:18.871 --> 01:06:20.980
this idea of an aesthetic theology,

970
01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:24.490
there's something else that dentists saying about the proximity between the

971
01:06:24.491 --> 01:06:26.620
poetic and the religious.

972
01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:31.510
It's not a connection that is usually made because we tend to believe that the

973
01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:35.350
poetic,
it's just the world of deceptions make believe.

974
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.440
The fact is that both the poetic and the religious,

975
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:41.230
and we can say that even about the philosophical if you wish,

976
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.980
they respond to profound impulses within us.

977
01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:47.530
Let emotions that we have,
the,
you know,
all,

978
01:06:47.531 --> 01:06:50.170
you see beauty and you tremble in the presence of beauty,

979
01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:54.580
whether it's a human beauty,
its natural beauty or artistic beauty,
whatever,

980
01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.150
whatever it is that we are in conflict and there is something that responds in

981
01:06:58.151 --> 01:06:58.600
us.

982
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.600
And the same thing about the idea of all and the idea of a discovery or sense of

983
01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:05.561
the sublime.

984
01:07:05.561 --> 01:07:09.730
Whenever you have what we call a religious experience and they too have not

985
01:07:09.731 --> 01:07:10.990
neatly separated.

986
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:15.670
This is what drives the poet in the journey of Paradise.

987
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:20.680
This is where the,
the,
the actual source of,
uh,
of his inspiration,

988
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:25.980
that's the novelty that Dante represents and which probably some romantic poets

989
01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:31.050
much later I'm talking about the 19th century,
uh,
have been trying to,
to,

990
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:36.150
uh,
restore,
grasp or understand.
You do have that in,

991
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:40.900
uh,
in,
in Dante.
Do you have it for instance,
in the Bible,

992
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:44.800
I dare say you do.
Because whenever we think about,
you know,
it's so,

993
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:49.150
or so many courses at Yale,
I used to be taught,

994
01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:51.270
I don't look at the,
uh,
at,
at,
at,

995
01:07:51.271 --> 01:07:53.650
at the offerings anymore because I think I know them by heart,

996
01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.670
not for any other reason about the Bible is literature,
which is great,

997
01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.130
but you know,
the,
the idea,

998
01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:04.130
the underlying idea is always that the Bible can only has to be that guy,

999
01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:08.320
you know,
novels.
Uh,
and that's,
that's all right.
That's very good.

1000
01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:13.480
But that's an Oro to say that as I did that the song of songs is a fantastic,

1001
01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:17.330
I said it 10 minutes ago,
that the song of songs is a fantastic love poem.

1002
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:22.450
What I'm really saying is that the poetic is already in itself proximate to the

1003
01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:27.170
religious,
so that we,
when we think about the Bible in literature,

1004
01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.190
we are ready re unfreezing another version of this problem,

1005
01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:36.191
which is that of the Dante presents as the religious in this and the poetic in

1006
01:08:36.201 --> 01:08:39.470
paradise.
I hope I've answered your question.
Okay.
Thank you.
