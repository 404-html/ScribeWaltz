1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.220
Last time,
oh,

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.110
I was arguing with you about some of the novel Tish,

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.120
the Dante introducers.
When the poem at the start,

4
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:21.360
we'll pull the Tori one.
Uh,
there are some full more,

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.180
uh,
for the,
we'll call this scriptive.
Um,

6
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.660
novelties,
light the time,

7
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.550
the question of time as a moral innovations.

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.420
The,
the focus on the connection,

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.540
the subtle connection between freedom and a new beginnings.

10
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.990
Uh,

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.040
the idea of freedom as first of all a political value,

12
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.390
um,
and the meeting with Cato,
uh,
so that,
uh,

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.890
though insisting on this novelties and that the novelty and the new or the

14
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:06.000
possibility of renewal is exactly,
uh,
at,

15
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:10.590
at stake in Dante's do politics.
I was also trying to emphasize,

16
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:14.870
and I think that that came through,
uh,
hopefully,
uh,
with,

17
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.810
with clarity,

18
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.580
the whole tension between the old and the new,
uh,

19
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.730
the,
the pool of the past,

20
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480
the sense of nostalgia and whether it's an existential one or in the biblical

21
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.530
exodus story,
they don't style just for the,
the,
uh,
the,

22
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.450
the time of a safety.

23
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
Our parents have the in of the Jews in Egypt,

24
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.150
even though within under the slavery or that Egypt stands forward.

25
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.770
So this is where some of the issues,

26
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:52.860
and then we moved down to Ken to tool where we,

27
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.890
we've specifically on the encounter of Dante with a musician by the name of

28
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.970
Casella where Dante dramatizes as a fan aware,

29
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.190
as if mindless of what of what had happened in the previous cancer and the

30
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.780
experience of the previous candle.

31
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.110
He just lapses into exactly the same time type of predicament that the previous

32
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:18.720
Canto had featured namely,
Ah,

33
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.710
here he is indulging in memories of the past,
uh,

34
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.550
lapsing into a form of idolatry,
self confrontational.

35
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.300
He's listening to the beauty and roar of the Canto of the,

36
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:37.470
of the,
of this song that has a will sing for him.
And then finally,

37
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.220
the presence of the eruption of Keto,
once again,

38
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.280
who focuses on the ethical,
uh,

39
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.400
domains of the place.

40
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.890
Purgatory is a place of moral purification.
And so,
uh,

41
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.460
he urges oldest holes that had gathered around the song of,
uh,

42
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.860
of,
of,
uh,

43
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.780
Cassela to move away and the language that he uses that of dispersion,
uh,

44
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.800
like doves or pigeons like doves that,
uh,

45
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.840
go home dispersing throughout the,
the,
the plane.
Um,

46
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.020
clearly what,
uh,
in retrospect,
what is a parent?
I think in all of this,

47
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.490
this,
uh,
situations,
it's Dantes,
uh,

48
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.530
insistence home the power or the importance of a communal,

49
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.200
a communal desk.
They communal fate,

50
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.680
little this communal faith appears as defeated.

51
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.000
Let me just explain what I mean and then we move on with,
uh,
with,
uh,

52
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.770
today's readings.
In the case of Cato,

53
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.010
Cato has been defeated by the civil war between Pompei and sees to the point

54
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:54.060
that he had to commit suicide.
In the case of a castle,

55
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.600
a song that poem had managed to gather around the self,
nor only Dante,

56
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:02.710
but all the other souls who had become mindless of what we really were supposed

57
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:07.430
to do.
Continue.
They're climbing up the mountain and k intervenes.

58
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.250
And he also shatters that,
the,
as a losery,

59
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.410
that form of community.
What,
what,

60
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.410
what I think that Dante's after is the following,

61
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.090
they may have been defeat and,

62
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.180
and therefore the value of these experiments in communal communal existence,

63
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:30.721
that of Cato who commit suicide and that have the aesthetic gathering around the

64
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:31.640
poetry.

65
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.640
They are both partial and defeated and yet tech contain seeds that will be

66
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.670
necessary for his rethinking about how to renew a reconstruct a,

67
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:46.210
his idea of the common historical destiny.

68
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.410
This is really what,
uh,
and I hope it's,

69
00:04:48.411 --> 00:04:53.120
it's fairly clear the bushes see this a little bit on,
uh,
today.
Um,

70
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.980
uh,

71
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.980
W I turn very briefly now to canto five for a couple of reasons because it's a

72
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.880
canto five.
If I had to give a general title to the cantor,
I would say,

73
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.510
uh,
that this deals with,
uh,
uh,

74
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.930
Dante sense of a retrospective knowledge.

75
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.090
I have been really focusing on a Dante turned to the future as you know,
uh,

76
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.250
Dan who,
who,
who thinks and reflects on hope,

77
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.620
who thinks and reflects about issues such as uh,
uh,
the,

78
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.200
the uh,
the future,
the future in general,

79
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.590
that this is freedom is and,

80
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.960
and time is the future is the real time.
Uh,
nothing else really matters.

81
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.970
Everything else can only be understood as part of even when it's passed with the

82
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.080
logical and the lying assumption that that which is past was once the future,

83
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:46.540
the only real,
the only reality of time.

84
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.630
So he understands improvisatory how time moves in a uni direction,

85
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:53.650
which is future oriented.
That so it's,

86
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.860
it's really a time as future that that turns out to be also returned to the

87
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.680
garden of Eden.
But that is kind of second thought,
uh,
for him.

88
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.790
He and now though in Canto five done timid souls that um,
the,

89
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.381
the,

90
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:14.381
that sort of bring to the fore for him that power of retrospection this our

91
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:19.481
souls who managed to repent at the last minute.

92
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.600
It's almost as if,
again,
it's time,
it's a question of time,

93
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.840
but a time that is all to of inexhaustible.

94
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:29.840
It's always possible to full back,

95
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.970
reflect and turn one's life around.
One figure that he meets,

96
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:37.670
and this is Ken to five around line 90 years.

97
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:42.370
You should see in a moment why I select him.
Uh,
he meets a figure,
uh,

98
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.200
who is,
uh,
uh,
he,
he,
he would identify himself,
uh,

99
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.680
uh,
bunk conte,

100
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:52.370
the Montefeltro who is the son by the way of a main,

101
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.740
we though whom we met in Canto 27 of in fair.

102
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.010
And this is why I like to focus on him,

103
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.000
the break between the past and the future,

104
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:06.170
the sand being always a sort of statement about a project,

105
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.120
about a future product side of the door,

106
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.350
a statement about about the future and,
and,
and uh,

107
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:16.320
that father ends up in her,
the son ends up in this program,

108
00:07:16.321 --> 00:07:18.830
Total Ledge on the way to redemption.

109
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.950
So there is no chain of natural necessity and causality between the past and the

110
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:28.400
present and the future.

111
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.380
That is a focus on freedom because once you break that,

112
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.640
that bond of necessity,

113
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.430
you are really opening up inaugurating the idea that we are free,

114
00:07:38.431 --> 00:07:43.431
that we are really free to make ourselves regardless of what antecedents we may

115
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.940
have behind us.
But there's another little detail which is a formal,

116
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.280
it really tells you something about Dante's art.

117
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.450
So he goes long landlines 88 or so.

118
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:57.950
Then another spoke prey,
so made it that desire beside this five,

119
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:02.930
which drove the to the uh,
high mount.

120
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.130
What an extraordinary,

121
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.690
extraordinary language about design drawing us we are in.

122
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.880
This is Dante as universe of desire,

123
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:15.020
where impelled but desire and desire is really what moves us.

124
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.420
We love that moves us.

125
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:21.890
It's desire that impels us to go one way or the other.

126
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.060
Do Dowe do that with gracious pity.
Help mine.

127
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.120
I was of Montefeltro,
I am boom called.

128
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:36.020
And I hope now that you are sensitive to this temporal to the Kansas that this

129
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:39.410
junction intenses are really pointed those out for you.

130
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:44.590
In the Canto of Google Reno in here to health bone content is asserting his,

131
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:45.800
uh,

132
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.800
his identity in the mode of the presence presence and detaching himself with the

133
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:56.430
view of,
of the use of the past tense from the,
the,

134
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.910
um,
the,
the family Montefeltro.

135
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:05.070
Now the Jovana Mri has had care for me so that I go among this with downcast

136
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:07.620
brow.
And I said to him,

137
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.400
what force or what chains chains the or adventure adventure more than chance

138
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:19.740
chances too heavy a word,

139
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.740
and I will come back to this a little bit a little bit later,

140
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.980
where Dante reflects on the significance of which has took the sole far from

141
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.870
compel deal that the bureau praise was never known.

142
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.820
This is an extraordinary scene,

143
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:36.810
an extraordinary and counter for one very autobiographical reasoning.

144
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:42.150
And the reason is this is that Dante fought at the battle of [inaudible] was one

145
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.270
the moment of his great maturity.

146
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:47.750
He is entering into the battle,

147
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.970
the battlefield of life when he discovers that now because of the victory that

148
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:57.480
the Florentines had income [inaudible] that he also can have claims about

149
00:09:57.481 --> 00:10:00.960
himself,
about his own family and political future.

150
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.180
And how he made me means a victim.

151
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.160
And there have been those who go and claiming with very little evidence as if

152
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:12.030
you are in a battle.
I don't know how many of you know,
uh,
the field of compel.

153
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.710
Dino is,
it's pretty,
pretty large,
25 miles

154
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.900
east,
uh,
east of Florence.
Uh,
it,

155
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:26.460
the idea is that those who go on claiming that maybe this is someone that Dante

156
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:31.080
killed actually in battle and now sort of retrieve them,
brings him back.

157
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.910
There's no evidence for this,

158
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:37.500
but it is a painful autobiographical moment for that moment when he did

159
00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:42.000
experience violence and he perpetrated violence,
and this is the answer,

160
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.820
ah,
he replied at the foot of the cousin Tino,

161
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.100
rather than answering the questions a battle,

162
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.450
he goes on thinking about his death.
He recounts his death.

163
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.850
This is a poem about births.
You remember,

164
00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:58.851
I always like to say this about the vent of being born and the portentous

165
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:05.061
quality that being born implies that kind of alterations that we all can,

166
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.650
can bring on the world around us.
Uh,

167
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.770
but the very fact that we were born now he talks about death.
He replied,

168
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:17.190
the photo Cosentino stream crosses called the Kiano,

169
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.540
which rises above the hermitage in the upper ninth to the place where it's name

170
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:24.690
is Blas.
I came wounded in the throat,

171
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:29.520
flying on foot and blood in the plane.
They are lost sight and speech.

172
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.290
I ended on the name of Mary and their fell and only my fresh remained.

173
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.920
I will tell the truth.
And do thou tell it again among the living.

174
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.970
God's angel took me and he from hell cried odour from heaven.

175
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:46.470
Why does now rob me?
It's one the reason why I'm really reading this passage,

176
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:46.980
Romney,

177
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.750
to tell you about this notion of the power of time and the power of

178
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:53.920
retrospection.
Looking back,

179
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.600
that that final moment once life is,
they're the size of moment that,

180
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:03.760
uh,
confers a coherence and the meaning to one's life.
Okay.

181
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.290
We were born and we are born with certain expectations of what we can do.

182
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.820
But death becomes the revelatory event.
That's fine.

183
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.630
This is really the point of this passage.
But there's another point.

184
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.960
Dante deploys the fame rhetorical genre of the debate,

185
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.860
which he had used in the encounter with the uh,

186
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.610
[inaudible] father.

187
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:31.120
So that by the sameness of the rhetorical genre,

188
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.640
you are forced to really couple them together.

189
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.970
And yet the point is that of the distance between father and son,

190
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:44.730
that was the distance in the temporal disjunction between the past and the

191
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:48.430
present and the future.
The Canto ends with six lines,

192
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:53.380
which had extraordinary lines where sentimentalist is.

193
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:54.550
Occasionally I am,

194
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.740
I will go on and even seeing as Tuttle illusion of Dante to his own wife,

195
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.100
it's a,
it's an encounter with a beer.

196
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.350
The Ptolemaic a woman from Sienna.

197
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.000
And clearly this little passage is meant to,
uh,

198
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.500
refocus,

199
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:16.050
remind us of Francesca in Canto five of unfair.
No,

200
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.140
it's the exact symmetrical cancer.
These are the lines are,
uh,

201
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.190
which I will read.
I will go and reading also in Italian.
You read it in English.

202
00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:25.120
Uh,

203
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.120
Professor Margaret Brooks was asking me to give some evidence of,

204
00:13:30.781 --> 00:13:33.740
uh,
what the Italian language it sounds like.
And uh,

205
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.940
so it's a moment of nostalgia for,
for you too.
I take,

206
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.310
so pray Windar has returned to the world and that rested from the long way.

207
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.030
The third spa spirit fall on the second dude out.
Remember me,

208
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:50.540
who Amblyopia is a sort of,
uh,
an epitaph who,

209
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.380
who was mistreated by here by,

210
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.100
by the husbands and yet incredibly forgiving and the,

211
00:13:57.101 --> 00:14:01.210
and the word ends with a and the pathogens with uh,
uh,
the word gem,

212
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.920
which is Gemma,
uh,
Dante's wives' name.

213
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.380
Uh,
so one wonders if be a,

214
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.080
also doesn't stay in the kind of sort of wishful thinking on the part of Dante

215
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.191
that his wife,

216
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:20.191
whom he had because of exile had been forced to leave behind a may also forgive.

217
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.500
That's the point is that introducing this radical category of forgiveness,

218
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.860
which is the true scandal.
If you went to begin again,

219
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.220
then forgiveness is exactly what's demanded.

220
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.530
Let me read the passage in Italian and we move on.

221
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.910
That one to two psoriasis or natural Mundo.

222
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.290
Early posts are too,
they're a lunar via said.

223
00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:48.070
We told her to spiritual sickened record the TDMA.
Okay,

224
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:51.740
so let the CNN,
me Fay,
this

225
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.730
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] this [inaudible] call us.

226
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:04.030
We're Gemma.
Now we move tool after this highly.

227
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:09.040
I find that a passage of a great pathos as are all of them are a great intimacy.

228
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.660
Dante's really involved and justice is obliquely involved with [inaudible].

229
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.830
They both have the same battle on opposite sides.
Uh,
and,

230
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.520
and then this encounter with fear,
they told me we,
we,

231
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:27.700
we turn into a public and a political canto.
Uh,

232
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.180
and,
and uh,
let me see,

233
00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:33.230
let me just try to explain a couple of things before we move on to something

234
00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.870
that I care about here.
Uh,
in terms of the,

235
00:15:36.871 --> 00:15:39.110
the Canto 10 and 11,

236
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.620
that's how he begins Canto six political Canto Canto six of inferno and I can

237
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:47.660
throw six of paradise.
You know that now,

238
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.840
the simple principle of symmetry at work,

239
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.180
this is not came for six of inferno is about the city of Florence came of

240
00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.070
[inaudible] is about Italy and the disarray,
the chaos,
the,
the,

241
00:16:00.071 --> 00:16:03.740
this unity of,
of the country.
Uh,

242
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.540
and he starts when the game of hazard breaks up,

243
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.570
the loser is left disconcert golden over his throws again and sadly learns his

244
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:18.350
lesson with the other.
All the people go off,
one goes in front,

245
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:21.980
one seasons him from behind and other it is recited,

246
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:26.570
recalls himself to his memory.
He does not stop but listens to this one.

247
00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:27.404
And that one,

248
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.030
each to whom he reaches his hand presses on him no longer.

249
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.640
And so he saves himself from the throngs.

250
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.120
Such was I in that dense crowd turning my face to them this way and that,

251
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.530
and by promising I got free from them.
There was the maritime.

252
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.230
And so it's an extraordinary similar

253
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.080
to explain,
that's the burden of the sibling that,
uh,

254
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:59.110
all the penitents or social priced and seen Dante alive in the,

255
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.990
beyond,
that they would go after him.
He is.

256
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.990
There's a throng of people pressing on him.
That's the simulator,

257
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.790
but they seem really,
that he uses is that of a winner in a game of hazard.

258
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.920
That is to say he's the winner.

259
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.690
Dante's the winner and they all go after him and the old neglect,

260
00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:23.290
Virgil Virgil is the loser and therefore the similarly introduces her language,

261
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:29.360
which is extraordinary.
It is as if now we're speaking of his salvation,

262
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.510
of the uniqueness of this journey that he is undertaking in terms of a game of

263
00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:36.434
hazard.

264
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:41.270
We all have been thinking that this is really providential journey and now he is

265
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:44.060
casting it as if it were just a game of chance.

266
00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.160
Here is the word change that he uses hazard.
It's,
it's,

267
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.880
it's an interesting first of all,
from the point of view of,
uh,

268
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.760
of,
of the language of play.
This is playful.

269
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:01.850
It's a way of almost of casting one salvation as the casting of the,

270
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.430
of the,
of the,
of,
of the dice.

271
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.590
A lot a lottery here that someone losing someone,

272
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.020
someone win and then says,

273
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:18.021
well I was born after the incarnation so I had the possibility of saving myself

274
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:20.430
and Virgil did not.

275
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.650
It also is an interesting metaphor because it really introduces the question of

276
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:30.770
play in Dante's theological conception and it's an issue that I will talk about

277
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.820
much more extensively when we reach paradise,

278
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:41.180
but one thing is clear that Dante understands that the relationship between,

279
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.660
and that's that's all I will say unless you press me a little later,

280
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.730
but we'll talk more about this metaphor.

281
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:53.390
That antenna understands that the relationship between the soul and God is a

282
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:58.641
relationship shape by risk on both sides and that this idea of risk that would

283
00:19:02.071 --> 00:19:07.071
seem to be a blind casting of the dice in effect constitutes the freedom that

284
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:12.510
the human beings can have in the scheme of things.

285
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:17.960
The whole point of salvation is by using this language of hazard and chance is a

286
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.790
rescue.

287
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.790
It's this engaged from my the idea that God knows it all and we are going to and

288
00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:27.870
we are determined in what we do.

289
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.100
No know Dante saying by focusing on a timebound metaphor is that we are engaged

290
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.780
in a risky relationship and it's in all relationship between God and the soul.

291
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.360
There is this element of danger.
That's it.
That's the metaphor.

292
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.280
Um,
to make it more precise.
So you don't,
you,
you,

293
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:54.150
you know what I'll be going,
uh,
in the days ahead,
whenever,

294
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.850
uh,
in antiquity we will discuss,
mainly bullied.

295
00:19:58.850 --> 00:20:02.470
This is the most important author,
uh,

296
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.590
the relationship between human freedom and the,

297
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.100
and and God's foreknowledge.

298
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:13.500
They would always present the case to say that God is outside of time,

299
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:15.570
or it says being outside of time,

300
00:20:15.571 --> 00:20:20.350
old times converge in God and so that God sees all things in,

301
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:25.200
uh,
in the present.
So that should really,
God is here.
It's a point of view,

302
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:29.340
which is transcendent and therefore a synoptic.

303
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.600
And we are in a diachronic world,
past,
present,

304
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:34.590
and future.

305
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:39.240
But everything is at the same time we think that we live,

306
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:43.290
we live in a world where we do not know what tomorrow may bring us.

307
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:46.980
What are the decisions we make now have already been,
uh,
what kind of,

308
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.500
uh,
it's there.
I'm predictable,

309
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.550
or they have been determined by things that escape our control.
But God knows,

310
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.760
and this is the breathe in scheme of harmonizing God's foreknowledge and human

311
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.680
freedom.
It doesn't take too much to,

312
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:09.560
to realize that this is really a little bit of,
uh,
uh,

313
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:14.170
the illusion because you know that I'm free or am I not free?

314
00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.450
Uh,
it may be that God knows it all,

315
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:21.670
but doesn't mean that he wills that I,
that I do what I do.
He knows,

316
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.940
but he does not will it.
And yet,
you know,

317
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.060
he knows and I'm here and I don't know.

318
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.120
So my own freedom is still a little bit of a rhetorical.

319
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.900
Dante does it differently.
It's a departure from bleachers.

320
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:43.100
The relationship within God's for a knowledge for knowledge and the souls,
uh,

321
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:48.180
being in time is one that that introduces the question of chains and hazard.

322
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.660
Uh,
and that involves God,
both God and the soul.

323
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.000
And to be very precise.
He doesn't say it here.

324
00:21:58.001 --> 00:21:59.950
And that's why I hesitated to get into that.

325
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.730
I would like to work with a text to be,
to make this very clear,

326
00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.770
the issue is that in a love relationship between God and the soul,

327
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.190
we are always at risk or is at risk.

328
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.050
And if you accept the principal of the love economy regulating the unit,

329
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:19.240
which does Dante does,
certainly does,

330
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.400
then you understand this notion of hazard,
uh,
in,
uh,
in a,

331
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.300
not as a principal of a,
uh,
just a,

332
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:33.080
a change in the sense of,
uh,
um,
uh,
casual,

333
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.160
a blind,
the randomness,
but in,
in a sense of,
uh,

334
00:22:37.161 --> 00:22:41.140
of this risk proposition,
risk element,

335
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.190
then they can talk,
uh,
goes on after this particular method.

336
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:49.810
What goes on with another meeting between two poets?
Uh,

337
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.070
yes,
please.
The economy,

338
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.820
the economy of love.
The question,

339
00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.530
the clarification is what do I mean by the love economy?
Uh,

340
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.980
the Dante's universe,

341
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:07.600
it's a universe of love and that's how creation takes place.

342
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:10.240
The creation of the university,
of the creation of human beings.

343
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:15.420
So we are the involvement that we as every soul has with God is one of love and

344
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:21.760
justice and the relationship between say Beatrice and Dante.

345
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:27.030
There is an element of risk in loving what is the risk in loving there can think

346
00:23:27.131 --> 00:23:27.964
of several.

347
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.200
I think we are all grown up for grown ups to understand that one loves and one

348
00:23:32.201 --> 00:23:36.430
may not be reciprocated in love.
That's a pretty bad risk.

349
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.690
Certainly it's a risk of God who creates a may not be loved,

350
00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:43.990
which is the story of where this obedience is and it certainly is the

351
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:49.050
existential experience of human beings to be involved with someone other we love

352
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:53.690
their own person with then we say wisely,
I was loving the wrong person.

353
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.250
I'm being ironic.

354
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.850
But with that idea of wisdom or discovering that indeed in every religion there

355
00:23:59.851 --> 00:24:02.210
is time,
feelings change.

356
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.580
We have so many ways of thinking about it and there is a,
uh,

357
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:10.510
dentist response is uh,
look,
uh,
he,

358
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.640
he,
he likes figures.
Who should,
we should talk about this.

359
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:18.940
Like Francis who goes to prey on the cliffs at night because he wants to

360
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:26.081
dramatize the idea that even a prayer put you at risk of being heard or not

361
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:29.414
being heard,

362
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:34.670
of being disappointed of discovering that the world does not go the way you want

363
00:24:34.671 --> 00:24:39.350
it to go.
And that which is true in prayer is truly love.
Okay.

364
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.700
That's what I was saying.
I wasn't saying anything from uh,
uh,
more than that.

365
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.760
In Canto six,
also the political canto,

366
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.660
there is an encounter between two poets.
One is Virgil with,
um,

367
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:55.280
eh sort of dialogue who is a man from port.

368
00:24:55.310 --> 00:25:00.310
They all share the same birth place mantra across the centuries they meet.

369
00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.600
And the very idea of mantra,
they ask,
uh,
uh,

370
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.430
virtual virtual sal saying mantra,
clearly playing with a famous,
uh,

371
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.990
uh,
epitaph.
I think [inaudible] the line interrupts.

372
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:19.991
There's this man mantra or made me know the famous epitaph written on a in

373
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.220
Naples where virtual is,

374
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.630
is buried a man to a made me.

375
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.930
Um,
and uh,
uh,
the,
the,

376
00:25:29.931 --> 00:25:33.530
the South Calibri took away,
took me away.

377
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:38.810
I sang the f the,
the arms,
the anemia,
the herds,

378
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:43.340
the Georgics and the story about the bucolic,
the fields,
it's just,

379
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:45.800
just in two lines,
the account of his whole life.

380
00:25:45.801 --> 00:25:50.120
So it's that saying Mantua I think alluding to this birthplace,
once again,

381
00:25:50.121 --> 00:25:54.860
the birth.
And so they're low in,
he embrace this,

382
00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:57.200
embrace,
this existential encounter,

383
00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.500
this other little moment which is in substantial because they can't really

384
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:05.501
embrace their spirits and other failure after the one that we saw with Cassela

385
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.280
in,
in,
in Canto,

386
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.750
in Canada to have a of Purgatorio,
uh,

387
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:16.580
that triggers Dante's political invective against Italy.

388
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.900
It's the moment of which I will read very briefly and I will not read the whole

389
00:26:20.901 --> 00:26:23.750
thing,
but it's an invective,
um,
uh,

390
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:28.760
this the kind of civic sense of responsibility.
Uh,
and this,
uh,

391
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.560
um,
all Manch one,
uh,
this is line 75 o'clock canto six,

392
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.010
and the gentle leader began man to our,

393
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.190
and the shade who had been all wrapped within himself.
Sprained,

394
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:44.720
told him from the place where he was saying,
Oh man,
I am sort of Dello,
uh,

395
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.680
of the city.
He's a province,
how port?
But he wrote in province and,
uh,

396
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:50.780
from,
from,
uh,

397
00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.960
from mantra and the [inaudible] and the one embrace the other.

398
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.080
Look at this phrase,
which is extraordinary.
It was an Italian.

399
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.670
Now I feel that I can read things to Margaret Attack Tech.
Read it.

400
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.540
Kalyan is freely as I care.
Illume loved Barbara Java.

401
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.290
Um,
I returned to this construction in a moment.

402
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.220
One embrace the other.
It's,
it's,

403
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.910
it's what I call a,
it's a phrase of reciprocity.

404
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:22.350
That's where one embrace the other,
the reciprocity of affections across time.

405
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.513
Okay.

406
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.880
Dante begins his incredible or victory operational.

407
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:33.340
He's attack against in sleeved Italy.
Um,
and,

408
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:37.470
and look how the Italy enslaved hostile of misery,

409
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.180
number of metaphor,
ship without pilot in great tempest,

410
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.010
no princess among the provinces.

411
00:27:44.011 --> 00:27:49.011
But Bravo so eager was that no posole only for the dear name of his city to give

412
00:27:50.191 --> 00:27:51.960
welcome to their,
to its citizens.

413
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.220
And now in the they live living are never free from war.

414
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.490
And of those one wall and Moat Shuttin one knows at the other and other,

415
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.270
uh,
another line that seems to have a sort of uh,
uh,

416
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:14.300
grim version of the reciprocity earlier one embrace the other.

417
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.940
Now one knows that the other,
but if you look at the Italian,

418
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.500
it's really slightly different.

419
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.680
English doesn't give that this translation at least,
uh,

420
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.820
one is just in ta line 82.
No,
not stand,

421
00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:31.850
nuisance aware live oil and Lula see roll there.

422
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.820
One is a reflexive form.
The other one does not.

423
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.560
And the moment of violence,

424
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.710
Dante uses the verb cro role in the reflective form in order to imply that the

425
00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:47.700
exchange is an exchange.
That it all is terms of oneself,

426
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.760
one knows at the other full oneself.

427
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.420
Therefore it reverses and denies very process.

428
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.480
There is reciprocity are the action of reciprocity indicated by the previous,

429
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.070
uh,
the previous,
uh,
a phrase.
I could also,
uh,

430
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.110
emphasize a couple of details here where Dante says,

431
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:15.360
uh,
welcome to the citizens.
And now in,
uh,

432
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.030
indeed I living at an ever free from war.

433
00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:22.200
And those whom one wall emote Shuttin.
It's very,

434
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.420
you do know that the word for community which,

435
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.030
which we always use right community,

436
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.180
it's a word that written biologically comes from

437
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:40.400
the Latin for war mania community meant and,

438
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.000
and stems from is a concept from the sharing of walls,

439
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.530
houses piling in and built one on top of the other.

440
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.360
That's the idea of a community.

441
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.110
The shared the shared walls of the city,

442
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.350
which we are now a seen as,
uh,

443
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.480
viewed as separating one from the other.

444
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:07.690
And then this will continue with the lack of laws and the families,

445
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:13.550
including the mantle use and copulates for you Shakespeare lovers or mentioned

446
00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:18.500
here.
And uh,
uh,
and then Dante ends up with a,

447
00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.510
um,
on online,

448
00:30:20.511 --> 00:30:25.270
the one 25 with a returning to Florence and the little,
uh,
uh,

449
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.190
clearly bitter satire.
My Florence,

450
00:30:28.191 --> 00:30:31.580
they'll miss well beer east with this digression,
uh,

451
00:30:31.581 --> 00:30:33.350
come back to this metaphor in the moment,

452
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.040
which does not touch the thanks to the people who are sorry,
resourceful.

453
00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.590
So Dante talks about it.
Everybody turns to him,

454
00:30:39.591 --> 00:30:42.830
federal sex with your vocation or Florence,

455
00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.400
he's calling this,
this poem,
this,

456
00:30:46.401 --> 00:30:48.890
this invective a digression,

457
00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.650
which literally means that it does not belong.

458
00:30:51.651 --> 00:30:56.651
The poem that Nana is stepping out of the economy of the poem and talking on his

459
00:30:57.831 --> 00:31:00.710
own voice.
It's a digression.
That's where we call it a day.

460
00:31:00.711 --> 00:31:03.220
Rashford right where you are.

461
00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.500
You use a particular language that doesn't really belong to the general protein

462
00:31:06.501 --> 00:31:07.334
theme.

463
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:12.730
But then the meaning of this digression is made really clear later when he says,

464
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:16.700
uh,
which does not touch the how ironic.

465
00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.540
Of course he saying literally this digression,

466
00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.080
you are so much better than all these other towns.
That's the irony.

467
00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.850
Florence is no better.
Therefore this digression,
it doesn't really concern you,

468
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.910
but it can also be understood in another way.

469
00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:35.300
And then when another more tragic and most sinister way,

470
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:40.370
this digression does not touch you,
my language will not affect you,

471
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.770
but the whole state with in all its ambiguity,

472
00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:48.771
it becomes one of the reflection on the impotence of the poetic language to

473
00:31:53.151 --> 00:31:57.680
affect the historical are the unfolding of,
uh,

474
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:02.510
of history.
The ordering of the city.
It is as if Dante,
we're a,
we're here.

475
00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:07.810
That the relationship between the voice of the poet and the political order is

476
00:32:08.571 --> 00:32:11.900
one of inevitable rupture.

477
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.290
So Nancy who test to improve and change,
that's clearly the,

478
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.850
the thrust of the passage.

479
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.860
And the thrust of the invective also also declared that powerlessness,

480
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.420
uh,
in his,
uh,
his doing so good.
We are doing very well with time.

481
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:31.570
So I have a chance to read a little seen Dante moves on talking about the first

482
00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:38.320
night of purgatorial will take place and uh,

483
00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:43.390
he takes in the so called Valley of the princes were and knew God and another

484
00:32:44.001 --> 00:32:47.370
God is going to be described,
which in many ways,
uh,

485
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.700
fulfills the God in a limbo,

486
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.580
in can tall four of in fan on,
you know,
don't,

487
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.580
don't think has this motives that keep reappearing.

488
00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:01.220
And here it's more than a natural beauty of the place.
It's,
it's,
it's uh,

489
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.550
they're precious stones implying the pool got Oreo.

490
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:09.110
Is that the world of transition for trends and souls?

491
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:14.000
That is something abiding about this place.
And then Dante moves on,

492
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:18.420
uh,
around to read a paragraph here,
uh,
with,
um,

493
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.190
uh,
the,
the,
the meeting with a princess I wanted to do about it,

494
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.770
but I want to read it.
First passage,
which is an evening song.

495
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.530
Uh,
Dante's Dante,

496
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:35.531
the pilgrim now is taken with the nostalgia for his whole home town.

497
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:40.640
It is a,
um,
the pilgrimage of desire,

498
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:43.550
which is the poem.
Write a poem of desire.

499
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.950
Desire for God is higher for Beatrice.

500
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:51.250
Now turns into the desire for the comfort and the shelter of the home he had

501
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:57.140
lost.
So re,
listen to this passage.
It's,
it's written in many ways in,
in,

502
00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.730
along the lines or province.

503
00:33:58.731 --> 00:34:03.731
Our poetry over nostalgia and listen to the acid and says is the first six,

504
00:34:05.571 --> 00:34:08.720
seven lines of Canto Eight,
uh,
uh,

505
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:12.230
listen to the essence is the casting structures of the sounds.
I,

506
00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.800
which I'm not going to point out to you.
You can do that on your own.
Uh,
era.

507
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.980
Jalil
[inaudible] [inaudible]

508
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:27.110
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

509
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:31.010
[inaudible] [inaudible].

510
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.430
So the squealer Dylan get back until June.

511
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.210
Luke Pangea case in water do coming.

512
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.650
Chaya render Wianno Ludia Emirati,

513
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.210
one of the La Sueur coal tar.

514
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.190
He their command and then they hear here,
I'm not going to be able to read it,

515
00:34:49.191 --> 00:34:51.990
but to tell you how the poem should be read.
Then they're going here,

516
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.000
him and medieval him.

517
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:57.470
They blue cheese anti-terror amendments on which if we were really at the time,

518
00:34:57.471 --> 00:35:01.190
I would come to to class with the whole Latin him because we,

519
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.320
Dante gives only the first three words,

520
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.020
but clearly we are supposed to hear the whole thing,
uh,

521
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:11.040
about the dangers of the night sense that Tinnitus,

522
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:16.050
soft fraud with phantasms and that that will intrude on the,

523
00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:21.650
the powers of judgment of the various holes.
Dante's own included,

524
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:26.250
uh,
with Ken Tunein.
Dante moves from,
as he does in every country.

525
00:35:26.251 --> 00:35:28.310
Nine Canto,
nine marks,

526
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:33.170
the rupture from a particular area of,
uh,
of the poem too.
Then other,

527
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:33.770
another,

528
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:38.190
remember Canto nine of inferno and the encounter with the failed and counter

529
00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:42.030
with a medusa.
That passage into the city of this.
Now with Ken [inaudible],

530
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.060
Dante moves into purgatory proper.

531
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:48.090
And so we'll go with the cattle pen 11 and 12.

532
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:50.520
We're not going to be able to do all three cantos to there.

533
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:55.521
So we'll return to some of the things that I will say now about Canto 10 and 11

534
00:35:55.981 --> 00:35:59.980
that I hope to cover.
Um,
um,
how is purgatorial that part?

535
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:03.270
What is this purification proper going to take place?

536
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:08.510
This is the ordering Dan two will go on the so called seven deadly sins.

537
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.990
I don't know that you know what they are.
Uh,
but the first one was just see them.

538
00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:16.170
The first one is,
and they go from spiritual sins.

539
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.000
Pride is the root of all sins,
uh,
to,

540
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.090
to lust at the end,
um,

541
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.580
in every representation of,
uh,
of,

542
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.030
of this sin.

543
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:35.270
Dante precedes it with their presentation of its opposite virtue so that we have

544
00:36:36.661 --> 00:36:39.470
humility in Canto 10.
And then in Canada,

545
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.000
11 punished pride first of all,

546
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:47.270
as if Dante has to learn that which is going to witness a little later.

547
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.770
In a sense,
it's the,
um,
the,
the uh,

548
00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.730
absolute reversal of the economy of,

549
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:56.040
of inferno and purgatory.

550
00:36:56.041 --> 00:37:00.840
You may remember that I said last time that the incredible,
uh,

551
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:06.080
quality of the structure of the poem is that Dante wants us to see experiences

552
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:09.130
of evil in,
in fair,

553
00:37:09.131 --> 00:37:12.690
no first so that when we get to purgatory and paradise,

554
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:17.900
we really have the change to appreciate what the good is and appreciate what the

555
00:37:18.391 --> 00:37:21.810
absence of the good may be,
but evil really,

556
00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.900
really generates.
And then genders here.

557
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:29.130
Now he changes all of this in a,
in,
in porter,
he starts with,

558
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.040
with the representation of the virtue of humility.
And then the same,

559
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.100
um,
the representational,

560
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.720
the virtue of humility takes place through the language of art.

561
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.590
Dante approaches that cliff and know the size of the cliff.

562
00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:47.580
He sees three sculptures and bolding,
uh,

563
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.940
examples of humility.
The word,
uh,
uh,

564
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:56.700
pride,
which in Italian is,
you know,
we have the English superb.
In Italian,

565
00:37:56.701 --> 00:38:00.660
we call it [inaudible] to the word superb.
You add IAA,

566
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.780
which is pride.
Uh,
uh,
they were the humility.
He's Italian.

567
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:07.800
The same thing as UU minister.
They will,

568
00:38:07.801 --> 00:38:12.120
the humility means comes from the ground.
The sense of the,
of,

569
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:17.000
of being down,
of being the idea that one is really a,

570
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.310
with let's say,
the feet on the ground,
the very opposite of superbeets,

571
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.420
which implies some kind of a immoderate flight away,

572
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:28.200
a sense of the,
the view of the over man,
right?

573
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.830
The idea of being a superman,

574
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.740
some here that someone who wants to transcend the,

575
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.360
uh,
the limitations of this world and being human.

576
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.920
Um,
the,
the word folk,
humility and the word for human heaven.

577
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:48.940
This same victimology in case you,
you wonder where it comes.

578
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:53.950
The all mall,
h,
o,
m,
O which means man,
they Latin comes from Hoummos.

579
00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.360
We are cold man,
human beings because we come from,

580
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.160
from the earth and we are close to the earth and we'll return to the earth.
Uh,

581
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:06.460
we come from the earth and are returning to the earth.
Uh,

582
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.690
the idea of humility is the same,
the same notions.

583
00:39:09.691 --> 00:39:14.691
So there is a kind of implicit connection etymologically between the two.

584
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.950
The two words that two terms,
um,
uh,
one,
one more,
uh,

585
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.860
remark to make this whole idea of having a couple of remarks before I go in with

586
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:28.060
the text.
Um,
but with serve you for the rest of proven story,

587
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.880
the idea of um,
um,
having the,
the humor,

588
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.410
the virtues and the end devices.

589
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.270
Our first one and the other seem to cast purgatory,

590
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.850
but it's not really that way,
uh,

591
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:47.910
as a variant of a medieval poetic form called Comark Markia,

592
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.890
which means the battle of the battle of thoughts.
Uh,

593
00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:56.410
CECO market,
by the way,
this is a Latin poem,

594
00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:01.620
one of the early Latin poem by this Latin Spanish poet called Prudential's.

595
00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.650
Uh,
the,
so it's a,
it's a kind of secret market,

596
00:40:05.651 --> 00:40:08.560
the battle of thoughts of contradictory thoughts.

597
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:10.030
The second thing that I have to say,

598
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:13.270
it's more important for the poetics of Dante.

599
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.630
Keep in mind that the whole poetic mode of Purgatorio,

600
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:22.920
unlike the poetic mode of inferno is played out in predatorial through the

601
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:29.680
imagination,
art,
images,
memories,

602
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.250
phantasms.
And that was,

603
00:40:32.251 --> 00:40:36.970
we're really in a world which is in between their bodies and souls,

604
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:41.950
the world.
The middle ground of the imagination.
And now we have the world of art,

605
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:46.600
a work of art that Dante says,
and I read from Kantar 10 at the very beginning.

606
00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:50.720
Um,
I just,
I just,
I want to give you,
this is,
it's a,

607
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.490
it's an extraordinary,
uh,
I don't,
I'm,

608
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.680
I don't want to go into excessive detail,

609
00:40:56.681 --> 00:41:01.681
but I have to do it this time when we were within the threshold Canto 10,

610
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.670
the very beginning of the gate,

611
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.700
which the soul's perverse love this user's purgatory is all,

612
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:11.623
eh,

613
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:16.150
a sequence of variations on love.

614
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.120
That's the moral law of purgatory.

615
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:23.230
All sins in purgatory or sense of either gurus use the,

616
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.090
we give love to the wrong object or we love too much in terms of what,

617
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.810
how we are being loved back or we love too little.

618
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:36.800
These are the three general subdivisions of purgatory.
Okay,

619
00:41:36.801 --> 00:41:38.150
so that's perverse.
Love this.

620
00:41:38.151 --> 00:41:42.980
Users making the crooked way seemed straight by the resounding,

621
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.810
I heard it closed again,
and if I had turned my eyes to it,

622
00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:51.770
what excuse would have served for the fault reflection on what happened before

623
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.680
we were climbing through a cleft in the rock,

624
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:59.360
which kept bending one way in the other,
of course,
around the mountain.

625
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.250
Okay.
That's really what the languages like a wave that comes and goes.

626
00:42:04.251 --> 00:42:06.730
When my leader began here,

627
00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:12.070
there is need to use some skill in keeping close to this side or that will it

628
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.490
turn turns away.
The cliff is there's an abyss and their needs it,

629
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:20.240
so it's an invitation to prudence along the way,

630
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.340
and this made us step so scanned that they're winning.

631
00:42:23.341 --> 00:42:27.560
Moon had regain its bed to sing to rest before we were fourth from the needle's

632
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:28.280
eye,

633
00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:33.280
but we were free and out in the open above where the mountain draws back.

634
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:37.740
I really am both uncertain of our way.
We know now this.

635
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.760
This has become a sort of formulaic expression of the uncertainties of this

636
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:46.850
exile.
As he moves up the mountain,

637
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:51.851
we stopped on a level place more solitary than a desert track from its edge

638
00:42:52.011 --> 00:42:54.560
bordering on the void to the foot of them off the bank,

639
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:59.770
which rises a sheer would measure er three times a man's body and as far as my

640
00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:03.920
eye could make its flight.
Now on the left hand,

641
00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.280
now underwrite that terrace that seemed to me,
they say,

642
00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.260
what is all this about?

643
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:15.950
What I want to point out is that Dante is measuring the whole landscape in terms

644
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.990
of the measure of a human being.

645
00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.590
He's using the human beings,

646
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:30.840
a human being as the measure and all that.
It's main the measure.

647
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.570
You have heard that expression,
right?

648
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:39.180
Are we the measure with a measure of what creation or with a measure what we

649
00:43:39.871 --> 00:43:43.360
should do?
This is exactly the point of the Kantar.

650
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:48.930
It was pride means and in inordinate love and believe in our own excellence.

651
00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:57.300
Pride means that we do not think that we are.

652
00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.600
We can be measured by others that we want to become the measure for others or

653
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:07.500
that we really do not belong where others may think we belong.

654
00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:12.390
That's what pride is seen.
Very common.
Who Do you think?
Who Do you think you are?

655
00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:17.610
Who Don't?
You know who I am.
This is the language we use and it's pride.

656
00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:22.290
I always like to say that are never really proud when we are dealing with our

657
00:44:22.291 --> 00:44:26.880
janitor.
Yeah.
Not Proud of that becomes so human.
So,
so good.

658
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.850
We are all as proud with those when danger,

659
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:35.190
our sense of our own measure,
who seemed to take the wrong measure of us.

660
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.410
So Dante is starting with the idea of measurement and that comes back.

661
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.210
This is the crucial metaphor.
And that come back to that.

662
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:45.600
How do we measure what is human?
And there is no human.

663
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.180
One thing is clear that pride,

664
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:53.290
suburbia means an inordinate love of one's own excellence.

665
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.570
Uh,
we are really fast superiors,
uh,

666
00:44:57.571 --> 00:45:01.710
we think than everybody anybody else could have taught us.
And then he goes on,

667
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:06.930
uh,
looking at,
um,
images made on the white marble,

668
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.680
such,
such that not only public liters,

669
00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:14.690
but nature would be put to shame their extraordinary metaphor or how are they

670
00:45:14.801 --> 00:45:19.050
talking about,
uh,
about measure,
about order.
Uh,
these are,

671
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.770
these are works of art produced by the hand of God directory.

672
00:45:24.901 --> 00:45:28.380
God is an artist and God has made these images,

673
00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:33.440
but it's such that nature,
which as you know,
is the daughter of God and uh,

674
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.620
and,
and,
and,
and,
and the mother of the arts.
Uh,

675
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.240
and also notice the famous political leaders,

676
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:44.040
Greek scholar pull el Greek sculptor qualities would be put to shame or ready.

677
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:49.041
There is the sense of rivalry within the pattern of generation of arts.

678
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:52.470
Okay.
Uh,
that's the first thing.

679
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.800
And then the first image that we see is image of the Angel Gabriel,

680
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:02.280
the Messenger who came to earth.
That's humility.

681
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:05.040
That's immediately it came toward the descent,

682
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.380
the descent of the high becoming low.
While the human beings who are low,

683
00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.630
one to think of themselves as very high.

684
00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.610
The Angel who came to Earth with the decree of the many years whipped for peace

685
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.870
that are open heaven from its wrong interdict appeared before us.

686
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:23.190
So truly Greven,

687
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:28.490
they're in a gracious attitude that it did not seem a silent image.

688
00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:33.270
That's God's art.
But very clear,
there's no difficulty in understanding this art.

689
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:38.400
One would have sworn he said the first words of the Angel Gabriel during the

690
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:39.234
Annunciation.

691
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:43.740
They don't see Asian is the story of the humility whereby of politically God

692
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:48.360
becomes man.
So that's the descent and other form of,
of,

693
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:53.160
of only the,
the humility of Mary in accepting the mandate,

694
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:56.040
but also the,
the,
the idea of the dissent.
By the way,

695
00:46:56.041 --> 00:47:00.350
let me just point out of this.
Avi is where we call a boost profit on,

696
00:47:00.351 --> 00:47:04.200
I have spelled the word out for you.
For a VA,

697
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.250
it's very conventional.
In medieval medieval literature.
The idea that,
uh,

698
00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.870
Mary becomes that the one who reverses the role of eve.

699
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:17.250
Okay.
With eve,
there's the,
the loss of the garden and the fall with air,

700
00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:21.390
with Rv,
there is now the turning of the key as it were.

701
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:26.660
And the redemption for she was imaged there who turn the key to open the supreme

702
00:47:27.061 --> 00:47:30.550
love.
And in her bearing she had this wonderful imprinted,

703
00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:33.210
this word imprinted h and Sheila.
They,

704
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.560
she acknowledges her.

705
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:38.680
Mary acknowledges ancillary role.

706
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:43.750
She is a servant and she acknowledges herself as a servant.

707
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.500
And now I alongside with this what we could call an ethical education,

708
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.190
Dante's rice to learn what humility is.
There's an ethical education.

709
00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.520
Learn about what this humility is about.

710
00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:02.680
There is also an aesthetic education going on.
Simple tennis after all,

711
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:04.330
Dante's really looking at art.

712
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.340
So the question is what is the relationship between the virtual and art?

713
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.510
How can the tool be together?

714
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:14.230
And to give you an idea of how complicated the problem is is then the next

715
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:17.650
candle Dante goes on meeting all the painters.

716
00:48:17.651 --> 00:48:22.651
You read Kant 11 Jocko and Shima Bohr who are emblems of people who invest their

717
00:48:24.521 --> 00:48:29.050
productions with an inordinate val sense of their,
of its value.

718
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.260
Then Dante puts himself,
puts his friends.

719
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.920
We though Cavalcanti you remember the two wheels and we though we need sadly

720
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:41.800
says one weedo removed the other we'd have from its nest and now the third

721
00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:46.300
person has come meaning himself who probably were route both of them.

722
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:51.330
What a proud statement it is as if the artists are always prone to this salt of

723
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:57.150
inordinately idea of who they are and what their value maybe.

724
00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.870
So art and humility and pride that this is the issue,

725
00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.660
the ethical education and the aesthetic education.

726
00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.400
What is the aesthetic education?

727
00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:09.940
Virgil is telling Dante how to look.

728
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:13.660
That's really the most complicated thing for those of you who are doing art

729
00:49:13.661 --> 00:49:15.310
history.
That's really what it's about.

730
00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.640
How do we look through the eyes really revealed to us,

731
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:23.210
do not keep their mind all in one part.
That's,
that's the looking,

732
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:25.000
the belief that we,

733
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:30.120
or the temptation to lose sight of the totality of things and not,

734
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:34.520
uh,
and,
and just taking one part for the whole,
uh,

735
00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:38.980
do not keep their mind on in one part said the card master who had me on that

736
00:49:38.981 --> 00:49:42.700
side of him where the heart lives on the left so that I turned my face.

737
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.030
And so beyond Mary on the same side as he,

738
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:49.420
that prompted me another story set on the rock.

739
00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:54.690
So Dante has to learn how to look and where he's looking at her stories story,

740
00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:01.920
the word this Greek for those of you who know some Greek it comes from I saw and

741
00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:04.030
I never rate.

742
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:09.420
And it's the same etymology firms for story and history.

743
00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:13.420
This is a little better of an allegory of history where it's as if Dante's

744
00:50:13.421 --> 00:50:16.450
really begins with the New Testament,
the story of Mary.

745
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.970
Now we're going to see a picture from the Old Testament,

746
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.410
David dancing in front of the Ark and then an episode of Trajan,

747
00:50:23.411 --> 00:50:26.950
the emperor who is an example of humility is or see him in a,

748
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:32.540
and the point is that the whole of history is a,
an allegory of humility.

749
00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:37.340
And that's God's heart.
That's what Dante has God's represent for us.

750
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:39.890
So,
um,
Mary,
et Cetera,

751
00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:45.080
they're carved in the same marble where the car to Knox and drawing the sacred

752
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:49.070
ark on account of which meant fear an office not committed to them in front

753
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.570
people appeared.

754
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.700
And the whole company divided into seven choir's made two of my sensors.
Hey,

755
00:50:54.701 --> 00:50:56.780
the one,
no the other.
Yes,

756
00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:01.070
they saying in the same way at the smoke of the incense I was in image,

757
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.750
their eyes and nose were in contradiction with yes and no there.

758
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:08.300
The humbles hammers,
David,

759
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:13.630
when before the blessed vessel Gert up and dancing at the time he was both more

760
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:20.960
and less than king,
opposite figured on the,

761
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:23.210
at the window of a great palace.

762
00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:28.890
Mccall looked on like a woman vexed and scornful.

763
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:31.790
This is really,
uh,

764
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.820
the story that is told in Samuel and the Bible in Dante's really reinterpreting

765
00:51:37.161 --> 00:51:37.994
it for us.

766
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000
So I beg you to repair a little attention to some of these episodes.

767
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:47.990
First of all,
David is humbling himself.
His dancing,

768
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:51.540
he lifts up his um,
his fault,

769
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:56.510
his dress and just dancing out of joy.

770
00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:02.200
It's an episode that is used as one of the many cases and so called Ludic

771
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:08.600
theology,
playful,
theologists intrusion that in,
in,
uh,

772
00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:13.460
in the plan of salvation,
there is always the presence of his comedy,

773
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.630
this comic idea and David embodies that.

774
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:19.633
Okay.

775
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:24.350
And then there's this little phrase which you must have noticed that peer so

776
00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:26.480
often in this candle,

777
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.430
moreover than this cancer than ever before in the whole point,
more,
less,

778
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:33.520
more and less.

779
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:38.670
It is as if it's impossible to use or find in a canter where measure is the

780
00:52:39.441 --> 00:52:43.940
issue,
the precision about where we are,

781
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:49.190
who we are and what we are doing.
But one thing is clear that opposite to David,

782
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:54.250
that is his wife call sitting at the window different perspective and what she

783
00:52:54.951 --> 00:52:58.850
sees,
this is art.
This is a question of perspective.
What she says.

784
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:04.030
She is so angry at David because he is by his action of dancing in front of the

785
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.820
Ark is humiliating himself.

786
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:11.390
He's losing his state as king.

787
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.980
He's losing his stature as Kang.
The fact is that for Dante,

788
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:19.460
McCall is completely missing the point.

789
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:24.340
It is a stance of someone who thinks that she's superior stance or some of who's

790
00:53:24.341 --> 00:53:27.210
sitting at the great I the window had great palace,

791
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:30.590
will not have anything to do with what's below her.

792
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:35.990
We are entering the world or the domain or what pride may be.

793
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:39.990
What's wrong with pride then why pride may really be a sin.

794
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:45.030
Pride may not be a sin because of we want to reach higher than we are.

795
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:47.910
That's probably okay.

796
00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:53.570
What makes pride the sin is that we tend to have contempt for what we think is

797
00:53:55.591 --> 00:53:59.760
below us.
That's really the displacement.
It blinds us,

798
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:03.360
so I'm,
I'm introducing here since this is a world of art,

799
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:08.250
the notion of a perspective we've been talking about perspective.

800
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:15.500
Pride is tied to perspective because he said by being proud,

801
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.320
I think that I have within myself,

802
00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:24.650
I certainly have a view of myself that may be at odds with the reality of me.

803
00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:28.800
Right?
Certainly this is the case of not David,

804
00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:30.540
but it's the case of McCall.

805
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:35.310
The third episode is I think even more,

806
00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:39.180
more interesting and then we'll see what's going to happen.
Um,
the,
the,

807
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.920
I moved my feet from where I was to examine close to the end.

808
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:48.660
And other part of this,
how do you examine what is an aesthetic education?

809
00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.700
Uh,
how do you look for images?

810
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:55.650
I hand another story which I saw gleaming with y white beyond me.

811
00:54:55.651 --> 00:54:59.790
Call the pic the there.
Now the third episode is from secular history,

812
00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:04.260
Roman history.
So you have Old Testament,
New Testament,
Old Testament,
the Roman,

813
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:05.700
yeah,
secular history.

814
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:10.500
There was the glorious deed of the Roman Prince who's worth moved Gregory to his

815
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:11.160
great victory.

816
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:16.160
I mean the emperor Trajan and the poor widow was his bridle in a posture of

817
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:18.690
grief and tears,
the place about him,

818
00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:23.700
Sim trampled and thronged with nights and the eagles and the gold above them

819
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:28.500
move visibly in the wind.
The poor woman among all the,
these seem to say,

820
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:33.630
Lord avenge me for my son that is dead for whom I'm stricken.

821
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:38.280
And he to answer her,
wait til now our return,
he's going on to Romania,

822
00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:43.110
the Asia.
If you see the column of Trajan in Rome,
it's still the,
the,

823
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:47.830
the monument document of that expedition.
Uh,
wait,
not return.

824
00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:51.930
And she,
my Lord,
like one whose grief is urgent,
if they're returned not and he,

825
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.380
he that is in my place will do it for the,

826
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:58.060
and she watched shall another's goodness avail the,

827
00:55:58.061 --> 00:56:01.420
if thou are forgetful of their known now take comfort for us.

828
00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:06.030
Fulfill my duty before I go.
Justice requires and compassion with.

829
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:11.690
It's the story of Trajan who gets off his high horse levels with the little

830
00:56:12.481 --> 00:56:16.800
widow,
they diminutives or Dante languages of humility,

831
00:56:16.801 --> 00:56:21.210
the little widow and,
and administers and gives her,

832
00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:25.090
it gives her justice because for Dante,

833
00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:29.860
the perfect emperor and Trajan certainly is the perfect emperor.
Must be,

834
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:35.210
must have the attributes of mercy and justice.
And he gives yeah,

835
00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:39.750
evidence of that if for who site,
et Cetera.
Now,
um,

836
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:45.930
ah,
that's the drama,
not developed.

837
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:47.550
Dante Cenovus,

838
00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:52.640
he has understood this images and the meaning of his images and the,
uh,

839
00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:58.200
uh,
well I'm just going to tell you about this little drama and we stop here,

840
00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:03.270
uh,
are what I was taking delight in no problem.

841
00:57:03.271 --> 00:57:07.080
And picking the light after all,
this is God's law,
God's art.
Uh,

842
00:57:07.081 --> 00:57:10.290
so having delight in itself,
uh,
is,

843
00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:15.150
is part of the appreciation of this art at the images of soap.
Great.

844
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:20.010
Uh,
humility's I think that the oxymoron is deliberate.

845
00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:24.300
The greed,
humility is Dhea to side tool for the craftsmen sake.

846
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:29.040
I love them because they were made by God virtual prompt him.

847
00:57:29.041 --> 00:57:33.120
See on this side,
many people that port murmured.

848
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:37.290
But calming with slow steps,
they will direct us to the other stairs.

849
00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:41.400
And now here is dentist drama.
My eyes,

850
00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:45.570
which were looking intently.
We're not slow in turning to him,

851
00:57:45.571 --> 00:57:50.310
being eager for new sites.
He yields to the temptations of the eye.

852
00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:54.150
Have you ever heard about the three temptations?
The pride of life,

853
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.620
the,
the,
um,

854
00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:02.840
the pride of the eyes or the curiosity of the,
and the,
and,
and,
uh,
and,
and,

855
00:58:02.841 --> 00:58:05.650
and the,
and the pride of the over the heart.
But I would,

856
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:09.730
and the three old temptations are present here,
but I would not have the reader,

857
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:11.770
Dante's touring to us.

858
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:16.800
And then apostrophe s he has done before fall away from good resolve for hearing

859
00:58:17.501 --> 00:58:22.501
how God wheels that the debt they paid do not do well on the form is telling us

860
00:58:23.381 --> 00:58:26.890
not to care about the images as such of the torment.

861
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.010
Think of what follows thinker worst.

862
00:58:30.011 --> 00:58:33.910
It can not go beyond the great judgment he saw to them is make a preemptive

863
00:58:33.911 --> 00:58:37.810
strike.
Don't worry about the peculiar form of the art.

864
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:42.820
Look at the meaning of the art and he can't,
but that's what he's wants us to do.

865
00:58:42.821 --> 00:58:46.900
He says,
but look what he says to Virgil Mass that I begin,

866
00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:52.180
that which I see coming to us does not seem to me persons.

867
00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:55.690
And I know not what they are.

868
00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:58.370
Fuse is my sight.

869
00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:04.210
What an incredible contrast between what Dante had seen with God's images or

870
00:59:06.881 --> 00:59:07.880
clear to him.

871
00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.640
But now that he's seeing some human beings who are doubled under massive

872
00:59:14.001 --> 00:59:14.840
boulders,

873
00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:19.460
if that's the punishment inflicted on the proud to put them and press them

874
00:59:19.461 --> 00:59:23.120
against the earth,
he does recognize them.

875
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:29.030
If it's as if his aesthetic education has been for nothing,

876
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:32.090
it is ethical.
Education has been for nothing.

877
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:37.040
He had no difficulty in decipher in God's heart,

878
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:39.800
which is so clear and,
and luminous.

879
00:59:39.801 --> 00:59:44.760
But now he does not want to identify with what he sees.
He reads,
haven't bulls.

880
00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:48.020
Mikel from high up,

881
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:51.320
does not want to have anything to do with David.

882
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:56.900
This is the exactly the same problem that Dante is facing.

883
00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.660
He has a,
he had no problem with Gabriel.

884
00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:03.740
The descent of Gabriel has no problem with,
uh,
with Trajan,

885
01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.920
but he himself is and willing to identify with those that he believes are uh,

886
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:14.360
uh,
beneath him.
And then he goes on,
um,
of virtual experience,

887
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:16.190
the grievous nature of the tournament,

888
01:00:16.191 --> 01:00:20.570
double stem to the ground so that my eyes at first were in debate about them,

889
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.180
but he says they are really human beings like you.

890
01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.300
And then Dante goes into a further,
uh,

891
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:31.780
apostrophe to all Christians calling a himself super,

892
01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.370
super superb Nutanix Christianity.

893
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.010
The Italian line is actually very interesting for a reasonable,

894
01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:40.010
I'll tell you in a moment,
look at line one 21,
oh,

895
01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.440
super big Kristianne misery.
Lastly,

896
01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.710
there is an incredible contrast between the word superior,
meaning superior,

897
01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:52.370
right?
A claim or superiority and the word lassie,

898
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.480
which means lapsed having foreign.
So within the same line,

899
01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:01.490
you capture the,
to this dynamic or how we want to be up and how we go into,

900
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.720
the more,
the higher up you want to go there,
the quicker we seem to be falling.

901
01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:06.200
Uh,

902
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:11.200
or various V we re wretches mistranslation who are sick in the mines vision and

903
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:15.890
put your trust in backwards steps.
Steps.
Do you not perceive that we are,

904
01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:18.200
warms born to form the angelic butterfly?

905
01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.790
And I want to stress this shift in pronouns.

906
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:28.270
Do you not perceive Dante is literally taking the higher ground?

907
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:33.620
We do not know.
He knows,
right?
Do Ury,
he's,
he's preaching to us.

908
01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.190
Do you not perceive,
but then he,

909
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:41.180
with the subsequent Pronoun that we are warms,

910
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.480
he,
uh,
literally,
uh,

911
01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:49.400
erases the distance between himself and the readers to himself and the other

912
01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:53.630
Christians.
He places himself on the same ground where we are.

913
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.960
That's the quality of the double voice of Dante systematically punctuated this

914
01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:04.370
text as claim over transcendence,
superior perspective.
Because after all,

915
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:08.890
he really has seen the whole,
uh,
the unfolding of,

916
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:11.450
of God's cosmos.
He did.
He has witnessed it,

917
01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.600
but at the same time he descends and is part of a common plate.

918
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:20.040
That's really what the lie is.
Do you not perceive that we are,

919
01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:23.490
warms born to form the angelic butterfly?
The,

920
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:28.100
it's an illusion that the word for butterfly,
northern Italian.
But in,
um,

921
01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:33.840
in the Roman Sarcophagi,
uh,
in antiquity,

922
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.940
whether they are in,
uh,
Exxon profiles,
if you happen to go there,

923
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:42.180
you go to [inaudible] where there was a room and uh,
um,
uh,

924
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:43.620
Roman cemetery,
uh,

925
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:48.650
you would always see a butterfly imprinted on the sarcophagus because the Greek

926
01:02:50.401 --> 01:02:53.490
word for butterfly is Seca.

927
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:57.390
It's the same word for the soul at the butterfly.

928
01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:01.530
And by putting the implement of the butterfly,
the indicated at death,

929
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:06.950
the soul finally would be capable of flying off toward delight and told the

930
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:10.520
creator.
So Dante is clearly using and,

931
01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:15.450
and remembering this kind of a motif that he has seen that source to judgments

932
01:03:15.451 --> 01:03:19.440
that defense.
Why does your mind the fraud so high since we are,
as it were,

933
01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:22.260
imperfect insects at the warm that is undeveloped.

934
01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:24.060
The language of a metamorphosis.

935
01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.200
We are in the process of making ourselves both alive and in the penitential

936
01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:33.020
world or purgatory.
And then how he ends up with an Acorn,

937
01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:38.030
no graphic motif that recapitulates the whole iconographic element that make up

938
01:03:38.911 --> 01:03:43.650
the poem are there.
The can talk 10 as for core book to support ceiling,

939
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:48.240
a roof and figure sometimes since joining the knees do the breast which begets

940
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:52.320
from it's hard reality,
real distress in him that says it in such a posture.

941
01:03:52.321 --> 01:03:54.120
I saw these when I look carefully.

942
01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:59.121
They were indeed Ben town more and less and as they had more and less on their

943
01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:05.310
back and he that had most patients in his look seem to buy his weeping to say,

944
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:09.270
I can no more.
What is this about?
What is this story about?
Well,

945
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:12.510
the stories first of all about this,
this passage,

946
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:17.700
it's about the fact that Dan has just warned us not to pay attention to the form

947
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:21.480
and to look at the meaning of a particular message.

948
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.920
Now he returns to us and focuses on the form was what he's describing.

949
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
This oh called cariatides human forms that if you go maybe in New York you may

950
01:04:31.111 --> 01:04:34.710
see them,
but it's certainly in European cities.
This human forms,

951
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:39.711
I seem to be buttressing edifices and buildings and they are decorative,

952
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.950
but auntie saying the form matters.

953
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:48.990
We can not really go to the ultimate meaning by bypassing the form.

954
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:53.160
So he's literally a,
by picking up the,
the uh,

955
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:58.190
the sculpture or Motif of the Kantor returning to this idea we shall see cause

956
01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:03.200
I,
I have to leave you hanging on this problem or prospective assembly,

957
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:07.380
the 11 and 12 and continue.
Um,
um,

958
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:09.930
and therefore the meaning of art,

959
01:05:09.931 --> 01:05:14.880
how art can change a moral perception of the world.

960
01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:18.730
That's the idea in which you are all wondering,

961
01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.120
have been wondering where your questions are.

962
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:26.080
What is Dante's understanding of art?
It's so dangerous and it can be of course,

963
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:31.240
but there is a role that art can play in altering our perception.

964
01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:36.330
A moral perception in an effect form becomes a way to go to understand,

965
01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.820
uh,
the moral world and the moral terms in which you are.
We shall see this,
uh,

966
01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:45.490
next time.
Let's see if there are questions now.

967
01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.673
<v 1>MMM.</v>

968
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:11.370
<v 0>The,
the real la,
I think we are approaching the,</v>

969
01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:15.260
the heart of the matter in purgatory.

970
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.600
The relationship between ethics and aesthetics and,

971
01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.610
and what I really pointed out so far,

972
01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:28.030
then it's this idea that Dante is trying to find out what is the measure for

973
01:06:28.431 --> 01:06:31.340
human beings because we cannot say,
well it's pride.

974
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:37.250
What criteria if I want to reach,
you know,

975
01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:42.080
reach for what it's so far away from me.
Why should that be viewed?

976
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:46.070
Is,
is a sin of pride.
Um,

977
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.960
so what are the criteria?

978
01:06:48.961 --> 01:06:53.250
What is the context in which we can really talk of pride and why is humility and

979
01:06:53.251 --> 01:06:56.990
a better,
we haven't touched any of this yet.
Um,

980
01:06:57.410 --> 01:07:02.200
one thing that is clear is that Dante is for now,
uh,

981
01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:06.080
on the one hand giving examples of art and humility,

982
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.530
making mistakes.
The confusion of his perception.

983
01:07:09.531 --> 01:07:12.990
He says they cannot quite figure out what are the shapes or is,

984
01:07:12.991 --> 01:07:16.490
is there something disfigured he cannot quite identify with,

985
01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:21.440
they cannot recognize them.
And then claims that we really should be,

986
01:07:21.441 --> 01:07:24.050
should looking at the meaning and the ultimate meaning of things.

987
01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:29.000
But then he returns and valorizes the idea of form.

988
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:32.610
We cannot bypass form in,

989
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:37.460
in art or an experience we can not buy.
We can not skip the idea of time.

990
01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:42.620
That's really what,
what existentially it amounts to.
That's all I need have said.

991
01:07:42.621 --> 01:07:47.621
And then maybe explain to you a few etymological or connections,

992
01:07:47.721 --> 01:07:52.530
humility and the human,
uh,
the meaning of history.
Uh,
and,

993
01:07:52.531 --> 01:07:56.660
and introduced this principle principle of perspective that I have been talking

994
01:07:56.661 --> 01:08:01.190
about before,
but this is really connected with the representational art,

995
01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:06.620
uh,
perspective.
What is the,
what kind of perspective that's arts and give us.

996
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.860
We all know that in art we use perspectives,

997
01:08:09.861 --> 01:08:13.970
especially with the modern language of art,
the modern language of painting.

998
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.070
Ever since the 15th Century explicitly discusses the question,
we'll perspective.

999
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:24.460
I see the world are called into the position that I occupy in it and the

1000
01:08:24.861 --> 01:08:29.861
position that occupy in it reveals things to me which are unique and it reduced

1001
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:35.360
at the same time implies,
it also implies,
but this is not the case.

1002
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:38.000
The possibility of manipulating space.

1003
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:43.240
The 15th century Renaissance Discovers that space is not unalterable and fixed,

1004
01:08:44.330 --> 01:08:48.620
but it can be manipulated.
Right with dealing with up to that point,

1005
01:08:48.621 --> 01:08:51.800
maybe we're dealing with time and the manipulation of time.

1006
01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:55.190
You don't have to watch a football game to know what I mean about the

1007
01:08:55.191 --> 01:08:58.910
manipulation of time,
but then there is such a thing as manipulation of space.

1008
01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:02.630
I can create the space I can make of this small space.

1009
01:09:02.631 --> 01:09:07.130
Something appear large space is not a fixed entity.

1010
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:08.660
That's what what,

1011
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:13.750
what perspective comes to me and in the 15th century for Dante perspective is

1012
01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:17.060
connected to an inner world.

1013
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:19.670
What is my perspective of myself?

1014
01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.770
What is my sense of the measure of things?
How do I view the world?

1015
01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:29.450
Mccall gives one answer as you can be angry about,

1016
01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:34.310
but David does misunderstanding the whole point of David.
What does he,

1017
01:09:34.311 --> 01:09:38.690
she misunderstand about David that in humiliating himself he had really found

1018
01:09:38.691 --> 01:09:42.080
himself higher by the idea of humiliation of self,

1019
01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:46.880
which exactly that of Mary and which is exactly that of the story of Trajan.

1020
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:52.150
So how do you show me call does not understand the reversibility of positions.

1021
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.970
That's really the argument so far.

1022
01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:59.960
And I think that Dante's making a big deal with pride because pride,

1023
01:09:59.961 --> 01:10:04.160
the sin is the root,
the spiritual root of all of all evils.

1024
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:07.830
Let me see if there was some,
some,
some,
some questions that I can,
um,

1025
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.800
I have a few minutes please.

1026
01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:15.210
<v 2>Why does Dante have trouble sympathizing with the centers in purgatory or the</v>

1027
01:10:16.991 --> 01:10:19.780
people on the ground when he doesn't have trouble doing the same thing?

1028
01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:21.720
<v 0>And in fairness,
what,</v>

1029
01:10:21.721 --> 01:10:25.340
why does Dante is trouble sympathizing with the centers employee,

1030
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.580
especially here because in,
in,

1031
01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:32.190
and I mean he even kicked some of the heads [inaudible] condom in his sympathy.

1032
01:10:32.191 --> 01:10:36.230
But uh,
uh,
what is necessary?
He just,
he has had its head.

1033
01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:39.140
Then the Canto 32,
uh,

1034
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:43.670
or the guy was frozen on the,
and stuck and not in,
in ice.

1035
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.520
Uh,
it wasn't pretty,
it wasn't pretty.
But here it's true.

1036
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.520
Especially now he has,
he's,
he,

1037
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:55.350
he declares this his confusion.
It may be because,

1038
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.470
uh,
you know,
I couldn't,
I did not know what these forms are.

1039
01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:04.070
And I think they have to do with the whole question of what did he learn first

1040
01:11:04.381 --> 01:11:07.470
of all,
from,
from,

1041
01:11:07.530 --> 01:11:11.940
from the images that he saw because he know a virtual had just taught him how to

1042
01:11:11.941 --> 01:11:14.010
look.
Right?
You look here,

1043
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.450
you move around a don't stay in one place.
You can look underneath.

1044
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:23.490
So that's one problem.
What is it?
What is a moral and an aesthetic education.

1045
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:29.490
And then he's just also,
I think indicating the whole idea.

1046
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:34.910
What is it ever possible to look at the world more of this next time is this

1047
01:11:36.511 --> 01:11:39.120
engaged spectators.

1048
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.930
Think of ourselves in the theater,

1049
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:47.580
which is an image that I probably will bring in and discuss.
You know,

1050
01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:52.030
you go to the theater and you really,
uh,

1051
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.640
sometimes you,
you know,

1052
01:11:53.641 --> 01:11:58.641
we all feel that we should jump on the stage and rescue the damsel in distress

1053
01:11:59.131 --> 01:12:02.430
or whatever.
And yet,
you know,
you may see someone who do,
who can do that,

1054
01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:07.170
but many of us want,
we want to be unaffected by it.

1055
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:11.130
That's what Dante's doing.
He would like to be,

1056
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:16.370
to feel how he is no longer like any of these sinners.

1057
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:19.360
That's the mistake is making.
It's,

1058
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:24.440
it's really that he said it's an indifference calming to him from something

1059
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:28.650
Akin.
They're not exactly to me,
calls,

1060
01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:32.400
sure sense of herself.
I have nothing to do with the mob here.

1061
01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:34.890
You know what is west of what?
This,
this is the king.

1062
01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:39.930
I don't want to even be his wife.
That's what Dante's doing in,

1063
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:41.670
in,
uh,
in that scene.

1064
01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:47.260
I do not want to be with this kind of disfigured lowly forms of life.

1065
01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:53.960
I am better.
I have seen God's heart and I've learned about God's out.

1066
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:59.210
Do you see the morals and spiritual confusion that this kind of drama is going

1067
01:13:01.291 --> 01:13:03.720
to generate in him?
And that's the answer.

1068
01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:09.150
The one who reflects beautifully on this,
I will bring the passage in,

1069
01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:11.400
but I would like you to read it if you can.

1070
01:13:12.210 --> 01:13:17.100
A book two of the confessions of Santa's Gastin because so the customer loves to

1071
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:18.090
go.
I mean,
he does.

1072
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.140
He doesn't like to go to the spectacles at the coliseum because they're so

1073
01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:24.610
vulgar.
And beneath him.
Right?
Uh,

1074
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:28.800
but he loves to go to the theater and he has extraordinary refraction.

1075
01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:32.870
What does it mean to be unaffected in the theater?

1076
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.320
How we'll have to understand my discomfort at the theater.

1077
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:41.310
It's the very image Dante users at the end of Canto 10.

1078
01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:45.720
I remember when he says that we see characters which we know of phony and yet

1079
01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:49.740
they can inspire some kind of distress and paraphrasing very poorly.

1080
01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:53.610
The last paragraph,
the last lines of Purgatorio 10,

1081
01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:59.330
is it possible to ever be indifferent spectators of the tool more around us?

1082
01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:06.020
What and what's at stake when I say,
well,
these things don't touch me,
um,

1083
01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:10.560
have nothing to do with me and Dante saying they always touch us,

1084
01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:13.510
picks time for him to understand that.

1085
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.300
And I think that he's unveiling that he's,
he's,

1086
01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.220
he's showing it to us and Canto 10.
Okay,

1087
01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:25.300
please
connection between.

1088
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:28.890
Yes,
very good.

1089
01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.930
Do I think that we can draw a connection between form and time and continue?

1090
01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.230
We had to make a reflection on that.

1091
01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:39.360
And then also if there's some way to giants and notion of futurity is time.

1092
01:14:39.371 --> 01:14:44.040
And the notion of
eternity as time,
time,

1093
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:49.810
time necessary to beginnings with the idea of an art form,

1094
01:14:49.811 --> 01:14:52.010
which is sort of like a fixed and mutable thing.

1095
01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.930
The question is since up,

1096
01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:00.900
I think that was implied if I didn't say it and know what I was saying,

1097
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.670
that there is a connection between four men time.
Uh,
the,
the,

1098
01:15:05.671 --> 01:15:07.740
the struggle.
They were,
the question that becomes,

1099
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.250
we usually think of form or something which is fixed.

1100
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:16.400
How can that be part of the world of time?
Well,

1101
01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:20.970
in a number of ways,
I would say that the full Dante saying,

1102
01:15:20.971 --> 01:15:24.870
first of all,
witnessing,
watching history,

1103
01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:29.900
therefore it has a kind of unfolding and he discusses art in fort in terms of a

1104
01:15:30.361 --> 01:15:31.194
metamorphosis,

1105
01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.520
ongoing process of change that includes id of type.

1106
01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:39.100
One way in which jock taught really different shades.

1107
01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:43.170
When we're going to see next can't or it's not an arbitrary relation here that

1108
01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:48.171
are making the distinguishes himself from Byzantine mosaics is that he

1109
01:15:49.351 --> 01:15:53.190
introduces a history.
Painting is a series of,

1110
01:15:53.370 --> 01:15:57.270
of of elements and you've got to keep looking at all of them.
So it's a form.

1111
01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.100
It's unalterable quality.

1112
01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.200
The form indicates forms change.
There's a history of forms to begin with.
I could

1113
01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.450
generalize there,
my answer,
uh,
the,
uh,

1114
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:18.720
in the,
in a way,
as a metamorphic sequence.
Okay?
So from that point of view,

1115
01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:21.350
form sense of all time,
in fact,
he says,
you know,

1116
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:24.570
whenever you see a particular scene or void,
which we're seeing,
Auntie,

1117
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:29.340
that's what it means.
Now,
that is the occlusion of time.

1118
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.410
That is an eclipsing of time.
Let me just go to the ideal essence.

1119
01:16:34.411 --> 01:16:38.850
The ideal point to when you're reading a poem,
you're reading appointment.

1120
01:16:38.851 --> 01:16:40.710
Of course,
the form is changing,

1121
01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:45.270
but unless you know the beginning and you could start from the beginning and you

1122
01:16:45.271 --> 01:16:48.540
read through I time you come to the end,

1123
01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:53.550
you'll miss the point about the poem,
right?
I mean,
I do.
Um,
you got to read.

1124
01:16:53.551 --> 01:16:57.870
You've got to be in time and the novel gotta read Proust,

1125
01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.550
get it full cheek,
which I'm reading now.
That takes forever.

1126
01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:04.410
So thank you.
We'll see you next time.
