1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.170
So here we are talking about recapitulating the work done or na in reading of

2
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.610
the poem selections of this forum.
Um,
and it,

3
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.910
it,
it's,
it's a little difficult,
um,
sort of that of course,

4
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:21.720
I'm not going to tell you exactly what we have been talking about.

5
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.980
We have been reading from,
uh,
uh,

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.020
the work outside of the divine comedy.
We started with the Vita Nuova,
uh,

7
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.090
which we read.
This you recall is a visionary techs as a store of an education.

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.210
It's an autobiography.
And we tried to explore,
uh,

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.150
what those terms mean and how they interact with each other.

10
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:48.120
How does one term shed light on the other,

11
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.730
what does it mean to write an autobiography?

12
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.980
And then at the same time having an education,
the two converge,

13
00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.390
of course in Dante's imagination,
uh,

14
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.520
you can only write an education.

15
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.560
I started your education if you have a sense of what your whole life is about,

16
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:08.394
if you have some,

17
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.730
some pattern of coherence and intelligibility that you can impose on and extract

18
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:19.020
from respectively,
uh,
this the sense of,
uh,
of your life.

19
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.350
But above all,
I was interested in,
uh,
in that,
in that,
uh,

20
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.600
partial because it's,
it's sort of inter inter,

21
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.190
it's truncated at the end as a sort of interruption,

22
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.650
deliberate interruption because,
uh,

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.800
what kind of preparation that gives us [inaudible] repeated that adventure.

24
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:40.980
Dante not rates in Devita Nuova,
uh,

25
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:45.660
is kind of add another operation of the divine,
the divine comedy.
Uh,

26
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.050
in many ways the two Texas really,
uh,

27
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.120
are implicating each other in the sense that Dante finishes the Vita Nuova stops

28
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.760
writing the written wolf.
That's the,
uh,
inconclusive,

29
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.120
the unfinished quality of the text so that he can go on writing the divine

30
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.290
comedy.
If you see what I'm saying,

31
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.710
the Villanova ends with the statement of a project of a project to come,

32
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.180
which therefore will be in a certain way the fulfillment of what is a only

33
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:21.660
hinted at in,
uh,
in,
in,
in the Vietnam War.

34
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.170
So the two texts is our little loop.
One is preparing for the other,

35
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:27.650
the other one,
but then there's the divine comedy.

36
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.690
Turns out that we were reading the divine comedy last time.
Um,

37
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.390
did the in comedy itself has a soul to inconclusive quality about it.

38
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.340
Dante reaches,
uh,
and,
and,
and experiences the beatific vision.

39
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.440
And yet he's text,
um,

40
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.560
succumbs to the enormity of the task of describing it.

41
00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:58.320
And there were a number of reasons why we said Dante does that.
I mean,

42
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:03.321
what seems to an is at the feet at the level of the imagination turns out to be

43
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.100
a great triumph for Dante's own theology,
right?

44
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.510
Because it's in a measure in which that the poem ends it a kind of repeating the

45
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:14.260
salt of the,

46
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.580
with the admission of the possibility for Dante,

47
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:23.581
the poet's language to contain and therefore re fi circumscribe that which he

48
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.120
has seen,
right?
Uh,
he sorts of,
uh,

49
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.750
ending with this,
uh,
uh,
this,

50
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.360
this question mark,
this,

51
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:39.300
this vision of our effigy as he says her own image in,
ah,

52
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.020
that's all that is left in that for him to recall,
which really means that,

53
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.650
uh,
in the refusal to pinpoint,

54
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.800
describe and define the so called beatific vision.

55
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:54.790
Some people can be very disappointed.
Why doesn't it tell us what he really saw?

56
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.180
Because that would be the statement valid for him.

57
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.310
He wants us at the end of the poem to adventure,
to take,

58
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:08.311
to take our own journey and make our own discoveries about that which remains

59
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.950
the essential point of the divine comedy as is the essential point of oh great

60
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:19.471
texts of our tradition and the encounter between the human and the divine.

61
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.630
That is the point of all the great ethics.

62
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.840
Whether this is in the form of the Aeneid where the hero is always uncertain

63
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:33.150
about what the oral,
the gods are telling him,
uncertain has,

64
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.720
how to decipher it.

65
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.630
And yet he nonetheless pursues a,

66
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.540
what he takes to be and miss makes mistakes.
And he is along the way.
Uh,

67
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.430
but when he takes to be God's will,
this is the,

68
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:51.250
the way he can live out his own sense of ethical imperative to himself,

69
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.660
to his people,

70
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.490
the refugees that are coming from Asia minor and going to told an unknown land

71
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.730
and the divine imperatives or whether it's going to be renaissance techs from,

72
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.060
from uh,
uh,

73
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.080
Spencer's fairy queen to task source to Milton whole two creatures who I send a

74
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:16.200
theological epic the idea he wants to,

75
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.620
to,
to show his readers his,
he has one reader in mind.

76
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:24.450
They younger period and this is who creatures from Dante had never read him.

77
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.420
He read in part and was very fascinated by what he read.

78
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.470
Who wants to educate one young man many years younger,

79
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:36.310
be Korean to the real and bitter truth of what the,

80
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.990
the uh,
the piggery and philosophy may be and the bitter truth,

81
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:45.370
the harsh truth,
it'll creatures things is that there is no such a thing that,

82
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.870
that ours are the Roman world is the say created world that the gods have fled.

83
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.810
That's the,
but that is a still in the mode of an eighties,
eighties.

84
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.350
It is still a theological concern because an implication of what I'm saying is

85
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.700
that it is in itself may be a way of addressing,
of course,

86
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:08.990
it's a way of addressing the question of God.
Uh,
the unknowability of God,

87
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.470
the distance of that maybe they're non existence of the gods.

88
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.360
The divine comedy from this point of view partakes of this extraordinary

89
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:21.530
tradition.
But he does it in a way which is remarkably different.

90
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.690
Dante does his theology in a way which is remarkably different from anything

91
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:30.350
else that's like an before him and in many ways after him.

92
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.240
So I think there is a mode of recapitulation.
This is what I have to,

93
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.380
I will have to,
uh,

94
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.400
briefly illustrate and give you the chance to ask more questions specifically

95
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:43.480
about the poem.
But some of these things that I think have said,

96
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.700
the whole poem moves toward this kind of theology are condensed in Canto 33 of

97
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:55.400
Paradise recapitulated right there.
Of course,

98
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.120
in fairness,
he goes on talking about issues of politics,

99
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:02.180
which is not that they are easy,
they are very complicated,

100
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.510
but in some ways they're rooted in Dante's,
on theology.
There is,

101
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.720
it's too easy to believe that it autism is politics,

102
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:12.590
is his theology always imbricated with one another.
In fact,

103
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:16.430
sometimes the best way to understand the theology is to talk about the politics.

104
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.850
And the best way to talk to understand the politics is to really talk about the

105
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:24.540
theology.
They are completely always implicating,
uh,

106
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.580
each other.
And in federal talks or the ethics and the,
and the politics,

107
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.730
purgatory talks about aesthetics and ethics above the possibility of

108
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:38.540
reconstructing the human.
They're a human beings.

109
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.220
So fraud,

110
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:45.221
the seem to be so incredibly sunk into the ditches of their own perversions of

111
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:49.880
our perversions.
How do you,
how do you so radical,

112
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.680
Dante's condemnation of the political realities of civil war people

113
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:58.340
cannibalizing each other and not at a metaphor that man is a wolf too,
man,

114
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.150
but literally they are doing this.
So how do you get out of it?

115
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.250
It's very difficult,
you know,
to,

116
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.460
to be sure to ostracize politics from the possibility of the human imagination.

117
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.620
And then at one point said,
well,
I still need this.

118
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.970
How are you going to make a persuasive case for your readers that they can for

119
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:21.680
you in this was the great challenge of,
of,
of,
of Purgatorio.

120
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.070
And we saw the,
the,
the,
the question of time,

121
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.600
the great problem of freedom that all of a sudden seem to surface in purgatory

122
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.930
with Keto suicide.
You remember with the debate about the soul,

123
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.990
the soul and uh,
and uh,
uh,

124
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:44.510
created in freedom and by an act of freedom of God's freedom to the attainment

125
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.460
of the freewill and,
and this extraordinary concern of freedom,

126
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.560
uh,
and therefore the possibilities of the moral alive.
Uh,

127
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.050
we came to the,
the,
the conclusion Flatonia with uh,
with,

128
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.380
with a garden,
the garden of Eden,

129
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.980
the plays of pleasures that plays were pressures are not them.

130
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.720
They in and of themselves.
And the question becomes now because that,

131
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.330
that is the sabbath,
that is the moment where are your,

132
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.020
you are pleasure can be seen as the crown of work.

133
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.950
That which crowds of correlational one's own labors and so on.

134
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.580
But that is also rooted in theology.

135
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.230
And then we ended up in paradise where we really talk directly because I think

136
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:29.760
that's really the substance of paradise,

137
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.360
the possibility of thinking of an aesthetic theology,

138
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.570
how art and theology hole and go hand in hand.

139
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.720
Because what joints them is the question of not just the question of say art

140
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:44.250
being the temptation,
ethical temptation.

141
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:48.930
But now the question of beauty is the mode of revelation of the divine.

142
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.330
And therefore the implication was,

143
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:56.331
and that's hope I have said that very clearly that art becomes a way to know

144
00:09:57.031 --> 00:10:00.330
God.
They weighed Condo,
the divine.
So we are moving away from,

145
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.250
from traditional assumptions about what is the path to go and encounter God.

146
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.040
But it's really the discovery of the sacred.

147
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.640
It's a sacred going to be found some,
some Texas.

148
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:15.750
And Dante seems to have believed that at some point in a particular,

149
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:17.310
in the animation of nature,

150
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.390
is it going to be found in the love that you have for your,
for your beauty.

151
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:24.240
So you will be at research for your Dante or whatever.

152
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.650
Now he goes home thinking about this concerns,
uh,

153
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.740
and how everything that belongs to the world of art is the part of the path to

154
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:37.020
the divine.
So theology and the aesthetics not just as well.

155
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.640
Aesthetics is a way we make beautiful the,
the reality,

156
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.450
the theological content of Dante's faith.

157
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.560
Not just that,
but not just that.

158
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.150
It's no longer the question over and ornamentation.
That was a problem.

159
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:53.670
By the way.
We'll creatures,
we're at one point says,

160
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.880
I really write poetry because I want to make pleasant the bitter medicine that,

161
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.900
that,
that,
that uh,
uh,
epicureus costs owner administrating through what?

162
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:06.810
The way he says that the gods have fled,

163
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.310
that the resource that you think is a sacredness in the cosmos.

164
00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.580
That's two Beta two bear.
I'm going to say it nicely now.
That's really not.

165
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:18.570
So for Dante,
how are they the actual exercise of art?

166
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.120
It's an ascetic exercise.

167
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:26.580
You got to move through art to refine you think and you question all of the

168
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:28.200
things.
He's not just the end ornamentation,

169
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:30.870
ornamentation of being the word for cosmetics,

170
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:35.310
for beautifying that we should one history,
which he was saying.

171
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.210
So this will the concerns.
And we came to came to three,
three of paradise and I,

172
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.750
I maintained to you and they say,
wait a recapitulation.

173
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.260
I think I have said to you,
uh,

174
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.870
I hope that I have said it all to you.
Uh,

175
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.100
but I will gladly go over it and I hope that,
uh,
if you,

176
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:57.460
if you see more or,
or not quite haven't seen what I think,

177
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:02.140
I haven't been saying it to say that last chance as far as I go.

178
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.300
Uh,
in this public mode here,
the first thing that we do,

179
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.750
we understand about dentists.

180
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:12.751
Theology is the extraordinary rootedness of his theology in the human reality.

181
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:20.800
The Canto three,
three is the candle of the prayer.

182
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.880
And we'll talk more about the prayer as a mode of theologizing.

183
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:26.710
Why is it a special mode of the organizer?

184
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.140
But the first thing he is a prayer to the Virgin Mary.

185
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.410
That is to say a way of thinking about how the divine has entered the world of

186
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:38.290
history and they human flesh.

187
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.970
So there is not such a thing as an extraordinary that I think even talking about

188
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:47.680
the cosmology of Dante,
I try to hint tied to say,
look,

189
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:51.850
the physical world and the metaphysical world are all part of one universe.

190
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.830
They are two separate hemispheres and yet there is always a cross as a cosmos

191
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.340
that will connect them.
But we'll make them because that's the,

192
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.260
the irony of every customer.

193
00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:04.750
So you know what I mean by Cosmo's who I said it comes from the letter,

194
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.170
the Greek letter,
he in Greek,
right?
That's a cas my next,

195
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.280
and they will have a cosmos.
You have a point of intersection of the two arms,

196
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.710
but that becomes also a point of fright.

197
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.490
Things come together and can be seen to come together,

198
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.720
but things also seem to be divergent,
seem to be going away from the charter.

199
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:22.720
Okay.

200
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.720
This is the cosmos of Dante is an extension of what he will say in the prayer to

201
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:31.010
the virgin,
the the,
the,
uh,

202
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.590
the human rootedness of the divine,
not dualities.

203
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.340
Okay.

204
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.020
That's really the primary item and this will conclude with the idea that with

205
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:46.230
the it makes it persuasive that what Dante sees and remembers at the end is our

206
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.720
fog,
which is clearly as a throwback to genesis.

207
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.460
Let us make man in our image and likeness.

208
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:55.601
That's what Dante,

209
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:59.020
we'll say police also means that we are in the world of images.

210
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:01.720
That dampness on journey ends in the world of images,

211
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.960
but in northern images as deceptive appearances only that which he saw that the

212
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:11.200
whole of Purgatorio is full off now has somehow the image,

213
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.180
probably because of that hour,

214
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:18.390
the shared quality of that image becomes the locals of the sacred itself becomes

215
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:23.230
not something that just hides but also reveals the divine.

216
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.100
And the second thing that I think that we have learned to understand about this

217
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:29.890
theology of Dante is freedom.

218
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:35.580
That the foundation of our panties own are the foundation of his beliefs as

219
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.370
natural.
It's theological beliefs is in freedom.

220
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.580
And we talked about the theological virtues as you recall,

221
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.720
the theological virtues,
faith,
hope and charity 24,

222
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:51.040
25 and six with the various examinations or dunk ago or so,

223
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.640
if you're a cold,
we're talking about the fact that,
uh,

224
00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.710
uh,
Dante,
things of faith as an APP to freedom.

225
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:06.050
And that's not unusual for those who have any theological interest too,

226
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.980
to even find traces and,
and,

227
00:15:08.981 --> 00:15:13.610
and implications of this kind of statement.
Faith is for Dante,

228
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.730
a way of knowing he connected with knowledge,

229
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:19.490
which is not a way in that we have a saying that,
you know,

230
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.640
faith intervenes with knowledge stops here by stop because someone who is

231
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:28.550
interested in his curiosity of knowing now,
I don't know,
I'll try hard.

232
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.460
Maybe tomorrow I will know.
I don't need any faith,
right?

233
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.880
If you really think about the relationship with knowledge and faith,

234
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.870
you can't say faith emerges at the boundary line of knowledge was that boundary

235
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:40.490
line is always shifting.

236
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.730
And that would imply the progressive reduction of uh,
Eh,
Eh,
Eh,

237
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:51.020
kind of receding and a diminishing fragments of the,

238
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.200
of,
of,
of,
uh,
the dimension of faith.

239
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.120
But Tanti saying by connecting university examination and the Promo faith is

240
00:15:59.121 --> 00:16:03.230
that faith itself is a way of knowing.
I have faith and that means her,

241
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:05.930
I see the world in an entirely different way.

242
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.350
I can see myself disengaged from everything around me.

243
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:14.000
I can see that nothing really matters that are all the patterns and,

244
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.090
and parameters of reasons are going to be found.

245
00:16:17.091 --> 00:16:21.200
One thing that's really so it's tight with freedom,

246
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.860
hope introduces the question of the future and you cannot have freedom without

247
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:30.680
the future.
We talked about this temporal issues.

248
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.430
You can only think about the possibility of a future if you believe that there

249
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:37.580
is a novelty.
If there is a freedom,
if you are in bondage,

250
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:40.970
you cannot really think of it but philological because I don't want to confuse

251
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:41.870
you at all.

252
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:47.410
You remember that all the three cantos when it literally woven with references

253
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:53.060
to exodus,
all three cantos.
And the story of exodus,

254
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:56.300
which is crucial to Dante's poetic figuration,

255
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.360
is the story of the freedom from a state of bond.

256
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.630
So this is the way we understand him,

257
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.370
but then he also knows that freedom can,
you only have to shift,
you know,
this is,

258
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:11.060
this is Luther,
of course a freedom and faith are one.

259
00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:14.630
And the same thing when this attack,
you remember I mentioned this to you,

260
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:19.310
doesn't concern Dante.
The is the issue.
And so I would mention it for clarity.

261
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.260
They debate the two of them,

262
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.830
Luther and Erasmus over the idea of what freedom of the will means.

263
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.150
And they're really the baiting at texts written essentially earlier by one human

264
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:33.170
is by the name of Val.
And they disagree about what that text means.
And I,

265
00:17:33.171 --> 00:17:38.110
Luther says,
what to harass you really are,
are interested in,
uh,
in,
in,

266
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.570
uh,
uh,
in faith as a form of order.
Uh,

267
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.060
I'm interested in faith as a form of freedom because that frees me from all

268
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:47.894
loyalties.

269
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.260
It's madness about the sublime quality of the statement,

270
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.690
but you only have to shift that the ground a little bit and realize that three

271
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.700
of them could really become in this the source of atheists because atheism all

272
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:08.001
of a sudden becomes important because human beings don't want to be subjected to

273
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.620
anybody.
It's part of the project to say,
I am my own man.
I am my own woman.

274
00:18:13.621 --> 00:18:15.510
I want to do exactly what I want.

275
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.400
I don't want to have any loyalties or acts accept,
uh,

276
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.150
anything that I don't even see.
I mean,
we can,
we can bear with their master,

277
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.460
you know,
that we see and maybe has a knife,

278
00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:33.450
but someone that you know is a distant and remote and [inaudible] says that's

279
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:38.310
the peculiarity of this religious belief of mine,

280
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.710
which is really all about freedom,

281
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:46.080
including the freedom to deny the divinity.
This is extraordinary.

282
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.270
Never heard of in the history of,
as far as I know,

283
00:18:49.271 --> 00:18:52.470
and I have a very limited knowledge,
believe me,
there's no rhetoric,

284
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.370
very limited knowledge,
but I've never seen anything like this.

285
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.820
Third Element about this theology is really there.

286
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.920
The great element of love to discover that the way to God,
yes,

287
00:19:04.921 --> 00:19:07.710
it's hard.
There are many ways,
first of all to God,

288
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:13.010
there is a philosophical way of going through knowing that is the the linguistic

289
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:17.970
way through the language and the outcome to this issue in a moment that is

290
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:21.270
poetry.
There is the world of beauty that I see the language of the heart,

291
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:26.160
but primarily it is the path to the divine is laugh.

292
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.240
All right.
That in which to Dante and Dante understands.

293
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.980
I wasn't saying that lovely,
so mysterious,

294
00:19:32.981 --> 00:19:36.360
but I know that deep down you are your young people.

295
00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.560
Many of you said a couple of here younger,
much younger than I am,

296
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:44.490
but not really that young.
So they are not surprised by any of this,
but you know,

297
00:19:44.491 --> 00:19:48.690
but I know that deep down I remember being young how you think about the mystery

298
00:19:48.691 --> 00:19:53.610
of love.
Ah,
that really speaks to everybody's heart.
I wasn't leading it that way,

299
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.320
but it is really a full point that the principle of election,

300
00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:03.321
which is so crucial to love and not be quite explained that it was meaning in a

301
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.820
theological way as possible.

302
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.470
I was already thinking about the statements that I was saw going to make today

303
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.900
about Dante's theology,
so this is,
these are some of the issues that Dante,

304
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.890
the other day yesterday,

305
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:21.891
the day before I was asked the question about one line in Dante that was very

306
00:20:23.701 --> 00:20:27.150
actually it's if it was a very good question about that fact that Dante's

307
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:30.600
allowed to see the true that that the light is always the truth.

308
00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.900
I was a very good question.
What does it mean to me?

309
00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:38.760
It was so clear and I apologize
because you know I said,
well,

310
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.760
this is really the biblical idea in your light,

311
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.930
which notes will tell you in your life.
I see the light,

312
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.930
we see the light.
What does it mean in your light?
We see the light.

313
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:55.530
And what he thinks is that it's part of this mystery that if you are a mistake

314
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.100
and you think that the divine is wrapped in the kind of a transcendent darkness,

315
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.380
you know that's the language or that it is really all wrapped him impenetrable

316
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:08.680
light.

317
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.550
It's both the same but neither light has the peculiarity of never Layton.

318
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:18.570
You'll see the origin of the light and darkness has that peculiarity of never

319
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:22.700
letting you see the origin of the darkness when Dan for reaches.

320
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.770
But these are 33 and that's the meaning and your light.
I see.
We see the light.

321
00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.210
Dante's is finally the origin of light.
That's the point.

322
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.140
That's the point.

323
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:37.140
So there are moments where his site can become so incredibly sharp and so

324
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:39.880
penetrating.
So look at all these ways,

325
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.870
the ways that the many ways in which we can take available to us.

326
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.030
And that seems that we are always stumbling.

327
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:50.560
I got something that in the long run you have to stop.
And yet if you have,

328
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.510
if you,
if you think that beauty is,
uh,

329
00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.490
is a part which is part of love,
beauties is part of,
uh,

330
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.470
love is a hunger for beauty,
then you play tennis,

331
00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.920
we'll say in the Florentine neoplatonism Lawrence.
Uh,

332
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.330
I don't know where he found it.
Probably in Palatinose.
Uh,

333
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.850
love is the hunger for beauty.
But all these are ways that Dante,
uh,

334
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.760
keeps opening for us are opening for us in our journey to the line.

335
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.290
And then there's the prayer,

336
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.970
which is the question of language that has also become one of the ways in which

337
00:22:24.971 --> 00:22:29.410
I indicated that said,
it's theological,
uh,
uh,

338
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.000
theological route to the question of,
you know,

339
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.040
neurone that we speak out of and speaking a language is an allegory,

340
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.990
a parable of,
of,
of our desires,
right?
A parable,

341
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:48.010
what we lack,
we speak because we don't have,
that's a specific,

342
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.630
and we speak because we had the Sydney and we are pointing maybe without really

343
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:56.500
knowing to what we,
uh,
uh,
what we need.

344
00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.940
It's always a question of need.

345
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.170
And that has always way of connecting language and desire.

346
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.740
We talked about that all the time.

347
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:08.360
That's one of the themes we discussed and then all of a sudden this was two or

348
00:23:08.361 --> 00:23:12.040
three though I share,
I said to you,
look,
the language now changes

349
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.250
all of us.
First of all,
the prayer to the virgin is all about longing,

350
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:23.270
the state of longing but not languishing.
And there is a team,

351
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.920
a logical connection there somewhere,
which is not not going to get get into,

352
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.650
but there's a longing for the divine to show.

353
00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.890
It's Bernard of Clairvaux the great mistake.

354
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:38.190
He who is the great seers opponent of Robillard appears on the scene and

355
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:40.780
therefore that you got over here the polemics,

356
00:23:40.781 --> 00:23:44.640
which we haven't got time for the polemics between our Bellard and Bernard that

357
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.680
clearly behind his operation in Paradiso 33 they all are waiting for the divine

358
00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:53.120
to show itself forth,
right?

359
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:58.330
And this language and yet this desire all of a sudden becomes a language of joy,

360
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.740
of enjoyment.
And that's such an extraordinary shift.

361
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:07.250
Why?
Because Dan understands

362
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.840
the problem with desire.
Of course we like to,
we know,

363
00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.290
we always talking about how much,

364
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:20.600
how permanent we like to be in a state of permanent desires was that's what

365
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:25.250
makes us feel alive.
Young,
right?
Your desire,
you want something.

366
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.690
But it's true.
It's true.

367
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.440
It's part of the great power of desire in the language of his eye.

368
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.610
But if desire work without an object ever,

369
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.250
then desire becomes of the greatest absurdity and futility.

370
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.390
If we go around thinking that we're in a labyrinth of desires,

371
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.920
then really that is this a joke.
Desire becomes a jog.

372
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.330
So Dan p praises this idea of enjoyment,
the possibilities,

373
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.890
this sweetness that is still is in his heart.
This is how the he shoes.

374
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.830
And then finally,
this idea of prayer and I want to stop there.
Uh,

375
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.140
um,
stopped with the pushing of prey and then,
uh,
get,
get your questions.

376
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.480
Cause the whole poem,

377
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.040
I think from the perspective of Paradiso 33,

378
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.610
taking her to respect to with a view.
Not only that,
the fact that there,

379
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.550
there are references to,
uh,

380
00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:27.560
the first words down to users in fair,
no one is a prayer,
right?

381
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.400
[inaudible]
says,
have mercy on me.

382
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.020
You never know whether you're a shade man.

383
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:36.680
He sees something that shape indistinct,
turns out to be virtual.

384
00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.470
This with poetry that lends itself,

385
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.010
lend offers itself completely freely.
You know,
you can go to the library,

386
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.080
pick up a book at three act of someone's generosity.

387
00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:51.080
There it is in terms to it and begins with a prayer.

388
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:56.230
And the poem ends with a prayer and then begins with a pre close the whole poem.

389
00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.740
They real quality and nature of,
of language is to be a prayer,

390
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.720
a prayer,
implying that tension that we have all the time.

391
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.550
Todd,
what for Dante told what necessarily transcends us.

392
00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.160
There is always a reality that is touched directory by the hand of God,

393
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.750
but he escaped the world of,
uh,
uh,
of,

394
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.490
of the human plans and human,
uh,
the human project.

395
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.760
This is what I think the whole poem is about.

396
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.630
Um,
and it's above all a poem addressed to the future,

397
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.920
addressed to us.
That is to say it's not a poem about the past.

398
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.700
Dante is the least nostalgic of poets.
It's so easy.
You know,
if you're ready,

399
00:26:44.701 --> 00:26:47.880
a goal,
a goal ever,
and you tell your grandchildren,
you read Dante,

400
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.730
I thought that Dante is a nice little story about the Middle Ages.

401
00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.850
We are all nostalgic about the Middle Ages.
Maybe some of you are here.

402
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.470
How are these guys,
how were they living in a world of absolute certainties,

403
00:26:58.471 --> 00:27:02.070
right?
Dante,
the poet of openness,

404
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.270
the poet understands reason and and understands,

405
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:11.200
understands,
uh,
the,
the uh,
risk.
That's really what,
what,

406
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.830
what this poem is about.
The talking about the future,

407
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.090
that poem addressed with a number of apostrophes to readers and whenever you

408
00:27:18.091 --> 00:27:18.800
read a poster,

409
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.430
which readers from beginning of inferno to roughly parodies or 10 every so often

410
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.610
Dante dresses,
as you remember.
Then I said at one point he stops.

411
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.600
He made this point.
What are this addresses to readers?
We can read it.

412
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:34.800
Whenever you have that kind of up to the 18th central,
you're always with novels.

413
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.480
Now,
my dear reader now,

414
00:27:36.481 --> 00:27:39.720
my gentle reader there coaching you pretending that crops we either couldn't

415
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:41.490
care whether you read or not,

416
00:27:41.491 --> 00:27:45.210
I don't think ultimately it doesn't really care whether we are reading

417
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.510
environment now who are you following the little ship of poetry,

418
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:53.660
the few of you and I think he means that who are not afraid or how uh,

419
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.720
how,
how rough the seas are,
right?

420
00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:01.910
He could chicken shipwreck and all of that.
Of course you can read those,
those,

421
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.740
those apostrophes as a way of saying,
look,

422
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.710
I need your readers because if I have readers I'm constituting myself into an

423
00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:14.430
offer.
Right?
Cause in Kinda measuring which their readers,

424
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.780
then I am the author,
I am,
I'm an author because I have,

425
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.470
I married because the poem has made me internal.
Of course there is that,

426
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:28.150
but what I think this is about is you are going to use my poem as the bolt with

427
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:35.820
which you can start your own journey.
That's the understanding of the future.

428
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.620
The poet,
Dante is a port to the future,
which he said,

429
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.850
we were saying there is a little bit of irony is I say this,
uh,

430
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.960
that Dante is not the port to the past.

431
00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.930
His wealth deployed toward which we are going.

432
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.470
The Middle Ages may not be a time of the past,

433
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:56.340
maybe the Middle Ages in a different form.
We'll certainly,
we'll come back,

434
00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:01.200
we'll probably come back in the future.
This is what Dante clearly things.

435
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.030
So let's go now with your questions.
I hope you have many and uh,
not many,

436
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:09.610
I mean few so that we can talk a little bit about this.

437
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.810
Yes.
Whoever wants to,
uh,
you came in late,
so I must say,

438
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.430
I must repeat this.

439
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.940
You have to sign and there is that beautiful young woman right there,

440
00:29:20.941 --> 00:29:25.260
Maria Deripaska that adjective you forgive me,
but it's true.
But also,

441
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.940
uh,
and uh,

442
00:29:26.941 --> 00:29:31.800
the other thing is you have to talk very closely to a microphone.
Right?

443
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.783
Okay.

444
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.020
Well I wanted to talk a little bit more about desire and I'm glad you brought

445
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:39.900
that up cause it's been on my mind the last couple of days.

446
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.460
I was just reading

447
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.720
<v 1>Shakespeare is 147 sonnet yesterday in which he says desire is death.</v>

448
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:54.300
And it struck me how different Dante is inception of desire is and that it's

449
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:59.620
something that he seems to want to stay in and relish and it's almost life to

450
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:04.240
him.
Um,
we started this course with the Vita Nuova and

451
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.980
I got so frustrated reading it cause I,
I pardon me was saying,

452
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:12.970
if you love this woman so much,
why don't you do something about it?
You know,

453
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:16.150
but it's like Dante,
no,
he wants to stay,
you know,

454
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.640
in this place of longing.
Longing is his life for him in some way.

455
00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.530
<v 2>Um,
and</v>

456
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:31.060
<v 1>so that seems to me something vitally important to understanding what the divine</v>

457
00:30:32.031 --> 00:30:33.110
comedy means.

458
00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.160
And I wonder if you could just go back and talk a little bit about the courtly

459
00:30:37.161 --> 00:30:41.630
love tradition,
how that might have influenced,

460
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.790
Dante is thinking about desire

461
00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.520
<v 2>and,
and</v>

462
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:51.220
<v 1>more specifically in a spiritual sense as to,
um,</v>

463
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:56.140
Dante is theology,
how desire played a role in Dante,

464
00:30:56.141 --> 00:30:58.540
his conception of,
of his relationship to God?

465
00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.090
<v 0>Yes.
Okay.
Um,
well good,
good.</v>

466
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.170
I like the fact that you bring in,

467
00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.430
I will take the points is that it can remember them,
but,

468
00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:13.340
but also following up my own law in the logic.
I like the way you bring in,
uh,

469
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.910
Shakespeare's understanding of desire and that desire.

470
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.360
It's not that it's really death,
but ends in death.

471
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.400
I that desire leads you to death,
right?
That this is a kind of uh,
uh,

472
00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.140
that is in many ways also,
uh,

473
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:35.060
a view largely shared by Dante in the sense,

474
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.240
but it's not only that come to this stop there in the sense that you have to

475
00:31:41.211 --> 00:31:45.050
understand that there's such a thing has and metaphysics of desire.

476
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.860
I don't know if the term is new to you or not,

477
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:53.870
what could that possibly mean?
But we talk about what does it mean that,

478
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.900
but other than its metaphysics of desire,
some of you may be a little bit,
uh,
uh,

479
00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.950
unusual.
It really means this,

480
00:32:00.951 --> 00:32:04.080
that desire that they said dialectics to desire,

481
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.920
movement to desire that necessarily.

482
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:10.550
I want this today.
Then I won that,

483
00:32:10.551 --> 00:32:15.380
that desire is inexhaustible.
That's what it means.
And,
and fraud point of view,

484
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.670
it's very important for all those like Augustan intern.

485
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.940
It's part of this restlessness of the heart as [inaudible] mentioned.

486
00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.870
That's the theological understanding of this idea.

487
00:32:26.871 --> 00:32:31.871
We call it metaphysical because it really wants the absolutes desire by

488
00:32:32.721 --> 00:32:35.090
definition.
I want now this,
you know,

489
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.270
the smoking of a cigarette for a great novelists,

490
00:32:38.271 --> 00:32:41.900
that Italian is a beginning of the last century,
uh,
was the,

491
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.940
the true emblem of desire ending in ashes,
but always like a Phoenix.

492
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:49.040
You can start over again,
et cetera.
This is,

493
00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:52.280
but it really means that it always,

494
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.810
it will come to an ends either in death,
in nothingness.

495
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.390
Finally,
you renounce all this idea was just that,

496
00:32:59.391 --> 00:33:04.190
that's the desire or some idea of the absolute of God.
That's really,

497
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.960
that's what we mean by the absolutely.
The,
this absolute,
uh,

498
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.580
tension that desire entails.
Now,
then you asked me to,
uh,

499
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.790
talk about the veto mover and the uneasiness you had.
I mean,

500
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:19.130
you express the [inaudible] another spectral that easiness.

501
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.650
I know a man of action,

502
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:26.380
like you students will philosophy as you are.
Uh,
then,
uh,
you,

503
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.020
you obviously have,
uh,
have the kind of,

504
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.720
I think that you're supposed to have that,

505
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:35.090
that is such a thing as a passivity of the,
of the state of dejection,

506
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:40.630
the sense of the mastery of love that throws the lover poet in.

507
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.570
He doesn't even understand what love is at this point.

508
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:46.190
That's what part of the education is.

509
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.270
He wants to know the story of the veto Nova is a story of a poet who knows.

510
00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:51.890
He doesn't know Beatrice.

511
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:57.130
He calls a beauty is only because in when in the near [inaudible] of her,

512
00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:01.800
he would feel beatitudes.
That's what he says,
you know,
so,
uh,

513
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.170
there's a kind of arbitrary list two names.
We don't care about that.
Now we,

514
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.720
we go on with your life.
So that it's this idea that he is,
uh,

515
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.990
the power of love,
the eject him.
It's not yet a virtual,

516
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.360
it's a passion and that word passion,

517
00:34:17.361 --> 00:34:20.810
it really implies that we think that the passion is what makes us go.

518
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:25.890
But now careful distinction of the will that becomes paralyzed.

519
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:31.430
The desire to be discovered.
But the woman he loves,
you know,

520
00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:35.960
it's very important for him that she says hi when they meet in the streets and

521
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:39.590
he,
she wouldn't say hi and so he goes home and this dejected one say and I'm

522
00:34:39.591 --> 00:34:43.970
worthless,
et Cetera.
So that is,
he's explaining the kind of,

523
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.230
uh,

524
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:49.640
that sort of state of dejection that love can bring in all the passion of love

525
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:54.420
can bring into the mind.
The mind is,
is,
is clouded,
uh,

526
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.120
unable to think straight,

527
00:34:56.450 --> 00:35:01.450
but that for him also sheds light on the way he understands poetry.

528
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.240
So because he waits for poetry,
he comes,

529
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:09.470
he's a sort of poured very romantic poet who does think that poetry entails

530
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.920
discipline.
Yeah.
You,
it's almost like somebody else says,
well,

531
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:14.500
it's almost going to the,

532
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:19.620
the office at 7:00 AM you sit down at a desk and key parrot and then maybe your

533
00:35:20.841 --> 00:35:25.010
managed to come up with a great line.
He hopes for Romantically,

534
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.980
for poetry to come to them for inspiration to come to him.

535
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.220
And then he realizes that his understanding of love was as wrong as is of the

536
00:35:33.351 --> 00:35:33.590
love.

537
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:38.590
Passion was as wrong as his understanding of poetry that you got to really get

538
00:35:38.731 --> 00:35:41.730
down and do something about it.
When he understands it,

539
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.600
it's too late for him because Beatrice has died.

540
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.370
So now the poem,
the project of the divine comedy,
because she,

541
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.550
she may be,
he has a vision.
He sees her,
uh,

542
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:58.110
at the thought of,
of,
uh,
God's majesty says,

543
00:35:58.111 --> 00:36:02.460
I want to go there and meet with her.
That's by action.
That's action.

544
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:06.780
We will agree that that really is quite a [inaudible] completely changed.

545
00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.710
How does this understanding of love connect with,
uh,

546
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.540
the courtly love tradition?
Uh,
that is really not a difficult question.
In fact,

547
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:20.310
I will give you a little better verb bibliography that,
uh,

548
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:25.260
uh,
cs Lewis has written a very good book on,

549
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:29.730
uh,
the allegory of love,
a book written probably in the late fifties,

550
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.240
but last time I read it,
which was recently some 20 years ago,

551
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:38.120
it was still very good,
very powerful.
Um,
the idea is this a that,

552
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.040
and I'm really paraphrasing cs Lewis more or less,

553
00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:45.030
I mean with a lot of gaps in my mind about the,
the,

554
00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:46.750
the richness of the text.
Uh,

555
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.640
the clearly what we think of love today as a romantic understanding.

556
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:52.740
It's really a discovery of the Middle Ages.

557
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.860
And I have been talking about the fact that as you may all recall,

558
00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:00.600
the Greeks didn't have this romantic understanding or the Romans didn't have

559
00:37:00.601 --> 00:37:05.550
this understanding of love.
You know,
when you read Talas,
uh,
uh,

560
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.090
the passion for a woman is something,
you know,
that,
uh,

561
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.870
he's always,
uh,
uh,
a little uneasy about,

562
00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:17.220
that's not what a virtuous men should be doing.
It's a weakness.
It's a weakness.

563
00:37:17.221 --> 00:37:20.940
We will,
the weakness of the world.
He got,
you know,
it's advice.
What can you do?

564
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:25.140
We are fallible.
We are Romans.
But we are also occasionally a little fallible,

565
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:25.701
but they,

566
00:37:25.701 --> 00:37:30.701
idea of romantic love comes with province or poets in the south of France.

567
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.480
Uh,
when you call core three love,
I would distinguish that.
That's,
that's all.

568
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.080
The only thing I would say about it,
you don't read the Cs Lewis,
uh,

569
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.640
who ends up with love and,
and the history of loving the in the,

570
00:37:43.641 --> 00:37:46.380
in how changes that is right in the renaissance.

571
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.910
But I would distinguish between the two.

572
00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:52.350
I would not use indiscriminately courtly love and medieval ideas of love.

573
00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:57.000
A quarter love implies a formalization of love and,
and it goes back,

574
00:37:57.001 --> 00:38:01.320
some of you are new or writing a paper on this,
uh,
on Andreas Capilano's,

575
00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:04.830
the art of courtly love,
which is a way of setting rules,

576
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.950
setting rules for life in the perception that love is a

577
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.110
potentially disruptive experience.

578
00:38:16.111 --> 00:38:20.520
And so let us make it into a joke.
That's the idea.
You know,
let us,

579
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:24.390
let us establish protocols and code,
um,

580
00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:28.410
but by means of which the women and the men can really interact and tell each

581
00:38:28.411 --> 00:38:33.210
other,
uh,
what,
what,
what this is about.
How don't hope marriage,

582
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:38.410
because that's a serious business concerning property and wealth and status.

583
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:43.470
So we then the fairly close boundaries of the quarterly love tradition.

584
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.300
Then you can go on making certain assumptions about yourself,
about,

585
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.470
you can play Oh,
about,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
uh,

586
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:57.840
the greatness of women.
The secret of loving,
you know,
there's,

587
00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.800
there's a certain code.
Okay.
Um,
in the other forms of,
uh,

588
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.880
our quarterly love,
the,
or the suite,
the new style,
the way developed.

589
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.070
Another book that I could mention,
he was in Valencia v,
a.
L,
e,
N,
c,
y,

590
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.480
uh,
which is,
uh,
uh,
love something.

591
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:20.230
Kind of remember the title Maurice Valance say,
uh,

592
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.530
he also discusses the shifts between province,

593
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:28.531
our understanding of love and the sweet new style articulated by Dante and his

594
00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:33.810
Coterie of,
uh,
of poet.
Okay.
That makes it a hope.
Yeah.

595
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:47.250
<v 4>Thank you for,
um,
an extraordinary series of lectures.</v>

596
00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:51.950
I was curious about the ending and I wonder if you could comment on Dante is

597
00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.060
views about the papacy.

598
00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.840
I thought his choice of Bernard of Clairvaux was very curious,
um,

599
00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.020
and throughout the divine comedy,

600
00:40:01.021 --> 00:40:06.021
he previously was grumbling about a paper or people intervention over temporal

601
00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:09.740
powers.
So I wondered if you could comment on that conclusion.
Hmm.

602
00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.550
<v 0>Yeah.
Very good.
Good.
Good,
good question.
Um,
a,</v>

603
00:40:13.551 --> 00:40:16.790
of course I didn't talk about it and I think that what you're really referring

604
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:20.750
to,
I don't know.
Uh,
but I think what you're referring to is the fact that,
uh,

605
00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.850
Bernard of Clairvaux,
uh,

606
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:26.510
wrote a great book called considering own consideration,

607
00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:30.670
which seems to be about contemporary of life.
You know,
he's a,

608
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.680
the great reformer of the Benedictine Movement,

609
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.920
Monastic Movement in,
uh,
in,
in France and the,

610
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.990
the so called Cistercian monasteries,

611
00:40:41.991 --> 00:40:46.991
which became the centers of culture where they would copy,

612
00:40:47.241 --> 00:40:51.860
they will do poetry,
they would write music.
Uh,
they would sing,

613
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:53.120
I mean,
the,
the,

614
00:40:53.121 --> 00:40:57.020
the odds that way we know them really originated with him,

615
00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:01.250
but he wrote this thick sole consideration,
which actually in spite of the title,

616
00:41:01.251 --> 00:41:02.570
because you didn't know that,
you know,

617
00:41:02.571 --> 00:41:06.380
what the consideration is a step before you come to contemplation.
You know,

618
00:41:06.381 --> 00:41:09.830
there are a number of reflection,
concentration,

619
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:14.900
and then contemplation.
He chooses to write on content or no on consideration.

620
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:20.170
He dedicates a book to this treatise to Pope Eugene the fourth,

621
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:22.940
who had been his disciple.

622
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.810
He had been at benedict with a French man who had been a benedictine monk with

623
00:41:26.811 --> 00:41:28.320
him.
And it's,
it's,

624
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.660
this is probably one reason why damper chooses Bernard.

625
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.990
They're not the contemplative monk that reformer all of paradise is populated

626
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:42.260
with founders and great reformers,

627
00:41:42.261 --> 00:41:47.240
founders of olders or Justinian in the law,
et cetera.
Right.

628
00:41:47.241 --> 00:41:51.740
Francis Benedict Dominate Bernard.
I said,
so,
uh,

629
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:53.320
in spite of the fact that he's a contemplative,

630
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:58.330
Bernard did not hesitate to write a text for the spiritual edification of his

631
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:01.700
ex,
uh,
disciple Eugene,

632
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:06.701
the fourth who is now a po and he's a way or how the office of the shepherd of

633
00:42:07.731 --> 00:42:12.731
the church can distract him from the loftier spiritual aimed and the wrong.

634
00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.860
So it's really a sequence of arguments about what you should,

635
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.580
how should you administer your time so that you are never really going to lose

636
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:27.530
sight of what your,
uh,
your are to Amos heaven.

637
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.230
Um,
Dan dimensions in this text by the way,
in the letter that so many people not,

638
00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.970
I go on a challenge in your authority over,
you know,
the,

639
00:42:35.971 --> 00:42:38.990
the letter to Ken grant that that may be,
I have no,
not with you.

640
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:41.550
With my graduate students,
we have gone over.
Uh,

641
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.540
but to me that is actually the indication of the fact that he refers to,
uh,

642
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.310
to the,
to the treatise by Bernard that the authority of,

643
00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:50.600
he is the author of that letter.

644
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.810
Now you see clearly another way in which I can understand your question is that

645
00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:00.350
you see some kind of divergence,
some sorts of break.
On the one hand,

646
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:05.420
this kind of invective the mood of the invective in Dante can talking about

647
00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:10.340
Peter Saint Peter in Paradiso 27.
I mean,
he,
he doesn't spare.

648
00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:14.660
He looks back after the examination on,
on,
on,
on faith.

649
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.330
He looks back and he starts attacking what is takes to be the use of patient.

650
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:24.230
My place,
my play.
Remember that incredibly,
uh,
uh,

651
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.690
moral voice at races.

652
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:30.560
Is that right at the very end and that you seem to be worried about the fact

653
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:32.840
that Dante seems to be so morally,

654
00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:37.360
and when it comes about the pope's and then becomes mystical all of a sudden,

655
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:40.100
it's not really one of your concerns.
Uh,
it could be,

656
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:43.280
it could become one of your concerns and asking this question about at the end

657
00:43:43.281 --> 00:43:47.810
of paradise story three,
he talks,
talks about a Bernard such a mystic,

658
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:51.610
and yet all over he's been talking about the paper say,
well,

659
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.440
if you were a war,
if we were interested in that,
I would say,
uh,

660
00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:01.690
there is no divergence in Dante between the prophetic voice and the mystical

661
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:05.120
voice.
That is something,

662
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:09.710
even even those who read the Bible,
we're going saying,
well,

663
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:14.510
the profits were visionaries.
In a way it's true,

664
00:44:14.511 --> 00:44:17.810
but in a way,
it's not true that province,
we're not visionaries.

665
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:22.250
That profits were readers of history that they don't need to have.

666
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.900
Danial gave her interpretation.
It's zeal has visions.

667
00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.010
Isaiah doesn't have vision.
So it's,
you see what I'm saying?
Uh,
the,

668
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.790
there is no clear cut distinction between the prophetic and the mystical.

669
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.590
Certainly,
nor in Tantra,
the two belong together.
Okay.

670
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.230
So that's,
I don't know that I'm answering your concerns,

671
00:44:43.231 --> 00:44:47.690
but I overheard the number of say rumblings.

672
00:44:47.691 --> 00:44:50.040
So your question,
uh,
I'm trying to take care of them.

673
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:53.500
<v 3>Is it a reconciliation with the pain?</v>

674
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:59.120
<v 0>No,
no,
no,
not in the sense.
No.
Uh,
that to talk about,</v>

675
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.790
uh,
even Bernard,

676
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:05.810
there's someone who understands how are oh way lane the,

677
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.670
the,

678
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:12.670
the all the office can be and he was obviously writing because he must be aware

679
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:18.120
of what has been happening and what was likely to happen if you don't have to,

680
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:22.730
to become a chronic worrier and the historian to do that.
You can imagine,

681
00:45:22.731 --> 00:45:26.370
you know,
this can happen.
Ah,
no,
there is not that.
It's,

682
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.720
I think that Dante is judgment about history is always very clear til the very

683
00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:36.620
end,
very clear.
Um,

684
00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.140
history needs every form.

685
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:44.870
And of course he would say because he's one who believes in the sacral mentality

686
00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.450
and presence of the self,
how the selfish culture,

687
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:53.540
before I start talking about that the world needs reforming.

688
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:58.240
Let me just begin here.
That would be a,
an intimate,

689
00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:03.260
an obvious way to say it.
So I call it the language of presence in him.

690
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.353
This hands up,

691
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:08.810
I am present to my own self and therefore I have responsibilities towards my own

692
00:46:08.811 --> 00:46:13.700
self.
Before I'd be hard to be kept.
I started using the megaphone and saying,
uh,

693
00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.560
let's reform the,
the,
the,
the,

694
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:20.890
the world that probably if they were ever to calm and not this know that Utopian

695
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.100
thinker,

696
00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:26.560
it will come only because so many people of goodwill and then women would,

697
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.080
will his saints,
he's Bi,
uh,
blessed.

698
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.120
The blessed souls that he meets are willing pools.

699
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.430
Do something about that.
No,
no.
Reconciliation,

700
00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.460
a sense of finally things were becoming together.

701
00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.060
I don't think actually I hold on to that.
Yeah.

702
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:45.203
<v 3>Okay.</v>

703
00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:56.530
<v 5>I'm just thinking more about um,</v>

704
00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:02.010
desire and love and the fact that the will is what loves and the will always

705
00:47:02.051 --> 00:47:06.460
contains some element of lack or desire it seems.
So even if it,
you know,

706
00:47:06.461 --> 00:47:07.690
can attain plenitude,

707
00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:11.710
it still seems that Dante and talking so much about the will and the will as

708
00:47:11.711 --> 00:47:16.480
loving Dante says that love always has some element of lack.
It's not just luck,

709
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.150
there is plenitude but still there's always this restlessness.

710
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.940
And so the love at the end where there is plenitude,

711
00:47:21.941 --> 00:47:24.940
it seems to be a completely transformed understanding of love,

712
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.450
that it's not possible to go to return from,
you know,

713
00:47:28.451 --> 00:47:31.900
in the beatific if you have this plenitude you know,
is it possible to go back,

714
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.620
cause it does seem like it's a completely transformed understanding of love when

715
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:39.810
you have just the plenitude and not lack anymore.
So with that in mind,
um,

716
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:40.900
does,

717
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.140
is Dante ever able to attain this love because this love that does have pundit's

718
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.910
you'd seems like it should end in silence with no language and Dante does go

719
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:53.320
back and speak and he does.
Um,
he,
he is still,

720
00:47:53.321 --> 00:47:54.730
he is a pilgrim and a poet.

721
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.200
And so does he really ever moved from the images to the essences and is the

722
00:47:59.201 --> 00:48:02.770
uncertainty at the end?
Not just because we have to go on the journey ourself,

723
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.480
but because he is still on the journey.

724
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.830
<v 0>Uh,
well the,
um,
I know you are,</v>

725
00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:15.850
you are really voicing a very delicate issue in the poem.

726
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:22.230
It's a very controversial issue.
Um,
uh,

727
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:26.200
because that also implies the status of the poem.

728
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.850
Are you understand what I'm saying?
In other words,

729
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.900
if you really think that Dante seen has had the big TV conversion and he has and

730
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:38.440
now he's writing the poem to tell us about it,

731
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:43.330
then you're really saying that the poem itself belongs to a higher level of

732
00:48:43.331 --> 00:48:46.840
experience because it's written by someone who is in full procession of grace.

733
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.520
That's your point,
right?
That's it.

734
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:53.140
That's a very delicate point because I have not been teaching down to that way.

735
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:58.810
Right.
I have not where I to say this at the moment of recapitulation,

736
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.540
uh,
I probably would,
uh,

737
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:06.780
I have wasted your time all along or one little detail that I want to bring you

738
00:49:07.161 --> 00:49:09.430
for your attention and then I will go to the more general problem.

739
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:13.870
When Dante Meets Beatrice in purgatory,
Victoria 31,

740
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.160
this is getting really to be a recapitulation.

741
00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:18.160
Are you talking about everything in the poem now?

742
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:23.260
Maybe it's speed it trees in Pelotonia 30 and then in 31 and put the poster of

743
00:49:23.261 --> 00:49:27.460
the 31,
Beatrice Forces Dante to go into a confessional,

744
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:32.770
you have to go on into an admission of who you are and has to be public.

745
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.320
CanNot say,
well you I know,
you know,

746
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:40.180
but you have to be Julie Ashamed.
There was only that way.

747
00:49:40.181 --> 00:49:44.370
You can transcend whatever it is that you have within your Dante,

748
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.550
uh,
reluctantly agreed to do that.

749
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.110
And then Beatrice will say,

750
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:54.730
I want you to go through this so that another time,

751
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.560
the future tense when you will see,
we'll meet the siren.

752
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:04.600
I want you to be strong.
And this to me implies that's one of the many,

753
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:09.700
oh damn Percy's sa Casabella another aesthetic temptation.

754
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.790
One doesn't have to have the temptation to kill someone,
you know,

755
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:16.810
to really feel that one is out of fives,
fallen out of grace.
But this is,

756
00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:21.250
he meets Cassela and he remembers how sweet was that,

757
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:26.251
that song he heard from Casa and that sweetness still resounds me.

758
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:31.310
No,
he,
Dante is writing is talking as a port.

759
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.740
He meets you listeners.

760
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:38.150
I grieve then and I grieve now.
I,

761
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:43.160
so there's a way in which states within the pilgrim don't really uh,

762
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:48.380
go on changing value the same implying that there's some kind of continuity

763
00:50:48.381 --> 00:50:51.920
between pilgrimage and poetry writing.

764
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:57.400
And to me the writing of poetry is an extension of the pilgrimage.

765
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.360
Damn pill goes on saying,
I have had the beatific Fisher,

766
00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.160
I am now I know what enjoyment means,
not just desire,

767
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:12.610
but I'm coming back to the earth and therefore I cannot come back to the earth.

768
00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:17.210
Is anything less than a human being with one project,

769
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:22.540
that project to write a poem because I want to retrieve that joy and because I

770
00:51:22.821 --> 00:51:27.530
want to share the joy.
So I have sat done.
Two things in my answer to you.

771
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:32.710
One talking about the question of the pilgrims' experience and the relationship

772
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:37.160
of the pilgrims experience to the writing of a poem.

773
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:42.490
But I've also said that the poem stands as a sign for us know hermeneutical

774
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:50.070
moment.
He,
Dante means it for us so that we can,

775
00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:54.260
and his journey continues.
Okay.

776
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.910
That's my aunts.
Uh,
you don't have to agree with it because there are,

777
00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:00.440
I know that is,

778
00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:05.441
that is there are the people I have been fighting those people for a long time

779
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:08.420
in my life.
I don't want to go back to those fights,

780
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:12.080
but I think that this is my way of looking at it.
Okay.

781
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:16.400
I can give you more bibliography.
I would rather not actually tell you the truth.

782
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.840
I don't want to tell you about those people who are writing the other way.
No,

783
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.840
I have written about them though in my,
my box.
So,

784
00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:36.480
<v 6>um,
I was wondering if you'd talk a little bit more about how Dante views other</v>

785
00:52:36.481 --> 00:52:40.170
religions,
if like in particular Judaism,
um,

786
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:45.230
and if it sort of falls underneath his idea of religious freedom and that if you

787
00:52:45.301 --> 00:52:46.920
have the freedom to become an atheist,

788
00:52:46.921 --> 00:52:50.010
you also have the freedom to choose a different religion.
Um,

789
00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.930
and if you've used Judaism and Christianity as sort of a continuity,
um,

790
00:52:55.020 --> 00:53:00.020
both driving from the same basis or if he ascribes the idea of succession as

791
00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:05.880
him,
that,
um,
Christianity has succeeded Judaism and invalidates it.

792
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.820
And for that reason,
we don't find from what I can remember,

793
00:53:08.821 --> 00:53:13.650
any Jews in in paradise.
Oh,
yes.
You do.
You do.
Okay,
then that's,
that's fine.

794
00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:14.533
<v 0>Well,
well,</v>

795
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:18.020
I have to correct you immediately because then maybe you rephrase today they're

796
00:53:18.021 --> 00:53:22.050
there because you,
Barbara will rephrase the question.
When,
uh,
uh,

797
00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:27.090
uh,
Dante goes on listing in the,
in the,
in the,

798
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.920
in the mystical rose,

799
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:33.170
we even told that Beatrice sits next to Rachel.

800
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:35.430
She's,

801
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:40.200
she's a way of elevating her and then he goes on describing all the other,

802
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:44.930
we talked at length about Solomon who is a Jew,
I think.
Right?

803
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:47.580
Was a chew right in the Bible.
Um,

804
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.900
we went home talking about Nathan.
Uh,

805
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:55.080
I tried to make light of it because I wanted to tell you that Dante,

806
00:53:55.081 --> 00:53:56.100
so his whole name,

807
00:53:56.660 --> 00:54:01.620
but it's Nathan the prophet of David and also in the harrowing of Hell,

808
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:06.980
which is in no for with Dante describes what happens to Jesus after his death.

809
00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:13.290
You know,
what does he do?
He harrows hell,
he goes into,
well,
what is he doing?

810
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:18.180
And he goes there to take the Patriarchs and the women with Israel and take them

811
00:54:18.181 --> 00:54:20.370
to heaven.
That's,
these are facts.

812
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.420
You want to change you your question or I can go on telling you more an

813
00:54:24.421 --> 00:54:27.300
answering the real questions that you are,
you are racing,

814
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.100
they said the relationship between Christianity and Judaism and uh,

815
00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.890
and the other religions.
You want me to talk about that?

816
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:44.020
I guess by having juice in paradise and having the figure of Christ come in and

817
00:54:46.261 --> 00:54:51.261
collect the Patriarchs if he's trying to integrate Judaism and Christianity or

818
00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:57.340
somehow find a way between the two.
Uh,
okay.
Uh,

819
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.930
so you're interested especially,
uh,

820
00:54:58.931 --> 00:55:03.931
about Dante sense of the relationship between Christianity and Judaism,

821
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.740
or you want me to also address the other issue of the way he looks at the Hindus

822
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:12.930
and the Muslims?
So,
so we talked about Dante,
the other religions.
In fact,

823
00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.670
when I would talked about Dante's relationship with the sense of Christianity to

824
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:21.540
the other religions,
I'd never mentioned the Jews.
And probably that too,

825
00:55:21.541 --> 00:55:24.650
you may have been a kind of glaring omission.
I it,

826
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.180
this guy is talking about the big,
the big religions.

827
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:32.010
What about the Matrix of the religions?
The,
the,
uh,
Judy's,

828
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.633
it's likely,

829
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:37.200
I occasionally thought maybe I should say something about that says no because

830
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:40.930
Dante doesn't talk about it.
And so I wouldn't,
um,

831
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:45.030
but antitrust talk when he has,
and he's not the only one.

832
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:50.020
Centuries before him,
they were talking a main,
like

833
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:54.300
a great theologian by the name of Bonaventure,

834
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:58.650
a professor of theology at University of Paris.
I mentioned that text I'm sure,

835
00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.140
uh,
in,
in the year 1274,

836
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:07.940
which is also the year of his death.
He was invited to Paris.

837
00:56:07.941 --> 00:56:08.820
He was teaching there,

838
00:56:08.821 --> 00:56:12.450
but he was invited to deliver a number of lectures and he gives these lectures

839
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:17.840
and then he goes on talking about the other religions that religions,

840
00:56:18.061 --> 00:56:22.020
he knows Hindu and a Muslim religion.

841
00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:26.620
And it's an argument I mentioned that because it seems to me that Dante follows

842
00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:29.610
Bonaventure fairly closely when in the Canto,

843
00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.170
some Francis Canto 10,

844
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:36.280
the description of the that that the legend of Sam Francis,
Uhh,

845
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:41.281
Francis is said to have gone to the Salton to try to convert him and fails.

846
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:46.350
And then Dante also talks of,
uh,
uh,
the,

847
00:56:46.351 --> 00:56:51.351
the Hindus with references to the Ganges when talking about justice,

848
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:56.020
Dante's talking about Europe.
But in between he alludes to the [inaudible],

849
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.480
he talks about the Persians and the Hindle,

850
00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:02.590
the guy from the hint who is born on the river,
uh,
Hindus,

851
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:07.480
the Hindus.
Um,
so what is their conception there?

852
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:08.613
The critique,

853
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:13.300
they are talking as Christians and they're talking from the point of view of

854
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:14.230
Christianity.

855
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:19.710
And the position that Bonaventure we'll have and Nanterre think follows him,

856
00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:24.700
uh,
is the following.
How does it,
how can be,

857
00:57:24.790 --> 00:57:28.960
can they be distinguished?
What do they share?
They talk about what they share,

858
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:33.710
what do they have in common,
uh,
and the having carbon,
eh,

859
00:57:33.711 --> 00:57:38.080
especially with the case of the Muslims,
the biblical,
the biblical,

860
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.270
the Jewish tradition.
Let me just look mince words here.
The Jewish tradition,

861
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:48.370
that's really the,
the,
the common matrix for him.
Um,

862
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.090
he also notices differences.
The,
for instance,

863
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:57.091
the physiology of the Hindus is one that presumes the diffusive ness of God in

864
00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:02.380
all things.
Okay.
That's,
no,

865
00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:05.920
I don't think that's something that unusual.
What does it imply?

866
00:58:05.921 --> 00:58:10.921
Because then they come critical of it and then implies the difficulty of making

867
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:16.420
judgments about what's good and evil.

868
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.410
If God is everywhere you have through the sacrality of all things,

869
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:22.450
which is a great idea.
And yet,
you know,

870
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:25.540
there are some aspects of reality where you don't like to think that they are

871
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:30.450
all alike,
is a way in which this is pantheism and,
and,

872
00:58:30.451 --> 00:58:34.690
and can become,
uh,
uh,
therefore,
uh,
can become,

873
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:39.750
can be critiqued as the lack of distinctions and hierarchies and ordering when

874
00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:42.130
they come to the Muslims.

875
00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:46.850
Since the Muslim religion is one that talks about the absolute,
uh,

876
00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:50.170
impenetrability of the human mind,

877
00:58:50.171 --> 00:58:52.870
cannot ever hope to understand the divine.

878
00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:57.900
We are here at the mercy of God and we live only by the mercy of God.

879
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.180
We can not go on to and say,
well,
but I,

880
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:04.630
I live by reason and I die by reason and I can get to know God.
He says,
well,

881
00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:08.440
there is a great distance between the human and the divine.

882
00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:11.770
So that's the critique.
If this is true,

883
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.430
then we have nothing to then it's an absolute transcendence.

884
00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:20.350
And theses Christianity's that which literally mediates between the two.

885
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:24.530
Because at transcendence and absolute transcendence of God,

886
00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:26.930
the way the Muslims understand it,

887
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:31.610
but there is also a possibility of a mediation,
not total mediation,

888
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:34.790
the way the Hindus understand it,
but the mediation of the cross,

889
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.560
the mediation of incarnation.

890
00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:41.620
This is the way Dante takes the other religions when it comes to the pagan

891
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:45.830
religion mom,
because they had the pagan religions for instance.

892
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:50.510
And Dante there for us very much.
Um,
the,

893
00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:54.020
the pagan religions,
their original,
the Greeks,
the religion of the Romans.

894
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:57.410
And Dante follows very much,
uh,
some fantastic,

895
00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:01.930
who is the one two talks at length about about this issue.
Uh,
and,
and,

896
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:03.320
and that's the ambiguity.

897
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:08.330
There are our adumbration of the divine,

898
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.480
but at the same time they big can become also blasphemous idols of the infernal

899
01:00:14.121 --> 01:00:14.930
powers.

900
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:19.070
So there's this way of really the smashing if you wish of the items when it

901
01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:23.600
comes to Judaism,
which is really the,
the,
the question that,
that,

902
01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:25.790
uh,
with which you started.
Actually,

903
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:32.330
I think that Dante is,
uh,
uh,
I talked about that.
I shouldn't say that.

904
01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:34.220
I didn't talk about it.
Um,

905
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:39.500
you may recall that I made a point,
uh,
in,
uh,

906
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:44.170
at the beginning of,
uh,
the readings of the poem.
Maybe,
you know,

907
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.690
pat was not very,
didn't see,
didn't seem to be very important.

908
01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:51.230
It was important to me.
Uh,
I,
I met an air,

909
01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:55.940
I sort of went on talking a little bit at length about the question of birth.

910
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:59.420
You remember how there are some characters,

911
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:03.410
representations of cat characters and,
and Dante continued.

912
01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:07.970
I could have said the same thing in the prayer to the Virgin Virgin mother,

913
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.310
daughter of your son.
Two birds,

914
01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:14.970
two birds in one stone and half half align as it were.
All right.

915
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:19.700
The order of your son Nantais focuses on,
on birth.
And I did say,

916
01:01:19.701 --> 01:01:23.900
I went on talking since it looks like this about Virgil then talks about the

917
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:28.400
birth of a franchise car.
Jack couldn't cancel checks,
uh,

918
01:01:28.401 --> 01:01:32.810
Farinata and Canto 10 endlessly talks about this whole issue.
Uh,

919
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:37.320
and then I went on talking to decide God is concerned with birth is a

920
01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.810
specifically Roman.

921
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:42.800
I said this is really a room insight into the importance.

922
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.890
It's really what distinguishes I uh,
the,
the,
the,

923
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:49.850
the Greek tragic understanding of birth.

924
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.640
Your children can really become a curse in,
in when you read the,
uh,

925
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:56.330
that's the by the,
for instance,

926
01:01:56.331 --> 01:02:00.920
when you read the story of we depose which stations being half Greek,
uh,

927
01:02:00.921 --> 01:02:02.510
so to incorporate,

928
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:06.790
and then I added after saying that this is a Roman concern because it's this

929
01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:09.470
whole,
it's tied to the notion of foundation,

930
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:14.060
the room and idea that you can start things over and over again with the

931
01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:16.940
foundations of cities and the birth being the language.

932
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:21.120
Nature becomes historical and therefore I potentially like all of you

933
01:02:21.121 --> 01:02:23.790
potentially can change everything around you.

934
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:28.050
It's not true as someone at a round table the other night in my department who

935
01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:31.770
was saying that you have no experience,
there are no events,
of course,

936
01:02:31.771 --> 01:02:33.300
that experiences and events,

937
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:38.190
every birth is an event that's down to is understanding because he can change

938
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:39.510
history,
can change the future.

939
01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:44.490
I have the making the statement that I'd say Roman idea and for Dante that she,

940
01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.550
he's a Roman and he thinks of himself as a Roman.

941
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.400
Florence is the daughter of Rome.

942
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:55.530
And then I added that this is also a Jewish idea of creation.

943
01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.630
That that's really what we have,

944
01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:00.780
mainly that the great invention that we have in the Bible,

945
01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:03.150
that the world was created.

946
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:06.930
And that Dante is connecting to ideas,

947
01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.880
enrollment and the Jewish idea,
which are miraculously convergence.

948
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:17.300
Is this an act to have useful patient?
Uh,
cause that's really the,

949
01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:22.290
the,
the,
what I read in your question is that an appropriation?
It's culture.

950
01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:26.760
I think that that's really what you do.
But you can say that about the Bible.

951
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
You read the Bible to say reading of history over 800 years of its composition.

952
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:38.510
It's a reading of events around them in the culture and valid.

953
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.300
And that's exactly what Dante does.
So,
uh,
how does he look at,

954
01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:49.340
he thinks that the Jews are a guest is really saying they are not Christians,

955
01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:53.920
but they believe in a Christ to come and that will save them.
Make.

956
01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:58.850
This really means that there is an acknowledgement of the dignity and,

957
01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.700
and uh,
and certainly the originality of that division.

958
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.660
I answered clearly.
Okay.
You may agree you minority,

959
01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:08.730
but it's clear that we agree about that.

960
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:26.030
I was wondering if you could just brief

961
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.410
you on a much taller than a need and the microphone in the universe.

962
01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:34.540
<v 4>Great.</v>

963
01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.550
If you could discuss the presence of violence and all of these texts that we've

964
01:04:38.551 --> 01:04:39.031
been reading.

965
01:04:39.031 --> 01:04:44.031
I'm thinking particularly about the Vita Nuova and the depiction of violence in

966
01:04:44.941 --> 01:04:45.770
these dream.

967
01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:50.040
It's filled with passion and a very strange,

968
01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:51.330
um,

969
01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:56.130
representations of the color red and all as both a lost full color.

970
01:04:56.131 --> 01:04:59.100
The fear of death in these depictions of love,

971
01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:04.101
which reminds me of courtly love and this idea that,

972
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:08.040
um,
our passions are sort of

973
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:14.070
transcendental violent dreams and images that come to us.

974
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.890
But so that's one question of one.

975
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:21.640
But the other is the presence of violence and violent imagery and putter diesel.

976
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.940
I'm thinking particularly about Marsha's at the beginning and control one also,

977
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.870
um,

978
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:33.870
the implied moral violation of Picard and these continuous images that remind us

979
01:05:36.191 --> 01:05:39.220
of human violence and passions,
violence.

980
01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:44.490
And I wonder how they fit in with the final vision of trend,

981
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:49.330
of the beatitude and human love

982
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:54.800
<v 0>that brings us right back to the,
the,</v>

983
01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:58.380
the relationship with the historical and,
uh,

984
01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:03.450
and the sacred really saw the violence has,
uh,
uh,

985
01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:06.000
a parody or most of the sacred,

986
01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:10.310
and in many ways the alibi for the sacred,

987
01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.240
a sacred this is to be understood,

988
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:17.010
is that which tries to redeem the violence.
And Dante,
you're absolutely right.

989
01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.580
Never flinches from,
uh,
uh,

990
01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:25.350
the understanding that the world of,
of history is an economy of,

991
01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:30.000
of,
of this ongoing ongoing violence.
It's true.
Um,

992
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:34.830
he,
uh,
he even addresses you write it,

993
01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.460
the human beings,

994
01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:42.080
the Cato who kills himself or hoping that with this death he can bring an end to

995
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.960
the civil war in Rome between Caesar and Pompey or,

996
01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:54.720
but then the violence that somewhere like,
because you absolutely,
uh,

997
01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:57.300
how love and genders violence,

998
01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:00.420
incredible things he's done that you have perversions.
It's,
you know,
just,

999
01:07:00.421 --> 01:07:00.751
you know,

1000
01:07:00.751 --> 01:07:05.430
that I kill because I want to steal someone's shoes,

1001
01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:06.563
you know?
Uh,

1002
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:11.630
but then there is a way in which I think I'm engaged more tragic understanding

1003
01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:13.740
of violence because it's sort of,

1004
01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.640
it's so mediated and so disguised as love.
Right?

1005
01:07:17.641 --> 01:07:22.300
I can love from [inaudible] Francesca and yet that in genders,
a lot of,
uh,

1006
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.690
uh,
a lot of violence,
uh,

1007
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:29.280
and that has gone through all the phases for this,
this sort of thinking.

1008
01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:33.000
Uh,
that'll thinking that maybe that's really what history is about.

1009
01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:38.310
It's all about violence and that any effort that redemption,

1010
01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.930
Christ's redemption of violence,

1011
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:47.040
that's really what the whole story of,
of,
of,
uh,

1012
01:07:47.310 --> 01:07:49.380
Christian salvation is about.

1013
01:07:49.381 --> 01:07:54.381
90 mentions that this is not a kind of an opinion than to mention it in an

1014
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.640
inferno 33.

1015
01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.570
You remember with the story of Vogel Reno,
uh,

1016
01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.640
in the background of that scene of that,

1017
01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:09.570
that the famous cannibalizing that is the story of the children,

1018
01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:14.760
uh,
have been,
have been killed to his children.
Um,
and you know,

1019
01:08:14.761 --> 01:08:17.750
and that's always the,
the death of the innocent.
It's through the beginning,

1020
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:20.590
you know,
what happened to the children and we can go on arguing,

1021
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:24.860
but what about this?
This kids will have notice sponsor what Indo centers,

1022
01:08:24.861 --> 01:08:28.880
Dante says,
and then you're over here in the background.

1023
01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:33.610
And I think that Dante wants us to over here the experience of,
uh,

1024
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.240
of,

1025
01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:39.240
of the cross that was meant to redeem or violence and they didn't seem to work.

1026
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:45.010
So there's a way in which he thinks that violence has even to the notion and to

1027
01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:46.760
the god of violence,

1028
01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.500
even the redemption succumbs to that vision,

1029
01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:56.830
the idea of redemption loses in connection with the end in relation to violence.

1030
01:08:57.711 --> 01:09:01.280
So that that would be the way we can,
we can come to,

1031
01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:06.440
uh,
to transcend it.
And there are a number of other extensions.

1032
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:10.340
Even when we read Dante will say,
when we read,

1033
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:15.370
we seem to be such an innocuous bland operation that we're engaged in right in

1034
01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:17.990
the,
in the,
in the choir to the studies,
et Cetera.

1035
01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:22.470
Then we are still very polluting the integrity of attacks.

1036
01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.180
We still extract was still break up that unity.

1037
01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:31.220
We isolate the passage,
we make part of what we want,

1038
01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.730
what we wanted to signify.
Hermeneutics is linked.

1039
01:09:34.731 --> 01:09:38.960
Interpretation is linked to its experience of violence.
What gives,
okay,

1040
01:09:38.961 --> 01:09:40.730
so we agree there.
That was your question.

1041
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:46.120
How does Dante get beyond that and somehow managed to arrive to a beatific

1042
01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:50.150
vision?
I think that what Dante's doing,

1043
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.230
it's denouncing or forms of violence,

1044
01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.730
confessing to them,
admitting them,
dramatizing them.

1045
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.110
It doesn't mean that he's espousing them or he shares them.
Okay.

1046
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:08.470
The whole point of the divine comedy is to acknowledge that it lodge it violence

1047
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.750
lodgers even in him and within him.

1048
01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:14.240
But he wants to move beyond it.

1049
01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.340
And that's the ascetic aspect of his text aesthetic in the sense that he's

1050
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:24.550
literally climbing up the ladder of a transcending that which is holding him

1051
01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:30.410
back.
And I don't think that,
you know,
if you're looking for a way that does,

1052
01:10:30.411 --> 01:10:34.230
then he does he get away from it because that's really the,
the,
the,
the,

1053
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.250
the other question,
has he ever get away?

1054
01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:41.760
Not In the measure in which he's human and wants to remain human open to these

1055
01:10:41.901 --> 01:10:44.180
temptations all the time.

1056
01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:46.983
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1057
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.250
Okay.
Oh,
please.

1058
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:04.860
<v 7>As a pilgrim who has become a senior citizen,</v>

1059
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:10.550
I have had a question throughout the entire course and having red hour back and

1060
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:13.890
Thomas Bergen and Mary and others,

1061
01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:18.330
the question is not been the answer for me and I'm not sure you can either.

1062
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.140
Uh,
the question is,
you know,
who,
who is Dante,
uh,

1063
01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:26.610
as we've been responding to these,
even responding to these questions here,

1064
01:11:26.611 --> 01:11:31.080
I've jotted down Newman,
man,
citizen exile lover,

1065
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:35.640
how it pilgrim visionary theologian,

1066
01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.600
Saint Paul and Teresa have John of the Cross,

1067
01:11:43.651 --> 01:11:48.110
Bernard of Clairvaux had their visions and they became saints.
Is this man scene?

1068
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:51.900
<v 0>Uh,
well,
yeah,</v>

1069
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:59.240
I,
I,
I'm taking it a little bit of time to,
uh,

1070
01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:02.730
to answer because I,
you must know,

1071
01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.930
I think you know that actually there are people who think that he should be

1072
01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:07.764
canonized.

1073
01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:11.780
You'll probably do not know that they would think that they should be canonized.

1074
01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:15.960
Actually,
it was actually interviewed once about soliciting my ideas.

1075
01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:18.830
I said,
I hope not post,

1076
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:23.580
I want to teach him for what I think he is a poet,
a poet,

1077
01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:28.320
a man of extraordinary imagination who divine's our time.

1078
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:33.830
That's what I think has power of the imagination and who understands that the

1079
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.040
greatest call on him and known us is really the possibility of the encounter

1080
01:12:40.711 --> 01:12:42.360
with the divine.
I don't know.

1081
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:46.500
I hate that if I were to make a movie about Dante have been,
I have been,

1082
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.490
sometimes some people have been,
I have been mentioning it to people.

1083
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:54.570
Actually the,
I will make him Ma,

1084
01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:59.310
uh,
I would make him into a rebellious type

1085
01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.650
who seems to understand everything that he touches.

1086
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:09.680
But he also is a way and takes as he should from everything and transforms it.

1087
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.200
So he has a vision from that point of view,
the vision of how the world is,

1088
01:13:16.201 --> 01:13:20.820
and not to make him,
Vince the world,
convince the world,
his world,

1089
01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.210
the world of the divine comedy.
It's,
it's an extraordinary invention,

1090
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:27.090
but a saint,

1091
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.260
I don't know what this other guys have done exactly the way to make them

1092
01:13:31.261 --> 01:13:35.340
deserving of sainthood.
Uh,

1093
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:40.800
my baby,
I'll leave it there.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Thank you.

1094
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.040
I think it's time.
Thank you so much for your great questions.
Thanks.

1095
01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:47.090
<v 3>Okay.</v>
