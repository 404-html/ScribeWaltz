1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.790
Today we'll be discussing and a little bit in a haste,

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.160
of course,
I haven't got much time to do this,

3
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:13.161
but we'll devote the whole class to the Vita Nova Nova as it is called,

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.950
which is Dante's first,
uh,
work.

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.510
Uh,
I was going to say first finished work,
but in a way,

6
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.710
it's not a finished work.
It is a deliberately unfinished work.

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.340
Dante doesn't really finish many of his works.
He interrupts them,

8
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:36.390
he breaks off and decides to move on to do other things.

9
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:38.790
This is the case with the philosophic banquet,

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.950
this text of ethics that he,
he goes on writing once he's in exile.

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.490
It's true for the text on language.
So cold.

12
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.950
They've Guardiola acquaints about the vulgar language.

13
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:53.370
The second book he just a warm Mongo on.
Uh,

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.470
but it's also true in a way for the veteran [inaudible] ends,
uh,

15
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.490
with a vision.
But we do not know what's going to happen.
Uh,
after that.

16
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.960
This is,
it's a kind of suspension,
uh,
about it.
But this is the first work,

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.600
let's call it full work that Dante writes.

18
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.140
The title means a new life,

19
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.840
the new or new life.

20
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:20.841
So it means probably a youth that describes the story or an autobiographical

21
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:24.840
account.
Uh,
the lover,

22
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.680
the poet who is,
uh,
uh,

23
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.000
who falls in love with Beatrice.

24
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:34.620
You may remember I called it the first decisive event happening in his early

25
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:37.490
life immediately after his mother's death,
uh,

26
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.420
and describes is the story of this love for Beatrice who then in the narrative

27
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.380
dies and he goes,
he,
the pilgrim lover,

28
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.790
poet goes on recording,
uh,
the confusion,

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.100
the sense of loss that ensues this,
this event of the death of Beatrice.

30
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.970
Uh,
his betrayal's becomes an ethical drama,
uh,

31
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:04.110
as most lyrical poetry of the Middle Ages.
That's it.

32
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:08.280
They always dealing with,
with the treacherous presences,
with betrayals,

33
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.270
uh,
with infidelity,
uh,
et cetera.

34
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.550
And then he ends up having,
uh,
uh,
a final vision.
It's so it's youth,

35
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.410
uh,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's the new life to me to above all,
uh,
youth,

36
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.850
but you means many other things,
which I think the narrative will go on.

37
00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:29.490
The meanings of which I think the narrative it will sustain.

38
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.590
New in Italian means means surprising and expected,

39
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.800
even strange,
novel,
marvelous.
It's an in it.

40
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.410
Therefore it gives a kind of a direction to the way we should be reading this

41
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.860
story.
It's a primarily,
well,
uh,
uh,

42
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.340
all these meanings are true and it's an autobiography or what we call our,

43
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:56.050
we'll come to the description of what an autobiography is.

44
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.540
It's also what we call a novel of this health.
Uh,

45
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.610
and other way of speaking about autobiography,

46
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.170
which literally means I write about myself.

47
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.780
So let me say a few things about this structure.

48
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.340
This all by auto-biographical structure,

49
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:14.040
this former problems before we get into the narrative,
uh,

50
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.790
uh,
as such,
um,
from one point of view,

51
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.480
we might,
uh,
a whole agree easily that if you knew that this is,
it belongs,

52
00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:28.481
a bitter war belongs to a mode of province are poets who would,

53
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.850
all right,
but they would call viva life.

54
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.090
It says the word lingers,
continues in Spanish lives.

55
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.640
They said they would write the poems and they would a pen,

56
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.640
a brief account of their lives.
This is true for [inaudible].

57
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.520
They all do that when they would publish their poems.

58
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.650
So we'll say that Dante is writing about himself and inserting the poems as part

59
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:53.800
of the texture of his own,
uh,
his own life.

60
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.370
But it's an autobiography though the,
the,
the,

61
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.340
the text echos,
uh,

62
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.960
and this model on the most important auto biography written in the Middle Ages.

63
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.033
In fact,

64
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.420
it's written by one who can be called that have founder of the autobiographical

65
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:13.930
czar.
And it is something Gaston,
who writes,
as you know,

66
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.390
the confessions confessions,
which is,
uh,
uh,
a witness,

67
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.310
which is seem him,
it's,
it's addressed.

68
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.180
It's really the story of his life from his childhood in,
uh,
in Africa.

69
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.460
Uh,
he saw growing up,
uh,
as,

70
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.470
as a gifted young rhetorician philosopher turned rhetorician who then moved to

71
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:37.470
Rome where he becomes a teacher despise unpaid,

72
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.770
but his students moves on to Milan and the whole narrative climaxes with a

73
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:44.530
conversion.
In fact,

74
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:48.750
the whole idea of their auto biography for Augustan is that it is a,

75
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.590
it coincides with,
it is coextensive with Eh conversion.

76
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.770
He writes a combo.
He here he achieves his conversion in a,

77
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.780
in a God that in Milan,
uh,

78
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:02.950
it's a narrative that we may have at some point the chance to go to an and look

79
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:07.380
at it in some,
in some detail and then goes on writing a,
uh,

80
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.440
a hermeneutics of the biblical genesis as if the new life that he found through

81
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:18.511
the conversion could only literally issue into a commentary about all beginnings

82
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.890
Genesis as the beginning of all beginnings,
uh,
uh,
uh,
as it were.

83
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.790
But after we say this and we say,
we can say that Augusta rights,
uh,

84
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.860
in the full awareness that in effect the auto biography has to be the same thing

85
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:39.640
as a conversion because autobiography demands to voices all the time.

86
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.440
Uh,
it's necessarily ambivalent.
It,

87
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:48.441
it demands the voice of the narrator who is outside of the narrative and who can

88
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:51.610
look back.
In fact,

89
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:55.870
the mode of writing autobiographies always retrospection.

90
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.100
I look back at my life and tried to figure out what are the stages,

91
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.900
what are the events?
What does that makes me now the person that I am?

92
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.050
So there's a sort of necessary distance between the protagonist and the and the

93
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.410
narrator to voices and rake or who knows more then what the protagonist knew.

94
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.770
I am caught in time and I have encountered in my own life from day to day.

95
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.200
And I never know what those encounters really portend.
No.

96
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.910
What do they mean?
Ah,
and that same thing for you.
You have,
uh,

97
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.740
you probably,
I don't know if you hold a that which is the most abbreviated,
uh,

98
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.030
in,
in,
in,
in,
in,
in,
uh,
a unit over autobiography,
which is a diary.

99
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.590
You go home at night and you jot down all the great events of the day.
Uh,

100
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.470
but you may over overlook the most important.

101
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:53.390
You may have had a meeting with someone,

102
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.920
you may have caught sight of some person who eventually 10 years from now we

103
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:02.921
reenter your life and give a altogether different appearance and direction to

104
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:04.634
your life.

105
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.590
This is to say that all autobiographical experiments,

106
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.890
like all diary entries are always uncertain and fundamentally false because you

107
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:20.990
can never really ride.
They can only write about what you know at that point.

108
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.170
And you can never really write about the whole structure of your life to be able

109
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:28.700
to write about the structure of your life.
You have to die.

110
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.590
That's Augustans idea of the necessity of conversion.

111
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.730
It's a symbolic death by means of which you come back into existence.

112
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.400
You'll come back into life as a new man.

113
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.100
You have a new life and now with that,

114
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:45.650
from that standpoint of you're being a new life,

115
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.800
you can have all the necessarily detachment to look at your past and decipher

116
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.700
that which was in a haze which was uncertain as things went on.

117
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.170
The other reason why you need this kind of structure in order to buy this double

118
00:08:00.171 --> 00:08:04.790
voice is obvious because if I go on writing about my life without got any sense

119
00:08:04.791 --> 00:08:07.970
of what my life is about,
can you imagine what happens?

120
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:10.580
I go on writing every single thing that I do,

121
00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:13.100
which means that I would need another life to be able to say,
well,

122
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:15.740
I got up in the morning and I brushed my teeth and et Cetera,
et cetera.

123
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.940
It becomes a random,
senseless accumulations,

124
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:25.040
accumulation of facts without any particular meaning or,
or,

125
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.610
uh,
the election.

126
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.880
Dante is aware of this type of complication of autobiographies where you don't

127
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:38.750
have this kind of autonomy.
We have autobiographical writing.

128
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.130
Writing's beforehand,
you have a kind of self analysis.

129
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.860
Think of of the,
uh,
the one,

130
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:49.040
the figure that is most powerful for Augustan is,

131
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:54.070
is David King David in the psalms with a kind of a reflection,

132
00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.230
a kind of turning inward and,
and trying to,

133
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.290
to pinpoint the shifts in molds are moral judgments than patients.

134
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:07.680
So the idea of one's own systems,
but this is really means,
uh,

135
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.090
the kind of internalization of one's life.
Okay.

136
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.970
A gasoline will not do this with digoxin and we'll go,

137
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.260
we'll go into the interiority of his self into the interiority of his

138
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:20.094
consciousness,

139
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.810
but he will also describe what has happened to him in the public space.

140
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.150
Uh,
he goes inside and outside all the time.
Damn,
please.
Or,
uh,

141
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.110
with turnover you have all read it.

142
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.330
It's really a complicated text from this point of view because for me,

143
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.850
for it being eh,
in autobiography,

144
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.410
it's amazing how little he tells us really and his own life.

145
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.020
It's nothing concrete about this text.

146
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.390
We know that it has taken place in the takes place.
In Florence.

147
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.510
Florence is not even mentioned as a city.

148
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.290
We only infer that it's Florence because at one point there is a description of

149
00:09:58.291 --> 00:09:58.980
a river.

150
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.980
That process by it and which Nantha uses because he has had an inspiration.

151
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.410
Words come to him with the same kind of strength and naturalness with which the

152
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:11.160
waters of the river flow.
That's the,

153
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.900
that's the implied meaning of that association or the description of our

154
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:18.900
landscape.
There's a river and and,
and,
and they'll grow.
Fantastic.

155
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:21.780
Words came to me,
which I I jotted down was the one to remember.

156
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.220
It's the turning point in poetic terms of the Vita Nuova when he addresses,

157
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:30.180
therefore,
he understands how to write poetry.
He writes a famous line,

158
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.030
women who have intellect of love.

159
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:38.060
It is a remarkable line though.
[inaudible].

160
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.820
It's a remarkable line,
and they will explain why it's a remarkable line.

161
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.860
It was never written.
That kind of perception was never really part of,
uh,

162
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.840
of the end of the,
say,
the warehouse of a,
of the poetic imagination.

163
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:55.890
So what does Dan do?
It's,
it's a,
it's a little bit abstract.

164
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:59.250
This is a kind of a need grammatic account that he gives in.

165
00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:00.720
This is unlike Augustan.

166
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.130
It begins with a reference to the book of memory in that part,

167
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.370
or the book of my memory within which literally has been written.

168
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.180
I find words,
which I can not go on repeating in all,

169
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.140
but I would just transcribe some sentences,
the meanings of them.

170
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.780
So he understand that the,
here we have,
first of all,

171
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:28.200
it's a book of memory necessarily act of retro spectrum and memory.

172
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.290
It has a number of other implications and dangerous.

173
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.940
What are the implications while Dante is writing?

174
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.100
This is about 25,
24.
Um,

175
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.220
he had,
it's,
it's,

176
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.300
it's a provisional retrospection of his growth as a poet.

177
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.780
He certainly knows that memories their mother,
as you know,
of the music.

178
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.230
This is the famous myth,
right?
Uh,
is good.

179
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.790
The old Greek myths,
duck mammary,
uh,
[inaudible] to,
uh,

180
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.740
lay with Jupiter from nine successive nights.

181
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.640
And from there copulations the nine muses came into being so mammaries the

182
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.520
mother says,
which means that art is always an act of memory,
eh,

183
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.560
and way of every member in an act of remembrance we could say.

184
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.670
But it has also some,
uh,
dangers that Dante we'll,

185
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.700
we'll go on reflecting about is that if you go on getting caught in the activity

186
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:29.710
of memory,
you run a serious risk.

187
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.310
The risk of changing your sense of life and your sense of reality into the

188
00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:37.960
phantasms memory.
Cause that's what memory is.

189
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.580
It's called a Juno,
the eye of the imagination.

190
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.600
That's the famous,
uh,
description of memory.

191
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.620
The Greeks of course,
for used to put memory in the heart.
And in fact,

192
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:54.910
as you know,
uh,
the ancient Greeks used to put them in the heart.
In fact,

193
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:57.940
as you know,
in Italian or in Spanish,

194
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.190
[inaudible] which really has the etymology and English record I see at the

195
00:13:03.191 --> 00:13:06.880
mortgage of the heart with the member.
Uh,
but in the middle ages,

196
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:11.050
it's already part of the imagination.
It's called the eye of the imagination,

197
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.340
which means that has a visionary component to it.

198
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.390
And this explains the emphasis of dreams,
vision,

199
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.480
strange operations with which this text is punctuated from the beginning to the

200
00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:29.980
end.
Planetary Pete understands that there is a danger to memory.

201
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.250
And the danger of memory is the transformation of experience into a fantastic

202
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:38.920
matic reality.
We all live in the world.

203
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.050
It's like you're always looking backwards and you,
you're not Janice,

204
00:13:44.051 --> 00:13:47.680
like you don't look in all directions.
You don't look ahead.

205
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.260
And then people turn against memory.

206
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:53.870
And the second thing that we get from that little absorb some of the,
uh,

207
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.100
in that part of the book of my memory,
we know that dentists pressing,

208
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:59.350
so I find words,

209
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.760
which have been the inscriptions of memory.
I'm not going to repeat them all,

210
00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.380
but only some of them.

211
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.220
We know the dentist casting himself as the editor of his own book.

212
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.630
That's the double voice.

213
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.650
And this is the double structure of this little text of his,

214
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.770
first of all,
it's a double has duplicity or Lova this Texas,

215
00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.930
it's a book of poetry and it's a book of prose.

216
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.270
It's not an unusual structure or Wheaties,

217
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.210
the consolation of philosophy is written like that.

218
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.990
Dante also writes out of Texas like that,
you know,
but what is,

219
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.190
what are the implications,

220
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:40.810
whether it's a lyrical self who has been in the throes of a great passion for

221
00:14:40.811 --> 00:14:45.490
Beatrice,
who struggles sometimes with,
with uh,
his,

222
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.430
uh,
inspiration.
Wait,

223
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.240
that's the problem he has that one of the crises that he has is that he always

224
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:56.360
waiting for words to come to him.
He's all,

225
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:59.660
we were always waiting for beer to still say hello to him.

226
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.640
There is a way in which he cast himself as the passive,
a passive protagonist,

227
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.810
weak willed,
a unable,
uh,

228
00:15:08.811 --> 00:15:13.220
and it sort of believing that the will can direct him whatever,

229
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.480
the real ones.
And that's another problem that we are really going to talk about.

230
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.140
Uh,
and then,
uh,
the final,

231
00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:25.880
he understands that he better get out of that mode.

232
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.840
And in effect,
and I will say this by making your turn,

233
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:32.190
just talking about the formal structure now,
um,

234
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.950
the whole text is written in the past mode,
the whole text,

235
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.870
that part of the book of memory,

236
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:44.330
a commemoration of a great event in the private life of love.

237
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.870
And she doesn't even know what it is.
He doesn't even know the woman.

238
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.780
He doesn't even know what the passion is.
And part of what the,

239
00:15:53.781 --> 00:15:58.160
the tangent of this text is to ponder what it is that the passion means and what

240
00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:02.670
it is that it's doing to him and to his mind.
But by the end of the,
of our,

241
00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.350
in chapter 42,
which by the way,
let it be said in passing,
it's the,

242
00:16:07.351 --> 00:16:11.840
the division in numbers is completely arbitrary.
We don't know.

243
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:15.710
That's not the way books were written.
[inaudible] were written in Dante's time.

244
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.150
They was a continuous,
uh,
to save page papers.
And people really believe,

245
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.540
but the modern editor have made it or controversial into $42.
Who,

246
00:16:24.541 --> 00:16:27.530
because they should be 30 and I agree with that.
But let me read the path.

247
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.480
The last passage,
last paragraph,

248
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.550
which is no poetry now ends with pros with a voice of reflection.

249
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.410
Pope pros functions is the work of reflections on the lyrical,

250
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.490
on the lyrical inspirations,
on the immediacy of the lyrical voice.

251
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.610
So that's the double was,
I'm an editor and I'm a poet.

252
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:50.000
At the same time sometimes the editing,
the notes that he writes,

253
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.960
say nothing about the poem.
They tried to,
sometimes he goes on into fall mode,
uh,

254
00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:59.210
mechanical description about where this solid is divided into two parts.

255
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.270
That doesn't really add much to the inner life,

256
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:04.940
to our understanding of the inner life of the protagonist.

257
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.940
So this is what he says in 42 chapter 42 after I wrote this song,

258
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.293
it,

259
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:16.540
which is about the famous vision of Beatrice sitting at the foot of God's

260
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:20.150
throne.
And so he decides that he has has to go there.

261
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.280
He decides that he has to go and meet her.
That's the last vision.
Okay.

262
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.580
After I wrote a sonnet there came to me and miraculous vision in which I sold

263
00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:33.094
things.

264
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:38.330
Visionary burden of the narrative is kept up from memory now to vision that made

265
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:44.441
me resolve to say no more about this blessed one and blessed the Italian,

266
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:48.290
by the way,
it's a pun on the name of Beatrice,
the one who is blessed.

267
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:50.790
That one was the better of the good.
Uh,

268
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.850
that's really what it means until I would be capable of writing about her in an

269
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:59.640
old war way.
So if that's the uh,

270
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.790
and avoidably unfinished,
the quality of the texts,

271
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:05.340
I can go on to write about her,

272
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.600
I need to do more work and it would do more research and find out what I really

273
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:12.270
can say about this woman.
So he will stop.

274
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.570
That's what I call an unfinished,
Eh,
Eh,

275
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.200
and inevitably I'm finished narratives to achieve this.

276
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.500
I'm striving as hard as I can and this she truly knows accordingly,

277
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.320
if it would be the pleasure of him through whom all things live with my wife,

278
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:33.960
continue for a few more years,

279
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.320
I hope to write of how that which has never written before of any other woman

280
00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:45.610
and then it may please the one who is the load of graciousness that my soul has

281
00:18:45.611 --> 00:18:48.120
sent to behold the glory of its lady.
There is,

282
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.360
there is a blessed Beatrice who can grow.

283
00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:55.140
Rick contemplates the countenance of the one we asked the barometer Sacra

284
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.050
Benetech to Swish through all times,
uh,

285
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:02.910
blessed and the and and ends with a pan on again,
a Beatrice,

286
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.700
what is the most important?
To me,
the most important point of this paragraph.

287
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.780
The intrusion of the verb of the future.

288
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.540
The only time you find it inherited,

289
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:20.720
I hope the whole text is contained between an exercise of memory,

290
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.130
an idea of something which is past and attempts in great reviews.

291
00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:29.340
If something is passed you have,
you think that you can even control it.

292
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.720
You can certainly decipher it.

293
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.960
You can hope to extract from it some particular meaning narcissist,

294
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:38.040
complacently or not,

295
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.430
and then ends with a projection of the self into the future and other work has

296
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:48.060
to come.
This is the preamble to something more,

297
00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:51.840
which I can not really campaign.
So memory is abandoned.

298
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.880
The work ends with an emerge and within the horizon of the future.

299
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.980
This is really very important.

300
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.360
The limitations of memory and can be understood the only from this point of
view,

301
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.800
because hope,
as you know,
when you think of hope,
hope grammatically,

302
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.200
this is what is the future.
He says,
I hope to write.
There's no future there.

303
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.720
I hope it's in the present,
but hope grammatically is a verb.
As you,

304
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.630
those who have studied a little bit of Latin,
remember,

305
00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.470
always takes the future participant.

306
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.480
I hope that I will do this and so I hope I would have done this.
It doesn't work.

307
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.470
I wished I had done that,
but so it takes all,
it's a verbal,
the future.

308
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.000
It is literally also in substantial terms.
It's a virtue.

309
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.290
This is a theme to say,
I hope it's a theological virtue.

310
00:20:43.291 --> 00:20:47.380
Hope which always implies the future.

311
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:52.830
It says that the past is not really over and done with because once you include

312
00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.210
or you intrude the category of hope,

313
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:02.430
you really believe you can change the meaning of the past.

314
00:21:02.431 --> 00:21:06.940
The things may be happening that whereby all your past errors or your past

315
00:21:06.941 --> 00:21:11.941
mistakes can be seen and will be seen in a new life so much.

316
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.750
Then for this question of,
uh,
the structure I repeat,

317
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.180
we have prose and poetry.

318
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.270
We have the voice of the lover and we have a voice of the editor.

319
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.480
We have a text of memory that at the same time turns against itself,

320
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.840
points out that the mutations of memory and opens to the future through hope,

321
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.690
right?
And you have this idea that uh,
uh,

322
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.920
something amazing is going to happen.
Something,
uh,
uh,
that don't,

323
00:21:41.921 --> 00:21:45.730
nothing concrete is being given.
Everything will take place within the self.

324
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.020
It's the moment where Dante Abandons Augusta.

325
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.620
We began by saying,
I began by saying that the mode,

326
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.210
the rhetorical mode that Dante really follows his Augustine's confessions,

327
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.160
which is a text of retrospection.
And then with the commentary on Genesis,

328
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.340
Dante and with,
uh,

329
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.490
what we call a prolapse is a weird word.
It's not so weird,
but we'll,

330
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.550
that means a projection to the future.

331
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:17.850
Auto biography has this kind of future dimension and cannot be contained.

332
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:23.200
It was,
it's not over and done and done with the most,

333
00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:27.260
the mode,
which is really just to make this really intelligible to you,
this,
the,

334
00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:27.551
the,

335
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:32.551
the kinds of texts that is most like what Dante is written in the individual

336
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.770
mover.
It's really Joyce who writes the portrait of the artist as a young man.

337
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:43.180
That's the way you can really,
if you can not have a conversion,
if you're not,

338
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.210
you can not die as Augustan says you have to do.
When you write,

339
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.470
write an autobiography,

340
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:52.620
in order to come back as a new man and be able to write your life story and find

341
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:54.160
out the meaning of your life,

342
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.400
then what you can do is write about yourself with a kind of temporal distance

343
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.530
that is brought by the time I'm no longer the young men are used to,

344
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.790
to be.
But I do know those passions.

345
00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:11.200
I removed myself from them and exactly the same way Joyce does it with a

346
00:23:11.201 --> 00:23:13.150
portrait of the artist.
I said young man,

347
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.600
which hands with a projection of going to a descending the smithy of this whole

348
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.130
writing,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
the,

349
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.160
the forge and forge the epic of,
uh,
of,
of,
of the future.
That's really the,

350
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:31.880
I mean,
it ends up with a project for the future.
So this is,
this is a kind of,
uh,

351
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:36.490
uh,
uh,
mode of total autobiographical writing that Dante really,

352
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.550
uh,
prepares and puts forth.
Um,
what,
uh,

353
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:45.830
happens to this text so much for the,
uh,
this,
uh,
you can,
by the way,

354
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:50.000
you can stop me at any point,
uh,
as a,
as I'm talking,

355
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.820
if you want me to clarify things or we can literally live at the end.

356
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.270
What happens to the text?
It's a love story.

357
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.340
It's a love story of a young man,

358
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:07.220
um,
who meet at the age of nine.

359
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.470
MMM.
Meet a young woman who is roughly the same age.

360
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.030
He says she's in her ninth year,
doesn't even know who she is,

361
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:21.650
but fields that kind of bliss and then sees her again nine years later.

362
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.880
So we know that there is a kind of numerical symbolism or running through the

363
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:30.710
number for Beatrice is three,
three,
three,
three trinitarian number.

364
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.230
She comes off,

365
00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:35.750
she got reappears and he's convinced that this is going to be the love of his

366
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:39.170
life,
but he doesn't even know what love is.

367
00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:43.310
He does not know what love is,
what he does know at the beginning.

368
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:45.830
And this is what the part of the,
the whole,
the,
the,

369
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.630
the economy of this narrative,
uh,
uh,

370
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.580
really focuses on time to ponder what laugh maybe,

371
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.440
you know,
the culture of the Middle Ages is filled with literature of love.

372
00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.830
This could be viewed as one of the many love books or the Middle Ages.

373
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.240
And in case some of you may be looking already for a,
Eh,

374
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.390
a topic for your paper.
You could write about the love books or the Middle Ages,

375
00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:12.470
um,
but are the other love books the famous,
what books are Middle Ages,

376
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.530
which are completely different from the love of books in the Middle Ages coming

377
00:25:15.531 --> 00:25:17.990
before,
uh,
uh,
for instance,

378
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.640
the Arthur courtly love of undress couple times.
Would you say you sort of,

379
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.280
you know,
it's a codification of what love is.
Uh,

380
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:29.840
the idea that love is an art,
the art of courtly love,

381
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.140
that it's obviously natural inner instinct or thrust the passion and yet has to

382
00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:41.111
be changed as if they can be a sentimental education when his to learn how to

383
00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:45.860
contain,
how to hold off excesses,

384
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:51.010
how to hold off the potential disruptions and violence that love will produce.

385
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.310
There are that the romances of critique and they too are that you may know
about,

386
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.180
which is all about,
about,
uh,
love at the court.
Uh,

387
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.360
the place of pleasure within,
uh,
the,

388
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:06.810
the unfolding of a responsible life.
Uh,
uh,

389
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.240
there are so many other tech,

390
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.520
a lot of the province are poets from Dante really evokes a,

391
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.210
Dante writes about love.

392
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.130
And let me say a couple of things with it so that you can really,
uh,

393
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.200
it's not the first time that people reflect about love.
Of course,

394
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.040
the Greeks tried to do that and you may remember

395
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.540
Socrates who always wonders what love is.
Is it a figure of speech,

396
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.400
manner of being,
you know,
these are such a thing as love.
It's,
that's just,
uh,

397
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.440
use this figure of love.
Is it a God that possesses me?

398
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.070
It's just a natural instinct and that we call love.

399
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.930
It's on this variety of,
uh,
of passions.
This right of ways of understanding,

400
00:26:47.931 --> 00:26:52.200
of all figure within the state.
The main things that Dante meets.

401
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.180
Beatrice doesn't even know who she is.

402
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:56.010
It doesn't not know what's happening to him at the age of Eight,

403
00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.890
it starts in an involuntary way.

404
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.870
The whole point of this narrative is that things seems to be happening to him.

405
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:08.160
No,
he's a passive figure,
but even love comes to him.

406
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:13.260
It's,
he doesn't real it.
He does look for it and in many ways,

407
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:18.650
look at this passage here or kit in book in Chapter Two,

408
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.560
nine times already since my birth,

409
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:30.090
the heaven of light had circled back to almost the same point where there

410
00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:34.880
appeared before my eyes.
It's,
it's appeared.

411
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.490
It's an operation.
Something gives itself to him before my eyes.

412
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:42.360
They're now glorious slate of my mind who was called Beatrice even,

413
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:45.270
but also did not know what her name was.

414
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.440
She had been in this life long enough for the heaven or fix stars to be able to

415
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:52.950
move a 12th with a grizzly east.
In her time there is,

416
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.700
she appeared to me or about the beginning of her ninth years,

417
00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:58.620
she's a little younger than he is and that first her,

418
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.600
near the end of my ninth year,

419
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.410
she appeared dressed in the most patrician of collars,

420
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:08.790
subdued the deckers crimson at that very moment in the speak,
the truth,

421
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.250
the vital spirit,
they want to dwell.

422
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:15.360
So the most secret chamber of the heart began to tremble so violently that even

423
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:19.620
the most minute veins,
my body were strangely affected and trembling.

424
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.920
It spoke these words here is a god stronger than I who is coming to dominate me,

425
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.900
to rule over me.
I mean,
this is,
this is,
uh,

426
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.050
these are set descriptions,
work leverage.

427
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.060
The point is that he doesn't will it,
he does not know what this is about.

428
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:43.140
Why,
why does he present himself as and willing this passion?

429
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:48.770
Because passions because which are unwilling seem to be more important than the

430
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.830
things that we will if they are unwilling.
And they happened to me.

431
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.550
They may have the mark of a secret necessity.

432
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.900
There may be a pattern behind them that I do not know,
but it happened to me.

433
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:07.920
You see what I'm saying?
I do not have any responsibility about it.

434
00:29:07.921 --> 00:29:09.390
I don't know what that is.

435
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:14.510
He will find out in time that he cannot go on obeying the rules of the will,

436
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:20.420
that he has to go on understanding that they will needs to be in turn ruled by,

437
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.860
by reason.
And the other thing that he does is that this is God,

438
00:29:25.861 --> 00:29:29.310
this figure of love.
I said,
God clearly,
literally reconceived.

439
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.390
He has no idea who speaks to him.
Over,
over,
over ranch,

440
00:29:33.391 --> 00:29:38.340
him roll over random.
He takes refuge in the chamber of his house,

441
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:41.950
the Chamber of his mind.
And there he goes,
uh,

442
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:46.650
engage in deliriums,
uh,
uh,
dreams,
uh,

443
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.370
uh,
et cetera.
They say all the clinical signs of love,

444
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.510
he thinks that love is a passion that this debilitates them.

445
00:29:55.750 --> 00:30:00.750
This whole problem would come to a head with the first sonnet that highlights,

446
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.630
which by the way,
is really the point of view.
We know,
uh,

447
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.440
[inaudible] 17 years old when he wrote this poem.
Oh,

448
00:30:07.441 --> 00:30:12.310
we know that this is really a kind of,
uh,
sort of,
uh,
uh,

449
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:17.350
uh,
it's a dream.
It's a poem which appears as a dream,
uh,

450
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:21.220
which I read in English and this,
uh,
uh,
so and so's translation.

451
00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:25.000
But it's better than anything I could try to every captive soul.

452
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:29.650
It's a horrifying dream.
As you can see,

453
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.430
two every captive soul and loving heart to whom this words,

454
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:37.210
I have composed a scent for your elucidation in my reply.

455
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.280
Greetings or bring for your sweet load sake.
Love the first three hours,

456
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.600
the hours of the time of shining stars were coming to an end when suddenly love

457
00:30:46.601 --> 00:30:50.140
appeared before me.
To remember her really was a pulse.
Me.

458
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.560
Julius loves seem to me holding my heart within her hand and in his arms.

459
00:30:55.571 --> 00:30:59.110
He had my lady loosely wrapped in,
folds asleep.

460
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.910
He woke her then and gently fed to her the burning heart.

461
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:06.340
She ate it,
terrified,

462
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.380
and then I saw him disappear in tears.
It's a dream,

463
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.800
a horrifying dream about a lady which is asleep,

464
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.260
held in the arms of the Lord of love.

465
00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:25.210
She weighed and needs the heart.
The heart is given to her.

466
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:30.740
It's a story of clearly how the heart nor riches,

467
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.580
lust.
That's,
that's the,
the,
the sense.
But the meaning,
he says,

468
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.440
uh,
it's a dream.

469
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.940
Another involuntary experiences at dream comes to us without a will,

470
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:47.910
without wanting it.
And she said,
said the meaning of this,
uh,
the song,

471
00:31:47.911 --> 00:31:48.850
it was unclear.

472
00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:54.100
He writes this on it and sends it out to his fellow poets in Florence.

473
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.560
He sends one of them to the person who is going to become his best friend and

474
00:31:59.561 --> 00:32:04.060
whom this Texas dedicated and who will appear very soon in the text.

475
00:32:04.061 --> 00:32:08.860
His name is weasel Cavalcanti.
We should see him in hell by the way.

476
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.320
None that,
we'll put him in inferno pen and we'll talk about him at length.

477
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.550
And the,
uh,

478
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.360
we don't answers cause that was the fashion is write the poem.

479
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.930
And then by taking your own rhyme scheme is I kind of response,

480
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.260
they go on really writing about this and that.
And,
and,

481
00:32:26.261 --> 00:32:29.140
and we look at our candidate says to him,
well,
you're really right.

482
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.430
You really had the vision,

483
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.500
which means that you can not quite trust love that you really have to turn away.

484
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.393
It's a,

485
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:41.570
it's a kind of admonition to you move from all of this figments of love and

486
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:44.900
turned pro philosophical studies.

487
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.320
It's only in the mind that you can find,

488
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:52.830
and then the pursuits of the works of the mind that you can find some kind of a,

489
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.540
of truth and stability for yourself outside of it.

490
00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.990
That is only in the few pursue love.
There's the world of the arrangements,

491
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.710
by the way,
or another,
our physician of the time,
uh,
Dante,

492
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.630
his name was also Dante,
Dante,
Diana,

493
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.100
he decides to write to him and also writes about the zone of this is,
well,

494
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:14.240
this really means that you,
you have a humoral problems.

495
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:19.190
Take cold baths and everything will be okay.
You nearly need,
uh,

496
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.530
need to rebalance,
uh,

497
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.810
the new equilibrium for your humerus.
One reduces love,

498
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.090
pled question of bodies position.
I say,
if we're just a disease,

499
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.260
the other one reduces it to a question of,
uh,

500
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.790
loves danger.
Visa VI the stability of the mind.

501
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.570
Dante,
we'll go another with one and will not listen.
Another two,

502
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:46.010
one no to the other.

503
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:51.290
The rest of the poem will be that of trying to understand what this love really

504
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:55.970
is.
A crucial chapters who would appear.

505
00:33:55.971 --> 00:33:59.030
Chapter Eight,
he describes is going to a funeral.

506
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.860
You remember what he sees a dead woman and you,

507
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.990
and you wonder what is the point of this kind of scene.
And the point,

508
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:10.991
I think that scene is that there is a body and that body is in earth and dead

509
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:17.500
and that there is no possible connection between him and this dead body.

510
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:22.040
So that love is not reduceable all the two bodies they need.

511
00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.400
There must be some kind of animation.
There must be some kind of soul.

512
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:30.200
That is our life that accompanies it.
And the,
the,
uh,

513
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.270
in chapter 12,
finally,
Dante seems to be moving a little bit,
uh,

514
00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.510
away from this.
A province are this,

515
00:34:37.511 --> 00:34:40.200
this way of describing love in,
uh,

516
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.180
in terms of conventional terms that I have to describe to you.

517
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.790
And he has this other dream about at the Lord,

518
00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.230
the god of love who comes to him and says,

519
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:52.370
it's time for you to put aside all Simulacra,
all fictions,

520
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:53.240
whole emptiness.

521
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.860
Let me just say a little bit about more this point about love and the kind of

522
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:02.480
questions of Dante raises whenever we think about love in the modern era,

523
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:07.680
as you know,
this is not my ideas,
but particularly I believe in them.
Uh,

524
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.770
others have formulated these ideas.

525
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.490
What do we think about love and modern times that the formulation of love is we

526
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:16.460
understand it today is essentially medieval.

527
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:20.300
The Greeks do not have this and this understanding of love,

528
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:23.390
the way the romantic idea of love,
the way we do,

529
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.800
they understand love as an intellectual pursuit,
as,

530
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:31.100
as an ascent up the ladder of being.

531
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.870
That's the work of philosophers,
uh,
that the,
the,

532
00:35:34.871 --> 00:35:37.010
the minds can go on a,

533
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:42.080
from the green through the various degrees of a reality and intellectual reality

534
00:35:42.361 --> 00:35:45.390
in one can grasp it.
That is friendship of course,

535
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.090
but it's not the idea of the love of the man for a woman,

536
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.200
which is so crucial tool,
the romantic understanding of love.
The,
the,

537
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:58.020
the Romans had no understanding that tall about either what the Greeks knew or

538
00:35:58.021 --> 00:36:01.560
what we know.
Uh,
you know,
the most important,
uh,

539
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.950
Latin voice romantic love is for instance,

540
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:09.720
I think capitalists who talks about love as something to be slightly embarrassed

541
00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:14.640
about.
It's a weakness.
A serious guy that's not involved in oneself.

542
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.150
And this kind of,
uh,
of,
of pursuit is kind of,

543
00:36:18.151 --> 00:36:22.860
you have to do the serious work of,
uh,
of living,
the political issues,

544
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.530
going to the forum,
negotiate,
et Cetera.

545
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.690
But come the province,
our world in the south of France,

546
00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:31.651
the province,

547
00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:36.651
our courts love changes both its meaning and its contours.

548
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.450
Now love is the love of men for a woman.

549
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:44.480
And it's usually described and even Andrea's Capilano's and they are to three

550
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:49.830
love or in the Texas of,
uh,
of,
of uh,
uh,
cutting the tour.

551
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.300
It's described this maybe it can be a clan,

552
00:36:53.301 --> 00:36:58.301
the Stein secret relationship in necessarily need not be within marriage cause

553
00:36:59.491 --> 00:37:03.990
marriages are usually a business propositions.
Uh,

554
00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:08.360
it is,
uh,
it is a kind of emotion and that uh,
uh,

555
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.390
potentially violence,
in fact,
they had effort is what should,

556
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.700
what is the sociology of love?

557
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:19.050
Can a noble man fall in love with a Caribbean woman?

558
00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.040
Can a noble woman fall in love with a Plebeian man?

559
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.400
So it's a real sort of arrangement about what love can be.

560
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:28.320
And yet they also describe it.

561
00:37:28.321 --> 00:37:33.030
They always describe it as the experience that causes

562
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:39.860
insomnia,
loss of appetite.
The lover turns,

563
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.960
pay and can speak in the presence of the beloved.

564
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.500
They go on describing the physical properties of love.

565
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.940
The other Greek revolution about love is what is contained in this text.

566
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:54.150
He's not the only one that is not the only one to have brought her about.

567
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:59.100
He's teachers and people that they like to read or cover canteen when it

568
00:37:59.101 --> 00:38:01.110
certainly we're going to the same direction.

569
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:06.260
Namely that love has to be explored for the changes it brings to the mind.

570
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.700
How can it be,
this is a kind of problem that they raise.

571
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:17.030
How can it be that I see a woman and the image of that woman obsesses me?

572
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.840
What is it about my mind?
Why do I want to be better than I am?

573
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.370
How am I going to be educated?
But in the height of the light,

574
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:30.880
in the light of the love that I feel for this woman and an effective,

575
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:35.900
this kind of metaphysical aspect of love is the special burden of,

576
00:38:36.611 --> 00:38:41.200
uh,
of this text.
Let me just give you an idea.
Uh,
it happens,
uh,

577
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.660
the first time that this happens,
uh,

578
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.200
is exactly where the famous poem that I mentioned to you.

579
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.430
That is the turning point.
Uh,
chapter 19.
Uh,

580
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.980
let me just read this paragraph.

581
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:57.520
This is a turning point in Dante's understanding of what love is.

582
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Then it happened that while walking down the path along,

583
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:08.950
which ran a very clear stream,
we guess,
but it's the iron river,

584
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:12.100
he would say he's not interested in the outside world,

585
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:16.960
is only interested in what love does to his inner self,
to the story of his mind.

586
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:22.290
I suddenly felt a great desire to write a poem and I began to think how to go

587
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:26.890
about it.
What an extraordinary moment.
Finally,

588
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:31.480
he's not just jotting down words that come to him.
He's just thinking,

589
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:36.830
this isn't all just about a self that is desiring or willing or unwilling and

590
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:39.640
who lives that kind of strange world.
Oh,

591
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:42.970
it's a good thing that things are happening to me because I can't help it.

592
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.960
You know,
I can,
I can give up my whole,
uh,

593
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:50.470
I can give up my whole exercise of what I can do,

594
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.650
the sense of purpose about what,
what,
what is happening,

595
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:58.690
changing will into,
into a rational,
uh,

596
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.920
activity.
Now he starts thinking and that began to think I would go about it.

597
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:08.130
It seemed to me that to speak of my lady would not be becoming unless I were to

598
00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:12.190
address my words to ladies and not just to any ladies,

599
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.580
but only to those who are worthy,
not merely to women.

600
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.800
Then I must tell you my tongue is not out of it.
Yet,

601
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:25.860
as if moved of its own accord spoken said ladies who have actually,

602
00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:29.080
he says,

603
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.080
women who have intelligence of love with great delight and decided to keep this

604
00:40:34.271 --> 00:40:36.820
words in mind and to use them.
At the beginning of my poem,

605
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.380
later after returning to the aforementioned city reflecting for several days,

606
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.050
I began writing a console and get song,

607
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:49.290
which for Dante's than the no blues form of a rhetorical form and using this

608
00:40:49.991 --> 00:40:54.991
beginning and they're constructed it to our in a way that will appear below and

609
00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:57.550
it's division that can solve it begins with ladies who have,

610
00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.010
who have ladies with intelligence who love.

611
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:05.020
I wish to speak to you about my lady not thinking to complete her literally,

612
00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:10.030
but talk in order to relieve my heart,
not thinking to complete her praise.

613
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.410
Praise,
uh,
it's a potent of praise.

614
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.580
Therefore religious,
kind of a very close to religious poems.
As you know,

615
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.080
there are so called Lao,

616
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:23.200
this laudatory we say in English to come back to this too,

617
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.890
to give you a essence of what this kind of poems can be,

618
00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:32.110
the praise which he would like to ask to distinguish from flattery.

619
00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.273
You know,
there's a,

620
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:37.850
between a prey praising someone and flattering someone praising,

621
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:38.900
uh,

622
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:43.340
you really going to expect anything in return you praising and it's a kind of

623
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:48.110
sense that you are just trying to describe and yielding to the Lord and the

624
00:41:48.111 --> 00:41:50.180
power what,
what is in front of you.

625
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:55.300
Flattery always imply some kind of a circuitous and some sorts of desire to get

626
00:41:56.151 --> 00:41:59.900
something you flatter.
It's a rhetorical,
rhetorical form.

627
00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:03.800
You flatter because it implies a sold some degree of manipulation.

628
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:09.130
But the most important word it is women who have intellect of love,

629
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.080
intellect.
Finally,

630
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:17.140
intellect and love are not too disjointed activities of the mind.

631
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:20.390
It's not what we do.
Cover.

632
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:25.391
Canty who really believes in parts really believes in a world which is sundered.

633
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:30.270
One from the other in a fragmentary world was come to that in in fairness,

634
00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:35.120
10 who really thinks that time is all fragmented from itself anyway,

635
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:39.350
experiences are all fragmentary.
That love.
If I have a passionate,

636
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:42.660
I can never quite come to understand anything.
In fact,

637
00:42:42.661 --> 00:42:46.760
when I am in the throes of passion,
my mind seasons,
its operations.

638
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:52.120
This poem is written against Dantes best friends to whom this Texas dedicated.

639
00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.400
And so we are forced to think,
and we'll go back with this appointment a moment,

640
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:03.550
but let me make a brief digression about the relationship between friendship and

641
00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:09.380
love to extraordinary extraordinary

642
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.170
virtues.
We call them passions,
but they're also virtuous.

643
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:19.910
Is there anything better than friendship?
Is Anything better than love?

644
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.100
But Dante says comprehensive.

645
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:26.270
This is the part of the radical way of Dante's thinking.
He brings her,

646
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:30.140
brings us to a point where you really have to distinguish between things that

647
00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:34.820
seem to be equally powerful.
Virtuals and what is friendship?
Well,

648
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:37.700
the Friday that the Texas dedicated to widow Kabaka,

649
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:42.500
which means that friendship implies a conversation,
a conversation of mines.

650
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:47.900
The word conversation was,
you know in Latin means things turning together.

651
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:51.230
That's why I did mines.
When you are conversing,

652
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:56.210
minds are turning together in some kind of harmonious turning,

653
00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:01.510
looking for some common agreements and there is a sort of benevolence in pride

654
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:06.710
in friendship that presupposes even the I the the where you are going to find we

655
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:10.160
are going up not only its benevolence is the condition for friendship.

656
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:11.770
It's really the point of arrival.

657
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.840
We've got to like each other even more after we discuss.

658
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:18.440
We disagree but we are doing it benevolently that's,

659
00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:23.330
that's the gift of friendship.
It's a virtue in the ethics of Aristotle.

660
00:44:23.331 --> 00:44:27.830
It's counter this one of the major virtues and so that's Dante in his own

661
00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:31.190
rewriting of the ethics of our stove,
which is the banquet.

662
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.220
But laugh for Dante here is more important than friendship and it's more

663
00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:44.031
important for friendship because it forces you to think,

664
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:50.270
it forces you to think something happens to you and that mobilizes your mind.

665
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.370
You got to go looking for the science of love.

666
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:56.520
You tried to look for are what all sides,

667
00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:01.090
what kind of sign is my beloved sending to me are et cetera.

668
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:06.380
The mind is engaged in an extended self mode of self reflection.

669
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:12.690
So intellect and love now low together.
That's the evolution.

670
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:16.260
When we go back to the theme that I had been with,
which I started,

671
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.850
this is the beginning of the so called sweet new style,

672
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:26.030
that kind of poetry that the Tuscans right and which is a sort of rethinking of

673
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:29.850
what the province,
our ports were doing.
The province,

674
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:34.851
our poets are writing poetry in the mold of I tremble under shade and the uh,

675
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.180
the image of the beloved.
I cannot even tell anybody.

676
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:43.470
I have to keep my passion away from the flatterers because they are going to

677
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:47.040
violate my secret.
And so I'll have to always protect this.

678
00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:49.470
I have to protect the identity of their beloved.

679
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:53.970
He wrestles with singularity and uniqueness to this passion.

680
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.820
The tusk and poet Dante Cavalcanti we need,
sadly,

681
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.740
they come on,
they come along and say,
no,
no.

682
00:46:01.741 --> 00:46:06.330
What matters is that love and become part of intellectual experience and

683
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:11.331
intellectual assent and knowledge only favors love and love mobilizes the mind

684
00:46:13.591 --> 00:46:15.150
to go on thinking.
See,

685
00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.560
I really don't want to to say too much now because we have so much time ahead of

686
00:46:22.671 --> 00:46:27.030
us.
The great debate,
philosophical debates,

687
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:32.010
the 13th century is always the forest between the so called voluntourists

688
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:36.330
irrational wrists.
Very simple,
don't.

689
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:41.390
So the volunteers are those who believe that if I want to know something,

690
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:47.270
I have to love first to love is crucial to my knowledge.

691
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:49.800
If I uh,
you know,

692
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.480
probably you remember well from your own early Jews when some of you would be

693
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.590
interested in and the boy or the boy and the girl,

694
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.580
someone would say,
Oh,
you really love that person.
What do you mean?

695
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:09.650
I don't even know him.
I don't even know her.
That's really issue.

696
00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:15.340
If you love so that you may know that's the position of the voluntourists.

697
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.860
No,
no.
Others would say you have to know first a no,
the,

698
00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:23.700
you may love and they said they're fierce debates.
Dante,

699
00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:27.420
circumventing all of us intellect and love.

700
00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:32.730
I like the two feet that carry us along and you move one and you move the other.

701
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:38.670
And only this work in your walk without being hobbled as he will be later when

702
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:43.870
he starts in fan.
So this is the great change what you call the sweet new style.

703
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.320
And the sweet new style means therefore a highly philosophical,

704
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:51.340
highly intellectual kind of poetry and poetry where the woman or the level of a

705
00:47:51.341 --> 00:47:55.330
woman can take you up to the divinity,
love through love.

706
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:59.890
And the understanding that that which rules the world is not just an idea,

707
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.490
it's just rough and therefore love is the only way of coming to it.
And,
and,

708
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:08.830
and for showing it.
Uh,
and some examples of this kind of,
um,

709
00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:12.700
of uh,
experience will,

710
00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:17.240
will happen very soon or one to,
um,
uh,

711
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.150
I want to mention this great poem,
uh,

712
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:26.320
that he,
he describes this little sourness,
what he,
he,

713
00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:30.620
which also,
uh,
which sorts of,
uh,

714
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:35.200
pursues immediately after chapter 20.
Uh,
let's look at the sonnets.

715
00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:36.663
The

716
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:41.470
after this consona had become.

717
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:45.790
This comes on about women who have intellect of love have become rather well

718
00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:46.624
known.

719
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:51.010
One of my friends who had heard it was moved to ask me to write about the nature

720
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:54.680
of love.
That's not what he forget about the,

721
00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.840
the experiences about being sleepless.

722
00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.300
Dante starts as a province or poet.

723
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.980
He's now refining the idea and wants to think about the nature of love,

724
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:11.260
philosophical idea about love having without losing sight of Beatrice,

725
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:15.490
having perhaps from reading my poem acquired more confidence in me than I

726
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:19.240
deserve.
So thinking that after my treatment to the previous team,

727
00:49:19.241 --> 00:49:22.720
it would be good to treat the theme of love and feeling that I old them to my

728
00:49:22.721 --> 00:49:27.130
friend.
I decided to compose a poem.
Dealing with love is,
I wrote this note,

729
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:32.131
which begins love in the gracious heart or a single thing.

730
00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:34.420
It's when it's sadly,

731
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.480
we with another poet of the sweetness is the father of the sweet new styles

732
00:49:40.001 --> 00:49:41.560
tells us in his poem,

733
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:46.270
one can no more be without the other than can be reasoning mind without its

734
00:49:46.271 --> 00:49:50.080
recent nature.
When he loves moons creates them,
etc. Etc.

735
00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.330
So this is the shift now,

736
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:56.230
the full awareness that learning about love,

737
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.890
Dante scanned through the school of the philosophers,

738
00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:00.160
you know that to learn about this,

739
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:05.580
this means that this whole text really is traversed by two interrelated themes.

740
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.500
Two stories,

741
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:15.340
two thematic strains running through.

742
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.180
One is the store over love for Beatrice.

743
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:24.880
Dantes love for Beatrice and way of understanding what love is.
Is it,
is it,

744
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:28.820
is it uh,
uh,
uh,
physical impulse?

745
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.050
Is it a demon?
Is it a figure of speech?

746
00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.300
Is it a simulacrum,
another fiction that we tell each other or not?

747
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:40.910
And he goes home learning about this.

748
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:46.510
The harder thematic strain of this text has to do with learning to be a poet.

749
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.710
Dante is toso telling us the story of his poetic growth,

750
00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:59.510
how he begins imitating the province are poets imitating now the pores of the

751
00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:00.440
suite and your style.

752
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:05.680
And finally finding his voice and how the two themes really shed light on each

753
00:51:05.901 --> 00:51:08.570
other.
Because I can only understand this about love.

754
00:51:08.571 --> 00:51:11.690
And if I understand really things about love and not Rios is understood,

755
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.180
I can really go on writing about the poem,
about the,

756
00:51:15.181 --> 00:51:19.850
of writing poems that nobody else can go right in,
which is a famous promise,

757
00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.710
the hope expresses in chapter 42 and the fucking own writing about love in a way

758
00:51:24.711 --> 00:51:26.060
that nobody else has ever written.

759
00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:31.180
It means that I understand love more than others have understood and that any

760
00:51:31.911 --> 00:51:36.140
rate,
the great poem that he starts riding when he's in a sense even,

761
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:41.780
uh,
in,
uh,
in,
in,
in a kind of a,
um,

762
00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:47.000
a rivalry with,
uh,
with,
uh,
um,
with,

763
00:51:47.001 --> 00:51:51.560
with,
with,
it certainly appears in the force on,

764
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:53.380
at the stars.
Um,

765
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:58.310
here I could mention 20,
uh,

766
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:00.560
21 are the power of love.

767
00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.220
Born in my lady's eyes were now it's normally about the nature of love,

768
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:09.200
but he goes on trying to find love within Beatrice.

769
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.550
It's not the god of love that has been abandoned.
It's not a conceit of love.

770
00:52:13.551 --> 00:52:13.851
It's not,

771
00:52:13.851 --> 00:52:17.600
the words is strange and a dramatic words of love that have come to him from

772
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:18.830
Oracle's and traditions.

773
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:24.070
Now that is love is love for the concreteness of Beatrice herself.

774
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:29.410
As I said earlier,
very much in passing,
uh,

775
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:33.700
the text,
uh,
uh,
an extraordinary sonnet.

776
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:38.810
I read,
I read an Italian,
a couple of lines,
a few lines,

777
00:52:38.811 --> 00:52:43.510
so you can,
you can,
you can hear the sound of this,
this,

778
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:47.390
this poem.
Chapter 26,
this is about Beatrice,

779
00:52:47.391 --> 00:52:48.870
the apparition of Beatrice.

780
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:54.370
She calls by through the streets and the world is silent.

781
00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:58.610
We'll force silence is a kind of general oppression,

782
00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:02.120
but also she's wrapped in a kind of mystery.

783
00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:07.130
And in an op inapproachable light,
there's always some kind of distance.

784
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.990
This is the poem,
such sweet the courtroom.
Uh,
page 57 of this edition,

785
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.330
Chapter 26 in such a gentle grace at 10,

786
00:53:15.331 --> 00:53:20.300
my ladies greeting as she moves the lips can only tremble into silence and nice.

787
00:53:20.301 --> 00:53:21.690
They're not attempt the case,

788
00:53:21.691 --> 00:53:26.691
her moving benign recruited in humility and touched by all the praise along the

789
00:53:26.821 --> 00:53:30.180
way.
She seems to be a creature come from heaven to earth,

790
00:53:30.181 --> 00:53:32.010
manifest a miracle.

791
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:37.070
So we are now Dante peers as this a poet who carries because of love,

792
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:43.750
heaven and earth mixed up in his head.
Um,

793
00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:48.800
Beatrice brings heaven down to Earth and asks of him that he can rise up to

794
00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:54.540
have,
these are the words in Italian.
Listen to their petitions,
the sounds,

795
00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:56.940
the n sound,
Dan,

796
00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:01.970
to Genteel a Tom Harness the power [inaudible] when they love through,

797
00:54:02.971 --> 00:54:04.490
we salute your new lingo.

798
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:09.450
The van [inaudible] Muhtar at York [inaudible] and Siva,

799
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:14.130
centennial,
Shilo,
God and source of prey.
Only praise can come,

800
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.350
uh,
toward,
uh,
in,
in,
in her direction.
And finally,

801
00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:22.080
how does he really,

802
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:26.640
how does Dante really get out of this sense of work?
Uh,

803
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.800
constant wonder.

804
00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:34.130
Cause that's a poem about wonder to Beatrice appears and it's a miracle wonder.

805
00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.660
And that's,
and that's how you start thinking.

806
00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:39.800
As soon as you believe that what you perceive is a wonder,
the urine,

807
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:44.200
quite understand.
You want to go on trying to understand it.
Now that's the state,

808
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:48.660
that's the heart of the effort of reflection,
right?
Um,

809
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:55.070
so this is kind of a sense of constant perplexity great excitement at the you

810
00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.070
will be.
It is not.
Beatrice has died.

811
00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:04.300
Her death appears around chapter 29.
Uh,

812
00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.260
how real can she be now that she said,
well,

813
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.550
how are you going to relate to someone who is dead and none too,
we'll do that,

814
00:55:11.551 --> 00:55:14.730
which probably some others can go do.

815
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:19.470
We tried to find a replacement and we'll go looking for someone who looks

816
00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:24.471
exactly like her or reminds him of her and then find this chapter 32 33 34,

817
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:31.830
this woman who has a lot of so much mercy,
sense of mercy for him,

818
00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:35.480
that he's very drawn to her and he understands that in the measuring,

819
00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:37.440
which he tries to duplicate Beatrice,

820
00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.740
then their love for Beatrice was not really singular that his own project was at

821
00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:46.944
stake here.

822
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:51.390
Either you believe in the singularity of the figure you love or if you believe

823
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:52.410
in the duplication,

824
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.700
then you are undercutting your own project.

825
00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:01.880
So he's caught in all this drama's till finally sees some pilgrims and this is

826
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:04.590
really the great direction.
And with this,

827
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.420
I will stop and see if there are some questions.
See,
uh,

828
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:12.660
chapter 40 some pilgrims,
you know,
that uh,
um,
pilgrimages.

829
00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:17.160
It used to go to Santiago de Compostela as they do now.

830
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:21.780
Then I used to go the famous from the north of Europe,

831
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:24.010
the so called they,
we've got two generalists on it.

832
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.830
They will go to the via Frankie,

833
00:56:25.831 --> 00:56:30.220
Jenna as it is cold that goes from the north following a particular path or to

834
00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:34.590
Rome.
And he sees some pilgrims are going deco.
Romae.
Uh,

835
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:39.950
there he see some pilgrims going to Rome and this is the poem he writes.

836
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:45.640
Uh,
and this is extraordinary poem.
Ah,
pilgrims.
He addresses them.

837
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:49.720
They don't listen to him.
They know nothing about him.

838
00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:54.930
He addresses them moving pensively along thinking perhaps of things at home.

839
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.083
You Miss.

840
00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:03.640
Could the land you come from be so far away as anyone might guess from your

841
00:57:03.641 --> 00:57:08.641
appearance that you show no sign of grief as you pass through the middle of the

842
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:09.940
desolated city.

843
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:15.300
This is phrase and normally is used for Jerusalem.
Desolate.

844
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:18.460
We abandoned city.
This is foreign stock.

845
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:23.470
Like people who seem not to understand the grievous way to wool,
it has to bear.

846
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:26.500
If you'd stop to listen to me speak,

847
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:31.860
I know from what my sign heart tells me you would be weeping when you leave.

848
00:57:32.441 --> 00:57:35.890
This place lost is the city source of blessedness.

849
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:41.140
And they're not words that could be said of her with power to humble any man to

850
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:42.640
tears.
This is,

851
00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:47.710
it's really another great shift in the movement of the poem.

852
00:57:47.711 --> 00:57:52.711
He sees pilgrims who are going somewhere and he realizes that he's not like

853
00:57:55.211 --> 00:57:56.830
them.
He's not going anywhere.

854
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.280
He is moving and circles and if you move in circles you get nowhere.

855
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:08.930
Now is something happens around him that will uh,

856
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:14.130
in many ways shake him from that kind of circular self absorption in which he

857
00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:16.420
finds himself.

858
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:21.040
And the second thing is that he understands this is an extraordinary poem.

859
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:25.370
We did it again for yourself.
So you have a chance.
He says,

860
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:30.480
he understands that for me theology has been constructed about Beatrice is an

861
00:58:31.751 --> 00:58:35.830
absolutely private mythology.
It means nothing to anybody else.

862
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000
You who come from afar and he's like them because he too is or they are.

863
00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:45.730
They are separated.
Pensively a word that implies suspension,

864
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:49.300
the same word to think and to be suspended.

865
00:58:49.301 --> 00:58:54.190
It's the same etymology in Latin,
right?
They are the they're,

866
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.190
they're halfway there.
Here now going through Florence,

867
00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:01.990
going somewhere to a destination and nostalgically separated from the world.

868
00:59:01.991 --> 00:59:05.320
The left behind and Nantais two is not going anywhere,

869
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:09.460
but he doesn't have Beatrice with him and has no idea of where he is though I

870
00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:13.780
like the pilgrims where to go above all this.

871
00:59:13.781 --> 00:59:15.610
If I were to tell you anything,

872
00:59:15.790 --> 00:59:19.990
you would understand that this is a this or a density by you do not know and

873
00:59:19.991 --> 00:59:24.560
implication is you not care.
My mythology is private.

874
00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:30.040
The effort I have to make is to transform my private mythology into public

875
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:31.843
discourse.

876
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:36.350
This is the transition from the Vita Nuova to the divine comedy.

877
00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:40.040
The divine comedy would be a text where finally Dante,

878
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:41.840
we'll go on literally,

879
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:47.050
he attract theatricalizing literary staging his own passion through the passions

880
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:51.500
of others,
involving all others in his discourse,

881
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:55.400
in creating what I would call a public mythology.

882
00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:59.210
So this is really the most important moment and that which ends with another

883
00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:00.200
journey of the mind,

884
01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:05.201
that who will make the next one beyond the sphere that makes the wider round

885
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:10.100
passes the Cya reason for my heart and your intelligence and love and tears and

886
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:11.570
Doug with the surgeon it on high,

887
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:16.780
etc. Here he sees beauty is far away and decides to undertake his journey,

888
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:21.320
the journey of knowledge,
the journey of exploration,
of the journey,

889
01:00:21.321 --> 01:00:22.620
which will be,
uh,

890
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:27.080
which is the journey of life and which is the journey that we'll be at the heart

891
01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:29.250
of the,
uh,

892
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.650
comedy or the divine comedy with which we start next time.
Um,

893
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:38.930
so this is really,
this is the kind of,
uh,
uh,
experience,

894
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:43.820
poetic experience that Dante,
we'll,
uh,
we'll go on.

895
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.240
Uh,
uh,
at the start.
It's still a young man.
Um,
uh,

896
01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.790
he's exploring a lot of personality.
He's gathering all the voices around him,

897
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.950
but he internalizes them.
There are no,
it's not,

898
01:00:56.010 --> 01:01:01.010
it's still the kind of encyclopedic text that the divine comedy will necessarily

899
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:05.290
be what he has to involve all these courses or whispers or,

900
01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.220
or groans whole noises.
Uh,
the whole world is to speak through his port.

901
01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:12.810
Oh,
that's part of,
uh,
uh,
uh,

902
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:17.900
the most inclusive vision rather than excluding anything that this is a time is,

903
01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:23.310
is it an effort to try to find himself as a port with a project.

904
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.660
And that project will be necessarily a project in the future.

905
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.290
There is no port that I know in the western tradition,

906
01:01:30.291 --> 01:01:35.291
which is so given to the ideal of the future and who is more of a poet of hope.

907
01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.220
Then Dante is,

908
01:01:37.221 --> 01:01:40.760
I call him a lot of things and that we'll call him a lot of things are call him

909
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:44.900
the,
the,
the poet of exile,
which he is,
I call him the point of love,

910
01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:49.100
which is I call him the port of peace,
which he is,
there's any Renick,

911
01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.800
uh,
thrust underneath his whole,
uh,

912
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:55.270
even his polemics fierce polemic.
Uh,

913
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.740
but above all and now from now,

914
01:01:57.741 --> 01:02:02.741
he appears as the poet of hope in the knowledge that hope is the most realistic

915
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:08.470
of virtues because it tells us that the past nor even a past may be dead.

916
01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.680
That really despair is the most crucial our sin that one could have English in

917
01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.040
this universe.

918
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:24.060
Belief is to say that things are over and done with damper says,

919
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.380
I'm not done yet.

920
01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:28.110
I still have a project that can even begin to tell you about it.

921
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:31.500
But let me stop now because I have other things to do.

922
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:35.580
That's the substance of his poem.
And in this sense,
it's a preamble,

923
01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.580
a preparation for the the 30 comedy.

924
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:41.860
And since I'm trying to give you a sense of dentist,

925
01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:46.890
own life is a fresh and bone kind of guy that he was,
uh,

926
01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:51.420
what happens after this?
So Paul Beatrice has died literally 1289.

927
01:02:51.421 --> 01:02:56.070
She dies.
Dante now is married.
Mary's,
uh,

928
01:02:56.510 --> 01:03:00.470
uh,
a woman who will never mention,
um,
um,

929
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:04.620
the belongs to him,
a decent family and not in a,
in Florence,

930
01:03:04.621 --> 01:03:09.440
the Donati troublemakers and [inaudible] like,
uh,
uh,

931
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.950
and Dante.
We'll enter public life and this public life,

932
01:03:13.951 --> 01:03:18.540
which also means that he will have a great interruption to his intellectual.

933
01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:23.310
And it is intellectual pursuits till in 1302,

934
01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:27.320
as I probably remember,
I mentioned his,

935
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:32.390
his banned from Florence has to go into exile and once he's in exile and his

936
01:03:33.601 --> 01:03:38.070
production or start again,
start writing about the language,

937
01:03:38.071 --> 01:03:41.430
the theory of language,
the first treatise on language in the Western world.

938
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:46.080
Did I text the VA of,
of,
uh,
ethics,
which is the banquet.

939
01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:46.950
Uh,

940
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:51.430
and then the divine comedy will begin next time or find them in the middle of

941
01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:55.170
the,
his,
his journey,
which is Ken top one.

942
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:59.850
But since we have a few minutes,
uh,
who have questions,

943
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.410
oh,
I said a lot of things.
I hope it was a,

944
01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.580
I go back to some of these things.
So,
oh,
questions.

945
01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:21.220
<v 1>Well,
this is not exactly about your lectures about the texts.
Um,</v>

946
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:26.500
do do you recommend that we go is civic texts that you recommend on the syllabus

947
01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.440
or I already own the Mandelbaum translation.

948
01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.080
Is that usable for this course as well?

949
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.880
<v 0>Yes.
The question is,</v>

950
01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.990
do I recommend that the students stick to the texts that I mentioned in the

951
01:04:39.991 --> 01:04:44.640
syllabus or can they go and using other texts such as Munda bumps,
translation.

952
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:49.680
And the answer is yes,
you can.
Uh,
it's a very good,
uh,
Munda bombs.

953
01:04:49.681 --> 01:04:51.480
Translation is a very good translation.

954
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:56.700
I don't use it for one simple reason because he said,

955
01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:59.720
dear friend of mine,
he probably will hear me now.

956
01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:04.730
Everything will be all record poets have a weakness when they translated dude

957
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:09.780
out of great love for the Texas.
But the Dar this idea,
look at this,

958
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:12.030
I can do little one better.

959
01:05:12.031 --> 01:05:17.031
I didn't even banter and he lapses into that and have told them I'm more than

960
01:05:18.371 --> 01:05:19.090
once.

961
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:24.090
I like this a unpretentious translation by Saint Claire Pros.

962
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:29.050
Sometimes it's wrong.
I will tell you when he does his blatantly wrong.
Uh,

963
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.080
but you can use Mandelbaum or if you have single term or you have darling and

964
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.050
Martinez or if you have a actual,

965
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:42.900
which I think is really better than all of these Hollander's Robert Hollander,

966
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:46.280
uh,
actually translation is by his wife Jean.
Uh,

967
01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:49.380
so that you can use any translation you want.

968
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:54.460
They are not really all that different from each other.
It's usually the sound.

969
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:59.110
And of course Manda bomb as a poet,
as a sense of the rhythm in English.

970
01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.790
Ah,
absolutely.

971
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:03.543
<v 2>Yes.</v>

972
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:10.680
Love as a process of acquiring knowledge is different or better than friendship

973
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:12.010
or like the harmonious,

974
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:17.880
<v 0>yeah,
the question is very good.
First of all,
and this,
uh,</v>

975
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:22.570
why should I make a claim that love is a process of knowledge is better than

976
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:23.404
friendship,

977
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:28.000
which are singling out that which is one of the dramas of the Vita Nuova book

978
01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:31.480
dedicated to our [inaudible] to his best friend.

979
01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.470
We talk up content and yet it's about Beatrice.
And when Kaaba can't appears,

980
01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:40.390
he says,
forget about love.
Uh,
just,
you know,
turn to philosophy,
uh,

981
01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:45.270
and the Sauna Ted is very well known and that I quote in some piece Hurghada Ah,

982
01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.570
so there is a tension between the two of love and friendship and we agree and

983
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:52.720
you seem to be agreeing with the very generic,

984
01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:55.810
not unusual or the scripture that I make of friendship.

985
01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:59.990
A friendship is really the language of philosophers,
right?
Uh,

986
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:05.130
philosophers who are get together and believe in thought and believe also that,

987
01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:07.870
you know,
friendship is a great virtual,

988
01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:13.360
there's a lot of dramas within friendship and in,
in,
uh,
in,
in,
in literature,

989
01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.430
friendships I and 12 do each other.
I'm a better friend than u s to me.

990
01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.070
Uh,
I'm a better friend to you than you are to me.

991
01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.170
As soon as you talk about that kind of rivalry,

992
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.000
you realize that passions also are getting to that process.

993
01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.650
But I would say that Dante,

994
01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:34.420
I understand that to imply here that love is better than friendship.

995
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:38.290
Exactly.
Because it forces,

996
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:43.530
it does violence on our ways of thinking because it forces us never to take

997
01:07:46.451 --> 01:07:50.980
anything for granted and in and of itself.
Because listen,

998
01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:54.850
this is moving be some things that you find very romantic.

999
01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.840
People can find very romantic.
The idea that a love,

1000
01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:04.480
y'all going to be surprised by what the science of Lavar and you bleed with this

1001
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.750
of the 80 of love.
Whereas in friendship,

1002
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.980
you really have a sort of the clarity of an exchange in love.

1003
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:16.800
You're going to have the secret science that lovers can give a charter.

1004
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.000
To me,
a great texts that may be Dante.

1005
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:24.100
I'm sure Dante red is really all very difficult and read over.
It's the stories,

1006
01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:26.640
great stories,
but at the story of Pyramids and Bay,

1007
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:32.020
I an old lovers who can see the smallest stuff chink in the war through which to

1008
01:08:32.721 --> 01:08:36.230
communicate and old inventing this that comes with,
in a sense,

1009
01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:40.160
it's really with the idea that love can urge,

1010
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:41.510
can I say,

1011
01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:46.840
can force us to think about in ways that we could never really imagine because

1012
01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.570
it is tied to the imagination.
Okay.

1013
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.960
That's what I would say are the questions.

1014
01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.620
Okay.
I think that that's it.

1015
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:08.650
