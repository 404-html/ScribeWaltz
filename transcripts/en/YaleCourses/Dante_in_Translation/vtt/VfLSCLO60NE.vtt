WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.020
We'll continue the discussion we left open last,

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.240
last time.
Remember,

3
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:14.241
we are all saying a few things about Ulysses.

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.913
Uh,

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.320
the overarching question of my remarks and your questions actually took my

6
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:29.770
remark in a,
in a,
in,
in a different and sometimes deeper,
uh,

7
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.720
direction than I had intended,
um,

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.420
is the whole issue of Ulysses.
But around Ulysses,

9
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.160
uh,
Dante's reading of,
uh,
uh,

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.540
what we call the Hellenic world,
uh,

11
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.150
and I'm Ulysses.
Ulysses is,
um,

12
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.410
appears in Canto 26,
uh,

13
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.370
with Diomede who is silent.
He races,
uh,

14
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.370
polio,
Tropic Intelligence of Classic Rock Antiquity,

15
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
the crafty,
um,
mind he's a,

16
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.930
he appears as a philosopher but also is a rhetorician.
And at the same,

17
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:17.931
and this is exactly the kind of complicity between the two modes that,

18
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.050
that,
uh,
Dante wants to explore.
Uh,

19
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.450
but let me continue with this overarching theme.

20
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:28.710
The overarching theme is the reading of a,
of the Greek,

21
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.790
the Greek world.

22
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.820
You remember that we saw a theocracy in Polynesia that clearly for Dante is a

23
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.970
knowledge which is filtered through,
uh,

24
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.060
a Greek Roman port stages who was born and lived in a Greek Roman city,

25
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.140
Naples.
Uh,
so he's,

26
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.680
he's discussing through a t is important is the whole story of feeds.
Uh,

27
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.840
the,
the,
the two brothers who are enemies,
the enemies brothers.

28
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.550
And if for the tragic history,

29
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.560
the tragic not have a fever and a mythology that this Diomede who is,

30
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.110
uh,
who is silent and,
but above all,

31
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:13.690
the focus of the Canto falls on the,

32
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.720
the greatness of this hero Unisis who are repeat plays a pivotal role in Dante's

33
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:24.670
imagination is paradigm is a paradigmatic role.

34
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.820
Dante can quite get enough of him,
nor can he get over,

35
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.810
uh,
the,
the,
the fantastic of Ulysses.

36
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:38.811
Ulysses literally appears in his dreams in Canton 19 of Purgatorio.

37
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.080
And then you list as will also appear when Dante is to measure the great

38
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:45.150
imaginative distance that he traveled,

39
00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:49.700
that when he's at the border of the physical and the metaphysical worlds,
uh,

40
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.180
he looks back and he will see a Ulysses,
uh,
oh,
he remember.

41
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:58.920
He will see the place which has been the place of Ulysses transgression because

42
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.330
is apparently Julisa sin.

43
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.630
Use a sentence to have councils counseled his companions to go beyond the,

44
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.540
our boundaries of knowledge.
This is a,

45
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.010
so it's the effects of counseling.

46
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.760
Let me just say one thing that for Dante is no figure,
which is more interesting,

47
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.800
more important,

48
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.340
more full of for whom he has so many questions than the figure of the council.

49
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.680
The council was of course,
be of the Levenia.
How does he advice,

50
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.640
how does he take the pressure or he's the secretary,
the council,

51
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.560
how does he take the pressure of the court?
What does he council,
uh,

52
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.470
Frederick the great his emperor with?

53
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.740
And then we're going to see other councils we're going to find very soon,

54
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.930
later today,
uh,
province,

55
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:54.220
our port who literally advisors war between father and son.

56
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.500
He divides farther from Santa,

57
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.430
he breaches the unity of the body politic.
And then we'll come to that in,
in,

58
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.320
in fairness,
uh,
28.
So well you list,

59
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:08.110
this is the council who he gives the wrong counsel to his companions.

60
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.780
He makes rhetorical promises,

61
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.610
which he knows he cannot quite keep their grand questions.
But,
uh,

62
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.960
what questions does he,
does he pass on to this companions?

63
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.220
What he says is,
uh,
uh,
after the captivity,

64
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.700
after they're being in bondage to sin,

65
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.320
he wants to reform them.

66
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.360
The companions who was Yuna according to the story that Dante may have read in

67
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:39.190
medieval accounts with resist,
had been metamorphosed into hogs,
into pigs,

68
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:40.300
into a PQ regions,

69
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.570
had yielded to the pleasures of a sensual,

70
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.920
uh,
happiness,
essential understanding of happiness.
And he says,
you were not made.

71
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.830
This is where he,
the speech that he makes to his companions,

72
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.100
you are not made to live as beasts and allusion to Cersei,

73
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.420
to sources,
metamorphosis,
but to pursue,

74
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.400
to follow virtue and knowledge.
This is a grandiose,
uh,

75
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.270
advice that he gives.
And Randy also advice,
but,
uh,

76
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.720
which has one problem that Dante praises him.

77
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.940
And that's not necessarily the major problem.

78
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:20.941
He praises Ulysses and his companions as they are going to go beyond is they're

79
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:24.760
going beyond the pillars of Hercules.

80
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.780
It is as if Dante implies and seems to agree with,

81
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:31.690
if one were to read the trajectory of the divine comedy,

82
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.020
that there is no knowledge worthy of its name unless it is connected to some

83
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:43.741
degree of transgression that somehow transgression is part of knowing of an

84
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:46.440
original and new knowing your list.

85
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.450
This has to go beyond the limits of the known world in order to truly uncover,

86
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:54.020
discover something,
uh,

87
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.420
I new that nobody else knew that makes him as they used to say,

88
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.330
a renaissance figure.
Our let,
oh,
that's the way he's not.
And you know,
there's,

89
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.950
there's the famous joke of you listeners and then the graduate paper refers to

90
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:11.951
Ulysses as the great hero who is with a one foot firmly rooted in the Middle

91
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.480
Ages and the,
with the other one,
he salutes the rising sun of a,

92
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.540
the renaissance.
It's a little bit of a comical,
a account of Ulysses,

93
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.500
but it gives you a sense of how,
what the novelty that he,
he,
he represents.

94
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:28.380
So there is this,

95
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.410
this bit of a transgression that Dante doesn't seem to be a terribly bothered by

96
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:38.711
it since he himself and the different circumstances is engaged in exactly the

97
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:43.010
same kind of,
uh,
uh,
transgression of the perimeter.

98
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.420
The apparently the geographic that even the cosmic perimeter,

99
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:51.110
he goes beyond the son.
He's even,
he even goes farther then,

100
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.500
then Daedalus and certainly farther than Ecos.

101
00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.750
This other mythical coordinates with them.
How does Dante find out,

102
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.350
uh,

103
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:05.350
how does he want us to full now that somehow the promises Ulysses makes to his

104
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:07.190
companions,

105
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.460
he wants to lead them to virtual knowledge may really be a faulty promise.

106
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.280
And this is the,
I think the substance of a cancel,
Dante,

107
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.070
we'll refer to it with a famous metaphor,
is a mad flight.

108
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.160
Remember,
Ulysses recounts how they made a,

109
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:29.540
made flowers flight out of the oars mixing metaphors.
It's done.

110
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.760
They had done before the,
the,
the,

111
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:35.260
the maritime journey and the air journey.

112
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.200
This is the journey,
the flight of the mind,
the flight of the intellect,

113
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.070
as if were described by a Salem.
That Ulysses is a sailor.
What,
what,

114
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.330
what,
how does Dante,
uh,

115
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.780
make us aware that this is indeed there's madness in what you listen is,

116
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.550
is trying to accomplish very simply,
he puts him within a peculiar,

117
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:56.570
distinct,

118
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.550
at the distinct political or rhetorical context so that you really have to

119
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:05.630
wonder can he's really delivered his promises and what of the political

120
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:10.370
consequences of the promises that he makes.
The whole,

121
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.580
the whole came to 26 is literally littered with fallen cities from this one.

122
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.900
It begins with Troy a with,
I'm sorry,
Florence.

123
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.760
Dante has this apostrophe against the city of Florence.
Uh,
the city of thieves.

124
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.690
That's what he calls it,

125
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.930
spreading its wings as if we're also as if cities were like heroes engaged in

126
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:33.884
great flights.

127
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.720
There's a clear desire on Dante's parts to have us connect to the story of

128
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:43.010
Ulysses,
uh,
self,
uh,
uh,
degradation.

129
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.770
Turpitude with a story of a,
of a,
of Ulysses Florence's,

130
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.260
uh,
turpitude and Julissa's own fall.

131
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.290
Then there is a reference to the city of Troy foreign city.

132
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.330
There is a reference Thebes with theft with through a key localism.

133
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.160
Polynese are there is also reference to Rome.

134
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.370
This hit the Kanto is full of references to cities from this point of view can

135
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.020
to 26 is a version,

136
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.680
a brief version of the epic because the impulse of the epic is always political

137
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.500
noise.
No epic that you can think of which doesn't think about is not trying to

138
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:24.030
represent the,

139
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:29.090
either the are falling cities and the edification of new cities or for that

140
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:32.630
matter,
uh,
some locating I say take,

141
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.580
it could be in a great ran metaphysical drama.

142
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:40.460
I could be in the heavenly Jerusalem or,
uh,
it's uh,
it's,

143
00:09:40.461 --> 00:09:43.730
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's Rome,
it's car third.

144
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.240
It's Thebes falling cities and rising cities.
So,
uh,

145
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.300
this is what the,

146
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:54.120
the strategy of Dante Nantha strategists to show them how the grand

147
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:59.121
philosophical claims of Ulysses have effects that make it appear as empty

148
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.060
rhetoric.
He,
he down to praises Ulysses nowhere,

149
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.210
somewhere in the ocean without a particular place.

150
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:13.260
It goes from one city to another.
And at the same time,
because of this,

151
00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.640
he can never quite,

152
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.780
doesn't seem to be able to deliver on what he has promised.

153
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:24.110
It's a reflection on one particular aspect of the tragic story of Ulysses.

154
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.450
It's the tragedy of language,

155
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.780
a language that contains with itself all the most incredible Mirages and yet

156
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.480
fall short of reality.

157
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.430
You list this is literally placed in,
uh,
in the,
in the empathy ocean,

158
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.600
uh,
away from all responsibilities and all locations.

159
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.870
And it is this gratuitousness of his quest that also counts for,

160
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.730
uh,
his being in a,
uh,
in,
in,
in,

161
00:10:55.731 --> 00:11:00.600
in hell among the evil our counselors.
Um,
okay,

162
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.140
so this is what I was trying to tell you last time and I think that I have added

163
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:09.030
on today a few other details.
Uh,
but we can go back to that if,
uh,

164
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.860
uh,
if,
if there is to be a discussion and I hope there will be a little later.

165
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.650
Uh,

166
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:19.650
let me turn now to Canto 27,

167
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.090
which I really like to read in conjunction users should be read in conjunction

168
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.360
with Canto,
uh,
26,
because we,

169
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.530
here we have what I would call a counter myth two,

170
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.090
the story of Ulysses.
There is a contraction of focus.
Ah,
AH,

171
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.120
there's even a revision of the claims of epic grand jury that we have in Canto

172
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.081
26.

173
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:48.081
Dante meets and he's the one who become the interlocutor of Riedel.

174
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.770
The Montefeltro an extraordinary figure,
a political leader.

175
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.730
That's what he was,
who then experience the conversion.

176
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.970
He became a Franciscan friar.

177
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.970
And historically this is a historical figure.

178
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.160
Historically he's called in by the Pope Boniface,

179
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.200
the AA.
By now you know him.

180
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.500
He's not someone that Dante really holds in the highest esteem possible and he

181
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.040
bought one.

182
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.040
If it's the aid in an inversion of the relations between a priest and,

183
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.000
and uh,
um,

184
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.060
and cleric high priest and clinic asks Weeder da Montefeltro for some advice,

185
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.060
we are dealing again with evil counselors.

186
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.880
And the advice is the following.
You have to teach me you're a great man of arms.

187
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.490
You have to tell me what is,
what is,

188
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:47.491
what are the strategies I should pursue in order to conquer?

189
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.500
But it's three in a small town.

190
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.730
You may know there's a place where the origin of a great musician from there,

191
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:56.200
but a small town near row,

192
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.890
I want to conquer and destroy the city of Palestrina.

193
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.040
You tell me how I am to do this.

194
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.280
So we're really dealing with a machiavellian and machiavellian world of

195
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:12.910
counselors.
Uh,
uh,
for Machiavelli,
it's,

196
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.320
it's uh,
uh,
actually the language of Machiavelli.

197
00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:21.250
Ivan Milat Makaveli users takes the language.
I think that that uh,

198
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.390
a widow will,
you were with DePaul it for himself at one point.

199
00:13:25.391 --> 00:13:30.391
We dose as my works where those of a [inaudible] of a Fox and you remember these

200
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:37.681
are the two attributes or in the prince of Machiavelli that the man,

201
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.640
the,
the,
the perfect prince or to have others to say,
uh,

202
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:45.610
the perfect princess,
the one who knows how to use strength,

203
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.380
how to use also slyness.
You have to know when you have to be crafty and foxy.

204
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.820
You have to know when to be,

205
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:57.030
to be violent and lie on like two images that clearly originate from Cicero.

206
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.390
They are not done for his own invention,
but,

207
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:04.390
and it's likely that Machiavelli got them from,
uh,
from,

208
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.710
from Cicero as well as from uh,
uh,
this,
uh,
this canto,

209
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:13.000
the connections between the two cancers are several.

210
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.090
And let me just go,
uh,
first of all,

211
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:20.380
it begins cantor 27.
This is the Sicilian bull.

212
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:26.370
Clearly a counter to the Trojan horse of the previous canter's Sicilian bull,

213
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.900
which bellowed for the first time it was just with a cry of him would shaped it

214
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.740
with his file used to Belo with the voice of the victim.

215
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:40.060
So that low it was the brassy had seen pierced with pain.
That's etc. Uh,

216
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.000
what is the story?
It's exactly the same version in a said,

217
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.160
demotic vulgar version or the grade situation of what has happened to Ulysses.

218
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.680
Ulysses is condemned to be held prisoner in the flames and the two,

219
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.150
uh,
tongues of fire,

220
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.040
literally tongues of fire because here is a rhetorician the philosopher,

221
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:09.190
the neoplatonists who actually is a rhetorician trying to persuade others about

222
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.580
his,
his,
his ideas and managing and,
and,
and,
and,

223
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:19.760
and being a,
and being very,
um,
uh,

224
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.840
being very proud of this,
uh,
his success.
Uh,

225
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.120
but then we get caught by his own tongue.
It's homeless.

226
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.620
The temptation of the artist himself.

227
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:34.650
It's Daedalus who builds the labyrinth and gets caught paid.

228
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.410
It's the stone of the artist who becomes a captive of that which aims of,

229
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:40.244
is constructed.

230
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:44.660
This is true for Ulysses and a tradition called but his own language.

231
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.260
And here Dante begins with a story of the Sicilian bull,

232
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.010
the first victim of which who was the artist itself.

233
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.960
So I think it's literally a way of,
um,
of,

234
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.310
of reflecting on the scene that precedes it.

235
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.650
Virgil and Dante are interrupted lines 20,

236
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.240
Oh thou to my direct my voice or who just now spoke in Lombard.

237
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.010
What an extraordinary little,
uh,

238
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:16.430
a misreading of the language of the rhetoric deployed in the previous,

239
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:21.350
can't you remember in the previous candle damn tab has virtual go out of his way

240
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:25.340
to say,
don't know,
don't talk to these people.
Uh,
they are Greeks,

241
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.110
so let me talk to them.

242
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.300
But now from the perspective of we do the Montefeltro,

243
00:16:31.301 --> 00:16:36.070
we're not speaking some kind of a Homeric,
uh,
uh,
attic,
ah,

244
00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.950
AH,
Greek,
they're speaking a dialect of Italy,

245
00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:43.700
which is to say that language language,

246
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.420
it's not a question of uh,
what kind of style you're using.

247
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.980
Language only shows this whole 12 distance.
It shows,

248
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.570
shows you yourself where you are,
uh,
and uh,

249
00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:00.590
the kind of distance that you have from the world of truth or the kind of

250
00:17:00.591 --> 00:17:05.030
proximity that you may have to some self complacency sets.
In the case of,
uh,

251
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.290
of,
of,
of Ulysses.
So you who know spoke Lombard clearly,
uh,

252
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.360
a way of reading the pretense that rhetorical stylistic pretentions of the other

253
00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:19.400
two,
uh,
speakers in the previous cancer saying,
now go that way.

254
00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:22.790
I do not urge the more though have come perhaps somewhat late.

255
00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:26.110
Let it not earthly to stay and speak with me and I'll see you soon.

256
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.360
Eric's not me and I'm burning if there has fallen.

257
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:32.450
But now into this blind world from the sweet land of Italy,

258
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.730
once I bring all my guilt,
Tommy,
if there are minorities,

259
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.890
have piece of war for most of the mountain there between Rubino and the height

260
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:44.891
where Tibor is released as opposed to the lofty rhetoric of uh,

261
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.280
of view loosest and the previous can't,
who speaks through the grant,

262
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:52.830
this generalities about what is the,

263
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.880
what is the destination and destiny and fate of human beings,

264
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.890
virtual knowledge,

265
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:03.060
the journaling to the west going through a hundred thousand pedals here,

266
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:07.530
the language becomes a,
this assault,
thoughtful,
deliberate diminution,

267
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.380
a contraction of focus as if,
uh,
uh,

268
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.440
the language becomes one of in lead local peace and war between neighboring

269
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.220
towns.
I was still bent down and so,
uh,
et cetera.
And then,
uh,

270
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.110
as a way of adjusting the,
the register,

271
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.020
the stylistic re register virtual,
we'll say to Dante speak,

272
00:18:29.021 --> 00:18:32.400
thou he is Italian.
Once again on the surface,

273
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.850
the observance of degrees of style and,

274
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:40.851
and the laws of rhetorical decorum are always observed and now he continues or

275
00:18:41.671 --> 00:18:45.750
soul,
et cetera.
Um,
and uh,
he will leave.

276
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.760
The pilgrim will inform,
uh,
we do the Montefeltro,

277
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:55.890
uh,
about the situation of Italy.
This is the whole paragraph on page three,

278
00:18:55.891 --> 00:19:00.570
three,
seven.
And then,
uh,
we do,
uh,
goes on saying,

279
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.620
if I thought my aunts who are to one who'd ever returned to the world,

280
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.530
this flame should stay within another movement.

281
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.850
But since Nan ever returned alive from this depth,
if what I hear is true,

282
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:14.490
I answer the without fear of infamy.

283
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.910
This is a passage that most of you remember very well.

284
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:22.510
You may know this very well.
It's a passage or a Elliot,

285
00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.250
a Tsl area to users as uh,
uh,

286
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.050
and the pig Ruffin epitaph actually for the love song of Prufrock.

287
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.830
Uh,
the,
this,
uh,

288
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.960
so it gives you an idea of the kind of reading that earlier it has of his own or

289
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:41.360
this the solitary this man,
uh,
uh,
Prufrock,
uh,

290
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.870
uh,
and,
and uh,

291
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:47.370
the kind of inferred or reality that his figure also evokes.

292
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.520
What I want to emphasize though here at the level of style is how we do speaks,

293
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.080
curses,
hypothetical sentences,

294
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.320
but in theoretical remarks that just a style that is deliberately goes contrary

295
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:07.110
to the smooth hi,
once again,

296
00:20:07.111 --> 00:20:10.690
high style of Ulysses in the preceding preceding canter.

297
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:15.710
And then I was a main of arms and then the cold coded fryer thinking so good to

298
00:20:16.771 --> 00:20:21.090
make amends.
And indeed my thoughts had come true.
But for the great priest,

299
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.871
here's the curse,

300
00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:26.871
I guess Bonhoeffer's May ill before him who put me back in the old sense and how

301
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.141
and wherever.

302
00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:33.141
And wherefore I would have the hear from me while I informed the bones and flesh

303
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.610
my mother gave me another reference to birth with,

304
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:43.530
which as you know,
characters start telling us their story,

305
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.940
uh,
uh,

306
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.940
making of birth than the first major event of their lives.

307
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.420
And then whatever happens,
whatever biographical account,

308
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.680
maybe a descent from or a deviation from the promises that that birth may have

309
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.810
held,
uh,
what I informed the bones,
et cetera.
Um,
my,
um,

310
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.410
my deeds were those noble iron bars over Fox.
This is machiavellian.

311
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.660
Eventually will become machiavellian language.

312
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.560
So we are moving into the secret halls of power.

313
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.530
There were big deals are struck,

314
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.490
the deal sell cause destruction of cities where the pole,

315
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.670
we'll ask the secret that advice from his counselor and let's see what he says.

316
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.110
I knew all wiles and covert ways and so practice their arts.

317
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.950
Um,
I could not,

318
00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:37.951
but a remark to you how Canto 26 also takes place through the language of

319
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.150
concealment and covertness,
right?

320
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:48.540
Uh,
even,
uh,
which is in Italian,
it's actually the language for thievery.

321
00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:50.830
At the same time,
the forgiveness of it all.

322
00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.600
Remember Dante speaks of the sun through a paraphrased is to say there was

323
00:21:55.601 --> 00:21:56.860
hidden,
uh,

324
00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.870
the sinners are hidden and concealed from view in the tongues of fire.

325
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.360
This is the land where drove manipulation of the political stratagems and

326
00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:11.920
machinations.
And here it becomes highlighted and make visible to us.
Uh,

327
00:22:11.921 --> 00:22:16.921
so he continues the covert ways our came when I saw myself come to that part of

328
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:22.810
my life where every men should lower the sales as if it were another,

329
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:27.550
another Marriner like you and gathering the ropes that which before had pleased

330
00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:30.520
me then grieve me.
And with repentance and confession,

331
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:35.521
I turned fryer and another curse war or possibly a woe is me.

332
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:41.220
It would have served the prince of the new pharisees being at war a year near

333
00:22:41.381 --> 00:22:43.800
the,
at Warner,
the Lateran and not with sirens.

334
00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:48.340
And so Jews for every one of his enemies was Christian and none had been asked

335
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.000
at the taking of Aker or treating in the land of uz Holden regarding another,

336
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.590
the supreme office and holy order or holy orders and himself,

337
00:22:56.591 --> 00:23:00.280
nor in me that code which used to make,
it's where lean,

338
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.670
but it's constant.
Oh,
it's really,

339
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.800
we're moving within the,
I said,
I said the,
within the,

340
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.350
the holes of,

341
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:14.170
we say the Vatican today at the time was the Church of Saint John,

342
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:18.250
the latter on which was the residence of the for the Bishop of Rome.
Uh,

343
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.340
and this was famous then as it is famous now for the mosaics about Constantine's

344
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:25.990
donation to Pope Sylvester.

345
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.020
So the whole issue of the doughnut,

346
00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:31.330
that temporal power of the papacy,

347
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.490
it really is to be seen as,
to be glimpse through this,
uh,
this,

348
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:40.840
uh,
a scene of a,
of widow and Bonhoeffer's.

349
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.650
Uh,
he asked council of me and I was silent for his words,

350
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:48.050
seemed drunken,
and then he spoke again.

351
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.950
This is the extraordinary catechist [inaudible] of the,

352
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.220
of the holy office giving,
uh,
the,

353
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.690
the absorb Lucian before even the commission of the crime.

354
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.200
You can go and do what you want.
I give you a solution before you do anything.

355
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:06.420
So it's,
it's do not let that heart,
this mistrust.
I observe,

356
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.800
absorb the henceforth and do that.

357
00:24:08.801 --> 00:24:11.600
Teach me how many casp Palestrina to the ground.

358
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.900
I have power to lock and unlock the new Peter to the heaven is,

359
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:22.290
I noticed for the keys are to which my predecessor,
ah,

360
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:26.000
the,
the,
did not hold a dear.

361
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.340
This is the famous story of seller Stein.

362
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:32.860
The fifth who gave up the office of the paper,
said it,

363
00:24:32.861 --> 00:24:37.550
who stands even in the historical recollections and scholarship today as the

364
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:39.380
embodiment of one of a,

365
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:44.470
of a pope of a figure who understood that the drama and the issue is always

366
00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.280
between power,

367
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:51.020
maybe a little bit too dualistically and holiness and how the two for seller

368
00:24:51.021 --> 00:24:54.680
Stein,
we're really incommensurable and can not quite,

369
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.180
there could not be a dialectic between,
between the two.
And he gave up.

370
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.400
Dante refers to him,
uh,
with the little bit of a,
um,

371
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.580
harshness for not being heroic enough and,

372
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.880
and uh,
withstanding,
uh,

373
00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:16.610
the tide of corruption and deciding to retreat to,
into contemplative life.

374
00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:20.030
Um,
so then the way to,
let me continue,

375
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.510
this is a little sermon that I apologize for it and we continue with this.

376
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:28.190
Then the way the arguments drove me to the point where silence seem to me the

377
00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:31.190
worst offense and I said,
and this is the advice he gives,

378
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.600
simple and spectacular in its simplicity.
Father,

379
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.780
since thou does cleanse me from this sin in which I ma I must now for I love

380
00:25:42.801 --> 00:25:44.300
that I must,
I cannot.

381
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.010
I find the soil resistible especially because now I'm guaranteed of this

382
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.130
absolution.
I can really go on and do whatever I want.

383
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:55.160
So there is not just a coercion on reader,

384
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:57.420
but a kind of pleasure that he feels,
you know,

385
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:02.240
he feels now it's a necessity for him to go out and perpetrate and committee

386
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:06.410
evil.
He will,
he will perpetrate and this is the,
this is the advice,

387
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.100
large promises with scant observance.

388
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:14.150
We'll make the triumph in the lofty seat.
What does he say?

389
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:19.870
Make promises and plan not to keep them going and tell the people in Palestrina

390
00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.840
they are going to respect them,
that you are going to make them even rich,

391
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.700
whatever you want to tell them.
Then of course,

392
00:26:25.701 --> 00:26:28.310
as soon as they opened the gates of the city,

393
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:31.160
don't keep this any of these promises.

394
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:36.020
This is the every statement by the way,

395
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:42.010
that one that finds its original source in Cicero's text about rhetoric,

396
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.610
which is known as a,
it's not really Cicero's,

397
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.940
but it was thought to be Cicero's and it says,

398
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:57.030
this is the text it's taught that,
uh,
from the uh,
uh,

399
00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:00.330
the person to whom it was dedicated,

400
00:27:00.331 --> 00:27:02.780
it was meant for this I already nume.
Uh,

401
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.020
it was taught in the Middle Ages to be of sa a rhetorical treaters.

402
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.870
And that rhetorical cheeses is based on this whole tree.

403
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:15.330
This many other treatises are based on one premise.

404
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:20.690
That rhetoric is the art of making the city and the citizens and Gri,

405
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.690
uh,
in order to keep the city going.
And in a,

406
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.490
in a properly,
uh,

407
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:34.520
govern city promises are made and that all is going to be observed.

408
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.170
It's a way of explaining rhetoric in moral terms.

409
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:45.410
What Dante is saying is those kind of dictates those kinds of propositions can

410
00:27:45.451 --> 00:27:49.770
easily be turned around and they are being turned around in the practice.

411
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.030
And the historical practice.

412
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.900
Then as soon as I was then Francis came for me,

413
00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.730
there is a rivalry between Francis and the devil are fighting over the soul of

414
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:02.610
reader.
And we though is,
uh,

415
00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.740
our Francis roses.

416
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:10.010
And we though is of course here in how I mentioned this details because you will

417
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:13.620
see,
uh,

418
00:28:13.621 --> 00:28:18.620
that Dante would pick up this genre of medieval disputation when later in Prague

419
00:28:18.621 --> 00:28:21.090
authorial make an a in a couple of weeks we'll,
we'll,

420
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.120
we'll hit the Canto Dante meets Weedo son because in this poem,

421
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:32.060
fathers and sons do not necessarily belong in the same model space and sons do

422
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:37.140
not necessarily follow the footsteps,
the footsteps of their,

423
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.540
of their fathers.
Um,

424
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.800
so you see how Dante echoes this whole scene when,

425
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:44.640
and this is a kind of brief duration.

426
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:48.910
I'm giving you a pre figuration of things to come and now we come and,

427
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.310
and that really want to pay a little bit of attention to this cancer 28 because

428
00:28:53.311 --> 00:28:58.140
we're entering the,
the world of the truly tragic world,

429
00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:03.000
uh,
that the tragic,
the most tragic section of the divine comedy.

430
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.710
And I mentioned that because,
uh,
from here to Ken to 33,

431
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:12.870
the story of will the arena we were going to talk about what does Dante think of

432
00:29:12.871 --> 00:29:17.520
tragedy and how can he go on,
really are envisioning the tragic,

433
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:21.180
after all,
I just called the poem as he calls it a comedy.

434
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.090
What is the role in the place of the tragic,

435
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.410
is there room for the tragic vision in Dante's comedy?

436
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.230
And the point is that the tragic,

437
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:36.180
I want to make this point now and that will be elaborating it as we go on next

438
00:29:36.181 --> 00:29:37.650
time,
especially in x time,

439
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.260
that tragic is never the final vision.

440
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.800
And I would go on even saying something now that the essence of,

441
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:50.830
of tragedy is always linguistic for that has to do with issues of the,

442
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.380
the inherent ambiguity's of language,

443
00:29:56.381 --> 00:30:01.381
the impossibilities of decoding and decipher in what is being said by one

444
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:04.900
particular bus,
state,
one state the mentor as opposed to another.

445
00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:09.490
He had Dante begins.
Then there is every fraction about tragedy.
Where are we now?

446
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.800
We are in Canto 28.

447
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:16.630
It's the liquidity Dantin counters.
The one figure,

448
00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.690
uh,
uh,
the figure of Bertrand,

449
00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.340
they'll burn who was a province,
how port,
um,
uh,
province,

450
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.430
our port whom done to actually admires greatly in the linguist in the,

451
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.160
in the treatise on language that he writes,
this famous,

452
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:36.160
I have been referring to it,
the Dave and God eloquency,

453
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.810
he singles him out as Dante singles out based on the bone as a great poet

454
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.400
because he knew how to ride the most difficult genre.

455
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.620
He was a province.
How port,
you know,
who they are,

456
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.060
the area of Provence wedged between a,

457
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.660
the Goulian parts of Italy and France,
the,
the,

458
00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.340
uh,
because he was such a great portrait because he knew how to,
uh,

459
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.790
rhyme and,
and right,
uh,

460
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.480
war poems that this is the most difficult type of poetry,

461
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.110
aesthetically very difficult to sustain.

462
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.350
And that's on the bone was a genius at this.
Now,

463
00:31:14.351 --> 00:31:19.351
Dante praises him among the so called makers of this court.

464
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.640
This is in Canto 28th that thunderbolt.
Uh,

465
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.670
and let's see how Dante starts with a refraction or war.

466
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:32.320
I want to tell you a couple of things as this is sure.
A Canto,
um,

467
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.940
a difficult cancer.
Uh,
Dante begins with,
uh,
uh,

468
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.230
the story of,
uh,
by,
by,
with a reference to,

469
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.190
uh,
uh,
ineffability.

470
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.640
Would you please read the passages?
I,
I,
my,
my,

471
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.230
my version is my English words from Kantar 28th.

472
00:31:52.231 --> 00:31:56.750
The first paragraph who could,
uh,
yes,
do you want to do is,

473
00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:57.883
would you like to do it?

474
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:00.740
<v 1>Who could ever tell,</v>

475
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:05.360
even with words untrammeled and the tail often repeated of all the blood and the

476
00:32:05.361 --> 00:32:06.740
wounds I saw now,

477
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.810
surely every tongue would fail for our speech and memory have not the capacity

478
00:32:11.811 --> 00:32:15.440
to take in so much.
We're all the people assembled again,

479
00:32:15.441 --> 00:32:20.360
who wants in the fateful land of Apulia be weld their blood shed by the Trojans

480
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.340
and in the long war,
which made the high pile of spoil of rings as Levy Rights,

481
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:30.670
who does not air with those who suffered grievous strokes in the struggle with

482
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.950
Robert,
uh,
just card.

483
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:38.960
And those are those others whose bones are still in heath,
heaps at separate,

484
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
where every Apulia in was speechless and thereby talk to be a closer where we're

485
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:47.720
older lardo conquered without arms.

486
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:51.780
And we're one to show he's wounded limb and another his cut off.

487
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:56.000
It would be nothing to compare with the fashion of the knife ditch.

488
00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:59.930
<v 0>Very well read.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Excellent.
Uh,</v>

489
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.130
so what does this metaphor,
it's uh,
it's the,

490
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.540
it's we could call it a yeah,

491
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:08.070
the option of Eh,
the,

492
00:33:08.071 --> 00:33:11.360
the so called ineffability topples.

493
00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.290
You understand what I mean by ineffability Topo say usually it's a,
a,

494
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.730
a device,

495
00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:23.650
a poetic device where the port admits the difficulty or even in possibility of

496
00:33:26.101 --> 00:33:29.310
describing a particular reality.
It's called ineffability.

497
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:33.090
It's so sublime usually has to do with uh,

498
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:37.800
let's say the vision of God.
I can not really go on whoever has seen God,

499
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.700
why did a mistake may have had a vision.
They always uh,

500
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.730
fall into the contingency,

501
00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.650
the facticity of language that I cannot quite grasp.
Uh,

502
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.100
the sublime quality of what they have seen,
non deploys,

503
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.240
the same uh,

504
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.930
device for the world of that said,

505
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.710
let's call it for what it is,
the evil world.

506
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:06.950
It is as if hell now has its home sublimity a subprime quality that is a

507
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:13.600
parallel and counter to that which Dante will witness in the divine spectacles

508
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.130
at the top of paradise.
Okay.
So this is the first,

509
00:34:20.131 --> 00:34:20.964
the first thing,

510
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:26.030
language cannot quite be adequate to the reality it wants to represent.

511
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.770
And what he's talking about now is a Oldie,
the,

512
00:34:31.771 --> 00:34:35.190
he wants to describe the whole of hell and all the limbs,

513
00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.830
the dismemberment of bodies,
uh,

514
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.940
from all wars that can not quite,
uh,

515
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:46.680
come close to what he has seen in,
uh,

516
00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:51.300
in,
in,
in this,
uh,
in this area of health.
This is really,
uh,

517
00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:54.120
the idea.
Um,
and what Dante,
first of all,

518
00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:58.530
we'll go on describing his principal than the question of the ineffability

519
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:03.530
toppers,
which we'll see what it means in the unfolding of the cantor.
Um,

520
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.440
and as we just continue,
and actually this,
then,
uh,

521
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.020
they can't really comes to a close with the meeting of,
with a port,

522
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.030
the transoral born.
So we go from,
uh,
the language of,
uh,

523
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.800
of the ineffable,
um,

524
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:22.320
and the language of the ineffable that is,
has also this little detail,

525
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.030
a reference to Livy,

526
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:29.290
a Roman historian and his voice and his authority are unquestioned.

527
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:33.440
Livvy cannot make mistakes.
Historians,
uh,

528
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:38.280
are entering in their chronicles,
in their accounts,
what they have seen.

529
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:43.490
But somehow the poetic voice is not quite the same thing as the historian.

530
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.520
Historians voice there.
See what the,

531
00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.850
the tension is in the first few lines of the poem.
And then the,
the,
uh,

532
00:35:50.851 --> 00:35:54.490
the Canto comes to a close with a,
uh,

533
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.680
a different form of a poetic reflection.

534
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:04.350
Uh,
Dante is here describing something all together different.

535
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:09.330
The meeting of Bhutan,
the barn.
Look how this scene,
this is the end of Canto 28.

536
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:14.340
I stayed to watch the troop and so,

537
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:19.400
and I saw a thing I should feel simply to tell without more proof and other the

538
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:24.450
threat of the ineffable.
Once again,

539
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:28.170
the port is unable to represent,
uh,

540
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:33.030
feels the difficulty of representing that,
the extraordinary quality,

541
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:33.873
what he has seen.

542
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.370
But that conscience reassures me the good companion,

543
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:43.350
which are Boldens Jimin under the breast plate of his felt integrity.

544
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:49.010
Verily I saw and I seem to see it's still a trunk without a head going,

545
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:59.091
as were the others of the miserable heard and it held the severed head by the

546
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:03.900
hair swinging in its hand like a lantern.

547
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.510
And that was looking at us and saying,

548
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.170
woe is me of itself.

549
00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:12.840
It made for itself a lamp.

550
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.190
And there were two in one and one into

551
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.480
strange arithmetical language.

552
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.690
That divided body of bartender born.

553
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:29.400
He's a maker of the scored and he's being punished by having his own body

554
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.570
divided from itself.
I'll come back to this metaphor in a moment,

555
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:38.750
but the idea that for now stylistically is that the two is one and one is to how

556
00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.850
it can be.

557
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:46.170
He knows who saw ordains and mathematical languages.

558
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.100
If there is no equality,
even possible.

559
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:55.050
Remember that it was exactly the language that he was,
he used for the metaphor,

560
00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:55.660
uh,

561
00:37:55.660 --> 00:38:00.660
the impossible metaphor to contain or the description of all the battlefields

562
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.450
and all the dead people at the beginning of Canto 28.

563
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.660
I cannot find the metaphor that somehow can come,
can equal,
can,

564
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.820
can,
can,
can give an idea.
I fair idea.

565
00:38:11.821 --> 00:38:16.821
I proportionate idea of what I have seen in this.

566
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:17.881
Uh,
uh,

567
00:38:17.881 --> 00:38:22.800
this is one on top of the other member limbs accumulated,

568
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:25.470
one on top of the other and now dentists using,

569
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:30.590
and again the language of a quantity but sort of making us think that somehow

570
00:38:31.591 --> 00:38:36.591
there is some equality or some rationale and the disparity of one being too,

571
00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.470
I don't know,
he says,
well he knows God knows who sold date.
I don't know.

572
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.100
That's what the statement means.
What it was just below the bridge,

573
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.790
a raised its harm high and with it the head.

574
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.200
So it's to bring its words near us.
And they were,

575
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.010
see now my grievous punishment,

576
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:01.060
thou who breathing goes looking on the Dead Sea,

577
00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:03.190
if any other is so great,

578
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:06.130
is this clearly,

579
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.400
this is the first character in inhale who complaints that a punishment inflicted

580
00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:16.690
on him is really beyond all justice.

581
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.460
Beyond all proportion.

582
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:23.530
There's no proportionality between what the punishment he gets and the crime he

583
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:24.141
has committed.

584
00:39:24.141 --> 00:39:28.780
And he proceeds to explain it that main in that maze bear news of me,

585
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.230
know that I am birth Rhonda Byrne.

586
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:37.530
He that gave evil backing to the young king and he explains,

587
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.050
I made rebellion between the father and the son.

588
00:39:41.051 --> 00:39:45.370
I divided father and son are kicked off hill,
did know worse,
uh,

589
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.990
Biblical,
uh,

590
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:52.230
typology for Absalom in David with his wicked Golding's because I parted those.

591
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:56.650
So joined I carry my brain,

592
00:39:56.651 --> 00:40:00.010
alas parted from its root in this trunk,

593
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:03.560
thus is observed in me direct rebuke.

594
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.600
What is going on here?
Uh,
it's a number of things.

595
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:12.250
Let me just explain a few things.
Why should they fund the ball?
Uh,

596
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:17.490
the poet be the one who bears now visible the mark of the division on his own

597
00:40:19.301 --> 00:40:22.810
body.
We know that this is the way punishments occur.

598
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.770
The idea of a punishment in hell is that a punishment is just usually the

599
00:40:26.771 --> 00:40:31.210
prolongation of what the extension of what has chosen to do in this life.

600
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:36.430
You choose to,
um,
create division.

601
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:42.150
That's where you,
you,
you belong.
You did not believe in the mortality of his own.

602
00:40:42.151 --> 00:40:46.900
You are always after death.
We are going to be dead,
uh,
and so on.
So,

603
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:48.140
uh,
this is the,
the,

604
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:53.150
the reflection on punishment or if you wish on the justice that regulates this

605
00:40:55.481 --> 00:41:00.060
world of hair or what Dante calls the retribution that,

606
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.340
that the word he uses is an Italian contract.

607
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.470
Paso say counterpart,
I would say,
oh,
counter suffering.

608
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:12.890
Last word in Italian is Contra Paso,
which really means,
uh,

609
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.190
uh,
that there is pastoral comes from passion,
uh,
to suffer.

610
00:41:18.191 --> 00:41:22.540
You suffer with what you have equally for what you have done.
Um,
that's it.

611
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:26.590
So it's in a sense it's really the,
uh,
not quite,

612
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.500
but the equivalent of the eye for the eye.
And the tooth or the tooth,

613
00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.110
the,
the,
the whole idea of Richard retributive justice.
There is,

614
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.470
there is a fair,

615
00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:42.240
a fair correspondence between what you have done and what you have,
uh,

616
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.980
uh,
and while you are going to suffer,
um,
and,
and,
and,

617
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:50.060
but from the born seems to do.
Why,
what is the,
what is the issue with the body?

618
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:52.840
The whole point of this Canto,

619
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.000
he said that's on the board divides father and son.

620
00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:01.030
He violates a principle of fundamental principle political theology whereby if

621
00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:08.060
some of you are interested in this issue,
you could read the work of a historian,

622
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:12.080
a great history,
medieval historian who died actually almost half a century ago.

623
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:17.240
It's the king's two bodies by historian,
by the name of canned Toro Vicks.

624
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:22.450
Some of you may know it can't aerobics k and t or the blue eye,

625
00:42:22.611 --> 00:42:27.140
et cetera.
Can't.
R O W I C C Kunturo Vicks.

626
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:31.310
And what is the idea of the king?
What you mean?
The king's two bodies?
Yes.

627
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.650
A king has always two bodies.

628
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.760
The visible party that one has and also the,

629
00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:42.590
the mystical body of the royalty.
They used to say in the Middle Ages,

630
00:42:42.591 --> 00:42:47.240
and we still do.
Maybe if you are in new to the news about royalty,

631
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.750
the king is dead long live the king.

632
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:56.080
The king never dies and the king never dies because he always two bodies.

633
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.500
There are two bodies of the king.

634
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:02.830
I may die as an incumbent by the office of the king always remains.

635
00:43:02.931 --> 00:43:07.040
Okay.
This is fundamental.
That's one idea.

636
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:11.670
So by dividing the father from the sun,
uh,
Nantais has Beltran,
the bone,

637
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:16.040
a bleaching,
the unity of the mystical body of the king.

638
00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.200
That two father and son are really one.

639
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:23.420
The other metaphor that is behind that,
which are,
we already saw a little bit,

640
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:28.220
uh,
um,
sort of,
uh,
traced a finally traced,
uh,

641
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.320
in the,
in the cantor of uh,
uh,

642
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:35.350
Chuck Coyne Canto six of of in was the idea of the body politic that I paid that

643
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.060
you,
you may remember,
you remember I mentioned to you,
uh,

644
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.680
the famous fable of millennials who thinks that the body,

645
00:43:42.681 --> 00:43:47.310
the city is really constructed like a body in organic,
uh,

646
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:51.710
a set of correspondences,
organic correspondences like the human body.

647
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.020
Uh,
there is no difference between,

648
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:58.310
there is a difference between patricians and Plebeians.
That's menus argument,

649
00:43:58.311 --> 00:44:01.880
but they're all part of one orga organic,

650
00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:06.860
unified whole that is true for the body politic from a Roman point of view,

651
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:11.600
but it's also the principal was so called mystical body of the church.

652
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:16.820
The same Paul in the letter to the Ephesians refers to the church is the

653
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:18.110
mystical body of Christ.

654
00:44:18.111 --> 00:44:22.820
They kind of so that the state becomes a secular canter,
a secular,

655
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.680
a extension of this mystical body.
The church,
we are all members.

656
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:32.100
Some of us are thumbs,
others are just toes or whatever,
whatever.

657
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.780
In this body,
the mystical body of Christ,
I mentioned this because Kantar 28,

658
00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:41.781
you have a political focus on the the Rome or but they're born,

659
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:48.450
uh,
breaching the unity of father and son.
But also reference to Muhammad.

660
00:44:48.451 --> 00:44:52.390
And I know that there are a lot of people who just find this just absolutely the

661
00:44:52.391 --> 00:44:55.880
audience that Mohammad should be placed or the,
the,

662
00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:59.350
the profit should be praised here in this area of,
in fairness,

663
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:03.210
the only argument that one can have about this is for Dante.

664
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:08.630
Mohammed was actually a member of the church who created a schism,

665
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.780
which is different from Harrison.
You know,

666
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.430
we saw the heretics and can't are nine and 10.

667
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.730
The heretics are those who do not believe in certain,
uh,

668
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.650
tenets of the doctrine.
The schisms are those who want to double,

669
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:27.510
who divide there would schism in Greek means to tear apart the unity,

670
00:45:27.511 --> 00:45:32.340
the world of unity and dabbling it.
Okay.
So this is really,
um,
the,

671
00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:36.130
the,
the argument,
uh,
uh,
some of the,
the,

672
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.150
the symbols and images of Canto 28,

673
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:44.370
but let me go to the actual heart of is probably the question of justice.

674
00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:48.540
Uh,
and the question of Bertrando born who will go back to that,
uh,

675
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.760
when I was just build a bridge,

676
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:54.450
see now my grievance punishment that who breathing goes,

677
00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:57.960
looking on the Dead Sea,
if any other is so greatest,
this,

678
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:03.170
that time things that there is no justice in this hellish world that he inhabits

679
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.950
a,
all the ideas that uh,
uh,

680
00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.730
the ethics of our store to really account for the vices that are so prevalent

681
00:46:11.731 --> 00:46:15.800
here is just not true.
Not only that's not true,
uh,
uh,

682
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.690
this idea of the retribution,
is it,
is it an idea,

683
00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:21.520
this idea of the Contra Paso there,
uh,

684
00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.810
is that an idea that really believes in that is a lot of,

685
00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.410
what kind of justice is that,
where the justice that we have in,
in Fandom,

686
00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.900
and let me just give you a little bit of a piece of intellectual history about

687
00:46:33.901 --> 00:46:36.950
this whole issue.
And I want to make it very simple,

688
00:46:36.951 --> 00:46:40.720
but it's really not a difficult problem anyway.
It's not that I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

689
00:46:40.721 --> 00:46:44.880
I'm simplifying the issues.
They are two types.

690
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:49.140
The people who think that the thinkers who think about this issue,

691
00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:55.260
of course our store too in the ethics and Dante's aware of the great commentary

692
00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:01.560
on Aristotle's ethics by Thomas Aquinas.
He keeps them in mind and,

693
00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:02.453
and uh,

694
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:07.560
they discuss justice and they wonder what is justice to this is a great problem

695
00:47:07.561 --> 00:47:10.560
for that.
It was Dante is,
I have been calling him a number of things,

696
00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:12.990
but he's clearly a poet of justice.

697
00:47:12.991 --> 00:47:17.991
He really believes that whole point of his quest is to establish some degree of

698
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:23.500
justice in his soul,
try to find out justice in the city and,
and,
and,
and,

699
00:47:23.501 --> 00:47:28.501
and probe the possibility of some universal justice as opposed to look Christian

700
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.400
ideas of anarchy and chaos in the cosmos.

701
00:47:32.401 --> 00:47:36.670
So there can be some continuity between the outside and the inside world.

702
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:39.630
So what is the idea of justice is what meant types of justice?
Do they have?

703
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.670
They usually think about two types of justice.

704
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:47.170
This whole called the retributive justice,

705
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:49.570
which is the one that we have in hair here,

706
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.480
but also this reparative justice.

707
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.300
That's Dante is Dante where of the two forms?
Yes.

708
00:47:55.630 --> 00:48:00.030
It's impossible not to think of the representation of the wheel of fortune in in

709
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:04.780
in fairness seven as anything less than a case of distributive justice and

710
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:08.410
distributive justice follows.
An arithmetical model.

711
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:11.960
There is to say in a distributive justice is imagine that wheel of fortune.

712
00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:15.190
Some have more,
some have less,
some have less.

713
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.030
If someone has five you want to establish some justice you take away from one

714
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:24.031
was five and gift one was zero or or one and you create some kind of equality.

715
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:30.450
Distributive Justice has equality as it's a in retributive justice.

716
00:48:33.431 --> 00:48:38.431
Things that are a little bit different because if I say and Aquinas reflects on

717
00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.750
this,
this is not a concern of at all of our historical,

718
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:46.870
if I say an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth,

719
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:52.170
am I really establishing justice or am I just dabbling the the offense as had

720
00:48:53.561 --> 00:48:58.510
been perpetrated.
If someone takes an eye plucks and I are of me,
uh,

721
00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:02.680
if I do the same,
whoever has damaged me that way.
Am I having,

722
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.550
am I being restored in my original position?
No,

723
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:10.900
no.
That doesn't happen too.
How do you,

724
00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:16.310
how does one go around thinking about the whole question of retributive Justice

725
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:22.350
Aquinas,
and this is also Aristo who goes on things as well.
Of course it's hard.

726
00:49:22.351 --> 00:49:26.380
It's very difficult to find the exact counterparts between crime and punishment.

727
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:30.370
If,
if,
if a clown were to um,

728
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:31.780
slap the king,

729
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.550
it's not enough for the king to slap the crown clown bag because one might say,

730
00:49:36.551 --> 00:49:38.020
well it's the,
say it's one slab.

731
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.820
There is the violation of the office and then both,
uh,

732
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.480
Aristotle that is implied and that can never quite be restored by having the

733
00:49:46.481 --> 00:49:50.730
king slap the clown bed.
Both that is total and Aquinas.

734
00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:52.300
That's why money was invented.

735
00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:57.010
So one can really give whatever there is a principle of inequality can go on

736
00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.850
repaying it through other forms,
other punishments.

737
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:04.240
The fact is I think that Dante,
first of all,

738
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.550
I want to go back to the structure of the camp.

739
00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:12.180
It's crucial that Dante should think about this fundamental problem of justice,

740
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:16.930
which is the aim of the ethical structure of the poem.

741
00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:22.120
And in fairness in particular through a poet through Bertrand,
the bar,

742
00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:23.680
not only three report,

743
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:28.980
it's Dante himself has just been announcing the possibility of finding through

744
00:50:29.361 --> 00:50:31.970
language,
the exact metaphor,

745
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:36.290
the exact correspondence between the reality and this sort of presentation.

746
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:41.950
What Dante is doing is telling us how arbitrary are his own judgments in hell,

747
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.580
how the notion of a precision in uh,

748
00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.700
in the way punishments and,
uh,

749
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.100
crimes are related are never quite reliable.

750
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.860
And this is the to understand this and they know that I,

751
00:50:58.861 --> 00:51:02.480
I did not ask you to read it for today,
but I have to,

752
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:06.590
I have a few minutes and I want to go to the ask you to turn to the very

753
00:51:06.591 --> 00:51:07.940
beginning of Canto 29th,

754
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:13.990
because I think it becomes a retrospective gloss here on the problems that had

755
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:19.871
been trying to explain and Canto 28 Dante goes through and other forms of,

756
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.610
he will enter the world of this whole called the alchemists.
Uh,
uh,

757
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.590
those were engaged in diabolical mutations and natural mutations,

758
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:34.850
personifications impersonators,
uh,
disguises,

759
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:39.800
etc. But before he gets there,
there is a little long passage.

760
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.670
It's the first time in the whole poem that usually,

761
00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:47.750
you know how what the Co,
the narrative economy of each canto is.

762
00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.590
Dante comes to the end of the point of,

763
00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:54.380
of a canto and usually closest off with a particular scene or particular sinner.

764
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.880
This is an exception.
Dante goes into cancer 29 and Dick,

765
00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:03.910
wherever situation he has been describing cancer 28 keeps reappearing,

766
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:08.660
worries him in some,
I want to see what worries him about this.

767
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:14.080
The many people in the strange wounds had made my eyes so drunk that they were

768
00:52:15.231 --> 00:52:18.680
failing to stay in we.
But Virgil said to me,

769
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:20.930
what are those still gazing at?

770
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.550
Pilgrim is looking back at what he has seen.

771
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:28.020
Why does that's the,

772
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:33.030
it looks the rest down there among the miserable main shades that has not done

773
00:52:34.131 --> 00:52:35.870
this at the other depth.

774
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:41.260
Consider if they'll thing to number them that the valley goes 22 miles round and

775
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:45.770
already the moon is beneath our feet.
That time is no short.

776
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.810
That is allowed to us.
And there is more to see the no,
he's uh,

777
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:53.490
here once again,
uh,

778
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:58.400
numbers or in medical language,
what is the,
what is the measure?

779
00:52:58.401 --> 00:53:00.230
What is the,
how do we measure how,

780
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:04.460
how are we going to determine where is the exact correspondence?
I just,
just do,

781
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:09.440
let me give you a little,
uh,
uh,
aside about this.
Um,
uh,

782
00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:09.861
you know,

783
00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:14.240
a great reader of him fan and actually he began his career as a commentator of

784
00:53:14.241 --> 00:53:17.600
Dante was Galileo the scientist.
That was the first work that he did.

785
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:22.610
He published a famous,
uh,
uh,
uh,
work on,
uh,
on,

786
00:53:22.611 --> 00:53:27.510
on,
on in fairness,
he tried to find out what the actual,

787
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:29.063
um,

788
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:34.200
size over the Holo in federal was just by going by this little detail of it

789
00:53:34.201 --> 00:53:39.201
without that gives the radius and he comes up with the idea that in fairness as

790
00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:42.700
large as they sit to Florence,
uh,

791
00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:47.460
which is something I probably would have said anyway.
When I was at mathematical,

792
00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:51.000
there was a mathematical proof for it or just his old joke.
Uh,

793
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:53.850
I'll leave it to you to decide.
Let me continue with this.

794
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.840
If thou had Steven heed to my reason for looking,

795
00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:03.230
I answered then perhaps that would just have granted me a longer stay.

796
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.543
Meantime,

797
00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:10.620
the leader was going on and I went after him already making my reply and they

798
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:15.060
added within that then what are held my eyes.

799
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:17.190
So in 10,
three,
just now,

800
00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:21.930
I think a spirit it kinsmen of is one of my blood.

801
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:26.350
We for the guilt that cost so much.
Now

802
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:33.710
Dante knows that a relative of his is in this den of hell.

803
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:35.250
Then said the mass,

804
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:40.580
let not thy thoughts with distracted about him henceforth at 10 12 things and

805
00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:44.100
let him stay there for,
I saw him below the bridge,

806
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:49.400
pointed the and threatened fiercely with his finger and I heard them called

807
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:54.180
Jerry del Bello reminding him,
yeah,
I'm here I am.

808
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:58.950
That was so holy occupied with him who once held hot forth.

809
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:04.220
The doubt is not look that way until he was gone and Nantais response or my

810
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:05.281
leader,

811
00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:10.281
I said the violent death which yes is yet and avenged for him by any,

812
00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:13.050
there is a partner.

813
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:17.940
The shame made him indignant and for that reason is I drudge.

814
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:23.040
He went on without speaking to me and by this has made me more compassionate

815
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:25.740
with him.
What's going on?

816
00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:28.950
How is this related to the previous cancer and I think,

817
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.280
I think it's fairly clear Dante meets a kinsman of is who has been killed and

818
00:55:36.511 --> 00:55:41.511
that death is an avenged and clearly is going to be an avenged is going to

819
00:55:43.441 --> 00:55:44.790
remain an event.

820
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:49.860
Dante's so overwhelm by pity and compassion.
But he does not say no.

821
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:54.690
Does he promised that he's going to go out and take revenge against the carers

822
00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:55.950
of his,

823
00:55:56.010 --> 00:56:01.010
his relative Jerry there Bedloe what he's doing is redefining the notion of

824
00:56:01.621 --> 00:56:02.454
justice.

825
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:08.180
The idea that justice is doubling or could be of the crime.

826
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.600
You know,
someone is doing something.
Here's a kinsman of mine,

827
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:16.470
I'm going to go out and kill your kinsmen cause that's the way justice could be

828
00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.680
understood.
The idea of justice as revenge,

829
00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:24.880
as a way of establishing the precise relationship is what is giving up here

830
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.720
completely.
It's retrospectively and gloss on what I have been saying,

831
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.990
that the notion of justice as the iPhone,

832
00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:36.050
AI or the tooth for the tools is no longer valid in this context,

833
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:39.010
no longer valid.

834
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:44.430
And I think this is the beginning then of Dante's worrying about,

835
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.950
uh,
what is the nature of God's justice,
what is,

836
00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:52.951
how arbitrary is my own claim of authority in describing this very issues and

837
00:56:54.491 --> 00:56:58.990
uh,
and continuing with this reflection as we shall see a next time.

838
00:56:58.991 --> 00:57:03.720
So we,
uh,
let me see if there are questions now.
And,
uh,

839
00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:08.060
I bought this whole problem of the problems we've been dealing with today or bit

840
00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:08.903
of a problem.

841
00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:20.300
Yes,
I am curious.

842
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:33.030
The question is how knowledgeable [inaudible] was of the Hellenic world since he

843
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:37.900
did not read Greek.
And my answer is yes,
indeed.

844
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:42.760
He did not read Greek,
uh,
at all.
Um,

845
00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:47.410
he,
uh,
for that matter,
no.
Did piners really read Greek?

846
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:48.250
Uh,

847
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:53.250
but so he knew the Hellenic world through Latin translation of texts,

848
00:57:55.831 --> 00:58:00.750
like car adis daughters,
uh,
was being the ethics,

849
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:04.590
the tree,
the soul Plato.
He knew,

850
00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:08.850
he knew medieval romances that we'll be dealing with a so called,
you know,

851
00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:13.770
medieval romances,
deal with the matters of France,
the matters of Rome,

852
00:58:13.771 --> 00:58:18.240
the mattress of Brittany.
Uh,
the role mom of Alexander,

853
00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:22.890
which is part of a,
the Hellenic world.
He knew the,

854
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:27.640
uh,
he lived,
which,
um,

855
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.750
it was parked by the way,
till the year 1200 and more,

856
00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:36.690
and later was part of the eggs are k,
um,

857
00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:41.660
a Greek hex or k the church over Aveda was a ex arcade as it's cold.

858
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.240
Um,
so he,
he knew,
he knew this,
this is the,

859
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:51.140
where the resources and the conduit of,
uh,

860
00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.350
his knowledge of the Greek world,

861
00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:58.390
Latin and whatever survives in Latin.
I mean,

862
00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:01.190
I'm fully philosophical schools of the Greeks,

863
00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:06.100
clearly Cicero on the ends of man,
the Feebles,
uh,

864
00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.770
that is really the,
the source book for whatever He,

865
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:14.630
I had been saying about [inaudible] aliens,
uh,

866
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:18.760
et Cetera.
Um,
he had some idea,
Dante,

867
00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:23.300
some idea of the metaphysics.
I mean,
he rides about,
uh,
um,

868
00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:27.840
the [inaudible] that's about the need to go next.

869
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:32.420
Ethics and metaphysics for instance.
So he knew that that's what he knew.

870
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.260
Um,
I could even add that,

871
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:41.261
I'm sure that actually that is going to be in Washington DC in about a year.

872
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:45.010
Are we going to have a conference?
We're going to hold it in court and,
and,
and,

873
00:59:45.011 --> 00:59:49.790
and,
and uh,
in Washington for a number of reasons about the,
on Dantin the Greeks.

874
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:53.860
So if you're staying in touch with me,
I'll let you know what happens.

875
00:59:53.861 --> 00:59:56.840
But one thing that we are really looking at her,
the mosaics,

876
00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:01.190
the art world that come,
the,
the relations,
the connections with,
um,

877
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.870
with a Greek artists.
We'll be traveling and,
uh,

878
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.330
we're in Rome,
in Sicily.
Yes.

879
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:10.303
That's what he knew.

880
01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:13.163
<v 3>Yes.</v>

881
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.200
What is it appropriate to move on from contra positive punishment for God to

882
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:22.190
keep it in place?
In how,

883
01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:28.170
how does he reconcile those two things that hell is supposedly adjust plays?

884
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.850
He's not supposed to look back towards like cans of 28 and he's not supposed to.

885
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.570
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
the question is,
uh,</v>

886
01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:40.350
going back to the promoter of justice,
uh,

887
01:00:40.351 --> 01:00:44.960
in Canto 28 and then 29,
how can they go on,

888
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:45.853
um,

889
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:50.000
having some kind of hesitations about the idea of justice and at the same time

890
01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:54.310
hold that place in a hell in,
up,

891
01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.250
in place according to some criteria.
Uh,
and,
and,
and,
and the ends,
uh,

892
01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:04.220
is,
um,
it may be a little bit,
we'll appeared a little bit complicated,

893
01:01:04.221 --> 01:01:06.620
but I'm not sure that it's complicated.
Uh,

894
01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.720
this whole language drove doubts about authority,

895
01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:17.200
that Dante has the authority of himself as the one who can administer justice.

896
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:20.390
The Authority about,
uh,
the,

897
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:25.080
the himself as a even capable of,
uh,

898
01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:30.200
remembering that we hit,
which,
which he has seen.
And therefore the,

899
01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.140
um,
the authority of the poetic voice,

900
01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:37.550
this is very extensive and really goes into,
into all directions,

901
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:40.970
has a counter with,
that's not the only aspect,

902
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.600
the only facet of Dante's a text.
The way I see that there's,

903
01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:49.010
that he's also capable of taking on a prophetic voice,

904
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:50.540
um,
so that he,

905
01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:55.490
he appears as the one who has by singular grace of God,

906
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:59.710
been chosen tool,
uh,
explore the,
the,
the,

907
01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:01.310
the world in the beyond,

908
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:05.870
which is really cold and then the student the most physical and direct way.

909
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:09.620
So the two voices are simultaneously present.

910
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:13.970
And so how does one,
uh,
condition the other?

911
01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:18.440
I think that that is a really,
the tension of this poem.

912
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.360
Um,
the,
the,
uh,

913
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:24.450
Dante Dante is as both a profit.

914
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:29.451
And Dante is the poet who knows the arbitrators of this construction.

915
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.460
He's the poet,
theologian.
And the port,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the,

916
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:39.280
the point that calligraphy Sta,
uh,
the two voices.
So I said,
well,
tennis,

917
01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:40.123
we present.

918
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:45.410
And what is the point of doing this is in many ways this makes the poem the

919
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.390
actual experience of a pilgrimage.

920
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:55.890
That is to say it's how you connect yourself.

921
01:02:56.010 --> 01:03:01.010
A kind of judgment to you give of what of the realities that Dante's represented

922
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:05.700
there is going to reveal to you yourself,
who you are and where you are.

923
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:09.520
It's a way of shifting the point of Dante's,
the fault,
the port,

924
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:14.750
the voice of the master who can tell you how things are to the interpretive

925
01:03:15.991 --> 01:03:18.150
journey,
to an allegorical journey.

926
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:23.220
You're going to this Haifa and all the time involve yourself in,

927
01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:27.810
uh,
in the story.
This can be,
can turn out.
I think this is his wish.

928
01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:31.590
The story,
which is his journey can turn out to be your journey.

929
01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.600
You can tell your own story.
Do you see what I'm saying?
And that's,
I think the,

930
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.230
it's a very good question and I hope I've been clear in answering this.

931
01:03:40.231 --> 01:03:43.230
You may agree or not agree with it.
That's,
that's another story.

932
01:03:43.231 --> 01:03:46.890
But I hope we've been really clear in the answer.
Yes.

933
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.130
<v 3>In terms of the narrow issue of justice,</v>

934
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.930
do you think that Dante doesn't have so much a problem with the system of eye

935
01:03:55.931 --> 01:04:00.770
for an eye as with the idea that only someone with the intelligence of God could

936
01:04:00.771 --> 01:04:05.550
like accurately see the correspondences and prescribe the right punishments for

937
01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:09.790
the time?
So it's not that like the actual system is bad,

938
01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:14.110
it's just that Dante is humans can't presume to make those judgements.

939
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.520
<v 0>Yes,
ma'am.
Uh,
the,
the,</v>

940
01:04:16.521 --> 01:04:20.230
the other question that follows the followup question is that,

941
01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:24.570
does it mean that Dante may can one say that Dante actually,

942
01:04:24.571 --> 01:04:26.910
it doesn't have problems with a basic structure,

943
01:04:26.911 --> 01:04:30.720
but only with the human ability to grasp how it works.

944
01:04:30.721 --> 01:04:34.530
And I would agree with that.
I would agree with that.
Yeah.
The,
however,

945
01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:38.850
I think that what he's really has has problems with is the notion,

946
01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:42.330
which was a practice at the time,
the notion of revenge,

947
01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:45.840
the way of understanding justice says revenge.

948
01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:50.160
Now even the Bible will go on and tell you that the,
the,

949
01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:53.280
that revenge is mine.
So says the Lord,

950
01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.780
but then two would say that's God's voice and not the human voice.

951
01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:01.050
So he clearly has an objection to that.

952
01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:05.550
And is there some implication because that's really,

953
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:08.190
I think what you were asking me.
I hope that's what you're asking me.

954
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:10.020
Otherwise I'm completely off.

955
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:15.420
Is there some implication that the university itself,

956
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:17.070
it's divine economy,

957
01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:22.480
they may be something come fathomable and I would say yes,

958
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.700
that they called question of justice.

959
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:28.100
It is something that we can not quite measure with human instruments.

960
01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:29.410
So there's one great metaphor.

961
01:05:29.411 --> 01:05:34.411
The Dante we'll give in Canto I believe 19 of paradise where he goes back again

962
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:40.360
to the question of justice and he talks about justice in terms of the salvation

963
01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:43.990
of uh,
uh,
the handles,
you know,

964
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.910
why shouldn't they be here and what he had.

965
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.500
He wonders about that and the answer that he gives us,
he says,

966
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:55.420
the question of justice is like this.
See when you are really near the shore,

967
01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:00.960
you see the bottom and everything seems to be that water's a clear and

968
01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:05.470
transparent and you really seem to touch bottom and see the bottom.

969
01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:07.120
As soon as you go in,

970
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.740
then the unfathomable ocean takes over.

971
01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:17.130
And the foundation of the ground of it all remains invisible and inaccessible.

972
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:23.350
Do you see what,
uh,
what the argument,
that's the argument that goes on giving.

973
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:27.190
It's not an issue that he has resolved here once and for all.

974
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.740
He will go back to these questions.

975
01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.480
<v 4>I have a question about the term you're using earlier.
What are we,</v>

976
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:40.540
when you were talking about they ineffability um,

977
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:45.130
I couldn't make out if you were saying the it of ineffability trope.

978
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.570
<v 0>Yeah.
I called it cause it's really jog.</v>

979
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:54.340
The question is I'm using a ineffability trope.
Uh,

980
01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.210
it's a,
it's more than a trope.
We say it's a device.
I call the top Os,

981
01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.100
which is a place where some,
um,
you know,

982
01:07:03.101 --> 01:07:06.800
they talk about top.
Was it something that keeps like a type we're keeping,

983
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:10.900
keeps repeating and can be used.
Dante uses this,
uh,

984
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:15.880
idea of ineffability what he's really talking about,
the impossible,
metaphoric,

985
01:07:15.881 --> 01:07:18.610
and hold the represent two different realities.

986
01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.140
And I think that that's exactly the way he wants us to think of a crime and

987
01:07:23.141 --> 01:07:26.680
punishment.
Okay.
And then a relationship between crime and punishment,

988
01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.180
which is a metaphorical one,

989
01:07:28.181 --> 01:07:32.260
which is a kind of relationship at the tries to equal relationship between two

990
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:36.310
terms.
I call it topples,
t.
O,
p.
O.
S,
a Greek word.

991
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:41.770
We call it common place.
It's place.
God says a commonplace.

992
01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.690
Okay.
We'll see you next time.
