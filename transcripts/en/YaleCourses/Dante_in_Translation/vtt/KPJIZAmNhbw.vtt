WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.060
Today,
we are going to look at the three Cantos,

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:07.560
uh,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.560
in the eight sphere of a dentist costumers who have beyond the planets beyond

4
00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:20.040
the role.
This so called they'd sphere or the heaven of the fixed stars.

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.230
Before we get too,
which will be next week,
next time the Imperian,

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.750
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the heaven of,
uh,
of light and fire.

7
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300
Uh,
and,
but now we are in the,
in the heaven on fixed stars.

8
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:41.301
And Dante discusses the three theological virtues and the three theological

9
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:43.854
virtues,

10
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.100
unlike the so called to distinguish them from the cardinal virtues that

11
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.780
Christians share with the classical tradition,
namely,

12
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.840
uh,
you know,
the,
the fortitude,
prudence,
et Cetera,

13
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.730
and justice,
et cetera.
The,

14
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:06.690
these are the virtues that deal with,
uh,
uh,

15
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.290
the understanding that the understanding of the divine.

16
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.320
They open up this a horizon of speculations about,

17
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.420
um,
about the language of God,
the God,

18
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.750
the way God speaks to us.
Theology in this sense,

19
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.850
the way in which we speak about God theology,
the logos in theology.

20
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:34.560
There's the word logos and a,
the way God speaks to us.

21
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.320
So it's,
it's,
uh,

22
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.890
it's the place of a in paradise where Dante,

23
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.080
we're focus on the meaning of what I call,
it's not my phrase,

24
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.080
basic words,
uh,
the words,

25
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:52.320
which are foundations of a,

26
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.740
the way in which we come out to discover who we are.

27
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.480
There words that we use,

28
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.980
the words that we may not even know exactly what they mean.

29
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.010
And yet the Dante,
we'll try to,
uh,
define them.

30
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:09.250
There are repeat faith,
hope and charity.
Um,

31
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.100
the three virtues,
uh,
that Dante,
we'll,
uh,

32
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.750
in this using a Paul's letter to the Hebrews where he accounts or gives a

33
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.380
deficiency at least of faith and hope.

34
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.370
But there are words that they are terms that always implicate each other.

35
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.270
You cannot go on explaining faith without really talking about hope.

36
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.030
You cannot go and talking about hope without explaining faith.

37
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.860
And both of them are recapitulated and come together,

38
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:43.150
gather within the question of a,

39
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.720
within the virtue of charity and the virtue of Love,
uh,

40
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.210
a virtue of love,

41
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.160
their words that they are very mysterious in many ways,
but they are,

42
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.970
but there are degrees of understanding all of them.
Um,

43
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.780
the three r examiners because don to go through,

44
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.860
uh,

45
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.840
the equivalent of a university examination and medieval bachelor's degree.

46
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.750
That's the term comes to us from universities,
medieval universities.

47
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.510
The bachelor,
Dante is a bachelor who presents himself to the teacher.

48
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.980
The teacher is testing him,
uh,
and uh,
he will,
uh,

49
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.970
uh,
who give an answer according to textbooks,

50
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.520
authentic where the authentic,

51
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.750
the deported of one's own beliefs,

52
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:36.010
once own hopes and one's own charity,
um,
are gathered.

53
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.020
The three teachers are going to be three apostles who are with,
uh,
with,

54
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:45.850
we're known as a,
uh,
Peter for faith Saint Peter for faith.

55
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:50.370
And that makes sense.
It was Peter himself.
The name stands for the,
uh,

56
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.380
the cornerstone on which the edifice of Christian belief,

57
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.770
uh,
is built.

58
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.010
The second one is going to be for the virtue of hope is going to be James known

59
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:07.200
also as the,
the Galician,
uh,
because why him,
uh,

60
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.210
to seem to be less obvious than the other two because he,

61
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:15.211
among of all the apostles is the one whose death was recorded in,

62
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.610
uh,
in the acts of the apostles.

63
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.470
And so he lived in a certain expectation of a life to come.

64
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.590
So he would seem to be the real figure of hopefulness of some idea of some way

65
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:34.360
of,
uh,
uh,
expecting,
uh,
a future,
a future.

66
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.720
And it retains a life of eternity.
The virtue of a chat,

67
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.690
it instead is,
uh,
uh,
uh,
is,
is,

68
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.700
is,
uh,
examined,
uh,
uh,

69
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.940
by John The apostle to distinguish him from the,

70
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.600
the,
uh,
this year,
uh,
the writer of the apocalypse.

71
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:57.940
So it's the three apostles,
Peter,

72
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:02.941
James and John are these other ways in which we could,

73
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:07.670
uh,
um,
we'll give some summary ways of,
uh,

74
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.500
trying to understand some of these virtues.
Uh,
uh,

75
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:16.410
one thing that I would ask you to look through when you have time to go in

76
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.670
detail of this,
of this texts.

77
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.850
It seems to me that all the three cantos deal or have as a kind of,

78
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:28.000
uh,
uh,
what I would call under text,
uh,

79
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.750
the sub subtext of them,
something that running through,
uh,

80
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.760
but,
um,
sometimes even visible,
but neural the time.

81
00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:38.740
Visibles the question of exile.

82
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.400
Dante is retrieving the language of exile.

83
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.390
The Lang as if this virtues are clearly virtues that don't,

84
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.480
don't concern at all.
The Blessed in heaven,

85
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:53.430
decker only concern as here in time.
They have the,

86
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.450
the blessed in heaven certainly do not need a faith or hope or they don't want,

87
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.020
they don't really need to know about what love may be.

88
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.520
Either they have it or they will be there.
Right?
So this is,
but it's,
uh,

89
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.640
the language of a exile is running through these three issues just as the

90
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.070
language of time.
Uh,

91
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:21.071
so the connection between time and exiled probably needs not much explanation,

92
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.660
much glossing.
Uh,
we are in time,

93
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:26.900
we are fallen and it's only in the language of,
uh,

94
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.550
of the fall that it's possible to think about,
uh,
about anxiety.
The other,

95
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.110
the other,
um,
uh,

96
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.840
element running through this is really the question of a very visible,

97
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.960
especially in Canto 26,
the actual question of,
uh,

98
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.090
of language itself.
You know,
what is the language of God?
Um,

99
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.080
what are the names of God damn tasks?
Is that question do,

100
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.670
are we talking about,
uh,
an entity with a name?
And if so,
you know,

101
00:06:55.671 --> 00:07:00.671
the whole debate about the so called a data Graham met or the four letters that

102
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:05.690
are supposedly the Taitra grab metal,
that name God,

103
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:09.030
that's what that word means.
The four letters,
uh,

104
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:15.410
day.
Are they known or is God just ineffable?
Is there some,

105
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.500
is it,
is,
is,

106
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.900
it's some kind of reality we can know we're going to hope to May to name,
oh,

107
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.830
are we going to be related and connected to this idea,

108
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:29.570
this knowledge of God by analogical discourse is our positions,

109
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.730
uh,
the mystical position that denies even the,
the,

110
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.410
our knowledge of the name of God.
Uh,

111
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.220
the analogical position put forth by Aquinas,
for instance,

112
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:44.410
that we really talk about God and a logically and all the qualities we attribute

113
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.450
to God.
Uh,
only they're not real in,

114
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.870
but by what we may know in our own lives.

115
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.220
So Dante asked this question about where is the language or what are the names

116
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:59.570
of God and how do we get to know God's?
So the first,
um,

117
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.470
the first virtue then is the virtue of faith in many ways.
Literally say,

118
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.530
I call it a basic word because it's really a basic word because it founds us.

119
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.580
Uh,
it's a stone.

120
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:15.610
Peter Asks for the foundation of all this poetic edifice of the divine,

121
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.870
the divine comedy.
I would like you to think about this a,

122
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.480
the actual s me get into a text.
Uh,
this is,
uh,
this,

123
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:29.030
this actual apostrophe,
um,

124
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.970
or at the beginning of Canto 24 oh fellowship,

125
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:36.860
he elect to the great supper of the blessed lamb who feeds you so that your

126
00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:40.040
desire is ever satisfied since by God's grace.

127
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.820
This man has foretastes of that which falls from your table before death.

128
00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:47.480
Opponents is time,
give heed to,
is measurable,
is craving.

129
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.330
And we do him with some jobs.

130
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:55.200
You drink holders from the fountain once it comes and that on which his mind is

131
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.870
set he wants to know about.
But what I do,

132
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.850
what I would like to stress is the presence of this actual metaphor of a
banquet.

133
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.640
Uh,
it is as if Dante is a,

134
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.810
clearly we're dealing with a two metaphors here.

135
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:13.980
One which is exhibited,
the manna in the desert,

136
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.500
the falling of this.
Do on a,
on,
on the exiles,

137
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.410
the wonders,
uh,
the Jewish wonders in the desert.

138
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:26.130
And the other one is that the eschatological banquet,
but it,
this is,

139
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:31.170
this is as if any debate about faith has to be placed within a communal context.

140
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.880
This is not going to be the professional faith that where you may have it,

141
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.110
let's say in 1550,
roughly.
No,
uh,
the,

142
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.490
and I'm really alluding to as a contrast,
as a contrast,
um,

143
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.240
just to make you understand the case.
So,
uh,

144
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.310
the great debate between two fingers of the renaissance called Erasmus and

145
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.770
Luther,
they debated at length about the question of whether or not,
uh,

146
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.800
how a text of a written about essentially earlier and on 1440 texts by a

147
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.623
vanilla,

148
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.660
a great humanist or who wrote about the free world and the defense of their free

149
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:17.010
will and free will.
He,
they,
they were,

150
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.720
it was unclear to them what value really meant.
So they go on debating in Texas,

151
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:26.200
code on Threewill,
uh,
Erasmus maintains that val,

152
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.150
I really had defended the existence of freewill cause it's free will,

153
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.670
which is a gift of God.
Uh,
it's,

154
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:37.580
it's something that has been given to us.
And,
um,
uh,
the,

155
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.920
and therefore we really have to come to know God through the acknowledgement of

156
00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:46.850
his authority.
But,
uh,
because the freedom that we are talking about,

157
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.880
he's talking about,

158
00:10:47.881 --> 00:10:51.030
he thinks valley's talking about that actually comes from him.
And so,

159
00:10:51.031 --> 00:10:55.860
but if free will we come to know and come to choose also the existence of

160
00:10:55.861 --> 00:11:00.810
divinity.
Luther had a very radical ideas about the question of,
uh,

161
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.110
of,
uh,
of freedom.
Um,
uh,

162
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.810
there was no such a thing.
He would argue,
Eh,
uh,
ThreeWill.

163
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.870
Um,
and actually the world,

164
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:18.330
the universe is a universe of absolute faith and faith is freedom.

165
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.640
And it's given to us by freedom to say,

166
00:11:20.641 --> 00:11:23.460
releases us from all obligations.

167
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.420
It frees us from more constraints.
It just makes us,
uh,

168
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.530
uh,
understand their own room.
Relationship to the Creator is,
uh,

169
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.620
uh,

170
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.300
without any other intermediary forces of the world.

171
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:39.930
So it's,

172
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.820
it's her radical theological claim of freedom and faith together.

173
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.540
It's very possible many people,
just to give you a,
to extend this argument,

174
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.780
there are many poets and thinkers who go on changing his and believe that for

175
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:58.810
instance,
freedom is actually the source of,
uh,
uh,

176
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.040
not faith,

177
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.100
but faithlessness that the idea of fate or once whole faithlessness may come,

178
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.590
denial of God may come from the assertion of oneself at the assertion of one's

179
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:14.470
own total freedom.
But this is,
I'm giving you this,

180
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:19.060
those two exemplify the nature of the debates and the force of the debates.

181
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.360
Dantian cysts removed the question of faith from one of radical subjectivity or

182
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.850
a radical faith.
Uh,
I aware that there may be some kinds of,
some,
some,

183
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:31.330
uh,

184
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:36.330
a flip side to it that that faith and lack of faith really both depend.

185
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.390
If you reduce them to subjectivity,
uh,

186
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.830
one can go on sliding into,
uh,

187
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.490
one of the two options very easily.

188
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.780
Dante focuses on with this first image on the question of the communal

189
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:54.190
experience,
the banquet.
And that to me is part of the shared world.
Uh,
this,

190
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:58.930
this eschatological banquet where the All the vision where at the end of time,

191
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.490
uh,
but,
but the illusion is also to the manner,
uh,
where,
where,
where,

192
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:04.700
uh,
this,

193
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:09.730
this various figures are con the community comes together and then Dante goes on

194
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.560
really focusing on the individuality of the private professional faith.

195
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.970
It's really about him.

196
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.700
The interesting thing that I want to point out is that beer,

197
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.220
beer Beatrice's words to Peter and onlines 30,
she,

198
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:32.340
she goes on a appealing to him to go on to,

199
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.760
uh,
examining.
But she does so in a very peculiar way.

200
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:41.761
Let me read this passage and she lines three to all eternal light of the great

201
00:13:42.281 --> 00:13:46.000
soul with whom our Lord left the keys.
There's no,

202
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:50.640
this is very canonical.
It's part of the Hagiography,
the,

203
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.530
the account of uh,
uh,

204
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:57.460
the no graphic representation of pita with the two keys which he brought down

205
00:13:57.461 --> 00:14:02.320
all of this wondrous joy test.
This man on points,

206
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:07.420
light and grave is Aussies.
Good regarding the faith,

207
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:09.910
but which the workers on the sea,

208
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:15.290
it's an illusion recorded in the gospel of Peter Walking out of an act of faith,

209
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.690
walking on water.
Jesus asks him and tells him.

210
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.720
So the strange thing about this reference is that Peter did not want to walk on

211
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:30.370
water.
It is the moment of,

212
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.120
let me call it the crisis of faith.

213
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:38.140
The moment where Peter had no faith.
And in fact,

214
00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:43.300
Jesus calls him all men of little faith.
Why don't you walk?
And then he,

215
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.190
uh,
I guess feeling that he's teetering on the,
on the brink of their base.

216
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:53.191
You can imagine a really see sewing over the waves finally does manage to go on.

217
00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:58.940
This is a poignant moment because clearly Dante's emphasizing that there are

218
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.930
degrees of faith and that the so called crisis of faith,
uh,

219
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:09.140
must not be seen as denials of faith.
On the contrary,

220
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.960
that somehow there is a social dialectical movement between Eh,

221
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:17.890
professional faith and doubts about owning and,
and,
and the,

222
00:15:17.891 --> 00:15:22.100
and the,
that's the,
the,
uh,
owning this,
uh,
this gift,

223
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.330
having this gift of faith.
So this is one of the strange moments,

224
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.880
edits in the light of this,
uh,

225
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.940
strange fluctuation between faith and an experience of not faith.

226
00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:37.510
That I think that the are what happens later,
uh,

227
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.880
has to the way it has to be to be understood.

228
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.920
And then whether he loves rightly so rightly hopes and believes here the three,

229
00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.780
you're the language of the three theological virtues or come together.

230
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:55.190
It's not hid from the,
since our sees them and so on.
And then Dante users,

231
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:59.470
both a,
uh,
the language of the university,
uh,

232
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:03.740
lie academic life as if this were really a,
an academic test.

233
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.530
We'll come back to this issue in a moment.
Uh,
justice,
the Bachelor,
oh,
that's,

234
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:14.000
that's the,
uh,
the bachelor of arts,
the Bacalao reactors as we call it,

235
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.920
armed himself.
So there are tool that is the weapon of knowledge,

236
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.280
the academic knowledge as a force.

237
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.820
Knowledge is a weapon just as the bachelor arms himself.

238
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:28.100
It does not speak to the master.

239
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.000
A McGeester submits the question for argument,

240
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:37.220
not for settlements.
And it was the issues,

241
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:37.640
uh,

242
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:42.640
issues that always need the open endedness over argumentation.

243
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.910
And not that of settling of a,
of the point.

244
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.660
I am myself with all my reasons what she was speaking to be ready for such a

245
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:53.720
questioning and for such a profession,

246
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.820
speak good Christian,

247
00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:01.150
declare myself now this is that a knowledge that makes him,

248
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.740
that makes him visible,

249
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.610
declared herself but in orange that does not keep him hidden.

250
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.580
It's all two brings him into,
into existence,

251
00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:15.500
makes him visible to us where his faith.
And that's the question,
uh,
that he,

252
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.480
that Peter Asks and the answer is may the grace which,

253
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:21.261
uh,

254
00:17:21.261 --> 00:17:26.261
which grants it to me to make my confession to the chiefs and children I began

255
00:17:27.381 --> 00:17:29.420
giving me right utterance for my thoughts.

256
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:34.690
And that went on as the truthful pen and illusion is to Paul a questioning a,

257
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.440
an authority.
And the word authority as you know,

258
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:43.520
is that which is what we mean by authentic.

259
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.650
And authorities are key keywords.
That word is Doritos.

260
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:53.910
I mean it's that comes which is worthy of faith.

261
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.650
Um,
the teacher is not necessarily worthy of faith.

262
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.090
You can question your opinions of the teacher and reject the question.

263
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:07.130
There's a distinction between the master and the author.
Uh,

264
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.610
the one or the authority,

265
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:12.870
the one who is an author is one who is worthy of belief,
where their faith.

266
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.350
So he quotes Paul.
So this is a canonical answer,

267
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:21.030
is the truthful pen of the dear brother Paul wrote of it with the father,

268
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:22.290
put Rome on the good path.

269
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.470
Faith is the substance and then literally the foundation that which lies under

270
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.820
or things that the ground of all things,
substance of things,

271
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.300
hope for us or faith.
You know,

272
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.570
if you went to understand faith and we ought to probably go and read about hope,

273
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.740
things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.

274
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.600
And this I take to be,
it's quiddity quiddity,
a medieval,

275
00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.060
medieval part of the medieval lexicon.
Meaning it's constitutive,
ah,
uh,

276
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.770
essence.
It's uh,
its specificity.
Now if you thought that,
um,

277
00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.170
uh,
in the Middle Ages that won't go and talking about faith,

278
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:06.171
the famous formulation of faith comes from Tertullian who says,

279
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:10.500
I believe because it is absurd.

280
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:16.160
So that faith becomes the consequence of the extension of the absurdity of all

281
00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:23.670
things.
And because they claim made on what one believes has in itself.

282
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.650
The idea of going,

283
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:29.760
being beyond reason observed in that sense of being beyond reason.

284
00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.053
Uh,

285
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.580
and that's one of the ways in which faith is defined.

286
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.330
It really means that faith exceeds the realm of reason.

287
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.890
It means that faith can never really quite be an object of knowledge.

288
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.740
Dante does not pursue that line.

289
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.180
He tries to make faith and reason coextensive.

290
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.610
This is the sense of the,

291
00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:59.040
I've got to qualify the term queer extensive and I will in a moment,
uh,

292
00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.120
press officer.
They are not,
uh,
but they are,
they belong together.

293
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:08.100
This is the sense of the whole metaphorical pattern of

294
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:11.310
the university context.

295
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.820
So say you can know something about belief,

296
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.520
knowledge and faith really belonged to,

297
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.750
they implicate each other.
They are not the same thing.

298
00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:28.710
Because if you really could know everything of what you believe,

299
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:31.330
then there is no reason why you should believe,
uh,

300
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:36.350
that which faith becomes necessary and necessity only because they are,

301
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.080
it's a way of acknowledging limitations of what one knows.

302
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.670
But linking knowledge and faith is not just simply a way of saying that reason

303
00:20:44.671 --> 00:20:48.640
can know some of the content of what Dan believes,

304
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.490
that there is a reasonableness to what one believes.

305
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.550
That's all true to say that reason and faith go together.

306
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.980
There are certain claims about the reasonableness of what one believes it's,

307
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:01.030
but it really means,

308
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:06.150
I think at a deeper level that faith itself is a mode of knowledge.

309
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.190
That it is a mode of knowledge.

310
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:13.390
Exactly the way you have an orange of philosophy though it's modalities are

311
00:21:13.391 --> 00:21:16.570
going to be different because philosophy,
uh,

312
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.110
submits to the rules of the rationality.

313
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:25.230
But fate opens your eyes and it's a way of showing you something about the world

314
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.570
that the reason alone cannot do.

315
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.630
So the binding of the two metaphors,
that's what I meant.

316
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.990
Coextensive but not identical.
It didn't mean that are identical.

317
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:40.230
The joining of philosophy and theology reason and faith made some projects faith

318
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.620
as a way of knowing.
Ah,
it,
it,

319
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:51.160
it makes you see the world in different ways.

320
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:56.530
If then,
if you were trying to look at the world in the,
in the,

321
00:21:56.531 --> 00:21:59.980
in the light of natural region and from,

322
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.130
and from their point of view of rationality.

323
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.840
So this is seems to be to be the argument and I set the terms,

324
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.750
uh,
against,
let's say a modern,

325
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.430
a subjective idea of freedom.

326
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.070
Freedom of faith is freedom that frees you from all.

327
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.050
And you're only,
I'm accountable to the creator,
uh,

328
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:28.051
or freed of faith as a mode of responding to the absurdity around oneself,

329
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.230
which is really the language of uh,
uh,
Tertullian.

330
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.380
And then this scholastic argument where that Aquinas of knowledge and faith

331
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.400
really needing,
uh,
to be,
uh,
to be together.

332
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:47.050
And then the examination goes on and I want to talk about 70,

333
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.630
uh,
then here doubt,

334
00:22:48.631 --> 00:22:53.530
think is right or this is the beginning of the top of the page.
Can 24,
slide 68,

335
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.030
then I heard they'll think is rightly,
if don't understand this well,

336
00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:03.040
where he placed it among the substances and after and after among the evidences.

337
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.980
And then,
uh,

338
00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:11.050
and I then the deep things so richly manifest themselves to me.

339
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.080
Here are so hidden from men's size below that their existence lies in belief

340
00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:18.760
alone.
Now it's a distinction.

341
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.900
This is Europe between belief and where we are.

342
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.280
The evidence of things not seen that paradox remain.

343
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:32.281
So there are things visible here in the heaven of the the fixed stars.

344
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.620
Uh,
no available to those of us were in time and uh,
in,

345
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:43.300
uh,
in the fallen world on which is based off the hope and therefore it takes the

346
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:47.600
character of substance.
If from this belief we must reason without seeing more.

347
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.960
Therefore it holds the character of evidence is a gloss on the medieval fill out

348
00:23:53.651 --> 00:23:57.290
theological lexicon that Dante has been deploying.

349
00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:00.950
Then I heard a four that is a pilot below for doctor,

350
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:05.660
whether that's understood there would be no room left for Sophos with,

351
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:11.060
and then this briefing from the kindle kindle love and it continued.

352
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.560
I want you to pay attention to this metaphor which we had,
well,

353
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:19.520
it me sitting around the table where I could ask you to speculate about the

354
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:24.521
presence of becoming a metaphor if for those acquired below four doctrine,

355
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.590
um,
I'm sorry.

356
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:32.740
Now the alloy and the weight of this money have been well examined.

357
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:40.610
But tell me if they're are hesitant in that purse,

358
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:45.970
all of a sudden the question of money and the question of faith.

359
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.950
Faith is literally

360
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.930
given as said,
it's said to be,
um,

361
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:58.770
money or do you have this,
this,
this Koan in,

362
00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.840
in your purse.

363
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.080
I therefore I have indeed so bright and round that it's of it's mentored.

364
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.720
I am a no doubt.

365
00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.130
Then there came from the depth of the light that was shining there,

366
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.800
this precious jewel.

367
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:21.040
That's one reason why the metaphor of money is used for clearly for faith.

368
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.640
It's a precious jewel on which every virtual rests when's did it come to the,

369
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:32.870
and the language is going to be,
it's from the printers,

370
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:35.990
rain of the Holy Spirit and the new parchments and so on.

371
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.470
But that metaphor of a money as faith,
uh,

372
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.700
really sort of has a way of lingering on in our minds what,
what,

373
00:25:44.701 --> 00:25:45.680
what is the connection?

374
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.950
One connection or repeat is to indicate the preciousness of the faith.

375
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:55.940
One holes.
Uh,
it is,
it is really as rare maybe,

376
00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:59.730
and this is valuable,
eh,
rare.
Uh,

377
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.510
beautiful jewels can be,
that's one thing.
Um,

378
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.350
but clearly there is more because the word money,

379
00:26:06.351 --> 00:26:10.250
which Dante uses an Italian Monita same work,
uh,

380
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.650
it becomes a character in an English epic.

381
00:26:12.651 --> 00:26:17.450
Monita comes from the Latin for Ma Mona Vale.

382
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.210
That word money as you know,
comes from,
uh,
uh,
uh,

383
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:27.320
it's like,
uh,
meaning a warning.
It's a,
it's a,
uh,

384
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:31.610
it's an advice,
it's a warning,
a warning about it's,
uh,

385
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.410
it's mintage.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's part of the language of,
uh,
of,
uh,

386
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.740
we have the word admonishment that comes from it that monitors that.

387
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:42.920
It's an aura of it that it is really pure.
Okay.

388
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:47.930
So that's another way of referring to the purity of this faith that preciousness

389
00:26:48.151 --> 00:26:52.470
before now the purity of his faith.
Uh,
the authenticity of it,

390
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:57.180
so to speak.
Uh,
and other Chait of money is that money has,

391
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:02.220
it's that which establishes the value.
It circulates,

392
00:27:02.221 --> 00:27:05.960
first of all,
has the power of circulating.
Um,

393
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:10.860
that's an upset by the text,
but it's implied by the metaphor.
It is as if,

394
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.340
as if it is as if a faith has the power,

395
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:19.200
is that virtue that puts everything into motion and therefore questions and

396
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.930
establishes.
That's what makes it a basic word.

397
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.200
It establishes it's the substance or establishes the values of all the things

398
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.380
that are,
are around us but full of,

399
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.680
I cannot really get past my mind that Dante wants us to think about this kind of

400
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:42.000
the restaurants of profit nation there is in the language of money and link it

401
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:45.030
with really this purity of faith.
It is a safe,

402
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.980
there is the distinction is really never quite between profit nation and the

403
00:27:49.981 --> 00:27:54.981
purity of faith and that somehow the world of faith comes out of the world of

404
00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.650
nation,
that it belongs to the world of time.

405
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.740
It can be profane and yet it still manages to put things into situations.

406
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:06.990
The ambiguity of money.

407
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:11.991
Then beauty of the metaphor of money I think sheds a lot of light on this

408
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:16.200
virtual that Dante,
uh,
has been,
um,
uh,

409
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.380
examining a has been examined about it,

410
00:28:19.381 --> 00:28:24.000
but he has been examining it for us.
Uh,
let me go and see how,

411
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:29.090
whether we can see more about this virtue by looking at the question of hope

412
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.340
that comes,
uh,
uh,
immediately after with the examination by Saint James,

413
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.640
I begin to tell you here just a little story that it's not an unusual story,

414
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.750
but as you probably know are the Greeks never thought of hope is a virtual,

415
00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:56.420
um,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

416
00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:01.240
there is a reference to hope in uh,
uh,

417
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.550
as being one of Pandora's being old,
one of the,

418
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.770
um,
the,
the,
the entities available in Pandora's box.
You know,

419
00:29:10.771 --> 00:29:12.090
about Pandora's box,

420
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:17.450
which was opened and all the evils of the world came out of Pandora's box.

421
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:23.220
Save for one.
Hope.
It's a statement.

422
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:28.280
It's a view that all is that really casts hope as clearly some kind of evil or a

423
00:29:30.511 --> 00:29:32.940
delusion.
And in fact,
for the Greeks,

424
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:35.840
the idea of hope is always a,

425
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:41.110
a term that implies the delusion of exiles.

426
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.030
It's really what befalls an exile.
Someone who loses once,
once,

427
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:46.923
once land,

428
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.610
and what is left for him to do nothing but hope.

429
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.110
It's the radical illusion.
It's a kind of hope against all pack.

430
00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.700
I have nothing more to do.
It's a self deception.
That's really what it is.

431
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.740
Dante does not follow that route for hope.

432
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:06.701
And in effect,

433
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:11.560
I think that he finds in the Bible the idea that Oh,
or,

434
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.870
or a kind of a new,
a different horizon [inaudible] for the,

435
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.630
the re thinking,
uh,
the way in which hope,
uh,
uh,

436
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:25.830
can be viewed hope first of all is literally a virtue of time.

437
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.010
More so a faith up with the language of the clock.

438
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:34.980
You must have noticed and Canto 24 introducing car,
uh,
that world of hope.

439
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.010
I did not want to talk about it because I know that we'll be talking about it

440
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:43.970
now.
Hope is as much of faith every virtue of time,
uh,

441
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:48.640
because it's a virtual Neroli of time.
It's a virtue specifically of the future.

442
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.920
It's tells me whenever,
if I have hope,

443
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:55.960
I really hope about the past.
It would be,
it would fly,

444
00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.730
uh,
in,
uh,
against or sense.
There's no logic.

445
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.140
I hope we yesterday didn't rain.
That makes sense.
Does it read it?

446
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:09.580
But I can hope that tomorrow,
once,
no,
I can.
I can have that hope,

447
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:11.020
which would be a silly hope,

448
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:16.220
but it's a hope nonetheless because it's a virtue of time in the future.

449
00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.450
It's a way of experiencing time in the future.

450
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.940
That's one thing that Dante's doing,

451
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.140
linking therefore hope and temporality,

452
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.710
but it's normally only virtue of time.
It's the most realistic of virtues.

453
00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.230
Normally we think,

454
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.600
and the Greeks would sort of give us a cost to Paul's that you really hope it's

455
00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:39.540
because you are really desperate.

456
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:44.900
You you hope because they have no rational reason or no realistic reason to

457
00:31:47.651 --> 00:31:52.120
believe that things are going to go the way you wish that went for you.

458
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:57.240
So you go home and hoping dentist has no hope is the most realistic of virtues

459
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:03.790
because it tells me that nothing is really ever over.

460
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:08.380
That's what makes it realistic.
The the negation of hope.

461
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.430
The opposite of hope would be despair that you,
Dante,

462
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:17.460
you remember is the same for Dante is the thing that we find the encanto.

463
00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.490
We never read it and now retrospectively I can tell you that you shouldn't go

464
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:25.530
and read it.
Canto eight of of inferno and even Canto nine.

465
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.320
The encounter with the Medusa is that fear of despair,

466
00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:33.730
that idea of being petrified,
they may do's.
I can turn you into a stone.

467
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:38.020
There is to say that you are imprisoned and you remain caught either in your

468
00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:38.810
standpoint,

469
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:43.810
all in that particular reality that you have all the idea of yourself as,

470
00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:49.010
as as you like to.
As you think you have been in the idea of the past,

471
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.980
Dante says,
no hope is a virtue of the future.

472
00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.330
It's a virtual that can even change the past.
In that sense,

473
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:57.250
it's affective.

474
00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:02.060
In the past though it's the term because it tells us that the past may not be

475
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.290
what we thought it was.
You know,
whatever disaster you may have had,

476
00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:09.020
whatever this appointment you may have had in the past,

477
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:14.200
that this appointment may contain seeds that really will reappear in the future

478
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.490
and maybe are preparing a future that will surprise you.

479
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.580
So this is a different understanding of time that Dante presents.

480
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.660
It's an understanding of time that once again down to the,
uh,

481
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.880
links with two moments of his,

482
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:35.620
which is sharp in that sense,
it's really not different from faith.

483
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:39.100
It fulfills faith.
It unveils the element of faith.

484
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.790
You can not really go on hoping about something like that unless you have some,

485
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.350
an act of faith.

486
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:46.420
<v 1>Uh,
um,</v>

487
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.200
<v 0>and,
and,
and,
and,
and 90 goes on explaining it in existential terms and,</v>

488
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.040
and tying it to his own hope of returning to his homeland,

489
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:59.720
his own native city and the larger pattern of exile.

490
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:04.090
I want to examine that with you.
The poem begins with a,

491
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.050
uh,
with subjunctive,
the kind of 25 begins with an operative.

492
00:34:09.051 --> 00:34:13.970
What do we call,
uh,
I wish,
you know,
oh,
that things were going that way.
Uh,

493
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:18.050
if,
if,
if ever,
if ever come to pass

494
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.501
contingency,

495
00:34:20.501 --> 00:34:25.270
there were these contingents in Italia uses a Latin is cause we don't really use

496
00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:30.230
that in that sense.
But uh,
uh,
well I read it Italian,

497
00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.200
even if Margaret who wish you were here,
uh,

498
00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:37.410
semicon Tinga that's a lot.
Is if ever took a,
if I,

499
00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.140
if everywhere contingent,

500
00:34:39.141 --> 00:34:43.570
if it happened in that sense that the sacred point could point myself sacro he's

501
00:34:43.571 --> 00:34:45.670
never come to pass at the sacred poem.

502
00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.090
Don't usually sacred in that sacred means.

503
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.430
Remember that Dante uses the word sacred in orders in the double sense,

504
00:34:54.431 --> 00:34:55.264
a sacred,

505
00:34:55.450 --> 00:35:00.450
he's not investing it with some kind of a magic idolatrous power because for

506
00:35:01.301 --> 00:35:06.130
Dante,
the sacred is never reduceable localizable if that's a verb,

507
00:35:06.131 --> 00:35:06.720
a verb,

508
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.530
localize where in one object or in one particular place or he means it

509
00:35:11.531 --> 00:35:16.531
ambiguously is that which contains a profane and the sacred within it hell and

510
00:35:16.931 --> 00:35:18.340
heaven descriptions of Heaven and hell.

511
00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:23.190
The sacred poem to which both heaven and earth have set their hand.

512
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.330
It's an incredible moment of prophetic self awareness.
I am writing,

513
00:35:28.331 --> 00:35:33.331
but I know that without God I would not be able to be writing this poem that it

514
00:35:33.911 --> 00:35:37.340
has made me lean for many years writing.

515
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.610
Now I'm sort of that I'm giving you this kind of a simple,
um,

516
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.230
a paraphrase of it.
The asco basis of writing,

517
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.810
writing as a pro.
You understand what I mean?

518
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:53.100
Writing as an ascetic labor of the soul,
it makes,

519
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:58.190
it makes me lean as if he were undergoing fasting the rituals,

520
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.550
the rituals of,
uh,
of,
of the,

521
00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:05.160
the commitment to a particular labor.

522
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:09.810
So I call it the aesthetic labor of a,
of the soul.
Uh,
uh,

523
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:14.840
should overcome the cruelty that bothers me from the first sheep fold if I could

524
00:36:15.751 --> 00:36:16.830
ever go back home.

525
00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:21.870
But he called Back Home Florence and the candle hope cantaloupe or he's an

526
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:26.310
exile,
uh,
in the city is described in pastoral terms,

527
00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.590
the metaphor of the city as a sheep for the pastoral language.

528
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.340
That language you expect to have in the backlogs of Virgil,

529
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:40.080
the pastoral tradition,
uh,
the idyllic world.
That's what we mean,

530
00:36:40.081 --> 00:36:44.760
the pastoral tradition and way if it ever works,
some peas,
some idyllic,

531
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:49.740
uh,
ideally,
uh,
circumstances in that city.
And you can continue,

532
00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.220
um,
where I slept.
This lamp here,

533
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:56.580
he continues with the pastoral length and then add me to the wolves that make

534
00:36:56.581 --> 00:37:00.210
war on it with another voice now and other fleas,

535
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.260
I shall return the poet and the phone to my baptism.

536
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.210
Take the Laurel Crown for,

537
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:11.230
they're entered into the faith that makes soul known to God and after,

538
00:37:11.341 --> 00:37:16.200
because of it,
Peter Does circle my brow,
so Dantes and still is in the,

539
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:16.860
in the,

540
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.940
in the circle of hope and the heaven of hope and yet now he's really thinking

541
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:25.941
about the last ceremony of Peter on him who blesses him three times as if it is

542
00:37:27.271 --> 00:37:32.040
as if literally faith and hope are now converging the tool,

543
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.390
the two virtues come together.
What is Dante saying though here in this camp?

544
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:40.050
In this program at the beginning of this cancer,

545
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.680
his casting his hometown Florence in the pastoral language as a sheep fold and

546
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:48.721
then no,

547
00:37:48.721 --> 00:37:53.721
he's alluding to messianic time where when,

548
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:58.860
if it were just when the piece were restored,
when the factions,

549
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:03.300
the wolves,
the wells,
you know the part of wolves and wealth,

550
00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:06.990
it's very clear.
That's what etymologically the word wealth come from,

551
00:38:06.991 --> 00:38:11.991
from wolves and the lambs will lie together almost a kind of impossible time and

552
00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:14.310
messianic time.

553
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:19.050
When finally piece will be restored and he goes on adding that,

554
00:38:19.051 --> 00:38:22.380
he would be acknowledged.
That's part of his hope.

555
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.840
He'll be acknowledged a,
there'll be a,

556
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:29.610
at that time who'd be acknowledged as a poet on the fount of his baptism,

557
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:30.803
which has,
you know,

558
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.800
you're refers to the baptistry of Saint John where we do have records that he

559
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:39.130
actually was Christen,
that's simple language,

560
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.030
but you have to ask yourselves why we'll Dante talk,

561
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.660
why would he use this particular metaphor?
The baptism is clear,

562
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:51.661
the place where a community is constituted and the baptismal font has that,

563
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.190
that value not only has that value,

564
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.910
it's actually the same baptismal font font to dump head.

565
00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.150
You remember there had been a pro phonation of it in Canto described in Canton

566
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:05.900
19 of hair.
We're not.
This is that he broke one of those,
uh,

567
00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.670
those,
those wells there,
one of those.
Well,
so exactly,

568
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.310
which we tried to understand in figurative terms since it would be inconceivable

569
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.590
that that would be capable of breaking it.

570
00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.350
He says to him to rescue someone who's dying.

571
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.630
But what is a baptismal font for those of you who have no inkling of what it is,

572
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.900
is it's,
it's the,
what are we called the Sacramento.

573
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.860
The topological if you really are more textual and historical about about that.

574
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:41.730
A sacrament that that that ceremony reenactment of exodus when a child is

575
00:39:43.211 --> 00:39:46.330
baptized,
he is literally said,

576
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:51.660
he's told actually that he is once again reenacting the crossing of exodus and

577
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:54.340
to me this is extraordinary.

578
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.820
The dentist says that he would be now acknowledged and be given the role of the

579
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:03.700
port on the baptismal font.

580
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.400
That question you have to ask yourself is,

581
00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:11.200
and no doubt is Dante's asking,
how does a poet come home?

582
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:16.300
He imagines a trial at the baptismal font.
Is there the home,

583
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:20.770
what is the homecoming of poets that that's the hope and hope for the homecoming

584
00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.290
where everybody will be at peace and there will be fair fees,

585
00:40:24.291 --> 00:40:28.690
the festive mood and he was going to be welcomed back and he'll be hailed and

586
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:30.120
acknowledges supported rates,

587
00:40:30.121 --> 00:40:34.870
fantasy of every the winners return.

588
00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:40.000
That's literally what he say.
Yes.
He's using this language of a baptismal font,

589
00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.390
which is the language of x averse.

590
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:47.140
It is as if you were saying that the poet can only come home in order to tell

591
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:49.600
his community.
That would have to get out again,

592
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.680
that all of them will have to do exactly what's happening to him.

593
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.190
That the exile that has been [inaudible] with which has been punished and wishes

594
00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.240
before in him is really the message that his poetry can only give to the

595
00:41:03.251 --> 00:41:05.380
community from which he has been exiled.

596
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:10.090
He's his con voguing the whole community around the baptismal font,

597
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:15.240
which is the figure of exile to tell them this is really where we belong in the,

598
00:41:15.491 --> 00:41:16.360
in exile,

599
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.920
in the language of a spiritual exile and language in which clearly,

600
00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.970
which could imply some kind of a re,
um,

601
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.800
remaking oh oneself,
rethinking on.
So now with this in mind,

602
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.920
Dante goes on seeing the,
and for whom below the visit,

603
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:36.920
Galicia an allusion to Santiago.

604
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:41.270
And then she herself will go on.

605
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:45.520
And I want to,
uh,
before we read the,
the,
the part,

606
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.810
the passage I went to,
uh,
give you this,
uh,

607
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:54.100
the Compassionate one line 50 Beatrice's presentation of Dante to Saint James

608
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.330
and that compassionate one who directed the feathers of my wings,

609
00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.280
right of the soul,
the name of the family,

610
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:11.060
Ali yearly to saps sacks or higher flight,

611
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:16.430
anticipated my reply,
the church militant.

612
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:21.460
This is Beatrice has no the child more full of hope is this written in the son

613
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:27.550
that he radiates all the host therefore ease it granted him to come from Egypt

614
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.920
to Jerusalem.

615
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.440
That he may see it before his warfare is accomplished.

616
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:39.920
The other two points about which the disaster,
not for enlightenment,

617
00:42:39.921 --> 00:42:44.300
for him to report how dear this virtuous today I leave to my himself for they

618
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:49.190
will not be hard for him nor occasion for boasting a and then like a pupil once

619
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:53.180
again taking this language of of school,
the school child,

620
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.660
the main thing about this person or this presentation,

621
00:42:56.661 --> 00:43:01.661
but Beatrice is that Dante's journey is glossed through one figure,

622
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.710
one figure that have been telling you ever since we started this,
this,

623
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:08.930
this course,
this classes,
uh,

624
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:11.780
in September through the figure of exodus,

625
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:17.170
Dante's journey here is literally described as a journey from Egypt to

626
00:43:17.931 --> 00:43:18.620
Jerusalem,

627
00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:23.620
which is the master plot of the Hebrews exile from the bondage to the story of

628
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:30.560
freedom and exiled becomes really the,

629
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:35.530
that of exile is the figure of the master figure of,
uh,

630
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.040
of,
of the poem.

631
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.970
So Dante then therefore is linking now exile and hope.

632
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.000
And I think I already have indicated to you that this idea of writing is writing

633
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:49.380
their mode of exile is also that it's not to be seen in a,

634
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.720
in a subjective way only relating to him or the two,

635
00:43:53.721 --> 00:43:58.130
the precondition for his own poetry,
but it involves the whole of history.

636
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:03.280
History has to be seen from the standpoint of uh,

637
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.060
of exile.
So they say,
Eh,
then,
uh,
there is uh,

638
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.660
Eh,
um,
pay at the top of page three,
63,
six,

639
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:16.020
align 69.
Hope I said,
uh,
again,
uh,

640
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:21.040
it's a sure expectation of future glory as the openness to time as futility.

641
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.210
And it springs from divine grace and precedent.
Marriage.

642
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.490
They're light comes to me from many stars,

643
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.980
but the three first is still that in my heart who will so sovereign,

644
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:36.981
single of the sovereign Lord David who told Dante is,

645
00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.310
uh,
uh,
the greatest,
uh,
of poet.
Now.
Um,

646
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:44.580
so we move on from here now to the last,

647
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.890
the last virtual,
uh,
the last virtue of a,
of love.

648
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:54.750
Um,
the,
uh,
and,
and it is,
there is a progression,

649
00:44:54.751 --> 00:44:56.160
faith,
hope and charity.

650
00:44:56.161 --> 00:45:01.161
It is as if only you have to know this virtuous before the beatific vision can

651
00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:04.050
even be possible to you.
You have to,

652
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:08.430
you have to understand what it is that they do to you and they produce in you.

653
00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.630
We come to love however we are,

654
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:18.110
we would be looking for a definition of it as at least in a,

655
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.370
in a formula,
in a,
in a,
in a,
in,
in a kind of,
uh,
uh,

656
00:45:23.371 --> 00:45:28.170
citation will formula a given and available in Canto 24 and 25.

657
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:29.820
We will be looking for it in vain.

658
00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:35.130
There's no definition of love and it's clear,

659
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:39.120
uh,
to me it's clear to you,
I take that,

660
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:43.410
that Dante really thinks that this is the word,

661
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.360
the key word love is the keyword that seems to escape or possible finishers,

662
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:52.870
which we know around us in a variety of ways.
Uh,

663
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:57.890
we understand it and yet we cannot quite confine it and define it and that to

664
00:45:58.231 --> 00:46:01.750
define it would really literally be a way of,
uh,

665
00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.280
reducing its impact and reducing its,
its value.

666
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:10.520
It's such a basic word that Dante says that the only word that is really left,

667
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.321
he,
he,

668
00:46:12.321 --> 00:46:17.321
he is an imaginary at the Malo [inaudible] in this treatise on language that he

669
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:23.121
writes this treaties on the devil gather or he says that the word love is the

670
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:26.880
only residual term from the past.

671
00:46:26.881 --> 00:46:31.290
That means that language is a way of like food.

672
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:36.360
The bank right at the beginning of Canto 24 is a way of gathering us and

673
00:46:36.361 --> 00:46:39.690
bringing us together.
So love and food.

674
00:46:39.691 --> 00:46:41.970
Food is given as a metaphor at the beginning.

675
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.150
Now love that escapes any particular definition.

676
00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:50.360
And yet it's the culmination of all these theological virtues.

677
00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:55.920
What Dante does,
C and a,
and he has,

678
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:59.880
I really want to,
uh,
turn to this scene,
uh,

679
00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:03.540
at the end of Canto 26,
Dante meets Adam.

680
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:09.170
So it's the confrontation with the beginning is the competition with the arch

681
00:47:10.111 --> 00:47:15.111
port because Adam is the one who named the world and therefore brings it into

682
00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:18.360
existence.
That's really what we mean by poetry.

683
00:47:18.361 --> 00:47:23.190
That's we're expecting of poets to do.
And since this is the meeting,
uh,

684
00:47:23.191 --> 00:47:25.080
the encounter with him,
uh,

685
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:30.110
lines ninth and following Dante addresses all fruit though the,

686
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:33.761
the,

687
00:47:33.761 --> 00:47:38.761
the word this is really is apple or apple or fruit.

688
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.090
That alone was brought forth,
right?

689
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.310
What on earth does he mean?

690
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:49.660
That's a strange way of addressing someone or all food that I was alone was

691
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:54.040
brought forth ripe.
There were a lot of theological debates,

692
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.940
uh,
as to,
um,

693
00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.830
ripeness is an element of grace,

694
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:04.580
a description of grace for Dante.
Uh,

695
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:08.960
uh,
if you're not ripe when you're ripe,
when you have received,

696
00:48:08.961 --> 00:48:12.160
they've been touched by grace.
So the argument was,

697
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:17.490
was Adam created in a natural state or was he already created in a state of

698
00:48:20.801 --> 00:48:21.634
grace?

699
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.320
How long was he in the earthly paradise before he fell?

700
00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:31.480
Could any fee if we feel it was,
um,
in the state of grace,

701
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:36.160
why could he,
why did he fall?
Uh,
if it was the state,
the reason why,

702
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:39.640
could he commit this sin of transgression?

703
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:44.790
Is it a transgression that he commits by eating of the fruit of the tree?

704
00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:50.170
So Dante implies that he was in a state of grace,
right?

705
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.280
The first we miss right?
Plus the idea of,
uh,
of fruit.

706
00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:56.130
That alone was brought forthright,
oh,

707
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.890
ancient father of whom every bride,

708
00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.020
his daughter and daughter in law.
This is the very language that Dante,

709
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:10.021
we'll deploy in Paradiso 33 for the prayer to the Virgin and being the daughter

710
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.170
of her son.
Then the question of,
uh,

711
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:19.470
the divinity and humanity of Christ as humbly as I may beseech thee to speak

712
00:49:21.101 --> 00:49:25.510
with me,
they'll see is my wish.
And to hear the sooner I do not tell it,

713
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.130
sometimes an animal,

714
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:32.131
let me just skip a few lines and see the answer that are Adam will give line one

715
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:36.940
15,
um,
and following no,

716
00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:39.220
then my son,

717
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:46.160
that not the tasting of the tree in itself was the cause of so long exile.

718
00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:53.740
So even Adam,
the fall was in a state of exile,

719
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.920
exile from the garden falling into the wilderness where he had to transform the

720
00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:05.731
wilderness into the garden so that the work would be the way in which he could

721
00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:09.010
regain that which she had lost the garden,

722
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:14.490
but solely the trespass beyond the mark.

723
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:20.500
I come back to this in the place from which the ladies and Virgil in limbo.

724
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:24.430
I longed for this assembly during 4,000,

725
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.530
302 revolutions of Sun.

726
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.830
He's clearly thinking about the handling of hell by Christ.

727
00:50:31.831 --> 00:50:35.390
So that added now,
uh,
uh,

728
00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:38.750
years two to the 4,000,
he counts in the Er.

729
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:44.030
And I saw it returned to all the lights on it's track 930 times what I lived on

730
00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:44.810
earth.

731
00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:49.810
The tongue I spoke was all extinct before Nimrod.

732
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.670
We saw him as the founder,
the giant.

733
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.790
It's a rescue over a Tom Mckee,

734
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:58.880
the classical idea of the giants fighting the gods.

735
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:03.170
Nimrod who builds a the tower of Babel.
So the,
the,

736
00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:08.070
the debate between them,
uh,
uh,
hinges on language,
uh,

737
00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.490
language is the key.
Now,
uh,

738
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.810
and retrospectively we really coming to understand the language of theology,

739
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.360
the question of what is the,

740
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:22.880
what are the properties of theological lines and what are the proper beyond that

741
00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:28.010
of all words.
No,
that's,
that's the arguments,
Huh?
I spoke with [inaudible] before.

742
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:32.210
Not nimrods race gave their mind to the unaccomplishable task,

743
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:36.980
the building of the Tower of Babel that would not be finished for no product.

744
00:51:36.981 --> 00:51:39.060
Whatever of reason,
uh,

745
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:44.140
since human choices renewed with a course of heaven can last forever.

746
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:50.510
It is a work of nature that main should speak,

747
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:54.830
but whether in this way or that nature of that,

748
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:59.480
but whether this way or that nature then leaves you to follow your own pleasure.

749
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.200
Before I descended to the anguish of hair,

750
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.510
the supreme good from whom comes,

751
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:10.511
the joy that swayed me was named I on Earth II in Italian,

752
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.500
not pie in the sense of you know,
the subject.

753
00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:17.910
I don't think that that's what that term meant.
Uh,

754
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:22.930
and later he was called El Dante's using two Hebrew words where he takes him to

755
00:52:24.321 --> 00:52:27.590
be,
he brought words for the name of God.

756
00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:31.790
God was called e first and then he was called l.

757
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:33.163
In fact,

758
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:38.180
this is one of my students suggested to me that if you read them backwards,

759
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:41.390
they really spell out the word Ellie.
Uh,

760
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:45.800
which would be a word that we would acknowledge maybe nowadays as being the word

761
00:52:45.801 --> 00:52:47.600
for an appeal to God.

762
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:53.020
He and he was called l and that is fitting for the usage of mortars is like a

763
00:52:53.751 --> 00:52:56.300
leaf on a branch which goes on.

764
00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:00.380
And another comes on the mountain that rises highest from the sea.

765
00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:05.410
I lived pure than guilty from the first hour to that following the sixth when

766
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:08.260
the sun changes quit.

767
00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:11.870
And that's the end of this encounter.

768
00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:17.930
Let me focus on this question of a language that,
uh,

769
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:22.350
Dante's really with,
uh,
uh,
encounter with,
uh,
with uh,

770
00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:26.340
Nimrod,
uh,
explicitly highlights,
uh,

771
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:31.460
Adam changes Dante through Adam is changing their account.

772
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.040
He had given in the devil.
God,
it'll Quinton's.
Yeah.

773
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:37.650
Which is a story about the origin of words and language and what did he had

774
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:42.651
claimed that the Hebrew persists the Adams language unchanged through history

775
00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.380
because it was inconceivable.

776
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:51.410
He adds there that Jesus would be using a language other than that primal

777
00:53:53.611 --> 00:53:57.300
language and not the corrupt language of human beings.

778
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:02.630
Now the story changes actually Adam's language hass has suffered the alterations

779
00:54:06.601 --> 00:54:10.140
already in the garden where the names of God keep changing.

780
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:14.400
This I think is the key.
This is the whole question of theology.

781
00:54:14.401 --> 00:54:18.060
Then their names all got God the way we speak about God.

782
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.540
God was called he and then he was cold air.

783
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.840
There is no proper name for God.

784
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:33.320
We only have words or languages that keep changing according to our own

785
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.310
historical circumstances.

786
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:42.750
And Dante goes on changing his own paradigmatic geomatic account about the

787
00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:45.420
status of the sacred language.

788
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:50.600
He says there is no such a thing as a persistent sacred language in history.

789
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:57.230
What comes out is that language is the mark of our own distance from the divine

790
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:03.270
that we are in.
The language that we use is,

791
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:08.271
is a part of our own exilic circumstances and exhilarate predicament.

792
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:13.170
And therefore all the language of theology that Dantes is,

793
00:55:13.171 --> 00:55:18.171
has been describing is part of this exhibit longing of human beings.

794
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:23.370
This is the story from 24,
25 and 26.

795
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:28.610
Dante uses theology in the examination of theology only to place us back on the

796
00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:35.610
world or this world where we go on hoping,

797
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.590
believing a and loving,
uh,

798
00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:42.930
realizing that these are all mysterious terms without which,
however,

799
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:45.240
that's another meaning of the word for,

800
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:49.000
of the resonance of money without which we,
uh,

801
00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:52.800
where we know faith is a form of trust without which you cannot really be

802
00:55:52.801 --> 00:55:53.880
functioning together.

803
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.120
Where we have hope as the realization of faith and where we have love as that

804
00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:05.370
which is we are always longing for and somehow miss the meaning of which is

805
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:07.890
mysteriously escaping us.

806
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:12.900
These are the three fundamental issues that Dante is discussing.

807
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:15.330
And let me take some questions.

808
00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:23.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

809
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.440
You passed over briefly this

810
00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:34.360
statement of Adam that his transgression was in the,

811
00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:38.890
not in the act of tasting the tree,
but in crossing a boundary.

812
00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:44.740
Um,
I wonder if you could unpack that a little more because it seems to me not,

813
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:48.520
um,
it seems to me a bit of a controversial statement,
first of all,

814
00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:53.770
because the command was you not eat from the tree.
So for Dante to say this,

815
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:54.670
it seems like he's,

816
00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:58.780
there's something very specific that he's wants to get across in this of

817
00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:02.710
boundary.
Um,
maybe if you could elucidate that point a little further.

818
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:06.770
<v 0>The question is a question that I had really welcome and that was hoping someone</v>

819
00:57:06.771 --> 00:57:11.270
would ask the question is that,
uh,
I did not,
I read from,

820
00:57:11.271 --> 00:57:14.000
I did not really explain,
uh,

821
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:19.030
the items statement when he says that he is seen was not in the tasting of the

822
00:57:21.681 --> 00:57:25.970
tree but in the trespassing of the limit.

823
00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:27.800
Let's say the mark.
Uh,

824
00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:32.860
and therefore it seems that there's some issue of boundaries here and would I

825
00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:37.910
our care to reply to give it a try to give a response to that?

826
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:44.120
Uh,
yeah,
I could give a response at a number of levels.
First of all,

827
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:45.683
um,

828
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:50.950
I would remind you all that this is Canto 26 or paradise and cancel 26 or

829
00:57:52.821 --> 00:57:56.870
paradise is symmetrically connected with the other two.

830
00:57:56.871 --> 00:57:59.140
Canter's 26,
uh,

831
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:03.860
the can't of Ulysses who also trespasses the boundaries,

832
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.240
uh,
who is a metaphysician of souls,
who,
who is dealing with,

833
00:58:08.241 --> 00:58:10.370
with space,
uh,

834
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:14.660
and who himself there was really low or where on earth is his,

835
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:18.530
he's really going,
he doesn't know his destiny.
She was trying to go somewhere,

836
00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:23.150
but that doesn't really know that.
Uh,
uh,
but they are connected.
Uh,

837
00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:28.040
and then Ken took 26.
So purgatory dealing with,
uh,
with love,
uh,

838
00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:33.010
in,
in it's,
it's,
it is pervert to the form of,
uh,

839
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:36.650
uh,
when entirely of the poets,
right.
And Cesar,
et Cetera.

840
00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.190
So that's one of the connections and other connection is that listen at three

841
00:58:40.191 --> 00:58:44.830
cantos where Dante's using foreign languages,
um,

842
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:50.210
they say deliberate connection.
They are there in Korea can't of,
uh,
of,
of,

843
00:58:50.211 --> 00:58:52.610
of,
of,
of,
uh,
26 of in February.

844
00:58:52.611 --> 00:58:57.611
You may remember that a virtual goes of the way to speak be the one who is the

845
00:58:58.011 --> 00:58:59.420
interlocutor of Ulysses.

846
00:58:59.421 --> 00:59:03.020
And supposedly they speak Greek in Canto 26 of purgatory.

847
00:59:03.021 --> 00:59:06.830
Dante uses the province,
our language of our now Danielle,

848
00:59:06.831 --> 00:59:10.720
who are now start speaking in,
in province are,

849
00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:15.800
and then now we are using [inaudible] using their foreign language,
uh,
uh,

850
00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:19.760
Hebrew,
the names of God.
So it's a,
that's one connection.

851
00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:24.140
Uh,
so there are a lot of other of these connections in the case of,
uh,

852
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:28.460
of either who makes that distinction to come specifically to your point,

853
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:32.960
the WHO,
who makes the distinction between the tasting of the fruit.

854
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.470
And I was not a,

855
00:59:34.471 --> 00:59:38.440
he tasted the fruit better than he trespassed the,

856
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:43.070
the mark that seems to be you right now.
It was a very,
uh,

857
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:47.420
controversial subject because indeed that was the,
uh,
the,
the,

858
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:49.820
the command,
uh,
given to Adam,

859
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:54.230
thou shall not taste of the fruit of this tree.

860
00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.620
Uh,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and the presents Adam,

861
00:59:57.621 --> 01:00:00.140
who instead that goes out to do that.

862
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:05.620
And it's clear that he thinks that the tasting of the tree was not he saying

863
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.340
there that was not his sin.
That's dentist take on it.

864
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.870
It's not the tasting of the tree.
There was the sin.
Uh,

865
01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:20.150
the scene was that he,
uh,
abolished or boundaries.

866
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:26.090
I,
I read that,
I'm restating the Mercedes is changing slightly.

867
01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.950
Sure.
I'm giving a paraphrase of what has been,
uh,
w w what seems to be,

868
01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:35.150
uh,
the issue here.
It's,
it's clear that Dante things,

869
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.240
that Adam's act of eating of the tree was good and Adam's act of the eating of

870
01:00:44.181 --> 01:00:49.181
the tree was actually the discovery of a knowledge that had but managed to

871
01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:56.330
elevate him.
And that was good.
So in a sense,
from this point of view,

872
01:00:56.331 --> 01:00:57.830
this is a,

873
01:00:57.831 --> 01:01:02.831
this seems to be a contrast between Julissa's form of knowledge and Adam's form

874
01:01:03.141 --> 01:01:07.910
of knowledge.
You list his form of knowledge is that he literally is,
does not go,

875
01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.430
doesn't even know what he's going.

876
01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.900
That's part of the problem in pure limit of physical terms.
You know,
he had no,

877
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.490
no directions.
It was a gratuitous quest.
In the case of Adam,

878
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:24.050
getting to know of the fruit of the tree was not an issue.

879
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:25.191
In fact,

880
01:01:25.191 --> 01:01:30.191
Dante says that may be real knowledge is always going to be tied to an act of

881
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:36.290
making discoveries and making even transgressions what it was.

882
01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:40.880
The problem is that they had been a loss of boundaries that he lost.

883
01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.190
How are we to understand the loss of boundary?

884
01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:48.580
It was the kind of knowledge that made Adam realize that he could be divine.

885
01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:53.300
That was his problem,
but as soon as you,
the,

886
01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.250
the imposition of the boundary,

887
01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:00.360
God's imposition of or establishment of the boundary between the human and the

888
01:02:00.831 --> 01:02:04.580
divine was also a way of letting Adam,
no,

889
01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:09.350
I'm not going to read this as if we're a kind of [inaudible] statement at all.

890
01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:14.590
It's all letting Adam know that he had to be aware that he was not divine,

891
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:16.940
that he was a human being.

892
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:22.750
What he Adam wanted to do was growing knowledge and discover that he could also

893
01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:26.280
be divined.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

894
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:31.550
That is the issue for him to fall then would be a way of reestablishing that

895
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:37.540
boundary and realize that he is a human being and not divide.

896
01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.070
So it's a growth,
it's a growth and self knowledge.
Well,

897
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.970
if you really know that you,
if you're here to know who you are,
you already have,

898
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.980
you have grown.
Do you see what I'm saying?

899
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:50.460
Dante's changing that sense of,

900
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
of what the fall of man is and the fall of man is not the fall in the growth of

901
01:02:57.631 --> 01:02:58.350
knowledge,

902
01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:03.210
but that growth of knowledge that leads you to you raising the boundary to

903
01:03:03.211 --> 01:03:07.620
believe that you are by virtue of that knowledge that you have gained,

904
01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.590
that you are now divine.
And just,

905
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:15.650
this is really what the whole poem is trying to convey to us is that this is a

906
01:03:15.781 --> 01:03:19.910
stereotype amputation,
that human beings seem to have a,
and we kept,

907
01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:23.580
we need to be reminded and when we hear it from God himself,

908
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.140
we don't quite believe it.

909
01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:30.560
And then we have to grow into that recognition of boundaries between ourselves

910
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:36.300
and something that we aspire to,
but we are not yet.

911
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.690
Okay.
Good question.
Okay.

912
01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:44.550
But I had anticipated this answer must say,
uh,
in a number of ways.

913
01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.500
Talking about Adam in the past,

914
01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:49.310
I hope that you don't remember because more or less I said the same.

915
01:03:49.311 --> 01:03:51.090
They got pulled.
I don't know that I mentioned before.

916
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:06.210
And you're one of my,
my one,
my one there.
Just to go back to the,

917
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.270
that one might wonder,
uh,
uh,

918
01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:13.590
does Dante really make it clear that he's nearly,

919
01:04:13.591 --> 01:04:17.840
not Adam,
but he's,
he's still things that he,

920
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:21.750
that he is,
he's Unisis at this point.

921
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:26.990
One thing that he understands that he is in the Canto before he acknowledges

922
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.290
King David as the,
the supreme,
and he did earlier,

923
01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:35.640
the supreme poet,

924
01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:40.850
he's really placing himself in David Psalms are the lyrical recapitulations of,

925
01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:51.050
of,
of engrossing,
of exodus.
Uh,

926
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:55.680
that's really where he now I think is trying to move that he's more,

927
01:04:55.930 --> 01:05:00.570
he,
he can not be like your races.
He knows he's not,
he does not want to be,

928
01:05:00.571 --> 01:05:02.480
he cannot be Adam.
Uh,

929
01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:07.610
that's the kind of model he's trying to regain for himself.

930
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.850
Okay.
Rush.

931
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.990
Maybe you see the connection with what we said earlier with what I,

932
01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:18.340
they explore the response I gave to your question.

933
01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:31.220
<v 2>Yes.
He gets going off of Dante is theological beliefs in encounter 24,</v>

934
01:05:31.221 --> 01:05:34.630
he talks about his belief in the trinity.
Yes.
Um,
and I was,

935
01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:38.710
what if you could just explain that further because he seems to be seeing both

936
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:42.110
at the trinity are three separate entities and the unity.

937
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:46.070
And I know there was controversy and different factions of different,

938
01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.110
of different attractions and Christianity,

939
01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:51.770
I believe different things about the trinity.
Um,

940
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:54.470
and so I was wondering what Dante believed.

941
01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:55.853
<v 0>Well,
uh,</v>

942
01:05:55.910 --> 01:06:00.910
Dan has a number of references throughout paradise to the trinity.

943
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.000
One of them actually have very significant one that we never talked about was in

944
01:06:07.581 --> 01:06:12.581
Canto 25 of purgatory where Dante things that the way we human beings understand

945
01:06:14.601 --> 01:06:14.931
the trick,

946
01:06:14.931 --> 01:06:19.490
can understand that one of the ways which we understand the trinity is to,

947
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:23.200
uh,
to think about the,
the structure by my mind,

948
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:25.490
the memory intelligence.

949
01:06:25.491 --> 01:06:30.491
And will we have the three by par to one thing and three functions or in Canto

950
01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:32.910
24 total.

951
01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:37.850
That professor Lumas I'm sure explained to you,
uh,

952
01:06:37.851 --> 01:06:42.440
is that the,
if you want to understand,
Dante seems to imply when he,

953
01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:47.620
he talks about I am one when he declares his own poetic a practice,

954
01:06:47.871 --> 01:06:51.940
I'm one who wouldn't love a dictates inside me.
Uh,

955
01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:56.960
go on using my languages on one wing,
which the trip there was explained,

956
01:06:56.961 --> 01:07:00.090
they would say think about speaking to,

957
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.150
to make it make an existentially ah,
compelling and concrete.

958
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:09.050
When you speak,
you have an idea in your mind was it's babble.

959
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:12.080
You have an idea in your mind,

960
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:17.180
you emit a sound,
but to meet the sound,

961
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:21.920
you need the breath and you cannot have the sound without the breath and you

962
01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:23.510
cannot have the sound without the idea.

963
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:28.700
So that speaking encompasses this threefold components.

964
01:07:30.201 --> 01:07:32.600
One,
the truth is always connected to one.

965
01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:37.400
Then in Canto 10 of a paradise.
You remember we spent some time there,

966
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:42.080
uh,
the having this idea of the love of the father and the son and the breadth of

967
01:07:42.081 --> 01:07:44.650
love that joins them.
They get gone.
Gazing Twitter,

968
01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:48.250
this idea of the fecundity or this idea of the trinity,

969
01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:53.150
a source or Dante would things about God in the form of them,
of the mover.

970
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:55.600
Uh,
but he,
he,
he,

971
01:07:55.601 --> 01:08:00.350
he does go into that and yet he understands that that's not the affective

972
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:04.940
theology.
He wants to think of God as the prime mover to think as the,

973
01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:07.230
the efficient cause it,
it,
it,

974
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:12.300
it makes God is such a mechanic or a clock maker or something.

975
01:08:13.461 --> 01:08:15.060
One of these images of,

976
01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.970
of God who imparts all de and the recedes from creation.

977
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.300
That's really not Dante as idea.
He wants to think of,

978
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:27.570
of a divinity that is partaking of,
of,
of,

979
01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:32.570
of creations love,
uh,
Dante's idea of the tree.
So he has many,

980
01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:36.170
many,
uh,
he tests all of these paradigms.

981
01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.510
I don't think that he ever excludes one.
Uh,

982
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:44.480
he does not really agree with the reading of joking more Florida who thought

983
01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:49.340
that the trinity was the unitive what could be dissolved into three separate

984
01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:53.020
beings so that that's no longer the unity to have a humanity.

985
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:57.470
You've got to have all three are clearly present.
That's what Dante believes.

986
01:08:57.830 --> 01:09:02.240
A unity with a kind of a,
is it a prismatic unity?

987
01:09:02.241 --> 01:09:05.360
Let me call it,
does that by and saw the damn who would say,

988
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:09.200
we all have some recognition of the trinity,

989
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.060
whether it's uh,
you know,
God and the,

990
01:09:13.061 --> 01:09:17.530
and the word of God being the Koran from eternally,
uh,

991
01:09:17.531 --> 01:09:21.080
oh God.
And the word of God being car,

992
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.860
the Christ or et Cetera.
We all have the word made flesh.

993
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:30.070
We all have some kind of idea of the tendon where one or the knowledge of God is

994
01:09:30.381 --> 01:09:35.360
a father or as a spirit,
ways in which we can understand,

995
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:39.440
uh,
this,
this,
uh,
this thing we call,

996
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:44.030
I don't mean it reverently we call God.
It's a,
it's a,
so that's,
yeah,

997
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:45.170
that's the response.

998
01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:47.543
<v 3>Ask.</v>

999
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:54.250
Please send an answer to the other question you were saying

1000
01:09:56.530 --> 01:10:01.530
all is good in some sense because it leads to more self knowledge and I

1001
01:10:03.611 --> 01:10:07.720
understand how it's different from Adam is different from Ulysses or that he is

1002
01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:10.780
trying to go somewhere like he's trying to become more like God.

1003
01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.720
And that's good because it's a definite end,

1004
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.990
but it still seems that it's a means of trying to achieve that end is wrong.

1005
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:19.480
Like if he's trying to become more like God,
fine,

1006
01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.980
like grasping instead of like we've been talking a lot about how the way off is

1007
01:10:23.981 --> 01:10:26.020
actually the way down,
not so essential.

1008
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:28.690
And if he's choosing the wrong way to get to his end,

1009
01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.170
if that changes the end itself so that he's not even really,
you know,

1010
01:10:32.171 --> 01:10:36.070
Adam is not even like having the proper and in districts for notch either,

1011
01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:38.740
you know,
like it changes because he's going about it in the wrong way.

1012
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.510
And just how that kind of reflects on whether the fall,
winter,
Dante,

1013
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.380
thanks to the fall itself,
he was like,
good.

1014
01:10:44.381 --> 01:10:45.950
I was actually leading to cell phones.

1015
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.740
<v 0>No,
it's very clear.
The,
uh,
the question is,
uh,
uh,</v>

1016
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:54.140
the,
the,
the earlier question,

1017
01:10:54.141 --> 01:10:56.860
I suppose it was about [inaudible] thinks of a trinity.
Uh,

1018
01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:01.190
and now the question is going back to other poet of,
uh,

1019
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:04.550
Adam and my suggestion that the,
the,

1020
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:08.820
the fall is good.
Uh,
and though,

1021
01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:14.460
because ultimately items seems to be wanting to reach God,

1022
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.580
and I made a contrast to Ulysses,

1023
01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:22.060
and the limitation of Ulysses quest is that he's really does not know whether

1024
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:27.120
he's driven by curiosity.
That's what I meant.
Um,
which we could talk about,

1025
01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:31.770
uh,
uh,
this,
this,
uh,
evil curiosity.
Uh,

1026
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.600
so,
but if,
uh,
if the movement toward the,
uh,

1027
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.390
told the good is bad because after all,
Adam,

1028
01:11:39.391 --> 01:11:41.400
let's choose to trespass the boundaries.

1029
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:45.220
Why should that really be thought as as good?
Is that?
It was,

1030
01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:49.200
that was the question.
Really.
Yeah.
Uh,
well,
the,
uh,

1031
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.180
let me just restate this issue.

1032
01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.620
The problem with Adam with them sort of,
first of all,
with Ulysses,

1033
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:59.730
I called it now the curiosity,
which as you know,

1034
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:02.550
eventually we'll become good,
uh,

1035
01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:07.260
in the renaissance scientific curiosity.
Uh,
that's the good thing.

1036
01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.101
In fact,

1037
01:12:08.101 --> 01:12:12.570
I have a young colleague who is writing a thesis about curiosity book about

1038
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:16.590
curiosity.
She has written a thesis about curiosity.
Linking it with,
uh,

1039
01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:20.730
a women's careers is a very interesting thesis to say that women are really

1040
01:12:20.731 --> 01:12:24.120
smarter than men because they've been attacked for being curious.

1041
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:29.180
So she has found Renaissance Texas where some written by women who go on making

1042
01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:31.350
that kind of climb.
I think it's a great idea,

1043
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:34.620
but how did dank understand curiosity?

1044
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:38.520
How do the fathers of the church understand,
why is it bad?

1045
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.760
Because that is the trait of Adam because curiosity has a particular quality

1046
01:12:44.821 --> 01:12:45.390
about it.

1047
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:48.600
It's something that continues this whole understanding that there's a little

1048
01:12:48.601 --> 01:12:51.330
curious,
I'm going to give you well into the 18th century.

1049
01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:56.070
The curiosity is bad because he uses up,

1050
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.391
you know,

1051
01:12:57.391 --> 01:13:02.250
curiosity has a salt of a restlessness.

1052
01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.680
Uh,
within it.
I am curious,

1053
01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:07.470
have a particular ability to observe it and I move on to something else.

1054
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.020
I literally consume,

1055
01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:15.390
I use up in particular object and devaluate in that process.

1056
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.600
That's really what made it so,
uh,
so bad.

1057
01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:23.160
Ulysses who goes from one thing to another and is always open,

1058
01:13:23.190 --> 01:13:27.460
fascinating figure of the renaissance spirit of discovery that,
uh,

1059
01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:31.940
but that's really what,
uh,
and does this,
this,
this,
this,
uh,

1060
01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:34.050
element homos of desire,

1061
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.800
a kind of a figure of a in I on one to make using this,
uh,

1062
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:40.830
uh,
to bad mouth a unisex,

1063
01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:44.550
but I figure of this way of thinking of the curiosity of your races is really

1064
01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:49.020
the don't Juwuan know who goes from one woman to another in an endless movement

1065
01:13:49.021 --> 01:13:54.021
of curiosity and knowledge that he's driven by knowledge to get to know certain

1066
01:13:54.061 --> 01:13:58.950
particular,
uh,
situations and uh,
and people,
Adam,

1067
01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:01.200
to go back to the question about Adam,

1068
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:06.300
I'm only giving you Dantas reading Dante's reading.

1069
01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:09.780
He distinguishes very carefully between the testing,

1070
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:14.960
the tasting of the fruit and the trespassing of the mark that,

1071
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:20.550
that just passing with a mark meant you cannot really violate the boundaries

1072
01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:24.820
that I want to place between you and myself.

1073
01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:28.990
Because once you get to know yourself for what you are,

1074
01:14:28.991 --> 01:14:32.620
you may get to know me.
That's what the part of the violation of boundaries,

1075
01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:36.360
you may get to know me for what I am.
So it's,
it's,
it's,

1076
01:14:36.361 --> 01:14:41.020
it's a wall that protects both the essence of the divinity and the specific

1077
01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:45.630
quality of the human that is,
uh,
is at stake.
Um,

1078
01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:51.100
he,
uh,
Adam eats,
which means that he wants to grow in knowledge and Dante says,

1079
01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:53.740
that's not the issue.
That was not a problem with that.

1080
01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:55.390
I want to grow in knowledge.

1081
01:14:55.930 --> 01:15:00.930
The consequence of that growth in knowledge was the trespassing actually very

1082
01:15:02.651 --> 01:15:07.600
well be the cause,
the trespassing of the boundary head.

1083
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.310
He really grown.
That's really a,

1084
01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.990
an acceptable aim.

1085
01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:17.260
You have to grow in knowledge and willing to say about Adam.

1086
01:15:17.261 --> 01:15:19.240
Exactly the things that you may recall,

1087
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:23.770
I said about the sin of pride in when we discussed the cantaloupe 10,

1088
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:28.750
11,
and 12.
It's good that you have this love of excellence and love of the,

1089
01:15:28.751 --> 01:15:30.430
of the growth of your own mind.

1090
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.970
The consequence of it or the,
uh,
the,
the,

1091
01:15:34.971 --> 01:15:39.971
the flip side of this quest for more knowledge is the violation of boundaries.

1092
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:43.390
And that has to be reestablished.

1093
01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:47.650
The fall of man is only every establishment of a boundaries.

1094
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.580
It's Nori way of mortifying the quest for knowledge.

1095
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:56.230
Okay.
I'm restating what different terms of slightly different terms,

1096
01:15:56.231 --> 01:15:57.190
what I said before,

1097
01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:01.870
but I think that's really crucial distinction and I would ask you to try to

1098
01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:05.830
think that I see a difference between the two.
Uh,

1099
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.980
the two situations.
I hope you will too.

1100
01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.080
I'll have time for another.
No,
we don't.
Okay.
See you next time.
