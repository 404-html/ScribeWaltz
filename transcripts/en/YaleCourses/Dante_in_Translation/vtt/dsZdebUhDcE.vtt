WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.300
Last time we looked at the candles of the sun.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.740
Uh,
she's the Canterbury systematic.
And so,

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.113
uh,

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.150
and we discussed actually the variety of a philosophical,

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.940
strange,
philosophical,

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.220
theological and philosophical ideas that compose Dante circle of knowledge,

7
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:31.800
this,
this encyclopedic commpass or what's,
what's,
what's worth knowing.

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.300
Uh,
today we move into the heaven of Mars,

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.710
which is as you know,
uh,
the god of war,

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.890
that the name of the planet,
um,

11
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.400
and it's the heaven of music than tilling Mars and music because harmony out of

12
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:57.561
the belief that harmony is shut the meeting point or the result of a discordant

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.400
elements,
uh,

14
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.430
kind of Concordia at Concord in a tuning of hearts reached through this golden

15
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.540
tolerances.
The,
the,
uh,
the discordant elements can be different sounds.

16
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.980
It can be the passions within us up need,
tempering,
uh,

17
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.200
and so on.
Um,
this can,
is,

18
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:26.610
can be read profitably and you can do some of this on your own,

19
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.780
uh,
in conjunction or will allude to it in passing in conjunction with Canto,

20
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:34.770
for instance,
a 15 of health.
We are in 15,
16,

21
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:38.460
and 17 of paradise.
You could read it,
15,

22
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:42.210
with the encounter with a damp,
his own,
uh,

23
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.790
ancestor catch a weeder.

24
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.150
And so inevitably the reference to Brunetto Latini literally imposes itself on

25
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.760
us.
It's,
it compels us.

26
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:58.761
We are compelled to draw parallels and see differences between the two ancestors

27
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:04.530
who claim make different claims on this,
uh,
uh,

28
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.520
descendant,

29
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.630
intellectual and a dynastic descendant.

30
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.670
Who is Dante himself.
Uh,

31
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.340
you could also look at it from other many other points of view.
The,
the,

32
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.230
the point of view for instance,
of uh,
uh,

33
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.260
the other references to war and the kind of the crashing sounds throughout in

34
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:26.070
fair know that Dante producers,

35
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.000
if I had worked to give a title to my remarks today,

36
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.740
which I really don't because I think it's,
it's,
it's the variety of,
uh,

37
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.120
uh,
suggestions coming from,
from a Canto takes over,
uh,

38
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.890
the desire to,
to be,
to schematic and thematic.

39
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.550
But if I were to give a title today,
I think it's really very encompassing.

40
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.490
I would call it self and history.

41
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.980
These seem to be the most,
uh,
uh,
the strongest,
uh,

42
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.220
uh,
questions or Dante racists.
They are not high.
The terms of question,

43
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.650
self and history,

44
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.090
the relationship between the two may be new to us here,

45
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.490
but we certainly have been talking about the history before.
Uh,

46
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.510
the last time we did was in the discussion of Canto six of paradise where Dante

47
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.960
gives in the heaven of mercury.
Dante gives this overall,

48
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.520
uh,
history of,
of Rome,
uh,

49
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.120
its humble beginnings and then the,
the,

50
00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:30.670
the construction of the empire and the crisis of the empire.

51
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.480
So that's really one.
Uh,
one thing that you,
one thing that,
you know,

52
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.560
the issue of self in itself is something we've been discussing ever since we

53
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:43.561
started with the Vita Nuova with the idea of a lyrical self over self who

54
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:47.890
removes himself as you recall.
That's what we mean by a lyrical self,

55
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:50.800
removes him oneself from the world of history,

56
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.280
the contingencies of time,
uh,
the,

57
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.310
the viscous realities of the city and takes shelter in the,

58
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.930
in the Chamber of his imagination,
uh,
in the world of,
of uh,

59
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.880
his ideas,
his dreams and memories.
And there he constructs his own self.

60
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:14.080
That was the point of the Vita Nuova.
When we begin reading the divine comedy,

61
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.290
I insisted on the autobiographical focus with which at least the divine comedy

62
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:23.950
begins.
This is his story.
This is his,
uh,
uh,
unique,
uh,

63
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.450
uh,
experience,
uh,
the pilgrims home Dante's own unique experience.

64
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.130
And that seems to have come to an end with the purgatorio 30.
When,

65
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.920
uh,
finally the normal of the self is sealed.

66
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:40.220
They should remember within mentioning of the name Dante,
uh,
then,
uh,
uh,
uh,

67
00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:43.630
a new phase begins in Dante's construction,

68
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:47.050
which is more educational,
more speculative,

69
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.610
which is really the world or paradise.

70
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.290
But so we talk about self and history in a way that maybe Dante's never quite

71
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.410
coupled the two,
the two terms before he does.

72
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:59.470
So in Canto 15,
16,

73
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.480
and 17 of paradise,

74
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.960
this is really the double focus around which everything,
uh,
uh,

75
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.370
moves.
Let me give you,
I will,

76
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.980
I will give you a reading of the various details,

77
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:15.560
but let me tell you an idea of what I have in mind.
The first of all,

78
00:05:15.561 --> 00:05:17.800
in the way of thinking about this issue,

79
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.190
I want to draw your attention to the presence of some mythic mythological

80
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:27.460
figures that Dante Dante is evoking.

81
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.220
And they're very different among themselves,
but their whole,
their whole,

82
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.300
it's a way of reflecting on Dante's own idea of selfhood and Dan,

83
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.650
his own relationship to an ancestor,
his own private history,
uh,

84
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.430
who in turn has had a very complex and for Dante,

85
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:49.180
no blink relationship to history.
He is a crusader.

86
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.250
He fought in the second crusade,
we 1149 and that the emperor Conrad,

87
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.400
he's proud of this belonging to the Crusader there has to fight as a crusader.

88
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.300
So she said a version of the relationship,

89
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.210
one hairs or things one has with history,

90
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.930
both catcher weeders and Dante's or relationship to his grandfather.

91
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.340
But let me tell you,
first of all,

92
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:13.850
this mythic figures and then we'll talk about them.

93
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:17.830
Dante is begin with Canto 15.
Uh,

94
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.270
I will just remarked in passing,
I will not,

95
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.100
I will leave it to you to do more diligently than we could do here at the

96
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:26.780
presence of music or metaphors,

97
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:31.781
which is not surprising in the heaven of the new music gracious will into which

98
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:33.740
this is the beginning of Canto 15.

99
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.720
Rightly breeding love always resolves itself as the cupidity into a new will

100
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.950
impose silence.
That's sweet liar.
This is the,
uh,

101
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.360
the soul as a tech becomes a kind of musical instrument,
a sweet life,

102
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.200
and still the sacred strings which are right hand of heaven.

103
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.350
Titans had relaxes and so on.
Uh,
and then this,
uh,
uh,

104
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.810
and the gym at one point,
this is line 20,

105
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.090
and the gym did not leave its ribbon,

106
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.950
but then across the radio strip has seemed fire behind the alabaster with such

107
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:07.784
affection.

108
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.480
Didn't cases shade reached out if may trust our greatest muse when it Elysium he

109
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:19.370
knew his son.
And then in Latin,

110
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.410
a quotation all sang with males or Super Infousa Grotzia they secret TB

111
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.950
[inaudible] Janow recruiter.

112
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.870
To whom has this privilege I've ever been given of having the gates of heaven

113
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.830
open to him twice.
That's,
that's,
that's see the light spoke to us.

114
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.570
So this is the first mythical reverence.
We are really,
we could just say,
well,

115
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:42.230
uh,

116
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.640
Dante of course at the very beginning of inferno makes a reference to Paul and

117
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:50.360
then he is disavowing any,
any,
uh,

118
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:54.410
strict connection with their memory.
You remember when he resists,
uh,

119
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.440
the core to this huge risky enterprise of going through hell that comes to him

120
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:02.990
from Virgil.
He says,
I'm not an ears.
I'm not poor.

121
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.260
Why should I do what you are calling me to perform a and they need yours is a

122
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:14.570
one who had visited hades to meet the shade of his father and Kaiser's now

123
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:16.700
recall there.
And of course,
uh,
uh,

124
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.650
Paul is the one who had been taken wrapped to the third heaven,
uh,

125
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.680
maybe a third mode of vision that allowed him to and kept quiet about it to see

126
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:31.780
God face to face,
but,
and cases,
uh,

127
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.060
the encounter between on cases and,
and,
and,
and,

128
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.080
and then ears here stands for result of relationship of an ears that in years

129
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.110
has with history and he is,

130
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.140
goes to hades in order to find out what the purposes are for his journey from

131
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:51.830
Troy toward an unknown land.
And he discovered this.
So it's a,

132
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.980
it's a way of unkindness discovers about he from his own father that the presage

133
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.080
the prophetic,
if you wish,

134
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:05.760
announcement of what it is for him to be part of history,

135
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.160
somehow a definition of sales.

136
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.790
That's what you'll find with an crisis engineered can be understood.
This,

137
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.791
that the sense that one hardest one belong in history and one belongs in history

138
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.600
as part of a providential pattern,

139
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.960
as the idea that this was a destined empire,

140
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.200
that he on Kaiser's head to found and the new history would start so that he

141
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.630
confirms his attachment to the dead father.

142
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.850
And yet he starts now as the,
uh,

143
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.540
point of a beginning for a new history.

144
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:43.140
So this is one way of understanding an epic,

145
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.440
the epic account and myth of one's own self belonging in the world of history.

146
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:54.180
This is mythical.
We move on and this really,
uh,
uh,
a bit,

147
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.870
uh,
sort of a reverse or of this,
uh,

148
00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.400
I will come back into Qantas 16.

149
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:04.670
Dante gives a chronicle of the city of Florence.
This we'll say is for.

150
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.790
So,
uh,
he's,
he's making problematical to us.
The idea of what,

151
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.090
where are we to understand this itself?
Yeah.

152
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:16.530
This is not clear what we had to understand this herself in the,
in the,
in the,

153
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:20.970
in the Vita Nuova,
the self is this nexus of memories,

154
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.130
fantasies,
and the will to write poetry.
And in that sense,

155
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:29.730
the texts constitutes oneself interests of I am myself.

156
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:31.470
I'm the author of this text.

157
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:34.650
This becomes a point of reference and this is what I am.

158
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:38.820
The emergent portrait that I give of myself gives you an idea of who I am.

159
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.560
It doubles me,
it perpetuates me.
It's a poetic version of self,

160
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.230
but we don't know yet what,
what are we to take us.
So,

161
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.680
and crisis has a different understanding of himself.

162
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.660
I am who I am only because I belong to a larger pattern of history.

163
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.890
And this larger pattern of history is going to be me as a founder,

164
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.050
a founder of a,
of a new way of looking at the world,

165
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:05.800
the founder of,
uh,
of Rome.

166
00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:10.801
And he gets the message from his own father and Canto 16 and I will not go into

167
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:15.780
this as I'm,
I'm,
I'm pursuing the theme of the mythic references.
Dante goes on,

168
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.760
uh,
really,
uh,
thinking about,
uh,
writing a chronicle is,
I will say no.

169
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.930
The city of Florence,

170
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.150
one for frauds is famous for its chroniclers that beginning in the middle of

171
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:26.870
agents in Deca.

172
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.810
So his history then the other problematical notion to be understood this,

173
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.700
the local events or is it to be understood the way I'm,

174
00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:37.990
Kaiser's understands it as a myth,
uh,

175
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.040
that somehow his assault of a parodic dramatic value in which can regulate and

176
00:11:44.221 --> 00:11:45.390
also,
uh,

177
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.480
a range are we can go on a ranging our lives according to the demands of that

178
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:55.230
myth.
Uh,
Dante would not answer this question correctly here,
uh,

179
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.360
but he does talk about all the,

180
00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:02.080
the Florentine families and talks about them in an electronic manner.

181
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.060
This to say that all decade they are all finished and extinct.

182
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.820
So whatever value of his history of my head,
it's an a gigantic,

183
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.290
a commemoration of the past catcher.
Weda by the way,

184
00:12:15.291 --> 00:12:18.940
is very elated at the idea that the son,
the grandson,

185
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.390
the sentence wants to find out about the past.

186
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.370
We move then into Qantas,

187
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:28.380
have a team where I think we find something about this whole issue about the

188
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.870
history and the self.
It begins in a,
in a,

189
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.040
in a peculiar manner.
Look at the beginning of canto 17.

190
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.020
The reference is really,
it's a long,
pretty fantastic,
it's a crystal can group,

191
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.180
very faster construction,
uh,

192
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.240
where you're a Turner along turn of a phrase to or for the pilgrim to describe

193
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:53.731
himself and himself in terms of fate on the famous figure as you know from the

194
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:58.450
classical myth who challenges a Paulo,

195
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.940
we saw him in the corresponding canto 17 of,
in fairness,

196
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.700
there was an illusion there to feta.

197
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:09.100
So a little touch of the symmetry of,
uh,
of cancers.

198
00:13:09.101 --> 00:13:12.310
But that's really secondary at this point.
Look at what the,
the,

199
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.200
the scriptures like him who came to Clementa to be reassured about that,

200
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.120
which he had heard against themselves.
That is owning,
first of all,

201
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:27.050
it's a story that of the uncertainty of fair towns,
descendants,
uh,

202
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.140
that his father was a polo.

203
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.350
So he reassured himself him who still makes fathers wary with their sons.

204
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.830
Hmm.
This isn't the Canto Kutcher Weda what is the real relationship?

205
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:42.950
That's what that is asking that I have to this noble,
heroic figure,
Oh,

206
00:13:42.951 --> 00:13:47.500
whom I'm proud.
But what is the actual relationship that joins me to them?

207
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:48.251
Such was,

208
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:52.930
I in such a was perceived to be both but Beatrice and by the Holy Land that had

209
00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:56.260
changed its place for me before.

210
00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.350
So he's happy that he seems to have to reaffirm,
uh,
this,

211
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.620
this,
uh,
uh,

212
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.520
genealogical lines or history now becomes no longer a chronicle,

213
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.700
becomes now a genealogy can,
can we,

214
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.910
can we establish some certainties that we belong into a junior logical line?

215
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:21.100
Can that really account for us and for who we are?
So this is the issue,

216
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.330
uh,
that Dante is raising.

217
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.600
The failure of Phaeton is a tragic figure because it introduces the possibility

218
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:29.680
of an Dante says there's this,

219
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:34.390
that's what makes fathers and the area of their sons all the time.

220
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:34.960
Uh,

221
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.880
the idea that the Sun Juan's talk do the father wants to go beyond the fathers

222
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.470
and that the,
the,

223
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:46.610
the idea of tragic transgression that I can exist and therefore breach that line

224
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:50.620
of continuity between in the generations,
across the generations.

225
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.160
That's one over there.

226
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.900
The other one is much more tragic than before the canto 17,

227
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:02.000
as you know,
goes on discussing,
uh,
among other things.

228
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.970
The,
let me read the passage.

229
00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:09.460
I think that this is much more sparingly.
There is to say,
uh,

230
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.180
without to my despair.
Um,

231
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.200
he says much better than anybody else can contingency.

232
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.380
This is line 36 contingency,

233
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:23.650
which does not extend beyond the volume of the material world is all depicted in

234
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:27.110
the turn of visually.
See,
this is another way,

235
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.330
still another way of understanding history,

236
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.230
that there is a contingency that the world of contingency contingency can be

237
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:37.520
subsumed within a larger transcendent paradigm.

238
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:41.000
Uh,
that seems to be the older of necessity.

239
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:46.270
That contingent world is linked to the volume where all things are present in

240
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:50.440
the terminal vision.
Yet that's not deriving,
as I said the anymore.

241
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.250
Then that's a ship that drops.

242
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:57.850
Is there some autonomy to contingency or things determined but the older of

243
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:00.500
necessity,
a downstream from the icing,

244
00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:04.760
which is mirrored from thence as sweet harmony.
Last time I mentioned it,

245
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.450
musical language,
musical lexicon are bounds.
Here,

246
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.710
comes from an Oregon to the ear are,
comes to my site.

247
00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:17.000
The time that is in store for the,
uh,
I,

248
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:22.040
I enjoy very much the implicit connection between time and music,

249
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.660
music becoming,
uh,
the,
the,

250
00:16:26.661 --> 00:16:29.390
the metaphor that makes,
uh,

251
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.650
makes a horrible time itself.
Oh,
uh,

252
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:38.630
prime is constitutive of music of course,
but it really makes it,
we,

253
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.920
it's an acoustic,

254
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:44.410
a translation of the silent Arrow of a,

255
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.880
of time.
And now this is the,
the other,

256
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.390
the third mythological reference and crisis,

257
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.180
the tragic story.

258
00:16:52.181 --> 00:16:56.600
And Kaiser's who recognizes himself in the history and in the break,

259
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:01.490
in the continuity with his father.
And in the break with Troy,
uh,
from his father,

260
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.550
from Troy,
and the beginning of a new,
um,

261
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.880
let's say history fair town,

262
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:11.510
who turns against his father and Burns the heavens in doing so that they say

263
00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.520
it's a famous metamorphoses of the origin of the Milky Way.
As you know,

264
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:18.980
the Milky Way was understood this,
the scorched,

265
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.040
the scorched heaven's a cosmological disaster,

266
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.570
that it was happening on account of,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

267
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:30.380
the rivalry between father and son.
And now the third is as he potters,

268
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:35.470
I say Polish the drop the story of the Phedre.
And I have to tell you this,

269
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:40.790
as he Polatis was driven from Athens on account of his rule and perfidious step

270
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.130
mother,
so much,

271
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.530
so much dao be driven from Florence.

272
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.750
This is special one ounces,

273
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.020
the exile as the fatality,
uh,

274
00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:58.920
that is,
uh,

275
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.810
hovering over Dante and for which he has to prepare himself and exile where he

276
00:18:03.811 --> 00:18:06.710
see what it implies.
Also sort of,
uh,
uh,

277
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:11.100
necessarily detachment from one's family,
one's country,

278
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.280
once hall,

279
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.360
all the possible lines that tend to join us and limit a limit us too.

280
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.990
So Dante is not quite in Kaiser's,
he's not out to,
uh,

281
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.820
establish an empire.
He's not like a,
uh,
the photon.

282
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:31.650
He doesn't,
not one to overdue at least,
uh,
uh,
literally the,

283
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:33.330
the father and now to see what to Swiss,

284
00:18:33.331 --> 00:18:38.100
he pollatos as a politics driven from Athens on account of his cool and

285
00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:39.870
perfidious stepmother phedre.

286
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.650
So must now be driven from Florence.

287
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.870
This is determined,

288
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.470
nay is already contrived because difference between determined and contrived and

289
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:56.940
the conjunction between the,
the older of eternal,

290
00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.230
the terminal,
uh,
destinies and the contrivance,

291
00:19:01.231 --> 00:19:06.030
the older oh contingency.
The maneuvers in Ferno maneuvers against,

292
00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:06.540
uh,

293
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.540
against the pilgrim and will soon be accomplished by him who meditates it in the

294
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:18.021
place where Christ is bought and sold all day to blame in the Cuban crash or

295
00:19:18.671 --> 00:19:21.630
follow the injured side is always,

296
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.320
but the vengeance shall be testimony to the truth that dispenses it.

297
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.710
Thou that's the announcement of the exile.

298
00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:31.440
Thou shall leave everything loved most dearly.

299
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.790
And this is the shaft which the bowel of exiles shoots first.

300
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.770
That should prove how sold is the taste of another man's bread.

301
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:46.130
And how hard is the way up and down and other men's salary

302
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:52.020
and other men's,
uh,
stairs,
uh,
excuse me here.

303
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.630
There is a terrible mistake that saint Clair makes cause Dante's very carefully

304
00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.560
aligned.
60.
He writes Margaret,
he writes,

305
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.620
Look Shanda,
it's sully Butler through scarlet,

306
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:11.630
which means going down and up and your translator.

307
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:16.800
My translator here has it the other way around because he's following your
logic,

308
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.160
which is all we would call it naturalistic logic.
You know,

309
00:20:20.161 --> 00:20:25.050
you go to the palace of uh,
uh,
the Duke,

310
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:29.700
you go up,
you climb the stairs,
and then you come down off the,

311
00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:34.701
you have been begging for some charity and then you have taken your more sort of

312
00:20:35.311 --> 00:20:39.000
bread and you can go down.
But that's not what Dante says.
He says,

313
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:44.001
you first got down and then you go up and I hesitate to gloss it for you because

314
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:50.260
I think it's a little bit clear walk us kind of thing.

315
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:54.460
He needs that for him to go to go up,

316
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.990
which was really,
the dissent was lowering himself.
It's a little bit of a,

317
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.440
if you wish,
it would seem to be a dissenting to pry into humility,

318
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.460
but at the same time,
because he's reversing their natural odor,

319
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.380
the ordinary older of the action,
it's really an assenting to pride,

320
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.720
you know,
for me to go up here is,

321
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.900
it's like going down really,

322
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.410
I'm really degrading myself.
So,

323
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:22.090
but it's a very interesting line,

324
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:25.420
our acknowledgement of a sense of gratitude,

325
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.320
a sense of the spiritual ascent being,
uh,
uh,

326
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:34.390
inevitably first a descent into the self and then becoming in a sense.

327
00:21:34.391 --> 00:21:38.100
So it's really,
yeah,
it turns the whole thing around,
uh,

328
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.680
was up and down in other men stairs and that would show way heaviest on the

329
00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:46.681
shoulder is that wicked and senseless company with which thou shall fall into

330
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:50.200
that valley.
We shall become holy and grateful,

331
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:55.090
quite mad and furious against the,
so the,
the story of,
um,

332
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:55.870
of,

333
00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.870
of Hippolytus is the story of their stepmother to go back to this idea of self,

334
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.910
uh,
it's the story of a step mother who is,
uh,
uh,

335
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.210
trying to seduce Hippolytus.
She's married to thesis,
uh,

336
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.930
and he runs away.

337
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:19.140
So the family becoming the destructive are the form of a destructive desires

338
00:22:21.881 --> 00:22:22.390
within,

339
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:27.390
within that family forces him to go away or run away and dies.

340
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.170
And so you wonder why Dante,
uh,
is,
uh,

341
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.070
taking on and thinking of this tragic figure,
uh,

342
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:40.170
to compare himself to his exile had this potentially destructive and tragic

343
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.970
consequences that I happened to reporters.
At any rate,

344
00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:48.550
we have three great images,

345
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.700
but which Dante's thinking about what is the self and how is the self to be

346
00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:58.300
editor,
how does the self enter the world of history?

347
00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.420
What examples did he give the can?

348
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.580
When we talk about any of the examples in the past,

349
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:06.850
I think that this is really the extraordinary,
uh,

350
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.790
the burden actually have a,

351
00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:12.910
a text that I have been talking about in the past and it's the confessions of

352
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:13.744
Saint Augustan.

353
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:18.400
That text is about the question of how the self is related to history.

354
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.650
And Dante,
this agrees with Augusta.
Um,

355
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:27.150
for Ferguson,
the self is one that takes refuge,

356
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.960
the interiority of oneself and goes home.
Then,
uh,

357
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.080
uh,
at the time with the time of the conversion,

358
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.700
he can now rejoice in history and that is taught to them to clear the way of

359
00:23:39.701 --> 00:23:40.660
entering history.

360
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:46.140
The other Ma Motif that you can have is the Motif of the other model you have is

361
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:51.281
the model of catcher reader who goes onto a self sacrifice of himself for the

362
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:55.460
benefit of a larger,
uh,

363
00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:00.440
cause the cause of the Christian crusade in,
uh,
in,
uh,

364
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.930
in Jerusalem.
Um,
uh,

365
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.690
then there is the Aeneid that presents the I,

366
00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:10.460
the idea of how the self enters the world of history.
It's political,

367
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.120
political activity and time to really,
uh,

368
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.560
sort of rejects all of them.
Uh,

369
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.970
this prophecy of exile with which can two 17 and gives a entirely different

370
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:29.030
twist to the cells relationship to history.

371
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.720
I inevitably I will belong in history.

372
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.040
There is no other way Dante says,
for the self to exist,

373
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:40.700
if not a,
by measuring oneself with the historical,

374
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.410
the pressures of historical realities.
But my own relationship to it,

375
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.410
it's not that we're over that of belonging is as,

376
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.390
as a new year's does into the world of history,
uh,
with feeling that I am,

377
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:58.850
the political world is going to be my way out of this maze.

378
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.070
It's not going to be the one like fatten and it's not going to be the one

379
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.360
represented by Hippocrates.
It's the exhilaration self,

380
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:13.510
an idea of a selfless inata this location from the world of research.

381
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.690
But then how are we to understand this,
this location?

382
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.960
Is this location a way of actually removing oneself altogether or just saying

383
00:25:23.451 --> 00:25:28.270
that I'm out of place just saying that I'm out of time and somehow I have uh,

384
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:33.140
a relationship to history,
which is maybe polemical,
maybe,

385
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.030
uh,
uh,
arguably,
uh,

386
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.450
constructives and if so,

387
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.560
what is the way I think that we have to reread now the three cancers in some

388
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:47.050
details and,
and a,
and we come up with an answer.
You see them,
what is a,

389
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.860
what the issues here are,

390
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.900
let me start with Qantas 15 and see what Dante is specifically doing above and

391
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:55.470
beyond this,
um,

392
00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:01.380
this overall pattern that he's putting forth in,

393
00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:06.380
uh,
in Canto in the various candles.
You will,
you will see how encanto 15,

394
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.420
the,
um,

395
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.830
let's go back to Kansas City and you will see that the relationship to catch a

396
00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:17.831
reader is also played the team or logically how often Dante's peak planning with

397
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:20.210
the metaphor wings in Italian.

398
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:23.960
It's Allie Allie Uri allegation.
That was the name,

399
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:28.070
the bearers of wings.
So the,
for instance,
line 52,

400
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:29.660
I speak of the uh,

401
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.740
thanks to her who cruddy with wings for the lofty flight.

402
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.500
Or a little later on,
Brian 70,

403
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:40.880
I turned to be a Beatrice and she heard before I spoken smell to be assigned

404
00:26:40.881 --> 00:26:45.881
that made the wings grow my will and the later align 80 many,

405
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:49.320
many times that he stops after the third time.
Uh,

406
00:26:49.321 --> 00:26:53.310
for this reason that it's playing to you are not equally feathered in the wings,

407
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.320
uh,
et cetera.
Uh,

408
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.560
the first thing that they do though with the exchange in the encounter with,
uh,

409
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.220
with,
with catcher Weda is focused on,
uh,

410
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:09.530
the city of Florence of old and the vocation of the Golden Age,

411
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.080
certain golden age where it kind of Utopian construction.
These are the lines.

412
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.560
Florence page two lines can to 15 lines 94 and 97 and following Florence within

413
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:28.791
her ancient circle from which she still takes tears and knowns.

414
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.540
These are the times of the day,
uh,

415
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.600
rung by the bills of the nearby church.

416
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:41.250
I bowed in peace,
so ba and chased.

417
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.630
She had no bracelet,
no Tiara nor embroidered gowns,

418
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:50.330
not girdle that should be seen more than there were no yet.

419
00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.091
The daughter,

420
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:55.860
her birth put the father in fear for age undoubtedly not part from the you

421
00:27:55.861 --> 00:28:00.030
measure on the one side and the other.
She had no houses,

422
00:28:00.031 --> 00:28:01.590
empty or family.

423
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:07.100
No heads has Annapolis yet come there to show what could be done in the chamber.

424
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.540
This is a kind of infernal.
Um,

425
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.960
in from vocations you are really thinking of,
uh,

426
00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.910
of clear powertrain Canto five.
You are thinking of Semiramis all those uh,

427
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.740
uh,
this,
this figures of uh,
uh,

428
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:27.950
the chaos of the appetites and are being recalled now in uh,

429
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.030
in this context nor yet.

430
00:28:30.031 --> 00:28:35.031
They do chuck [inaudible] and so on and goes on talking about a catcher with his

431
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:39.480
own birth and then say,
let me focus a little bit on this,

432
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:44.250
the metaphors of,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,
of Florence.

433
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.690
We should,
first of all,

434
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:50.930
the Florence is evoked within a closed circle of self sufficiency and called

435
00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.340
within range circle.
The Circle,

436
00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:01.230
the circularity of the city also implies it's kind of plenitude and the sort of

437
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:04.850
uh,
uh,
uh,
boundary.
Uh,
uh,

438
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:09.590
Dante does not have an idea of uh,
an expanding city.
He just,
he,

439
00:29:09.591 --> 00:29:14.220
he enjoys the,
uh,
the,
the,
and enlightened projects.

440
00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:19.221
His idea of a city held within its own perimeter from which she still takes

441
00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:24.831
tears and knows the language of a space in the language of time follows as if

442
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.290
everything could be measured and everything could be interrelated.

443
00:29:31.291 --> 00:29:32.880
One is interrelated with the other.

444
00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:41.130
And then this language of a foreign system as a Soba chased Pete and be so bold

445
00:29:45.921 --> 00:29:49.130
in peace,
sober and chased,

446
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.230
implying that here at least he believes,

447
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.800
and it's lingering in him the memory of the famous idea of the so called body

448
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.720
politic that you have heard.
You know,
the,

449
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.730
the idea of the organic structure of the city is made of interdependent parts

450
00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:14.910
just as space and time indicate the interdependent coordinates within which the

451
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:19.510
life of the city,
uh,
hair can be recalled.
And now,

452
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:24.520
and then this is followed in turn by a sequence of another for us all in the

453
00:30:24.521 --> 00:30:27.970
negatives.
She had no bracelet,
no Tiara.

454
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.360
This is the city dressed like a woman.
Dante.

455
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:36.810
You know that one way of thinking about cosmetics is also to think of it.

456
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.980
They used to think of cosmetics as bad rhetoric,
uh,

457
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:47.040
perverse forms of seduction by means of which one could this figure the natural,

458
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:52.810
uh,
continents and beauty of,
uh,
of the,
the human form.

459
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.780
So Dante goes on in a sense,
by repeating this negatives,

460
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.270
literally this processing,

461
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.220
literally stripping that woman of all this super fluid is all this.
Uh,

462
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:04.061
uh,
this,

463
00:31:04.061 --> 00:31:08.560
this complications and bring the city back to its home simplicity,

464
00:31:08.561 --> 00:31:11.800
its original chastity and simplicity.

465
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:17.080
Let me just see this passage.
She had no TRRS note,
no embroidered gowns,

466
00:31:17.081 --> 00:31:19.630
no girdle,
nor yet the daughter,
her birth,

467
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.800
but the father in fear as she had no houses empty.
Uh,

468
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.480
etc. So this is a,
uh,

469
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:31.740
this is the golden age is that's done to really believe in this myth of the

470
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:36.430
golden age.
Is it,
this is,
what do we call a,
there is a rhetorical,

471
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:41.200
rhetorical phrase for this sort of moving all the,
uh,

472
00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.340
uh,
praising the by ground times.
It's the,

473
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.680
the so called tell that CEO that means your praise,
uh,
uh,

474
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.360
of the past,
uh,

475
00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:00.060
which is more of a editorial strategy to denounce the imperfections of today.

476
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.261
It affect,

477
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:07.261
Dante has a radical he polemical view of the Utopian Spirit,

478
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:12.160
this idea of perfection,
that,
or the claim of a perfection,
uh,

479
00:32:12.161 --> 00:32:17.050
that we,
we,
we,
we pushed back into the past,
uh,
because it's no longer with us,

480
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:21.670
but we want to fantasize about.
And nonetheless,
he,
he's,
he's still PR.

481
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:26.730
He preserves it because you topia can become a kind of normative idea by means

482
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:31.410
of which we can alter the configuration of our own contingencies.

483
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.240
Our own history.
It made utopia store exists.

484
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:39.270
They may even be dangerous and people can claim a lot of interesting figures in

485
00:32:39.591 --> 00:32:42.590
the history of ideas claim that utopias are,

486
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:47.390
are dangerous constructions because the four mental illusions about who we are,

487
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.470
and yet they become for Dante necessary.
Because we,
in the light of those ideas,

488
00:32:51.471 --> 00:32:55.940
we can go on a altering what we perceive as the,
the,
the,

489
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.080
the degradations of,
uh,
of,
of our own,
uh,
our own times.
Uh,

490
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.810
and of course this a myth of the golden age of Florence for the past,
uh,

491
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.900
uh,
literally,
uh,

492
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.940
disintegrates when seen in contrast with the reality of Dante's life as an

493
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:16.670
exile,
which is going to wait him in the,

494
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.860
in the future that is going to be so it's exile,
uh,
as,

495
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:25.380
as the realistic perspective of his being in history.
Uh,

496
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:29.390
and he makes a virtue of it.
It's not a suffering is we are going to see,

497
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:32.950
I'm just,
let me just continue with my thought.
The air,

498
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.190
he doesn't see that as a punishment.
It induces suffering,

499
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:42.050
but it becomes a virtual and we shall see why it becomes a virtual.

500
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.921
And in effect,

501
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:47.921
it will become a paradigm in which we can all recognize ourselves in Canto 16.

502
00:33:48.111 --> 00:33:52.730
This myth of there's this also this golden age of tub of Florence with this

503
00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:57.100
illusionary bode in,
in peace and lived in peace.
Uh,

504
00:33:57.101 --> 00:34:00.380
whenever I hear the language of peace I do here,

505
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.280
I do overhear the echo of Jerusalem,
you know,
the,
the,

506
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:08.270
the p the city of peace,
right?
Uh,
and that what makes it interesting.

507
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:12.880
So it's a typology of,
of,
uh,
another city golden of,
uh,
the,
the,

508
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.680
the great,
uh,
uh,
time,

509
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:19.110
the golden age of the past is a kind of,
uh,
uh,

510
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:23.380
what the profits would always recall as,
uh,
uh,

511
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:28.310
the p the peace time of Jerusalem that they had.
They,
they,
the,
the,

512
00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.870
the,
that the Jews themselves had lost and kept home,
ah,

513
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.280
commemorating in,
in the history.

514
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:39.370
What makes this conjunction a very strong is that to me is that in Canto 16,

515
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.210
uh,
Dante goes on,
um,
uh,

516
00:34:44.211 --> 00:34:48.350
first of all talking about this at the chronicles,
what is a chronicle?

517
00:34:48.351 --> 00:34:51.430
How does the chronicle change history?

518
00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:54.650
The chronicle reduces,
it's,
it's,
uh,

519
00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:59.150
it's that,
it's,
it's a mode of historiography,

520
00:34:59.151 --> 00:35:01.940
different mold of historiography.
Uh,

521
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
the place where you can find these modalities of history is really bullied fuse,

522
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:14.590
who writes the consolation of philosophy,
uh,

523
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.340
at the center of which he figures the wheel of fortune.

524
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.750
Okay.
You remember the wheel of fortune?
This is blind folded.

525
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.880
A woman who,
uh,
revolves,
who rotates this wheel,

526
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.210
uh,
and which means that we were always on the shift.

527
00:35:32.211 --> 00:35:35.780
The curve of the wheel will be up and down,
right?

528
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:40.930
So that a kind of historiography that derives from this boy Ethan insight is

529
00:35:41.401 --> 00:35:46.401
that of writing the lives of families that ascent and descent and note the other

530
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:49.050
mode of historiography who we should be,

531
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:53.210
the historiography of the fall of empires,
for instance.

532
00:35:53.211 --> 00:35:57.930
So the,
the what,
Augustine,
so there are two history of graphic models,

533
00:35:57.931 --> 00:35:59.190
the one that you were available in the,

534
00:35:59.191 --> 00:36:03.090
in the city of God where we really told about the fall of the Persian empire,

535
00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:04.860
the fall of the Roman empire,
you know,

536
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:08.590
in a few pages kind of Gibbons sort of a group give them,

537
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.880
does it in a much more detailed way.
But this is really the idea.

538
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.210
On the other hand,
Nantha goes to another historical graphic model,

539
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.590
which is that of chronicle,

540
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.690
the idea that history is reducible to the events,

541
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.040
the local events and circumstances of one's own life.

542
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:30.660
He recalls all the families to the joy of the grandfather who was,
you know,

543
00:36:30.661 --> 00:36:33.620
you're going to understand the pressure of memory,
the,
the,

544
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:38.040
I know he shuttles back and forth between in memory,
uh,
between one,

545
00:36:38.041 --> 00:36:40.620
one item and the other recording everything.

546
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.820
And Dante soon discovers that he does not quite belong,

547
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:49.970
that that kind of history does not really account for who he is and who he wants

548
00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:52.110
to be above all.

549
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.150
And that somehow his definition of self will depend on a certain idea of the

550
00:36:57.151 --> 00:37:00.090
future.
And nor of the past I am,

551
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:05.150
I am trying to go back and to this idea of who their selfies and what his

552
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:10.200
history and how are we to understand history,
but here to continue with it.

553
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.120
The notion of Jerusalem,
which I have not,

554
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.740
which I bragged a little bit and gave you a little digression on history.

555
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.930
Uh,
non goes home talking about a language,
uh,
turn to cancer.

556
00:37:21.931 --> 00:37:23.760
16 line 50 please.

557
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:29.150
Where he again talks about all about Florence Mar or who were there the time

558
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:31.830
between March and the baptist.

559
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.920
Let me theology of Florence.
Um,
cities,

560
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:40.890
a neuron or you recount stories of families,

561
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.560
you have to recount stories of the predominant,

562
00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:48.750
the sovereignty of mythologies that control our own self understanding.

563
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:52.950
We will tend to understand ourselves in the light of,
of presiding mid.

564
00:37:52.951 --> 00:37:55.530
So imaginative mates above us.
So there's Mars,

565
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.820
but was the god of Florence before the baptist.

566
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.620
John the Baptist replaced him.
So this is the account.
But then the,

567
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.370
the shifting mythology of the city Marsa map,

568
00:38:06.371 --> 00:38:09.060
this able to bear arms was a fifth of the number.

569
00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.850
Now living that this is really an accounting I chronic worse position and

570
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:18.780
accounting of Florentine local history.

571
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:23.460
They say the [inaudible] but the citizenship which is now mixed with

572
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:28.380
championship towel doing Filene and so on.
Uh,
that language of mixer,

573
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:31.360
which later becomes confusion.
And Dante,

574
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.200
we'll call it the confusion when he has to give a diagnosis at the top of page a

575
00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.870
line 67 Dan has to give.
It goes into a diagnosis of the crisis of the city,

576
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:46.200
the mixture of peoples where it was ever the beginning of the city's eels is

577
00:38:47.161 --> 00:38:52.090
fooled in access is over the bodies.
Once again,
the connection between,

578
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.740
he's talking about the malaise of the city by the connection between body in

579
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:57.181
cities,

580
00:38:57.181 --> 00:39:02.181
cities grow and decay and get sick because of what he calls the confusion.

581
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:04.601
First of all,

582
00:39:04.601 --> 00:39:08.470
he called the mixture and confuse [inaudible] is the other name for Babylon.

583
00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.461
When you had to,

584
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:14.461
etymology dies Babylon into the romance languages and,

585
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.620
and and then in Italian or in English,
it's confusion.

586
00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.550
So that the two myths of the city that Dante has in mind,

587
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:26.850
it's Jerusalem or for Florence and then Babylon for Florence of today,

588
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.930
two minutes of the cities of the,

589
00:39:30.931 --> 00:39:34.210
the two cities are not antithetical.

590
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.190
They are both possible.
We see within the same body politic,
okay,

591
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.030
uh,

592
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:44.860
Florence can look like Jerusalem or it can look like Babylon according to the

593
00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:49.120
way the,
the,
the moral life of the city is,
uh,
lived out.

594
00:39:49.121 --> 00:39:51.730
So this is something that Dante will preserve it,
but it really,

595
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.880
it really implies that that the uh,
the city,

596
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:59.881
the political world is one which one has to shape all the time that you cannot,

597
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:07.290
there is no definite metaphor or emblem to define a particular city.

598
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.360
A city can change.
It's very identity.

599
00:40:11.361 --> 00:40:14.950
It can become like can be like a Jerusalem as it was in the old or it can be

600
00:40:14.951 --> 00:40:18.970
like Babylon.
Now the city involves us.

601
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:24.120
We are involved in the city's history in the way of making it according to our

602
00:40:24.851 --> 00:40:27.550
own,
our aspirations,
our own ideas.

603
00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:32.410
We share in the shaping of construction of the city.

604
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.100
This is not longer.
The,

605
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.110
the perspective of the chronic ward is the perspective dentists the port.

606
00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:43.111
So it's a critique of the net secrecy of the chronic was view of what history,

607
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.340
uh,
could be.
And now we go back to Ah,
canto,
ah,

608
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:53.190
17 where once again,
and I'm going to,
uh,

609
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.130
I will not go up.
Well,

610
00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:59.030
you remember it comes to fat on and the rivalry with the father and Dante

611
00:40:59.031 --> 00:41:02.890
saying,
uh,
if I don't belong to the city and I,

612
00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:06.280
and city and families go on decaying and disappearing,

613
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.780
what is the true relationship that I have to this main who actually is directing

614
00:41:10.781 --> 00:41:14.770
me and unveiling for me or that which the future,

615
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.890
uh,
that don't have to expect from the future.

616
00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:22.210
So these are the kinds of questions that he's very carefully,
uh,

617
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:27.250
uh,
raising.
Uh,
so,
uh,
uh,
we go back to the,

618
00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:31.840
the famous,
uh,
description of,
uh,
of the,

619
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:37.540
uh,
the Dante's exile where,
uh,
we did describe,
yeah.

620
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.050
That she'll leave everything loved most dearly lines.
Uh,
uh,

621
00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.250
55,
uh,
loved most dearly.
And this is a shaft which the bow,

622
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:51.110
the bow of exile shoot first.
Oh,
the condition,

623
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:56.470
the harshness of exile could not be crystallized in,

624
00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.520
in,
in,
uh,
uh,
sharpest terms.
Uh,

625
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.200
the severance,

626
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.760
the separation of self from family as apparently as a punishment.

627
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.661
At this point,

628
00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:13.661
Dan should prove high salt is the taste of another man's bread.

629
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.330
There are those who think that he had Dante's finding a little bit of,
uh,
uh,
uh,

630
00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:23.380
mildly comic relief in remembering the fact that in Florence they do use sold in

631
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:30.650
their bread.
But anywhere else around six year we have a,
uh,

632
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.160
a frequent flyer to Italy who remember,

633
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:36.080
who knows very well this little history.

634
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.670
But I don't think that it's hold that comical.
I think it's,
uh,
it's a,

635
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.830
it's a,
it's the bread.
It's,

636
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.780
it's a no Sacramento of foods,
right?
That he's,

637
00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:50.060
uh,
he's talking about.
Uh,

638
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.380
and then we shall see how he picks up the idea of the bread in a moment.
Um,

639
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:59.300
it's just not a metaphor there.
They'll show and how hard is the way down and up.

640
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.710
And other main stairs.

641
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:04.770
And that would show a way heaviest on the shoulder is the Wicklow.

642
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.070
We could incest senseless company,

643
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:12.390
the word picks up the metaphor of the bread because company means and that which

644
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.870
simply means the sharing of bread with,
uh,
with others.

645
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.770
So bread truly Sacramento in the sensor in joints and,

646
00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:26.860
and brings about the unity of the body of the body politic were Dante saying is

647
00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:34.910
that it's a reflection on his own life at little diff reflection his whole life.

648
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.150
He went into exile as you know,
in the year 1302.

649
00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.330
And for a number of years he went home at least two,

650
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:47.350
three years plotting along the side of his other fellow exiles,

651
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.710
the return to Florence and the destruction of the enemies who had banished proud

652
00:43:56.031 --> 00:44:01.031
of revenge in order to restore what they saw as justice Dante very quickly.

653
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:07.060
And the stood that this was the way to absolute destruction.

654
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:11.450
So he,
he just from then known moves like a shabby derelict to y'all.

655
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:14.730
He represents himself limping at the beginning of inferno.

656
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.840
And that is really the,
the uh,
the way we can,

657
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:22.010
we are asked by him to imagine him as he goes when he's talking about exile,

658
00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:27.180
we are not talking about living in some kind of a isolated splendor and some

659
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.400
code or other.
It literally means going from place to place,
begging.

660
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.780
Uh,
so this is punishment for him and yet,
and yet,
uh,

661
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:40.650
let's see what happens with which I'll show forward into that valley,

662
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.660
which shall become holding grateful,

663
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.870
quite mad and furious against the he is an exile to the exiles.

664
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:53.210
Both the welds [inaudible] this trust them and take their distance from him.

665
00:44:53.971 --> 00:44:56.040
But before long they not,

666
00:44:56.041 --> 00:45:01.041
thou shall have the brows red for this of their brutish folly they're doing,

667
00:45:01.711 --> 00:45:05.250
she'll give proof.
So it shall be to thy honor,

668
00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.670
to have made a party by myself.

669
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:13.730
What an extraordinary line to be absolutely on your own at party to myself.

670
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.510
This should make you,

671
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:22.370
should give you some perplexity to say the least because you may remember that

672
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:27.670
the divine comedy begins with the representation of the so called neutral in

673
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.060
angels.

674
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.620
And those neutral angels were angels who wanted to be neither with God,

675
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:39.090
no against God,
but they want to be by themselves.

676
00:45:39.091 --> 00:45:43.350
You remember how I pointed that out to you for that this was the most despicable

677
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:48.360
of conditions and choices though it seems to be non choice one is really

678
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:51.960
choosing any way,
even when we're not choosing,

679
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.690
we're choosing and he is.
He was separating.

680
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:59.691
The twin is despicable not to take sides to sit on the fence and now he seems to

681
00:46:00.211 --> 00:46:02.730
attribute that very conditioned to himself.

682
00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:08.020
But to you it will be to your honor to be a part to that self and no,

683
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.450
we did not read it.
But you know with those of you who were so taken with a poem,

684
00:46:12.451 --> 00:46:16.980
you can go and read Canto of Paradise.
What?
That they will ask one question,

685
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:20.250
he will he to the soul that he meets,
he says,

686
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:25.520
is it right for a man in,
in,
in,
in,
in the,

687
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:29.100
in the city to be a citizen?
Yes.
He says,

688
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:34.050
and I don't even want to ask why it's so clear that that has not,

689
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:38.570
it needs no justification.
No explanation.
You have to be part of the,

690
00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:43.350
the belong to the world where you are.
And yet now he takes the other side.

691
00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:47.670
He has to be by himself.
What does it mean to be by himself?

692
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.160
Is that a kind of neutrality he's imagining?

693
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.650
Is that it's really the condition of exile?

694
00:46:52.651 --> 00:46:57.630
I think that he's really describing the destitution,
the loneliness,

695
00:46:57.930 --> 00:47:00.720
the severance of the self from others.

696
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.840
But even that can become a condition that triggers a new form of relationship

697
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:09.570
with the exile is still part of the community.

698
00:47:09.571 --> 00:47:14.530
And let's see how he is thinking of,
uh,
of this want to,
um,

699
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:20.820
uh,
so,
or this is this,

700
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:27.140
this is now the specific prophecy of what's in store for the exile.

701
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.280
And I think it retrieves that's this in this sense.

702
00:47:33.281 --> 00:47:38.281
I mean that Dante's bringing about the transformation of the d of exile from

703
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:43.810
what seemed to be a punishment into a virtual,

704
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.200
there is such a thing as a virtual of exile.

705
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:52.100
The language with Dante presents the world to come for him.
The,

706
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.890
the future.
This is his future.
It's not the past history.

707
00:47:56.891 --> 00:48:01.030
Then it's understood as a Volvo futurity.

708
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:06.220
We are here oriented to the future.
The only real time that we have,

709
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:11.080
we don't have,
we don't have it yet,
but we can.
It's the type of one's projects.

710
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:15.580
It's the time in which one can really define oneself.

711
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.470
I'm not really my past.
So that is,

712
00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:21.760
I have some contact with a past my memories and my memories can tell you me

713
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:24.410
where I'm going.
But then a catastrophe occurs.

714
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:29.730
The need to sever yourself from anything that you know and you love most dearly.

715
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:34.960
Family,
city loyalties,
your habits,
your bread,

716
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.360
all of this details are here,
are given.

717
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:42.820
And at least what he finds the first day,
first refuge in,
in,

718
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:47.710
um,
in,

719
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.710
uh,
as of those of you who read,
uh,
it's a,

720
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:52.660
it's an interesting metaphor in medieval literature.

721
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:56.210
Those of you who read Chaucer is everyone here reads,
chosen the,
the,

722
00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.970
the Canterbury Tales.
So,
uh,
of course,
uh,

723
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:04.900
it's a story of pilgrims and the in becomes the station,

724
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.960
the temporary dwelling of people who are on the road and always moving.

725
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:14.670
It's really one of the most welcome images in the medieval imagination.

726
00:49:14.671 --> 00:49:19.671
The in the provisional comforts for the night that the in office anyway,

727
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:20.920
the first refuge in,

728
00:49:20.921 --> 00:49:25.270
in that shall find in the courtesy of the great lawn barred.

729
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.450
This is uh,
the,
the gentlemen of Verona,

730
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.670
the one gentleman of Verona whole houses him and hosted him for a while who

731
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:36.130
bears on the ladder,
the sacred bird.

732
00:49:36.131 --> 00:49:41.131
And he will hold z in so gracious regard there of doing an asking between you

733
00:49:41.431 --> 00:49:43.330
two.
That shall be first,

734
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.320
which the others come after with him.

735
00:49:47.321 --> 00:49:52.130
There shall see one where his birth so took the impress of this mighty star.

736
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:56.950
His deeds would be renowned that people have not yet taken note of him because

737
00:49:56.951 --> 00:50:00.550
of his youth for this wheels of circled about him only nine years,

738
00:50:00.551 --> 00:50:05.180
but before the gas gone deceives the Nobel Harry Sparks of this hair.

739
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:09.490
Heroism shall appear in this,
in this regard with Bert,
both of wealth and toil.

740
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.130
And this munificence shall yet be known so that his enemies cannot keep silent.

741
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:18.730
I part it looked to him and to this is benefits through him.

742
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:23.940
There shall be altered fortunate for many rich changing state with beggars and

743
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:27.930
none shall bear this written in my mind about him and tell it,

744
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.040
and he told things and she'll be incredible to witness them.

745
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.500
Then he added son.

746
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:38.300
This other glosses on what I was told,
the infernal 15,

747
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:41.210
of course,
remember we're Brunette who says

748
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.880
this is the profits of your future exile,
but it will be glossed for you,

749
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:51.470
um,
by somebody else.
It doesn't even mention it.

750
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.070
Dante goes on thinking that it's going to be Beatrice.
It turns out to be his,

751
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.390
his father,
his ancestor,
a,

752
00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.770
these are the snares that are hidden behind the few evolving years.

753
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.850
Yet I would not have the envious of their fellow citizens for their life.

754
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.900
Chafat outlast the punishment or the perfect is,
uh,

755
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:13.930
the exile can turn into a virtual and the language that accompanies this

756
00:51:14.001 --> 00:51:19.001
prediction is the language of the ethics of exile that they exiled,

757
00:51:19.121 --> 00:51:23.480
brings about and needs in order to,
to,
to,
uh,

758
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:28.430
be bearable and tolerable.
The hospitality and these how the great,

759
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:33.500
the courtesy,
the hospitality,
the language of gratitude,
the giving.

760
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:38.620
So it's a new ethics is going to be described in from the perspective of this

761
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:42.550
exhilaration,
uh,
experience of,
uh,
of Dante.

762
00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:46.700
Then Dante concludes,
which I think,
uh,

763
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:51.800
uh,
I think it seals what,
what I have been saying.
And uh,
uh,
I see,
well,

764
00:51:51.801 --> 00:51:56.210
my father,
this is line one 13 and following a one,
I'm sorry,
one 10.

765
00:51:56.211 --> 00:51:59.900
And following us.
He,
well,
my father,
how time spurs towards me.

766
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:04.250
The deal two deal me such a blow as falls most heavily on him or his most

767
00:52:04.251 --> 00:52:09.050
heedless it is well,
therefore that I arm me with foresight.

768
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:14.000
That's another virtual of exam.
The word translates.
Uh,
of course,
uh,

769
00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:15.410
uh,
prudence.

770
00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.740
Prudence is the human counterpart of Providence.

771
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.500
It's,
it says,
hey mythology,
a scene in advance,

772
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:27.070
trying to not predict that for a store.

773
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:31.860
The arrows and things that come our way.
Uh,
so that if the deal,

774
00:52:31.861 --> 00:52:36.110
this place is taken from me,
I may not lose to others.
The others by my songs,

775
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:41.140
songs down to the world of endless bitterness and on the mountain from who's

776
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:43.370
fair summit,
the eyes of my lady lifted me.

777
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.920
And after through the heavens from light to light,

778
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:50.660
I have learned that which if I tell again with taste for many of bitter herbs,

779
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.630
and if I am a timid friend to truth,

780
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:58.160
I feel to lose my life among those who will,
uh,

781
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.570
call this times ancient,
the light within which was smiling,

782
00:53:02.571 --> 00:53:07.070
the treasure and another reference to Brunetto who wrote the treasure.

783
00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:11.060
Of course,
I had found their first became a blues,

784
00:53:11.061 --> 00:53:14.000
like a Golden Mirror in the sand.
They replied,
conscience,

785
00:53:14.001 --> 00:53:18.740
dark with its whole note.
Another shame will indeed feel that words to be harsh,

786
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.920
but nonetheless put away every false hood and make plain all the vision and then

787
00:53:25.171 --> 00:53:28.290
let them scratch.
What is the itch for?

788
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:31.110
If they voices grievous at first taste,

789
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.430
it will afterwards leave vital nourishment when it is digested.

790
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:38.460
This cry of Diane shall do as does the wind,

791
00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.250
which strikes most on the highest summit.

792
00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:46.580
And that is no small ground of honor for that reason have been shown to lean

793
00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.030
this wheels on the mountain and in the waffle valley on this holes that are

794
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:55.500
known to fame.
Because the mind of one who hears,
we're not Paul's of fix.

795
00:53:55.501 --> 00:54:00.030
It's faith for an example that has its root unknown or hidden or for other proof

796
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.660
there's not manifest.
Um,
what,

797
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:08.900
what he hears and the decision that Dante will take is a palliative at least,

798
00:54:10.111 --> 00:54:15.111
or a remedy to his exile is writing the writing of the porn becomes the act by

799
00:54:16.951 --> 00:54:21.930
which he is an exhilaration,
uh,
as an exile can go on.
And in his,

800
00:54:21.931 --> 00:54:26.520
this location is Arthur.
This location from the city,
from family,

801
00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.420
from his habits can go on actually relating himself to the world.

802
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:35.480
Writing the work is that way in which their self and entries history and can

803
00:54:35.971 --> 00:54:40.950
shape history.
It's not any ears.
It's not fair it on,
it's not going to be,

804
00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:42.570
uh,
the he Polatis.

805
00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:47.460
It's not even touch a weeders on account of his own grandiloquent connection

806
00:54:47.461 --> 00:54:48.360
with the world of history.

807
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.600
The way in which this Dante self and this history is through this idea of,

808
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.920
of poet overwriting.

809
00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:00.720
There is now also described in terms of food.
As you can see here,

810
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:05.900
first of all with the bitter herbs and now the voices gives their first taste.

811
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:11.010
It will afterwards live vital nourishment when it is digested,
uh,

812
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:16.140
et cetera.
Uh,
words,
words.
First of all,

813
00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.870
let me just clear the air here.
No one,

814
00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:23.930
no one of you has this misconceptions about poetic language that somehow it's a,

815
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:30.470
some sort of faint symbol divorced from reality that goes beyond this idea of

816
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.380
the relationship of language to representation.

817
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:41.700
That was the problem with a chronic roles and they gave fairly faithful accounts

818
00:55:41.701 --> 00:55:44.680
and he can give fairly faithful account that,

819
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:47.190
that that's the mode of a certain historiography.

820
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:52.230
What Nancy is saying is that words are things in themselves,

821
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:57.500
that word words are food that change and being things they have a kind of

822
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:02.280
solidity and the result of truth value in and of themselves.

823
00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:07.410
This is really the biblical language that resurfaces,

824
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:08.940
you know,
son of man,

825
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.260
if the book you remember these lines from say [inaudible],

826
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:17.700
this is exactly the kind of language that is returning here and which don't have

827
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:22.730
bands sort of language to define himself in relationship to his future project

828
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.100
of writing the poem.

829
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:29.310
And that project of writing the poem is his way of establishing his place

830
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.270
literally in which is a utopian place in history.

831
00:56:34.271 --> 00:56:37.870
I say Utopian because it doesn't have to be understood in any local sense.

832
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:41.620
And also I do not belong.
I don't belong to the city,

833
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:44.960
only occupy a particular place in the city.
Uh,

834
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:49.180
it is the act of writing poetry.
That's really what matters.

835
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:51.880
What I'm referring to is also eh,

836
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:55.780
and here I am a sort of correction,

837
00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.520
but in mild correction of the classical idea which,

838
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:04.450
which is also medieval has survives in medieval times.

839
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:08.230
The idea that the self is decided,

840
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:13.231
the value of the self is decided by the place one occupies within the corner,

841
00:57:14.391 --> 00:57:18.940
me of the city.
Dante says,
that's not the way it works.

842
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:24.150
I am the project of writing my poetry anthropoid which is written in exile and

843
00:57:24.821 --> 00:57:29.500
therefore it's a poetry of exile.
I can re enter the world of history,

844
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.650
ah,

845
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:35.650
the [inaudible] accusing history and talking as a man who has been touched by

846
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:39.700
the vision of what justice of today.

847
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:43.780
So this is really the remarks that I think I can make about this cantos 15,

848
00:57:43.781 --> 00:57:48.700
16 and 17.
And I work some welcome questions for you.
Have any,
I'm sure,

849
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:49.893
sure you do.

850
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:58.333
<v 1>Yes.</v>

851
00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:03.760
And see some biblical references within the lines between 700 mentioned star

852
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.413
burst in,

853
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:15.110
<v 0>this is a line 17.
The question is,
uh,
uh,</v>

854
00:58:15.111 --> 00:58:20.111
would she be right in seeing a biblical antecedents context for the lines with

855
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:24.940
that go from line 17.

856
00:58:24.941 --> 00:58:28.580
You say the first refuge and in no,

857
00:58:28.581 --> 00:58:33.170
I think the shall find in the courtesy of the Great Lombard,
uh,

858
00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:38.200
they may be a Christological or a crystal mimetic language behind this sort of,

859
00:58:39.711 --> 00:58:42.300
uh,
uh,
references,
uh,

860
00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:46.490
the end that would be even more,
um,

861
00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.920
it would be true or even would be more made,
more compelling,
um,
uh,

862
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:52.510
in,

863
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:57.050
in light of a catch up with his own self representation.

864
00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:01.940
Uh,
in Christological terms,
both in Canto 15 and uh,

865
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:06.140
uh,
in cancer 16 actually he talks to himself as if we're a boolean philosopher.

866
00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:07.460
Dante uses the same,

867
00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:12.620
the same phrase about the death of [inaudible] used for [inaudible] in Paradiso,

868
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:17.810
Yvette Nida,
[inaudible] Patrick that he had used for breeders.

869
00:59:17.811 --> 00:59:20.550
But the language is a Christological language.
The,
the,

870
00:59:21.010 --> 00:59:25.790
the only difference is that,
uh,
if there is a Christological resonance here,

871
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:31.030
it very quickly fades because Dante is really discussing himself as an exile

872
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:32.810
with this.
And I'm here.

873
00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:37.830
The understands exile is that real condition of human,

874
00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:42.640
of,
of himself,
but also of human beings.
I would go on.
So,

875
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:47.180
so far as to say in order to connect your theological perspective and,

876
00:59:47.181 --> 00:59:50.410
but we're have been saying about herself in history.
Is that

877
00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:51.490
<v 2>okay?</v>

878
00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:56.490
<v 0>Exile is also the root or re once religious consciousness.</v>

879
00:59:57.970 --> 01:00:02.820
We have a those,
those of us who have a religious consciousness,

880
01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:07.510
I think we all do a,
just as we have an aesthetic sense,
we all do,

881
01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:08.260
uh,

882
01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:13.260
that religious consciousness come to all of us out of the sense or the feeling

883
01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:14.913
even better,

884
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:19.780
better than the sense the feeling that we are not where we should be,

885
01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:23.170
that uh,
that we are somehow,

886
01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:27.010
I don't know where we should be both in terms of time and all in terms of space

887
01:00:27.011 --> 01:00:32.011
that we are this located and this exile is exhilarating imagination than shapes

888
01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:34.990
are also the theological,

889
01:00:35.290 --> 01:00:40.120
the theological language of Dante and accounts for uh,
his,

890
01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.200
uh,
persuasion.

891
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:45.280
That exile defines the human condition and of just,

892
01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:49.650
it's not just an empirical,
it is empirical experience.
I say it,

893
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:52.720
it relates to him,
but he understands that it's really,

894
01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:58.210
we are all in engaged in this kind of,
we talk about this later,

895
01:00:58.490 --> 01:00:58.991
probably by the way,

896
01:00:58.991 --> 01:01:03.991
I am forcing my hand because the text does not really allow me to do that.

897
01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:08.760
That when he discusses hope,
uh,
the most extraordinary of,

898
01:01:08.761 --> 01:01:10.330
of of all virtues,

899
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:14.380
the most deceptive maybe of all virtues and they're healings,

900
01:01:14.381 --> 01:01:18.520
hope and exile in a very clear way.
And uh,

901
01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:22.540
our reserve,
that is a surprise for whatever next week or,

902
01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:28.040
<v 2>yeah,
next week
please.</v>

903
01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.860
You mentioned the confessions earlier and talking about the different

904
01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:38.660
conceptions of how the self relates to the city.

905
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:40.220
And you said Dante didn't agree with,

906
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:44.970
I guess I didn't catch everything that you were saying about Augustine's view of

907
01:01:44.971 --> 01:01:45.804
the self.

908
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:52.230
<v 0>Uh,
the question is about,
I was discussing modalities of,
uh,</v>

909
01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:52.910
this,
uh,

910
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:57.350
relationship between the self and history at the beginning of my remarks.

911
01:01:57.650 --> 01:02:01.190
And one of them obviously was a,
I mentioned,

912
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.640
let me just give a little resume of this.
Uh,

913
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:06.650
mentioned the Catcher Weda himself,

914
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:11.360
who has a kind of special understanding of history and that defines him.

915
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:16.630
His sub is taking part in the Crusades.
The other one is,
uh,
uh,

916
01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:21.150
with which Dante begins is in ears,
who is a modal for Augustan,
as you know.

917
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.330
So I'm answering your question now.
Uh,

918
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:29.870
the confessions of Augustan are constructed as nothing less than,

919
01:02:31.471 --> 01:02:35.850
what do we call,
what I call the [inaudible] of the heart.
They say,

920
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.920
he goes here,
he goes from Carthage.
He has his Dido's.

921
01:02:39.921 --> 01:02:43.830
She remember when he leaves Carthage to go to Rome and the died off.

922
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.410
It doesn't get,
he,
that's just abandoned them,

923
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:50.510
but he describes them as they hold on to his Helgam and et cetera.

924
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:55.130
Then he goes to Rome.
So it's really a pattern on an epic,
on the,

925
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:58.770
on the Virginia and epic of the,
the,
uh,
the Aeneid.

926
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.470
But cast it is very different for many years.

927
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:06.030
He doesn't go to Rome to found an empire.
He's a professor of rhetoric.

928
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.060
He teaches,
he's a teacher and professor of rhetoric.

929
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:13.600
And he comes to understand himself actually,
uh,
the great moment,

930
01:03:13.601 --> 01:03:15.060
the great revelation to for him.

931
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:18.010
There are two moments of great revolution to him,
uh,

932
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:21.030
which we never really never talked about.
The one which he has,
well,

933
01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.820
he's in Austria.
It's a little town on the,

934
01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:26.880
on the beach by the sea outside of Rome.

935
01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.920
And this is this moderate the window.

936
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:32.670
And they share and it kind of mystical vision.

937
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.600
He describes this ecstasy that they have or they look outside and then she's

938
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.980
about to die.
She will have,

939
01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:43.981
but that is a decisive moment in clearly in his life and his understanding of

940
01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:45.580
himself.
Uh,
and,

941
01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:50.490
and the other one comes in the garden in Milan when he hears voices that tell

942
01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:54.270
him to too.
He understands in his own way.
So it's a,

943
01:03:54.271 --> 01:03:58.170
it's an idea of herself,
which is,
uh,
which,
which,

944
01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.780
which understands herself as a,

945
01:03:59.781 --> 01:04:04.400
a death of the old man and the birth of a new man.
This is the,

946
01:04:04.401 --> 01:04:07.850
the old Adam and the new Adam.
The,
the,
the,
the,
the,

947
01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:11.240
the Christian idea of conversion.
Same Poles.

948
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:15.750
So impulse command,
you have to let the old men die.
So the new law,

949
01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:20.250
the new men can come into being.
That's the understanding of the self.
Now,
Dante,

950
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.230
of course,
when I say he doesn't agree with,
of course his Nordonia,
he'd say,

951
01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:29.220
didn't say that he's not tall.
He did say that there are those who say,

952
01:04:29.221 --> 01:04:32.550
well his ironic,
I don't think,
I don't see where the irony is.
He's not in here.

953
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:36.750
So this is not Paul.
He uses them to,
to,
to relate,

954
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.550
to coordinate himself to them.

955
01:04:38.790 --> 01:04:41.580
And now he's using a number of other mythical figures.

956
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.210
What is one's whole relationship to genealogy?

957
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.580
What is one's hold Russia relationship tool?
The,
the,

958
01:04:48.581 --> 01:04:52.450
the chronicles where it's the only relationship to mythical empires in the

959
01:04:52.451 --> 01:04:55.380
center.
What I'm saying,
the idea of self that he's going to have,

960
01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.100
it's not really Augustans is that of the man,
first of all,

961
01:04:59.101 --> 01:05:02.370
who can belong to the history of,
of,

962
01:05:02.371 --> 01:05:06.270
of the world by writing,
uh,

963
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:11.220
writing the poem and,
and he lives and he understands the,

964
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:16.430
the fundamental quality of the experience of human beings.

965
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:20.140
That's not Augusta.
So that's what I meant.

966
01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:25.300
No disrespect for Augustan only different,
a different experience.

967
01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:26.940
<v 1>Oh,
um,</v>

968
01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:31.730
yeah.

969
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:36.260
I'm still thinking about the brief reference to the Crusades that Cacciaguida

970
01:05:36.261 --> 01:05:41.261
makes at the end of the 15th Canto and the presence of sectarian violence.

971
01:05:42.501 --> 01:05:44.070
And I wonder if that is done to,

972
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:49.100
has some idea about that that connects to his idea of the empire as staving off

973
01:05:50.421 --> 01:05:52.310
the political violence of civil war.

974
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:56.030
What were done to suggest,

975
01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:01.040
as we saw thought Saint Francis last week,
who taught,

976
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:02.500
who spoke peacefully with us?

977
01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:08.790
<v 0>This is an extraordinary question.
Uh,
the question is,
by the way,</v>

978
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:13.660
uh,
the,
how do I explain,
uh,
uh,

979
01:06:13.690 --> 01:06:14.240
catch a,

980
01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.420
does reference to the crusade very brief referenced crusade and how does that

981
01:06:18.421 --> 01:06:22.720
connect with what we have told been talking about sectarian violence.

982
01:06:22.721 --> 01:06:27.410
So in the can't have Dominic for instance,
in Canto 12,
and uh,

983
01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:32.450
with a Dante is using this as a ploy to explain just the way he does with the,

984
01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:37.650
the violence within the city to justify the necessity of the empire,

985
01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:41.610
which he does or,
uh,
is this,
uh,
uh,

986
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:44.280
does he really have an idea of uh,
uh,

987
01:06:44.281 --> 01:06:48.090
the peaceful language of Francis Accurate?

988
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.570
If you ask a lot of questions and they're really,
really good,
really,

989
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:56.370
really a impressive after all,
she's an Italian major.
What did you expect?

990
01:06:56.371 --> 01:07:00.120
She has she better impressing me or no,
you did.
You did the,

991
01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.453
<v 1>okay,</v>

992
01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:07.270
<v 0>we'll talk more about Dante's preparing can talk.</v>

993
01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:12.320
Oh seven,
18,
19 and 20.
It's really about,

994
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:17.510
starts with what is a heroic life and how are we to understand the heroic life.

995
01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:23.690
So,
and then he said reference they all sorts of crusades and the question of the

996
01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:24.524
Crusades,

997
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:29.890
the relationship of a justice and Christian ideas of justice tool,

998
01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:37.540
Muslims and Hindus will come to the forefront there.

999
01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.880
So I really asked you to wait for that for next time because however I can

1000
01:07:42.981 --> 01:07:45.590
answer one question immediately.
Uh,

1001
01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.910
which is really implied by what you were saying more than the US directly.
Yes.

1002
01:07:49.911 --> 01:07:52.040
Dan P is a piece poet.

1003
01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.380
I would say that with full confidence low,
we know a Dante,

1004
01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:00.800
so polemical kicks,
shades is angry,

1005
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.461
uh,

1006
01:08:01.461 --> 01:08:06.461
fights and this always competing visions really in relation to the tradition and

1007
01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:11.420
others.
But he's fundamentally,
you have to establish,
it would say differences,

1008
01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.740
not really renounce your differences,
but actually make differences.

1009
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:20.690
The orchestration,
the musical orchestration is going on in cantos 15,

1010
01:08:20.691 --> 01:08:22.700
16 and 17.
This is the heaven of music.

1011
01:08:22.930 --> 01:08:27.830
This discordance discourses are part of it over over a sovereign and

1012
01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:30.500
transcendence order.
But he's a piece of port,

1013
01:08:30.501 --> 01:08:34.370
which is truly scandalous because most poets,

1014
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:38.450
except for Isaiah,
for instance,
we use a piece of port.
Okay prof,

1015
01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.590
but he's a prophet,

1016
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:43.610
a piece I profit of peace with a vision of peace.

1017
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.060
Dante really has an erratic,
erratic vision.
Uh,

1018
01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.270
most poets write about victories,

1019
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:55.100
but wars about our MREs truces uh,
you know,
epic,

1020
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.850
the epic.
So,
uh,
in England or in Italy,

1021
01:08:58.851 --> 01:09:03.710
it's all about the clashes of armies,
et Cetera,
not dentist.
So that's really the,

1022
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:07.400
the direct answer I can give to your question.
But then you raise another issue,

1023
01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:11.420
which I find a little bit,
I would not want to go there,

1024
01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:13.640
but I owe it to,
to give her answer said,
well,

1025
01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:16.580
what about the peaceful language of Francis?

1026
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:23.410
And that seems to be such a great idea because heresy and schisms in the

1027
01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:24.291
question,

1028
01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:29.150
the relationship between Christians and Muslims has always been one of wars.
So,

1029
01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.110
or heresy and war,
skis and war.

1030
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.210
So we can say,
uh,

1031
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.160
that Dante seems to be so radical.
It renouncing Warren says,

1032
01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:43.850
look,
it's possible to harmonize relationship or at least,
uh,

1033
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:48.890
confront our differences in a book with using a piece language.
Okay.

1034
01:09:48.891 --> 01:09:53.700
That's however
things that are not as simple as that.

1035
01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:57.480
And that's why I only mentioned it,
but I will not go into that.

1036
01:09:57.481 --> 01:10:01.380
We haven't got time for that.
It's really a thought,
a little developing.

1037
01:10:01.381 --> 01:10:05.820
I must admit,
the Hennessy is a question of language.

1038
01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.650
It's not just a question of wars.

1039
01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:12.860
So there are wars that go on in language and therefore the re propose the very

1040
01:10:15.541 --> 01:10:18.540
differences.
And,
uh,
um,

1041
01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.960
a stubborn divisions of understanding that qualify and describe both the schisms

1042
01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:31.190
in the Harris's,
so to say,
peaceful language.
Uh,
it,

1043
01:10:31.191 --> 01:10:33.970
it sounds also like a good,

1044
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:38.990
another way of another route in to potential the center and tragedy as you see.

1045
01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.330
But I'm not going to go any more than then give you as a,

1046
01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:48.080
as a kind of a suspicion that I have about,
uh,

1047
01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.890
uh,
my own claim that Dante is a piece,
a piece part.

1048
01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:55.350
We will talk to you about the Crusades next time.
And maybe I'm a,

1049
01:10:55.710 --> 01:11:00.450
I have time for another question maybe,
and they're very short answer anybody.

1050
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.353
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1051
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.810
see you next time.
