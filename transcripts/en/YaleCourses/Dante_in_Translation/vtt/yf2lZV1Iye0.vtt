WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.540
Last time.
Then we,

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.870
we talked about the candles of pride.

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.820
Uh,
we introduced the cantors who prided lat 10,
11,
12,

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.990
and the,
I was,

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.170
I was arguing that Dante comes to know and understand the virtues and vices of

6
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.290
pride and it's opposite humility,
which gcs featured humility.

7
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.590
She says featured and canceled 10 and pride,

8
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.560
his see punished and Canto 12.
Uh,

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.080
he got to understand the nature of this,
uh,
uh,

10
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.130
virtual and this and this vice by looking at the work of art so that in Canto

11
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.490
10,
we already have,

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.350
I sought of representation of what,

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.520
of what an aesthetic education can turn out to be what,

14
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:07.521
how do we look at art and what are we likely to learn from it.

15
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.680
This was the argument Dante arrives into predatory proper

16
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.530
in the first image that he uses to give us a sense of the dimensions of this

17
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:23.810
place is the figure of the human measure.
Uh,

18
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
he measures the world around him through the dimensions of the human figure.

19
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.070
And so obliquely it's not,
it's not,
uh,
quite,
uh,

20
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.070
we are not quite there yet to that point,

21
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.340
but he's wording us that indeed the issue is what is the show about pride and

22
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:48.480
about humility,
uh,
really is what is men's measure.

23
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.340
Uh,
we are,
he says that he was going to,
the plays is measured,

24
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.120
are called into the size of a human beings.

25
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.160
But then the question is what is the measure of human beings in a moral sense,

26
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.510
of course,

27
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.900
since pride is or [inaudible] in Italian and the Latin is a sin of um,

28
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.750
uh,
excessive

29
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.250
excessive of love of one's own excellence,

30
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.890
the sense that one isn't quite reduceable to what perhaps others see about us.

31
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.470
The idea that there will be a touch of vanity in the way we judge in view

32
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:38.100
ourselves.
The way in which we,
we measure ourselves.

33
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.690
Humility on the other hand is the opposite.
Uh,
is,

34
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.220
is the remedy to two pride.

35
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.490
And it is really a virtue in that it really reduces us to reminds us.

36
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:55.260
So the fact that we are earth bound,
that's the meaning of the word.

37
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.281
And by the way,

38
00:02:56.281 --> 00:03:01.281
that's exactly how humility and the of human are connected.

39
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.440
They both that both derive from a common rule to common matrix in almost,

40
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.770
which is the Latin word for the earth.
We are,

41
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.800
we are called humans almost because we come out of the earth because we are,

42
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.030
we are made of the clay of the earth and we return to the earth.
That's the,
the,

43
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.530
the other implication.
On the other hand,
humility is the virtue that reminds us,

44
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.210
that really should not view of ourselves as all that elevated.

45
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.710
So these are the issues measure,
uh,

46
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.410
and Dante then conference some scenes of humility.

47
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.910
He begins with the virtues.

48
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.920
And that sense of humility I see are the virtue of humility are all taken from

49
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.440
the three histories that are interesting.

50
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.470
He's always placing himself at the confluence of these three strains of,

51
00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:57.790
uh,
of history.
Uh,
an image from the Old Testament,

52
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.020
David who dances in front of the Ark.

53
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.210
Therefore he humiliates himself.

54
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.340
He tells us that he's more and less than king.
And by the way,

55
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:13.240
this phrase more and less,
this lack of precision,
uh,

56
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.000
is really an expression that pervades,
can't have 10,
Eh,

57
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.760
this is more and less.
The grief is more than I can take,

58
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:26.530
et cetera.
Uh,
peers in a variety of forms at least five times in,

59
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.170
in the context of this,
uh,

60
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.180
of the camp next to David and that image of humility from the Old Testament,

61
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.570
uh,

62
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.570
and above him actual watching down from the balcony of,

63
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.710
of uh,
uh,
a high tower in the royal palace.

64
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.900
There is his wife Mccall who looks down at David and owner.

65
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.470
He looks that she looks like down a Dave.

66
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.650
She obviously has contempt for him because in her view he is a humiliating.

67
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.560
He's offending violating the principle of the code where it came out to be.

68
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.570
She has a different understanding or is the measure of a king and the place of a

69
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:11.740
cake.
Because pride is exactly the question of place.

70
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.640
What place you or do I occupy in the world around me?

71
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.850
Am I where I think I would like to be or am I where somebody else is placing me

72
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.100
through his her gaze.
The second image is an image of,

73
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.610
but there are of the way you notice the little details,

74
00:05:31.611 --> 00:05:35.820
little placed above their sculptures plays the ball off the,
the,
the,

75
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.900
the normal sites so that there is an obvious reversal now and what the value of

76
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:44.590
humility can be.
That is the story of the Annunciation,

77
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.840
the angel Gabriel who descends literally and that dissent is a story of

78
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:52.120
humiliation or of the divine.

79
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:57.121
The divine enters a history and therefore in that sense the divine is truly

80
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.510
omnipotent.
There is the idea which is really something developed.
I,

81
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.610
I prepared it,
I mentioned it here,
but we'll come back to that.

82
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.820
The idea that the divine is detached from the human would make the divine less

83
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.830
omniscient and divine that does not know the human.

84
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:16.920
That's not no death cannot claim to be omniscience.

85
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.250
That's an argument that Dante users the,

86
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.260
so there is a store of the Angel Gabriel who comes down and the obedience of

87
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:28.490
Mary,
the Virgin Mary who says,
Yes,
I am your servant.

88
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.170
So there's a story of a,

89
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.460
and Mary is the one who said to turn the key,
uh,

90
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.550
between the old,
the old alliance and the new alliance.

91
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.400
She reverses the story of Eve.
It is a safe,

92
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.570
her obedience is a response to,
uh,

93
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.660
some kind of violation and the promise of being divine in the eating of the

94
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:54.500
tree.
The third,
uh,
examples,
uh,

95
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.380
story that the pilgrims he's,
uh,

96
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.410
looks at is the story of the emperor Trajan secular history who stops his,

97
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.650
uh,
from,

98
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.470
from marching onto his campaign into Dasia and to Romania in order to give

99
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.950
justice to a little widow.
The diminutives Dantes,

100
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.140
a little widow who has been asking for a justice before he departs Justin for

101
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:22.280
the death of her son.
This is what he,
what Dante is confronted with.

102
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.600
And when he was confronted with this,

103
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:28.400
we do know that he's being asked and directed by virgin to look at the whole

104
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:30.920
scene,
not to stop at one detail,

105
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:36.070
to even move beyond a virtual himself in what would appear to be a transgression

106
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:39.290
of the reverential bombed that ties them.
He,

107
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.780
Dante is always following as,

108
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.050
as disciple follows the teacher.

109
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.020
So he just even transgresses his place,
but that,

110
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:53.021
that CB two to have anything to do with the aesthetic education of the pilgrim

111
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:58.340
he's witnessing,
it's what he calls visible speech.

112
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.490
Uh,
a synesthesia.
That's what the phrase is.

113
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.630
Visy villa par Lara in Italian,
visible speech,

114
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:10.631
assessing dystasia that combined the cell to sensory experiences,

115
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.090
the eye and,
and,
and,
and the hearing.
So speech,
uh,

116
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.090
because this is God's heart and God's art has also a precise meaning,

117
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.780
a precise meaning that Dante has no difficulty understanding or finding

118
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:28.220
delighting.
Okay.

119
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.250
So this is the argument at one point that in the drama of the Kantor,

120
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.150
uh,

121
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:40.150
some figures keep appearing and Virgil direct Dantes eyes told the people that

122
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:46.910
are appearing.
Dante does not recognize them.
He says,
I don't know what they are.

123
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:52.100
Uh,
my site is so confused.
He doesn't want to even know who they are,

124
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:57.101
what they are virtual or explain to him our human figures crawling on the huge

125
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:02.820
boulders and almost moving like on the ground,
on the,
on the,

126
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.160
on the earth,
like warms on the earth.

127
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:10.010
And Dante is not really capable of,
uh,

128
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.490
discipling them or having even sympathy with them at that point,
as you recall.

129
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:17.970
Because had I had the feeling that maybe the explanation is a little bit,

130
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.580
it was a little bit too,
uh,

131
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.180
Wrigley but Dante's poet can to moves in that way.

132
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.110
A little with a lot of sinew acetates that I mentioned to you,

133
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:32.280
a particular passage in chapter two,
book three,

134
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.990
chapter two of their confessions.

135
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.950
It's an extraordinary passage and that brought her in so that you can,
you can,

136
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.900
I want to read a little bit from,
uh,
uh,
from that,
uh,
it's a camp.

137
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:47.700
It's a passage.
It's a book where,
uh,
um,

138
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.300
Augustine is living in Carthage.
Uh,
you know,
this,

139
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.420
this and this about now at this stage is about 17,

140
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.340
19 has been talking about his attraction for,

141
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.570
um,
shows,
uh,
uh,

142
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:06.690
his attractions for the money key wins.
Uh,
uh,

143
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.580
the distaste for scripture that he has and how he is going to be.

144
00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.260
It's been,
uh,
let,
let,

145
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:18.261
let us stray by some of his friends with the stealing of gratuitous stealing of

146
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.140
the pear tree,
the pairs from the pear tree,

147
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.200
which said she doesn't understand why he would ever do that and now are he talks

148
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:31.530
about once again his experience of the theater.

149
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.840
They to say he's discussing his experience of himself as a spectator,

150
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.620
which is exactly what Dante was.
Dante,
the,

151
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:45.570
the problem then Dante and Canto can pull the tutorial is that he is at first

152
00:10:45.571 --> 00:10:50.190
the spectator of works of art,
which he seems terminal difficulty understanding.

153
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.780
Then he has to be involved,
show some,
at least some compassion,

154
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.140
some self recognition with his souls through our,

155
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:02.830
this shades penitents who are under this huge,
uh,

156
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.440
weights that they carry and he cannot do it.
He cannot do that.

157
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.800
He still has to learn what grief is and what is it and how do you go on

158
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.490
connecting to the images that you see.
Let's see how it goes.

159
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.780
What are Gustin says?
Augustan um,
is that's what he says.

160
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:23.010
Stage place.

161
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:28.490
This is really chapter two or books three stage plays carried me away full of

162
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:35.790
images of my miseries and the fuel to my fire.

163
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.040
Why is it that men desires to be made sad?

164
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.730
Beholding Dofu and tragical things which had himself would by no means suffer.

165
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.150
The real pleasure of is going to the theater.

166
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:56.151
He claims we have a great pleasure is in the images of grief that don't really

167
00:11:57.551 --> 00:11:58.060
touch us.

168
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:02.530
We had already been expected to jump on the stage to relieve the characters.

169
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:04.870
What involved in this,
in this sort of situation.

170
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.110
So he goes on and then you'll see what the point is,

171
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.820
which are himself would by no means suffer,

172
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.740
yet he desires as a spectator to feel sorrow at them.

173
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.910
And this very sorrow is his pleasure.
I was just paraphrasing that.

174
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.650
What is this?

175
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:26.070
But measurable madness for a main is the more effected with his actions.

176
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.710
There is free.
He is from such affections.
However,

177
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.870
when he suffers in his own person,

178
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.590
a uses to be styled misery,

179
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.760
when he compassionates others,
then it is mercy.

180
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.040
But what sort of compassionate is this for?

181
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:47.041
Feigned in scenic passions for the auditor is not called on to relieve,

182
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.480
but only to grieve and the applause,
the actor of these fictions,

183
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.750
they're more,
they're more,
he grieves.

184
00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.610
And if the kilometers of those persons were of old times on mere fiction be so

185
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:04.360
acted that the spectator is not moved to tears,
he goes away,

186
00:13:04.361 --> 00:13:08.500
disgusted and criticizing.
But if he is to be moved to passion,

187
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.950
he stays in 10th and weep for joy.

188
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.020
This is extraordinary passage I think in the history of of Unpick,
right?

189
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.110
And the the criticism of the theater,
dramatic theater.

190
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:25.380
And the point is can we ever be disengaged spectators?

191
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.070
Yes,

192
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:32.070
we can be disengaged spectators and Augustine is criticizing this engaged back

193
00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:37.491
then they believe that we can be in front of the play of the world and that

194
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:42.160
things only touch us as if in a fiction.

195
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.270
And yet we ourselves are not going to be able to acknowledge it.

196
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.100
He's really criticizing the limits of the theater,
the limits of that kind of,

197
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.430
of,
of,
of,
uh,
uh,
aesthetic experience.

198
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:58.400
I think that Dante's picking up exactly from this,
uh,
what,

199
00:13:58.401 --> 00:14:01.890
what Augustan says in this chapter and he's,

200
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.920
he's showing how unavoidably one has to be involved.

201
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.700
There's not in the measure in which we think that we are not touched by somebody

202
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:13.660
else's grief.

203
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.280
We're really admitting the overpowered in quality of that experience.

204
00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:21.250
That's his argument.
So he has learned something.

205
00:14:21.251 --> 00:14:26.251
Then he has learned that there is no such a thing as a safe perspective,

206
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.380
the way our,
and he has learned what,

207
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:32.300
what some may call had been doing in a,

208
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:37.220
in from the high wind of her palace,
the,
she was expressing,
uh,

209
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.660
uh,
discussed at her how her husband,

210
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:45.970
because that offends her own sense of superiority.
And tantra says,

211
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.060
I may be no different from McCall in my disclaimer that I do not know and I do

212
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:56.060
not see any or any of this,

213
00:14:56.061 --> 00:15:01.061
this penitents who disfigure the human form in refusing to acknowledge that they

214
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:04.660
are like me and refusing to ignore,

215
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.360
to have any self recognition between me and them.

216
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.080
So this is really the aesthetic education.
Let's see now what Dante,

217
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.650
Dante's aesthetic and it's ethical.

218
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.550
He goes on understanding that the stakes he are in,
uh,
uh,

219
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.220
the idea of perspective,

220
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:27.250
the idea that the world is a projection of my own wishes on that world is really

221
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.870
re,
uh,
reformulated.
Yeah,
I am,
uh,

222
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.860
if I think that I can take a safe distance because I do not want to look within

223
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:44.510
myself,
can do 11 and [inaudible] 12.
I think we'll answer that question.

224
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:49.130
So let me just go on with cancer.
12,
uh,
can't do 11.
I'm sorry.
First of all.

225
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.750
Uh,
and if there are questions you can interrupt me because I,
you know,
I,

226
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.570
I don't think this is a difficult argument,
but,
uh,
if there are questions,

227
00:15:56.571 --> 00:15:59.300
interrupt me now or keep them for later.

228
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:05.070
Kent 11 begins with the penitents who now change reverse perspective are so

229
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:09.710
close to the ground,
but they are looking up.

230
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.840
They're looking up and they have the Lord's prayer in what is Dante's own,

231
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:19.430
a recasting of the canonical,
uh,
prayer.

232
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.220
Our Father,
which art in heaven,
not circumscribed by,

233
00:16:24.221 --> 00:16:27.740
by the great love that has for the first works on hi.

234
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.660
This is the prayer of the penitents praise be thy name and power,

235
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.870
but every creature is this meat to give things for a sweet effluence made a

236
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:43.250
piece of the kingdom come to us for we cannot reach it to ourselves if it come

237
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:48.200
not with all our striving as dining angels make sacrifice to the of the will

238
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:52.550
singing Rosanna's so let me make of theirs.
Give us this day,

239
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.910
the daily manner without which he goes backward through this harsh wilderness

240
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.170
who most laborers to advance.

241
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.820
And as we forgive everyone the wrong we have suffered due the also forgive in

242
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:09.380
loving kindness and look now deserving our strengths and so on.

243
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.450
Uh,
the business beseeching would speed for themselves and for us for shades when

244
00:17:14.451 --> 00:17:18.140
beneath the burden,
uh,
et cetera.
Uh,
the,

245
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.730
the what about this,
this first of all,
uh,

246
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.430
how is this related to what we are talking about?
The first thing is that the,

247
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:32.490
in the Lord's prayer when they change Dante makes is to emphasize that God is

248
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:37.670
not in space,
not circumscribed,
right?

249
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.800
God is not in space and therefore he is really,
uh,

250
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.100
everywhere.
He's free.
That formula he's using,

251
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:51.101
you may want to know is a traditional one in a medieval medieval thinking

252
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.020
whereby God,
they said to be an infinite sphere.

253
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.160
This is the full four mil to the fine.
What,

254
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.840
what the idea of the infinity of God,

255
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.960
an infinite sphere whose center is everywhere and whose circumference nowhere.

256
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.270
God is not in a place.
God doesn't have to have that perspective.

257
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.190
So that is indirectly,

258
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.750
there is a critique of perspective here or the anatomy of a perspective.

259
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.110
God is everywhere,
not circumscribed.
That's the first change.

260
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.910
The second change that he's making.

261
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.290
This is a neoplatonic element that he adds on to the Lord's prayer.

262
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.760
And then the second one is that he literally pleasers give us this day,

263
00:18:32.761 --> 00:18:36.210
the daily Manna are without which he goes back with he deaf.

264
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.240
He literally makes the Lord's prayer the prayer of the exiles in the desert,

265
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.460
like the Jews in the wilderness who ask and get their manner.

266
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.230
So now this is,
uh,
another element that,
that another metaphorical,
uh,

267
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:57.290
elements that casts purgatory as a journey through the desert between the

268
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:02.850
bondage of Egypt and uh,
and uh,
in Jerusalem.

269
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.940
So the other point is that there is a reversal of perspective somehow.

270
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.970
Uh,
and what kind of perspective is he gaining now?

271
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.070
And the perspective I think is what I call a Franciscan perspective.

272
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:19.980
Maybe just explain first of all the line,

273
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.300
let dinette praise be thy name and power.
Really creature.

274
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:29.690
This is literally an echo of the first poem of the Talon Poetic Tradition,

275
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.260
a poem written by Saint Francis,

276
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.970
which is known as the canticle of creatures,
which is really a secret.
And,

277
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:42.900
and a four x sequence of praises,
praise be thy name,

278
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:44.580
praise be the water appraisal.
So on.

279
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:50.210
But the point of that point is that it begins with the look of human beings up

280
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.580
to the highest and then it ends up with the idea of humility.

281
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.610
We are
trans,

282
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.630
he says not the most important or the center,

283
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.790
the center of creation.
We are like everything else valuable in creation.

284
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.580
That's the thrust of the poem.

285
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:16.020
And the only way in which you could really understand the creation is really to

286
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:21.021
look from the bottom up and not from the top down.

287
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:26.630
This is the true that the kind of a friend respective that he is uh,

288
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.880
uh,
describing in the poem,

289
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:33.580
the rest of the Canto really is a connection,
uh,

290
00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.050
between art and pride,
which are,

291
00:20:36.051 --> 00:20:41.051
we're not going to be surprised since the whole of Canto 10 was a reflection on

292
00:20:41.371 --> 00:20:45.900
the premises of that,
of that,
of the two metaphors are 10 pride.

293
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:48.460
So you have,
uh,
uh,
the,

294
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.670
the illuminators and then references on online's 92 the painters or empty glory

295
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.200
of human powers,
how briefly lasts the green on its top,

296
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.010
unless it's followed by an age of abdominals in painting.

297
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:11.011
Cima boy thought to hold the field and now jock to has the crowd cry so that the

298
00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:15.870
others famous them.
And so,
and then the poets,
uh,

299
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.490
we look of cover Cantin Guido when it sadly,

300
00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.770
so has the one greeter taken from the other,

301
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.510
the glory of our tongue and he perhaps is born.
That's,

302
00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:29.410
she'll chase the one and the other from the nest meaning damp himself.

303
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.060
The idea of fame,

304
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:36.270
which is what the proud souls may be looking for is dismissed as,

305
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.610
uh,
uh,
having the inconsistency of a,

306
00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:45.550
of the winds vanishing,
like the breath,
a breath of wind.

307
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.970
Uh,
and so this is,
uh,
this is the,

308
00:21:48.971 --> 00:21:53.280
the are two moral understanding of,
uh,
of,
of,
uh,

309
00:21:53.281 --> 00:21:55.810
of pride and humility.
And in Canto 12,

310
00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.840
I just want to show you and describe the reasons why and to explain to you the

311
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:05.740
reasons why Dante deploys a peculiar rhetorical artifice.

312
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.960
And I ask you to turn to around lines 25,

313
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.790
which is a sequence of new visions.
Dante has this times,

314
00:22:15.791 --> 00:22:20.110
this images are on the ground,
so he has to look down.

315
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:25.270
It doesn't have to look up and there are images of the proud souls who have been

316
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:30.190
punished and therefore now they appear.
Now on the ground and the tech stats,

317
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:34.210
I saw him that it was created no blood or any other creature.

318
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.800
Of course,
you know who he is as on the side.

319
00:22:38.801 --> 00:22:43.150
I saw Bria rails,
one of the giants pierced by the heavily shaft lying heavy.

320
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.340
I saw Tim Brailles as a palace.

321
00:22:45.341 --> 00:22:49.390
And then I saw Nimrod or figures you have more or less,
uh,

322
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.680
seen before at the photo of his mighty work as if bewildered.

323
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:56.770
And he was looking at the people's in [inaudible],

324
00:22:57.010 --> 00:23:02.010
the shared interests shared his pride and then our four tercets or Nairobi next,

325
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.140
also [inaudible] or [inaudible] or a Hobo harm.

326
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:12.610
And then once again,
the four more,
uh,

327
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.200
tercets it showed to the hard pavement,
uh,

328
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.110
our on it showed how he fell upon.
Now Caribou,

329
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.010
it showed the destruction and the crew of butchery or the turmeric is rod.

330
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.000
It showed her the Assyrians Freddy route after hall of furnace with a sled.

331
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.910
And then one final,
uh,
[inaudible],

332
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:35.940
I swear I saw Troy in Natchez and in heaps or Elian how BW abased and via the

333
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:39.070
design show,
the,
the resolve it,

334
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.780
this is so they're all the figurations of punished,

335
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.920
uh,
pride tried that has been now literally be humiliated,

336
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.090
but I did have to ask you to look so that you can understand the artifice.

337
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.200
This is what we call a visible speech.

338
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:01.100
Dante himself has been deployed.
And to do this,

339
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:06.101
I have to ask you to look at the Italian text begins with the word every tercet

340
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:10.280
with the letter v V v there.

341
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.980
You don't have to read the whole thing variably.
Earlier though you,

342
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:16.800
I'm sure you would like me to read a little bit of the Italian where their

343
00:24:16.801 --> 00:24:19.630
caloric or for no bill Claire to the next Thursday,

344
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.970
the day Abria rail and next video team,
Braille there,

345
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:25.093
none brought.

346
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.340
And then the for next term starts with the word with the or the letter o Neah

347
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.730
Bay also of all the Iranian or robot arm.

348
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.110
And then the next four tercets with M Mostra Vancor most travel.

349
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:44.000
Could we feed this digital next most travel arena?
You got to read down.

350
00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:47.810
Okay.
Uh,
most Strava coming rotten and the final,

351
00:24:47.811 --> 00:24:52.220
the third set from nine 61 to 62,
very,
they are Troia.
Oh,

352
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:56.060
if you own most Strava,
which show two of recapitulate,

353
00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.620
all of the key elements of this artifice,

354
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.800
we are in the presence of a so called acrostic that if you read from the top

355
00:25:07.461 --> 00:25:11.670
down,
it spells the following and then recapitulates.

356
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.710
This is the V,

357
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.970
but in Italian it's also the you is to say the fall of man.

358
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.320
So he's doing this.

359
00:25:18.321 --> 00:25:23.150
He's using this artifice that you can only understand if you read the text.

360
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:28.130
You,
if you have to hear it,
you can't quite get to it.
You know,

361
00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:33.131
it was his doing two things using God's own art as a model for himself.

362
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.350
This is pride.
Ah,
it wouldn't seem to be pride after all.

363
00:25:39.351 --> 00:25:41.240
It's excessive love of one sec silence,

364
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:46.100
but God did that in Canto 10 he's going to do the same thing.

365
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:46.953
Now with the tech,

366
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:51.830
the second thing that it shows is that the text is not a text to be just heard.

367
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:57.230
It's a text to be read.
It's a text to be looked at.

368
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:02.470
It's what we call visible speech and so what is that they're doing in he

369
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.010
lapsing?
Interesting of pride.
Yes,
of course,

370
00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:10.760
but what he's telling us is that pride is not as him.

371
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.970
He is in a sense redefining the ethical language of the Middle Ages and the

372
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:18.680
ethical language of his own text.

373
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.190
He saying that in the measuring which you love,

374
00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:27.140
what is above you that is normally sin
the same.

375
00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:32.680
It is the same pride in the measuring which you do have contempt for those that

376
00:26:34.041 --> 00:26:36.230
you think are below you.

377
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.050
So we have thanks to the world of art,

378
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.000
a reevaluation of the moral language.

379
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.930
That's the first and most important example of all of this.

380
00:26:45.931 --> 00:26:49.710
The happens throughout the program in purgatory itself.

381
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:54.480
Then to see what is it you want me to say this again?
Uh,

382
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.720
Dante,
uh,

383
00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.740
by imitating God's form of art as it does here with his own text.

384
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:06.950
He said his drawing attention to this is an artifice available to us thanks to

385
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:12.350
his text and it's only possible to view it the way he describes it,

386
00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.250
describes it within the text.

387
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.550
He's giving a peculiar status to his own text.

388
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.030
This text has also its stages,

389
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:26.070
an artifice that we normally,
and he has learned from God directly,

390
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:31.110
which means that the scene of Lucifer even it's not just the same,

391
00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:33.150
that he transgresses what's above him.

392
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.450
It's the same because he has contempt for what is below him.

393
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:43.850
So that humility and pride really have to go hand in hand and one attenuates and

394
00:27:46.141 --> 00:27:49.530
changes the meaning of the other.
Um,
okay.

395
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:55.470
This is really something that in many ways,
Franciscan,
Franciscan,

396
00:27:55.471 --> 00:27:57.890
cantor,
you might want to write a paper on that on,

397
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.960
on the song of the so called the song of all creatures by some friends and this

398
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:06.030
particular handle and,
and say,

399
00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:10.770
you may draw your own conclusions if you do not agree with what I have said.

400
00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:15.740
Let's move on to
the next fuel candles.

401
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.980
I want to go to a bubble to chem two 16.
Um,

402
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:23.570
um,
because here we have a,

403
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:28.040
we are approaching now the center of the world of purgatory.
We are in the,

404
00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.290
we skipped envy all together.
I will,
I will get back to that.

405
00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:37.630
Uh,
and another,
and another occasion in Canto 15,
um,

406
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.470
but 16 and 17,
we'll talk about anger,
the sin of anger.
Uh,

407
00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.320
the purgation of anger here in 16,

408
00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:50.090
Dante meets up,
Eh,
famous,

409
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.110
magnanimous,

410
00:28:51.111 --> 00:28:56.111
a figure called Marc Lombardo and he is a discussion about human who has a

411
00:28:56.991 --> 00:29:01.991
discussion with them about the so called they show of human degradation of human

412
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:07.100
degeneracy.
Um,
it's,
uh,
the scene takes place in a kind of,
uh,

413
00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.270
the cloud of anger,
the biblical cloud of anger,

414
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.800
sort of a world deprived of any light.

415
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:17.210
I kind of madness if which anger and the students that,

416
00:29:17.211 --> 00:29:21.930
which violates the clarity in light of reason,
uh,
that as,

417
00:29:21.931 --> 00:29:25.340
as we refer to it,
gloom of hell or night,

418
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.940
big raft of every planet under a barren sky,

419
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:33.941
overcast everywhere with cloud never made avail to my side so heavy or have a

420
00:29:34.311 --> 00:29:38.650
staff so harsh to the sense as the smoke.
And then the language of justice.

421
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.850
A blind man goes behind his guide that he mailed stray or knock against what he

422
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:46.500
may injure and perhaps kill him.
So I went through the foul and bitter.

423
00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:51.040
They're listening to me leader.
So he meets then in this,

424
00:29:51.041 --> 00:29:56.000
within this context and this background of,
uh,
of,
of,
uh,
uh,

425
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:01.140
cloudiness and Nia blindness near in visibility over the world around them.

426
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:05.890
They're kind of invisibility that has been carried over from this hint of envy,

427
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.390
which as you know,
was it's whole about,
uh,
about being blind.
Uh,

428
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:14.890
then he hears a voice and a Dante asks,
uh,

429
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.240
uh,
uh,
the,
the one,
one question,

430
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.800
the question is,
uh,
do we have,
uh,
uh,

431
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:29.100
the world is wholly baron of every virtual and line 55,

432
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.190
uh,
as that declares to me and pregnant and Dover spread with,
with wickedness.

433
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:37.990
But our big D to point out to me the calls that I may see it and how it's two

434
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:41.890
main for one places in the heavens and then other here below.

435
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:46.440
Is there such a thing as free,
what we call free will?
What is it,
uh,

436
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:51.470
what is freewill?
Uh,
what is the cause of all,
uh,
uh,

437
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.770
deeds,
other doings?
Is it in,
uh,

438
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.590
as the astrologist would say in the planets?

439
00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.830
And therefore the matter of determination by forces that transcend us and on

440
00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:04.300
which we have no control.

441
00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:08.090
So that there was a severe limitation of,
uh,

442
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.910
the meaning of choices and the possibilities of choices and therefore have

443
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:16.180
merits and demerits.
If we have no choices than we can really,

444
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.890
we can not be praised or blamed for what we do.
Or is it within us?

445
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.960
And this is Marco Lombardo.
It,
it's,

446
00:31:23.961 --> 00:31:28.961
it is revisit Dante's revisiting the whole story of and debate,

447
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:29.780
uh,

448
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:34.780
ancient debate about the relationship between freewill and God's fore knowledge.

449
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:39.880
If you wish that [inaudible] in the consolation of philosophy,
uh,

450
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.060
as is well known had been confronting he first,

451
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:48.061
he then a deep sigh line 63 and following which grief forced to alas than began

452
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.030
brother.
Um,
I don't have to point out to you,

453
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:56.650
this is the form of salutation in purgatory,
right?
You already had our father,

454
00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:01.810
uh,
in Canto 11 with this idea that there's a human family.

455
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:07.550
We therefore a brother is that the appropriate a form of interlock fusion and

456
00:32:07.831 --> 00:32:11.200
that dress among uh,
the souls and Dante,

457
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:16.470
the world is blind and I indeed that indeed.com just from it you that are living

458
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.800
refer every course up to the heavens alone.

459
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.310
Just as they moved all things with them by necessity.

460
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.810
If it were so free choice would be destroyed.

461
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.400
I think the text is very clear.

462
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:35.230
I would have to tell you that there is a distinction between choice and free

463
00:32:35.231 --> 00:32:39.070
will.
There are not the same thing.
Free choice of free will.

464
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.570
And this is a very,
uh,

465
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.810
difficult tog events choice implies that we,

466
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.640
that it's an intellectual problem that we choose.
Uh,

467
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.480
thanks to what we know the will,

468
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.720
he said it is a difficult argument because free will implies that the will is

469
00:32:57.591 --> 00:33:02.591
never in bondage and it's possible to attain the moment where we will freely.

470
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:03.711
In fact,

471
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:08.550
so many theologians worn asking that three wheel means that they will find that

472
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.360
can be moved by an act of choice.
That is,
it is,

473
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.520
it follows on the prior,
uh,
act of knowledge.
Uh,
okay.

474
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.390
So Dante uses the two terms.
Um,

475
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.730
if it were so free choice would be destroyed in you and there would be no

476
00:33:22.731 --> 00:33:27.000
justice in happiness for world doing and misery for evil.
And Oh,

477
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:31.220
that's the answer that the,
the Mark Lombardi,
we'll give the heavens,

478
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:34.910
initiate your impulses.
I do not say,
oh,
but if I did,

479
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.410
light is given on good and evil and freewill.

480
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.580
And if it bear the,
the strain in the first battlings with the heavens,

481
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.410
then being rightly nurtured,

482
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.670
it conquers all to greater power and to a better nature,

483
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:54.430
you free our subject,
which in Italian it really is a,

484
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.990
I have to say more of an oxymoron.
Liberi line 80.

485
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:03.800
Liberi such a shitty you three subjects.
Exactly.

486
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:07.790
You are.
And you can,
you do sense the,

487
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.200
you understand the contradiction.
Ah,
in the two terms are this to say,
uh,

488
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.580
we are free,

489
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.440
but at the same time we're a subject I can only understand it with in terms of

490
00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:21.650
what Dante,
we'll say a little bit later when he discusses,

491
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.920
he shifts the argument to the law saying that that's really the,

492
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:30.960
uh,
we are,
uh,
three subjects and the law is exactly that.

493
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
The metaphor for him that would make us understand what it means to be free and

494
00:34:36.021 --> 00:34:40.430
subject at the same time where limitations are going to be positive.

495
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.960
And within those limitations we can be free.
That's the argument.

496
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.430
And that creates the mind in which the heavens have known in charge,
therefore,

497
00:34:49.431 --> 00:34:51.350
et cetera.
And then here,

498
00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:56.650
the first thing that Dante does is give a sense of creation.

499
00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.960
He posits human freedom in the act of creation of the soul.

500
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.120
And this is,
look,

501
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:10.120
this is from his hand lines 85 from his hand who regards it fondly before it is

502
00:35:13.551 --> 00:35:18.230
comes forth like a child at sports tier and smiling.

503
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.410
The little simple soul that knows nothing.

504
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:27.010
This is the famous poem for those of you who remember a little bit of Latin

505
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.670
Hadrian,
the Emperor Hadrian about the,
uh,

506
00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.570
the little simple soul that goes wondering around.

507
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:38.040
And aunties were reinterpreting it as,

508
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.100
as not the soul that is lost in the world.

509
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.100
But I sold that is playing.
Uh,

510
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.880
the creation is a playful act.
The soul is,

511
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.900
it's like a child at sports,
tearful and smile.

512
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.700
The little simple soul that knows nothing but moved by joyful maker turns

513
00:35:56.701 --> 00:35:57.990
eagerly to what delights it.

514
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.440
We have the idea of creation as a free and playful act.

515
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.470
Play in the sense of the innocence of the,

516
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.210
of the experience and play the sense of being three.
Now when one is at play,

517
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:16.140
when I say has all the attributes of spontaneity and freedom that go with it,

518
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:21.650
it is the basis of what I call the playful theology of Dante.

519
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.670
Ah,
God creates the world in an act,
in an,
in a,

520
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.950
in a moment of freedom.

521
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.100
And that freedom becomes a foundation for positing our own human freedom.

522
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.750
Uh,
it's,
it's because we,
we,

523
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:41.930
we were born free that therefore we can go on believing and a,

524
00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.350
that there is such a freedom for us.

525
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.190
There was not an act of necessity that would be the opposite in the moment of

526
00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:54.720
creation and the experience of creation.
But it's,
it's,
uh,
uh,
it's,

527
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.290
it's,

528
00:36:55.290 --> 00:37:00.290
it's spontaneous and playful and then the can talk goes on with this

529
00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:04.020
extraordinary political argument,
political legal argument.

530
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:09.230
So we talk about human freedom and not an impasse moves to political freedom.

531
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.670
And look at what he says,
Rome,
which made the good world used to have two sons,

532
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.540
which is a kind of baroque emerge,
merge.
And I'll explain that in a moment.

533
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:23.570
Why he uses this image which made plane the one way and the other that of the

534
00:37:23.581 --> 00:37:28.290
world in that of God the one has quenched the other and the sword is Jordan to

535
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:32.760
the crook and the one together with the other mass per force go ill since
joined.

536
00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:36.510
The one does not fear the other.
If thou does not believe me,

537
00:37:36.511 --> 00:37:39.720
consider the ear of corn,
uh,
et cetera.

538
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:44.940
What is he talking about with God has um,
Rome had two sons.
Uh,

539
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
the phrase translate lion miss translates deliberately mistranslate align in

540
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:56.580
genesis where it is said that God gave mankind to luminaries the sun and the

541
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:04.690
moon,
but whereby we could really see both in the day and that night,

542
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:09.460
this little image from genesis was use dye,

543
00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.690
the so called Eurocrats of the,
the,

544
00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.820
the Canon lawyers of the Middle Ages to explain it as the emblem for the empire

545
00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.970
and the church that the,

546
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:26.050
the empire of the sun having the larger light,

547
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:31.320
the eurocrats would claim was the light of the church and the moon having a

548
00:38:31.461 --> 00:38:34.780
reflected light was the light of the empire.

549
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.630
It an argument that we'll use this,
this,

550
00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:42.631
this gloss as a way of explaining the superiority of the empire over all of

551
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.910
this.
But we already have the church over the empire.

552
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:50.590
The empire had to take its light and its direction from the church.

553
00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:55.890
Dante is deliberately violating that idea of the sun and the moon,

554
00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.890
equating them by saying the two sons in order to convey his conviction,

555
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:07.590
that conviction that the two institutions God provides for the guidance of human

556
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:12.940
beings,
the church and the empire are equal.
His conferring on them,

557
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.370
any quality,
uh,
rather than a hierarchical ordering,
uh,

558
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.590
of the two luminaries that the,
the sun and the moon.

559
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:25.670
It's an argument that really is addressed against the,
the,
the lawyers at the,

560
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.900
at the University of Bologna,
ah,
uh,
where they are.

561
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.470
[inaudible] we're working for,
for the pope,

562
00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.730
explaining the sense of,
uh,
uh,
the,
the,

563
00:39:36.731 --> 00:39:37.600
the superiority.

564
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.450
They suck the superior a status of one above,
uh,

565
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.840
above the other.
And,
uh,
and so with his,
uh,

566
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:51.730
a whole argument here now,
uh,
the,
the,
which is about,
uh,

567
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.390
uh,

568
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:57.390
kind of legality or the questions of history's boundaries.

569
00:39:57.581 --> 00:39:59.650
That's what I understand by they got to this.

570
00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.800
You have retrospectively also some light shown on this claim of being three

571
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:09.400
subjects in Encanto,
uh,
16.

572
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.690
And we turn now to the very center of the divine comedy,

573
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:14.770
the center of the divine comedy,

574
00:40:14.771 --> 00:40:19.300
which is clearly numerically the center 10 through 17.
And we'll see,

575
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.400
uh,
how,
what,

576
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.870
what is that Dante's discusses here and cantor 17,
uh,

577
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:30.270
the canto it's visions of anger,
um,
uh,
the,
the,

578
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.970
the Canto begins with an apostrophe to the readers,

579
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:39.240
memory recall reader if ever in the mountain missed coat the for which the could

580
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:46.070
is not see,
except as moles do through the skin.
The,

581
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.310
the difficulty of sight,
the difficulty of seeing is,

582
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:56.400
is highlighted again how when the moist dense vapors begin to disperse the

583
00:40:58.271 --> 00:41:02.170
sands,
this passes feebly through them and the imagination.

584
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.030
We're quickly come to see how at first I sort of saw the sun again now near its

585
00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:10.750
setting.
So measuring mine with a faithful steps for my master,

586
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.560
I came forth from such a fog to the beam,

587
00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:16.950
which were already dead on the shores bit.
Oh,

588
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.840
it's a twilight landscape.

589
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:25.620
We have a number of reversals and contract [inaudible],

590
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.900
the mall blind mall that burrows in the under the earth.

591
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.900
And then the Alpine scenery,
uh,

592
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.350
which makes vision also impossible.

593
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:44.590
Dante's evoking the heights and the lowest possible point of sight with the Mo.

594
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.540
Uh,
the sun is setting and the night is approaching.

595
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.670
It is as if the whole,
so the solidity of the world around him is vanishing,

596
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:58.540
is disappearing.
That's the experience that's,
see,

597
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:04.300
and this very moment he's appealing to the memory of the reader and the

598
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:06.080
imagination of the reader.

599
00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:10.280
It is a safe that when the world outside seems to be failing us,

600
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:13.160
we have this part of this inner light,

601
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:18.430
this in the possibility of recollection of the world or imagining the world.

602
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:21.020
Okay.
Uh,

603
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.220
his specifying what some of the claims about the in the lights that he says we

604
00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:29.210
have within us could be,
uh,
he had just said that,

605
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.600
but also he's preparing this extraordinary second apostrophe to the imagination.

606
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.600
Dante is,
we are approaching the center of the,

607
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.870
of the universe is poetic universe.

608
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.980
And Dante reminds us that this is a work of the imagination.

609
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:50.210
Why does he do this?
What is this?
What does he say about the imagination?

610
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:52.940
The first thing that he says about the image,
Oh,
imagination,

611
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:58.160
which so steels us at times from outward things that we pay no heed though.

612
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.790
1,000 trumpets sound above us.
Who moves the,

613
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.720
if the sensors of the nothing.

614
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.320
It's the same question have been asking earlier,
right?

615
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:14.300
Where do,
where do our,
what do our choices come from?
What do,

616
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:19.200
why do,
why do we do what we do?
Is it because,
uh,

617
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:19.760
uh,

618
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.760
power from the outside moves us or is there something that that is within us?

619
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:30.320
Now this question is asked in slightly different terms in terms of the

620
00:43:30.321 --> 00:43:35.180
imagination and the imagination is that power that that's what he had.

621
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:39.680
And he,
he,
the way he describes it that describes it,

622
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:44.830
that removes us from the outside world has such a power.

623
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:45.501
In other words,

624
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:50.501
it's not just the imagination that translates sensory experiences into images

625
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:54.320
for the benefit of rational judgements.
You know,

626
00:43:54.321 --> 00:43:58.280
this is the triadic at a strategic in order.
What is the imagination?

627
00:43:58.281 --> 00:44:01.130
Is the middle ground between the senses,

628
00:44:01.131 --> 00:44:04.400
the work of the perception and the work of reason,
right?

629
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.330
This is a triadic pattern that Dante,
uh,

630
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.370
could have found in Aquinas.
We in turn found it certainly in our historical,

631
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.450
that's the,
the way it proceeds.
Yes.

632
00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:19.560
Another imagination or he's talking about now and imagination that removes us

633
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:25.120
from the outside world.
It frees us that it needs nothing of,
um,

634
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.570
the,
the world do perception.

635
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:31.860
It is a power that in many ways that stills us from it.

636
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:33.260
It's a power that,
um,

637
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:37.410
part of the sea describing times from the outward things that we pay no heed.

638
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:40.720
3000 trumpets sound about us.
It's a,
it's a,

639
00:44:40.721 --> 00:44:44.970
it's a faculty that is completely free from the outside world.

640
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:49.800
A power that we have within us to imagine worlds that don't even exist,

641
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:54.550
to imagine things that without the solicitations of what lies,
uh,

642
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:56.970
outsiders and continues,
um,

643
00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.650
a like moves the which takes form in the heavens either of itself or by we'll

644
00:45:01.651 --> 00:45:06.120
which directs it's downwards of her impious deed.
And then he goes on describing,

645
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.650
uh,

646
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:11.650
three images of anger at the point in which Dante's approaching this center of

647
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:15.790
the world.
We are this,
we are,

648
00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.280
we are witnessing,

649
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:22.640
we are shown the power of the magician is a visionary faculty as a faculty that

650
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.840
is not a transcription of the real world.

651
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:33.270
And one wonders why he has to make this kind of claim.
It's,

652
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.250
it's,
uh,
it encompasses the real world and yet something,

653
00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.170
there's something that almost prophetic,
something that does not come from,

654
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:44.790
uh,
uh,
uh,

655
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:50.100
the contacts with the world come back to this in a moment.
I hope.

656
00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:54.360
Uh,
he has three images,
then three that come down to him gratuitously.

657
00:45:55.350 --> 00:46:00.150
They seem to have been descending into his mind without any,
uh,

658
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:05.130
anything that,
uh,
uh,
around him.
And then Dante goes on,
uh,

659
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.070
here describing the,

660
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:11.640
a low of purgatory.

661
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:16.730
What is the word or predatory?
Um,
what is the word to purgatory?

662
00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:21.210
How is it construct?
There was the architecture of this world and surprisingly,

663
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.930
this is a like a fabric of love and architecture of love.

664
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.130
And it's at the very center lines,
uh,
uh,

665
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.250
91,
92 or 93,

666
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:36.810
that this is the actual numerical even at the center of the poem.
Not Surprising.

667
00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:40.560
That's what Dante says,
neither creator,
no creature.

668
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.650
My son was ever without love,

669
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:49.010
either natural or of their minds.
That's a center.
What does he mean?
Natural?

670
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:53.280
The mind.
It's distinguishing here between the two types of love and in fact,

671
00:46:53.281 --> 00:46:57.270
they will clarify and this is always the natural is always without error,

672
00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:02.280
whatever impulse we may have,
that's impulse of love that is never,

673
00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:07.140
um,
prone to,
uh,
sinfulness.

674
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:10.760
It's a natural impulse and natural desire there.

675
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:14.730
That which is a instead a sinful is the one,

676
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:17.940
the one where choice is involved.

677
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.900
The natural is always without the other,

678
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.910
my earth through a round object or through access of the fact of vigor.

679
00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.980
So that whenever we make a choice,

680
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:31.090
we may either not love the right object or we may love it too much or we may

681
00:47:31.091 --> 00:47:35.170
love it too little.
And so this is the topography of purgatory.

682
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:39.580
This Triadic Division in terms of love,
everything is a problem of love.

683
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.560
But then there are varieties that organizes its,
uh,
uh,

684
00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.850
subdivisions while it is directed on the primal good and on the secondary keep

685
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:53.470
right measure.
It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure with this work to evil,

686
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:57.610
with more,
with less concern.
This do pursues its good.

687
00:47:57.611 --> 00:48:01.570
That is the creator with this creature from this that can understand that love

688
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:02.620
must be the seeding.

689
00:48:02.621 --> 00:48:07.621
You have every virtue and every action deserving punishment.

690
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.590
Now,
since love can never turn his face from the welfare of its subject,

691
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:16.030
all things are secure from self hatred,
uh,
and uh,

692
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.090
and so on.
And Dante now response.

693
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.320
Now I will have the give thought to the other,
uh,

694
00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:28.450
which pursues its good and faulty measure.
Everyone confusedly a prince,

695
00:48:28.451 --> 00:48:33.451
a good in which the mind may be at rest and desires it so each strives to reach

696
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:38.140
it.
And if the love is luggage,
uh,
that draws you to see your gated,

697
00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:42.430
this terrace of the jewelry pendants torments you for the four that are the good

698
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:46.930
there is,
et cetera.
So the question then will become,

699
00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:50.560
and I did not ask you to read this Canto,

700
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:55.561
but I can give you in a sort of brief preview of it and that has to ask,

701
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:05.000
um,
if,
what is this love of choice?
Um,

702
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:10.260
does it depend since since I'm a have a particular perception of the world that

703
00:49:10.601 --> 00:49:14.800
makes me see whatever encounter is beautiful and desirable,

704
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.960
where it's my fault,

705
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:22.470
he repeats the same problems that he had been grazing in Canto 15,

706
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.400
uh,
Dante,

707
00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:29.050
we'll try to explain it in terms of love and yet we are going to be brought back

708
00:49:29.051 --> 00:49:34.051
to the world of how do we perceive what it is that we love.

709
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:39.610
Uh,
the perception of what we love becomes who Huichol to,

710
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.200
uh,
uh,
varied responsibilities for it.
So,
um,

711
00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.200
this is,
uh,
uh,
in,
at the central appointment,

712
00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:52.030
Dante seems to be suspended between two ideas.
On the one hand,
the eye,

713
00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:56.590
the notion that there is a real world where you have responsibilities for

714
00:49:56.591 --> 00:50:01.120
everything that uh,
we do.
Uh,
and on the other hand,

715
00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:06.480
a world where there's an imagination which is completely disengaged from the

716
00:50:06.821 --> 00:50:10.550
world of reality,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,

717
00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:14.980
I can not be quite be constrained or held in.

718
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:20.140
So how are you going to suspended between these two possibilities?

719
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:25.600
How is Dante going to bring them together?
Do you see what the,

720
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:29.930
the,
the issue,
how do you,
how do you,
uh,
if,

721
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:33.770
if the world of the imagination is free of this,
engaged from reality,

722
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.920
then how am I'm going to,
on the other hand,

723
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:42.220
going to be held accountable for what I do over the world with a world that are

724
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:44.030
made with my own deeds,

725
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:49.160
the center of the poem [inaudible] reason this contradiction,
there's not,

726
00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:53.660
uh,
imagination is made to be the way to knowledge.

727
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.600
I can only know through the imagination.

728
00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:02.140
The imagination of that depends on my perception of the world or an imagination,

729
00:51:02.991 --> 00:51:05.240
which frees me completely from the world.

730
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:10.750
And then this toy ideas with the imagination really in contradiction one with

731
00:51:11.781 --> 00:51:15.780
the other.
So where does the human responsibility,
um,

732
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:20.930
the poem gets nourished by this duality of the imagination.

733
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.010
The poem moves back and forth between one and the other.

734
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.320
And let me just stop here because I think I,

735
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:31.430
I may have said a little bit too much about this issues may and that will

736
00:51:31.431 --> 00:51:36.210
respond to your questions.
I hope if there are some,
um,

737
00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:37.563
so

738
00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.580
<v 1>please
just for now,</v>

739
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.320
this is in purgatory on what products of love and he's not sure where we'll may

740
00:51:57.861 --> 00:51:59.110
or may not have factored into it.

741
00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.970
And because purgatory is the place that's in between,

742
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.980
it's also the place of that uncertainty.

743
00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.120
<v 0>Well,
I don't know about that.
The,
the,</v>

744
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:14.300
the question is really are a perplexity about what I have been now what have

745
00:52:14.471 --> 00:52:16.780
been saying,
uh,
in inferno,

746
00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:21.190
our will is crucial and you are absolutely right.

747
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:26.610
That cannot be a sin unless there is a will involved in purgatorial.

748
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:32.830
The argument here seems to be the way I've been following it from Canto 15,

749
00:52:32.831 --> 00:52:33.551
16,
17,

750
00:52:33.551 --> 00:52:38.290
and the way it's going to be developed in 18 and actually frankly 19 where Dante

751
00:52:38.291 --> 00:52:43.000
goes on telling you a dream.
Uh,
Dante makes the world of love.

752
00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.810
Uh,
the crucial,
um,
the,
the,

753
00:52:46.811 --> 00:52:49.480
the crucial act of our being in the world.

754
00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.930
What do they think us to God we had related to God,

755
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.910
really informed in through the way of love that for the way of the heart and not

756
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.870
unnecessarily through some abstract metaphysical issues.
Uh,

757
00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:06.060
but then the issue becomes how is this love related to,
uh,

758
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:09.700
the wheel is done,
being uncertain between the two.
What,
what is,

759
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:10.860
what is the moral,

760
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:15.890
the Dante begins in Canto 15 talking about moral responsibility is this kind of

761
00:53:15.971 --> 00:53:20.971
free subjection that we have and then in the light that is available to us,

762
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.940
uh,
then he came to 16.

763
00:53:25.050 --> 00:53:29.670
He will also talk about the,
the contracts in,
he talks about creation,

764
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:31.140
the creation of the soul,

765
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:36.000
the freedom which with which God creates and that freedom authorizes us,

766
00:53:36.330 --> 00:53:40.830
becomes a sort of ground for the human human freedom.

767
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.110
And then in 17,

768
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:48.470
first of all he talks about an imagination which is completely free of any

769
00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:53.460
contact with the world.
And then talks about this theory of love,

770
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.050
that rational love,

771
00:53:55.051 --> 00:53:59.100
that organized the level of knowledge that organizes everything.

772
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.950
I could just have stopped there and show you,
okay,

773
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:06.590
this is really what the text is and maybe ask you to connect the imagination and

774
00:54:06.591 --> 00:54:08.670
love that that um,

775
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:13.910
are really the two sides of Kantar 17 at the very center of the poem,

776
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.290
the almost to imply that we can love only and so far is,

777
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:22.970
and we can love as well as her imagination takes us to lovey.

778
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.550
That's clearly one of the,
the,
the images.

779
00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.640
But clearly there is more con in uh,
in,
in that debate,

780
00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:35.360
the debate is that if I love our cording well or not enough or too much,

781
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:41.340
that has to do with the way I perceive the world.

782
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:46.850
So why does he have to talk about an imagination which is so unbounded that

783
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.000
needs nothing of reality?
And I'm interested in this subject and I call it,
well,

784
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.740
I say,
well,
this is a visionary aspect of the imagination.

785
00:54:55.950 --> 00:55:00.950
It's a poet who thinks of himself as being the visionary poet and you know,

786
00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:05.260
you,
you have an idea of romantic poets,
for instance,
uh,

787
00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:10.310
English romantic poet who distinguish between fantasy and imagination.

788
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:15.530
Though Dante does it in terms of this imaginative power that removes me from the

789
00:55:16.141 --> 00:55:20.990
world of reality,
it takes me away and opens up new spaces and,
and,
and,

790
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.800
and,
and,
and their mind in itself.

791
00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:26.160
I asked this question or from another point of view,

792
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.680
which I think is connected to where we have been saying here,

793
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:34.280
can Dante ever right this kind of poem by being bound to the world of reality

794
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:39.900
and to the way that which the real world is known?
Clearly the answer is no.

795
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:45.260
The only way the Dante can come to God and the vision of God is by Larry.

796
00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:50.550
I agreeing with this idea yielding so rendering to the the power of the

797
00:55:50.551 --> 00:55:53.820
imagination that will take him out of the real world,
right?

798
00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:58.850
You cannot really write a poem like the divine comedy by following rules and

799
00:55:58.891 --> 00:56:03.810
laws where they are rhetorical or where they are.

800
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:08.190
Just pure ideas of style.
You try to,

801
00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:13.220
you have to go on imagining things that don't really are available to our

802
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:17.280
perceptions.
That to me is the issue.

803
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:19.200
That's how I have been moving this issue.

804
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:24.560
And I think that the poem that Dante's voice is to between these two

805
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:28.690
possibilities of the imagination and the imagination that has to accept the

806
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:31.690
world of reality and over dinner imagination.

807
00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:35.200
And yet that is also another idea of the imagination,

808
00:56:35.201 --> 00:56:37.780
which is so much more powerful.

809
00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:42.100
But if we accept this as being truthful,
the poem it follows,

810
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:47.101
we have to ask the question of what about the moral life is the moral life then

811
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:51.740
one that [inaudible] saying that in effect or law,
uh,

812
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.330
the language of blame and praise,

813
00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:01.520
which the pins on accepting limits and free subjection to two rules.

814
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:06.740
Uh,
is that,
is he saying that that is also,
uh,

815
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:11.460
maybe it's arbitrary that there may be some other low that he has to discover.

816
00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:14.340
And I don't think that there is yet an answer here,

817
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:19.670
but that's the problem that I was trying to convey was that that's that I hadn't

818
00:57:20.281 --> 00:57:24.430
seen your provisionally,
you're calm.
You're perplexities.
Okay.

819
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.260
<v 1>Yes.
Regarding Qantas 16,</v>

820
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:34.980
with division of anger serve beginning with division of banker,

821
00:57:34.981 --> 00:57:38.630
does that serve as the polar opposite condition to love?
Why did he,

822
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:44.520
<v 0>well,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,
the question is that's the,</v>

823
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.450
is the sin of anger in Canto 16?

824
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.560
Is that a kind of a polar opposite to love?

825
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:54.950
Why does he begin with and why does it begin with that?
That's right.
Well,

826
00:57:54.951 --> 00:57:58.850
I think that anger,
I would define it as a form of madness to topic.

827
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:03.880
I know this is a kind of eclipse all of all rationality.

828
00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:07.250
And so it explains why Dante,

829
00:58:07.251 --> 00:58:11.790
we'll have to go on retrieving the loads of reasons,

830
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:16.790
the loss of rationality to be opposed to the kind of to that,
that,
uh,

831
00:58:16.791 --> 00:58:21.791
the experience of madness in Canto and Canto 16 and we are going to cancer 17.

832
00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:28.220
And he's talking about the sort of,
uh,
love,
uh,
which is very rational,

833
00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:33.460
but then he is undoing it with something that stands between madness and in

834
00:58:35.121 --> 00:58:39.920
love.
And that's the imagination.
See the,
the connection.

835
00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:40.813
Okay.

836
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.600
<v 1>About what you just said.</v>

837
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:47.570
It might present a problem to the imagination.
And I'm,

838
00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:51.750
I just think what I've been understanding from what you've been saying about why

839
00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.660
imagination is because you're approaching like mystery.
So it's hard to,
um,

840
00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:59.430
use the real world,
you know,
to approach this.
So it seems like,

841
00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:02.580
and so you need the imagination,
I guess it's not,
is going to God,
you know,

842
00:59:02.581 --> 00:59:07.270
he's approaching mystery.
So it's hard for him to talk about this language.

843
00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:11.610
But isn't that more like an acknowledgement of his limitations then a

844
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.690
transgression?
So nothing,
it's still like fit with humility and fit.

845
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:21.780
<v 0>That's an excellent point.
You do normally ask the,
I think that you,</v>

846
00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.880
you are clarifying some of the,
the,
the problems.
Uh,

847
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:30.550
the question is still about the,
the whole issue of the imagination that,
ah,

848
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:32.300
are yes.
So now on the one hand,

849
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:36.500
the imagination seems to be the way to so large and so,

850
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:39.320
such a force that will take Dante,

851
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:43.750
I'm paraphrasing your point.
Take down all the way to,

852
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.170
to see God.

853
00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:50.080
And I seem to be saying that that is a kind of transgression,
but by you,

854
00:59:50.081 --> 00:59:55.081
or have you emphasize that that can be an acknowledgement of human limitations.

855
00:59:56.210 --> 00:59:59.960
Uh,
I call,
I call it,
um,
uh,

856
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:03.620
maybe that's true.
That's really what it is.
It's,
uh,

857
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:08.150
uh,
I call that a visionary power within him.

858
01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:13.250
It may be coming to him from the outside.
He asks that question.

859
01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:18.700
That's this visionary power come to me from the outside or is it something that

860
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.750
is within human beings?
That's the answer.
That's the question.

861
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:28.670
He doesn't answer that question at that point.
What he does say is,
well,

862
01:00:28.671 --> 01:00:33.440
this is the images that came to me,
the image of Amata who committed suicide.

863
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:37.880
Uh,
the image of our has Waitrose and so on.
He goes on with his three,
three,

864
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:40.550
uh,
three images.
Uh,

865
01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.480
he doesn't answer that directly and I think that yeah,

866
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.010
he wants to keep you guessing.
If this is a human transgression,

867
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:53.840
uh,
rather than,
or an acknowledgement of a human limits,
he,

868
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:58.640
I don't think that he knows yet at this point what the,
the,

869
01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.910
uh,
unfolding of that dilemma we'll be.

870
01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.790
He wants us to think in terms of a dilemma.

871
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.630
And that dilemma is at the heart of purgatory.
Um,

872
01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:14.350
the dilemma between what,
what is,
what is this power,
uh,

873
01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.360
have a power within me that without which I can never really go to God and is

874
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:21.290
this in any way a transgression?

875
01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:26.440
Do I need a transgression in order to come to God?
Um,

876
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:29.270
Julissa's thought that there would be knowledge,

877
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.130
no knowledge without transgression.

878
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.440
Maybe Adam in the garden also thought that there would be no knowledge without

879
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.410
transcript.
That they real knowledge is to transgress.

880
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.170
Is Dante thinking that way?

881
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:47.470
That or maybe he's thinking that there is no transgression without at the same

882
01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:52.721
time a sense of limitations that indeed that the idea of transgression depends

883
01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:56.780
on some sense of limitations.
Do you see what I'm saying?

884
01:01:56.781 --> 01:02:01.670
What the argument seems to me could very well be that in effect,
uh,

885
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:07.030
pride and humility are really more connected than a what we like to say.

886
01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:12.270
Oh,
so you know,
we're always proud,
you know,
um,
and,

887
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:16.250
and dental trade school to me,
that's what Ken Til 10,

888
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.070
11 and 12 was saying,
you may not agree with that.

889
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:22.020
That pride is good in the measuring,

890
01:02:22.021 --> 01:02:26.070
which I can reach out for something really high.
Yeah.
That's not bad.

891
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:30.900
That's not bad.
What is bad is that that blinds me to something else.
It's,

892
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.040
I take that to be Franciscan thinking.
He,

893
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:36.870
he's invoking the,

894
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:41.160
the humblest voice of the whole,
uh,

895
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:45.360
literary tradition,
uh,
up to his time,
the canticle of creatures.

896
01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.520
Um,
so,

897
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:52.500
but I'm glad that you are giving me the opportunity to refocus on the fact that

898
01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:57.501
that dilemma between pride and humility reappears as a question of limits and

899
01:02:58.381 --> 01:03:03.381
transgressions with the imagination and knowledge and with love and with love.

900
01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:04.770
Of course,

901
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.800
Dante would say that there is such a thing of love within with laws and yet love

902
01:03:11.311 --> 01:03:16.311
is one of those experiences where we usually don't like to believe that there

903
01:03:17.631 --> 01:03:22.360
are limits,
right.
Um,
of,

904
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.350
you know,
you don't want anybody to come,

905
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:30.351
I hope to come to your door and say I love you in a very reasonable way and with

906
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:36.570
a lot of limitations.
I'm sure you,
you'll kick him in the,

907
01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:40.170
it's behind this out.
Ah,
you know,

908
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.650
we love is one of those experiences.

909
01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:48.830
Exactly like the imagination that the powers of which cmos to be transgressing

910
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:51.870
whatever limitations we want to.

911
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.850
We wanted to transgress the limitations that a rational,

912
01:03:55.860 --> 01:04:00.480
the reasonably we want to impose on it.
This is the question of Dante is raising.

913
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.693
<v 1>Okay,</v>

914
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.920
<v 0>but you cannot have you,</v>

915
01:04:03.921 --> 01:04:07.200
I think that you are your own to the right track with your,

916
01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.690
in your paraphrasing the whole,
uh,
in your,

917
01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:14.780
in your asking the question that may be transgression and limitations who really

918
01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:15.960
have to be seen together.

919
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.070
Pride and humility will have to be Sidwell subjection and freedom will be,

920
01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:24.420
have to be seen together.
They are not,
they are not terms which are,

921
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.610
which are so far apart from each other.
Each involves the other.
Okay.

922
01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:35.010
That's what I call it.
The paradox there,
not that joins the syncs together,

923
01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.760
uh,
is exactly that.
Is this,

924
01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:42.150
am I did that confuse all of you today here?
Oh my.

925
01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:46.590
Then I will confuse you next time.
Okay.
Uh,
other questions?
So we have

926
01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.100
<v 1>yes section</v>

927
01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.960
where he's talking about

928
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:59.400
true love and love of God is like a mirror.

929
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:05.250
It's around
10 to 15.

930
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:11.810
Yes.
Harold,
how love of God is like a mirror that

931
01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:15.253
the more people,

932
01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:22.430
unless he gives back and it's like a mirror that keeps reflecting and
love.

933
01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.950
And I was wondering,
I was intrigued by the image of the mirror.

934
01:05:24.951 --> 01:05:29.450
So I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about how images mirrors and

935
01:05:29.451 --> 01:05:32.170
the idea of mirrors maybe are part of Dante skills.

936
01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:38.280
<v 0>The,
this is an online,
a 75 year old,
right?</v>

937
01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:40.960
Ah,
let me just read this part.

938
01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:45.970
We'll put half the Dante is in the describing the virtual that is opposed to

939
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.920
envy,
mercy,

940
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:54.150
the idea of the notion of mercy and uh,
uh,

941
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:59.470
because I did from 65 because there's still setlist they mind on earthly things.

942
01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:04.933
<v 1>MMM.</v>

943
01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:10.290
<v 0>Tell,
gather is darkness from the very light.
Huh?</v>

944
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:14.690
That's,
that's Pato.
Va Soto reversals that we,

945
01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:19.970
how light induces and generates darkness is a certain kind of light we seem to

946
01:06:21.531 --> 01:06:26.420
believe or to think in terms of,
uh,
the light that is available to us,

947
01:06:26.421 --> 01:06:30.820
but that does not necessarily produce more light,
but can,
can,

948
01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.920
can them our understanding or about the way things really are infinite.

949
01:06:37.251 --> 01:06:38.840
And then speakable good,

950
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:42.380
which is there are both speeds to love.

951
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.810
S as some beam comes to a bright body,

952
01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:49.880
so much it gives of itself as it finds of odd.
So the more charity extends,

953
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:53.420
the more there's the turtle goodness increase upon it.

954
01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.300
And the most souls that are Namor,

955
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:59.000
they are above the more that are sought to be rightly loved.

956
01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.430
And the more love that is.
And like a mirror,

957
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:05.090
the one returns it to the other.

958
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:09.100
And if my speech do not relieve the hunger,
that shall,

959
01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:13.910
thou shall see Beatrice Inn,
she will deliver the holy from this.

960
01:07:13.911 --> 01:07:16.930
And every other craving strive only that's sold,

961
01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:21.890
may be raised as the other two are already the five wounds which are healed by

962
01:07:21.891 --> 01:07:26.510
being,
uh,
uh,
by being painful.
So the question is,

963
01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:30.980
you want me to say something about the mirror,
the image of the mirror,

964
01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.610
the,
that is being used here.

965
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:37.040
The okay are,

966
01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:42.100
I think that this is a platonic emerge of the platonic image of uh,

967
01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:47.690
uh,
the,
the,
the notion that all of creation,

968
01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.460
this is the Celesio hierarchy of the pseudo the United States.

969
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:54.980
I don't know that I have ever spoken of him.

970
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:58.370
I will those Dante mentions him in paradise.

971
01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:01.160
But in the celestial hierarchy,
Dante,

972
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:06.780
the suit of the United States thing to vote creation being a kind of a location,

973
01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.580
being a kind of a hall of mirrors where everything is reflected on a to uh,

974
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:20.770
the other,
uh,
number of,
uh,
uh,
reflections,
ah,

975
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.810
that all give different law that the in different ways the light of God this is

976
01:08:27.230 --> 01:08:31.880
so that's where this the problem of mercy,
uh,
places are.

977
01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.470
So there's the idea of chat.
I think Dante is interested in two things.
One,

978
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:41.330
the generative idea of charity,
charity producers,

979
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.280
more charity is as a kind of,
uh,
uh,

980
01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.680
power to generate itself and multiply itself.

981
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.480
And the way he compares this is a,

982
01:08:52.481 --> 01:08:57.200
at comparison to what I called,
but he calls him briefly the whole of mirrors.

983
01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:58.453
Um,

984
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.760
let me just say something else about the [inaudible] when the sooner the United

985
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:06.950
States wants to mystical theology,

986
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:11.330
he wants to talk about the divine.

987
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:16.040
He will think about the divine in terms of light,
visual,
no light.

988
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:18.350
There is a reef refracted,
Eh,

989
01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:22.880
reflected throughout the the orders and ranks of creation.

990
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.560
The highest image of this light of the divine is the son.

991
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.940
The son that is generous in the sense was haven't been generous in a very

992
01:09:34.941 --> 01:09:39.941
peculiar says in the sense that he gives itself to all without any distinction.

993
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:46.670
And the tar depends on us whether we are going to be able to appreciate that

994
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:51.500
light or not,
but the sun is giving itself freely to haul.

995
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.300
This is the principle of mercy for that.

996
01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:58.640
Mirrors are reproducing that light endlessly.

997
01:09:58.641 --> 01:10:03.641
The whole creation is sending back this kind of light without any loss and

998
01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:06.500
itself of the original light.

999
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:11.000
This is the metaphor and the metaphysics of mirror in that,

1000
01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:12.290
uh,

1001
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:17.290
the world is therefore from the point of view of mercy and not from the point of

1002
01:10:17.331 --> 01:10:18.164
view of envy.

1003
01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:23.230
Where we do not even see the light MV is that it means that we have no knowledge

1004
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:28.370
of anything that comes from the,
from the outside.
But in the world of mercy,

1005
01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.730
we have an I,
we,

1006
01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:35.750
we understand this generous giving of the light would come.

1007
01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:40.520
She comes from God and the heat that goes with it.
Uh,
that's it.

1008
01:10:40.521 --> 01:10:42.400
So it's,
it's,
it's a,

1009
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.960
it's a virtual that completely offset the notion of,
uh,

1010
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:52.040
um,
of Mv,
the idea God who creates without envy.

1011
01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.390
That's another way of thinking about,
about,
uh,
the generosity of God.

1012
01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.700
And that is connected to the light and to the multiplication.

1013
01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.240
So the lights for mirrors.

1014
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.943
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1015
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:08.550
<v 0>Actually,
uh,</v>

1016
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:13.370
this is an image that really reappears in paradise and we'll come back to,
uh,

1017
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:17.280
this candle or the Hall of Paradise organized through this,

1018
01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:19.830
uh,
through this,
this whole,

1019
01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.180
this infinite reflections of,
uh,
of the,
of,

1020
01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:29.340
of,
of,
of God's light.
Other questions.

1021
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:36.503
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1022
01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.060
<v 0>Okay.
Well,
next time we'll see you [inaudible].</v>
