WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.770
With Ken to four of Paradise.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.670
We are now in the heaven of the Moon,

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.130
which is,

4
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:18.650
should know by now is also the,

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.460
the heavy,
the heaven of grandma.
And,
and that will show you in what way?

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.200
This is the,
the heaven of grammar,
uh,
in,
in Paradiso three,

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.080
Dante meets,
um,
to women,
uh,

8
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.070
the empress Constance and the irony of the name is a little bit obvious among

9
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:43.071
the inconstant spinet and Picada because the who also had the joy and the

10
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.990
cluster had taken the name of sister Constance.
She too,

11
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.380
but I was forced to leave the cluster on account of,

12
00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.220
uh,
uh,
brothers Corso Donati's,
uh,
uh,

13
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.460
political maneuvers.
He wanted her married to an ally of his,

14
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.380
um,
uh,
with can't afford them to return to this issue,

15
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.300
which is the issue really,
uh,
of,
uh,
the will.
What is the will,

16
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.430
how can somebody else's force on me,

17
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.943
um,

18
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.380
for Co compelled me to do things that I am accountable for?

19
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.180
In what way am I accountable for somebody else's,

20
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.310
a imposition of increase this case,
his will on me.

21
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.510
Uh,
Dante wants to know what is the wheel here?

22
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.950
Uh,
but there's another question that forces him to the,

23
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:52.340
another problem forces him to raise a question in canto four.
And a,

24
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.540
the question is,
uh,
uh,

25
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.570
Dante's wonder about the souls in the various stars.

26
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.320
They're disposed and the ranged in the various planets,

27
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.570
he sees some socio the moon.

28
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.440
So he wonders are we in Plato's,

29
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.630
um,
paradise is this is Plato,

30
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:20.631
right in believing that the souls at death return to the stars,

31
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.880
to the place of origin.
And these are the two questions that he has.
Uh,

32
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.870
he has to uh,
raise.
So,
uh,

33
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.460
the too begins with a statement that is extraordinary,

34
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.700
uh,
because I,

35
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:41.290
I will try to explain how the two questions are I related in what way they're

36
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.880
related or not just absolutely the arbitrary.
There is a,

37
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.830
a certain link between them.
Uh,
but the biggie the,

38
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.090
they can't afford begins in a very,
with,
uh,
with,
uh,
with,
uh,

39
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.990
at other strange formulation about the,
the,

40
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.680
the nature of the will and the freedom of the will.

41
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.910
So since that's what cons,
uh,
that,

42
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.620
that's what the car does situation had forced Dante to raise.

43
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.460
What is the will is somebody else's,
will uh,

44
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.140
forcing me to do something.

45
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.100
Am I still responsible for it at has to clarify what the wheel is.

46
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:23.101
So he starts with a statement that seems to suggest that the will is in Ert.

47
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.310
Uh,
this is,
uh,
a poem,
uh,

48
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.610
that the will cannot really make decisions.
First of all,

49
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.340
the will,
uh,

50
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.400
given the opportunity to choose between two contradictory objects of desire

51
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.550
can't quite move one way or the other.
You need the intellect.

52
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.080
That's the argument that makes the will take,
make a decision.

53
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.790
We'll force the world to make a decision.

54
00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.030
And this is the way he starts between two foods are equal distance and equally

55
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.550
tempting if free men would die of hunger before he brought her either to his

56
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:07.234
lips

57
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.820
and [inaudible] would stand between the cravings of two fears.

58
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:15.700
Wolves in equal fear of both.

59
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.920
This seems to be a kind of will that joins human beings and animals says that

60
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:21.880
paralyzes us.

61
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:26.170
The choices paralyzes the will so that maybe when we speak about freedom of the

62
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.750
will,
we are not speaking,
read about freedom of the will.

63
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.830
We speaking about the freedom of the will in the intellect.

64
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.390
It's the intellect that has to be free.
So that's,
that's really the argument.

65
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.450
Uh,
so would the hounds then between two dose,

66
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.860
therefore this is the sed,

67
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.710
three imagers that introduced Dante's own doubts and perplexities.

68
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:52.060
He has two questions.
Each of them seems come more compelling than the other.

69
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.380
It does not know what to ask first.
So we'll the hound stand between two dose.

70
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.090
Therefore,
if I kept silence,

71
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.270
urged equally by my doubts and other blame or commend myself since it was of

72
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.930
necessity,
I was silent,
but my desire was painted on my face and with it,

73
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:11.920
my question far more warmly than in plain words.

74
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.200
So Dante's indeed talking about the limitations of the will,

75
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.490
not that they will is this is an a verus position.

76
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.290
It's a position of a radical interpretation of Aristotle that the will is in

77
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:26.561
earth.

78
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:31.561
That you always need some kind of the power of the intellect to make you decide.

79
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.610
The intellect cannot move,

80
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.070
but the intellect and made the will move so that the statement has to be

81
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:44.071
understood as one of the hierarchy between intellect and will that the argument

82
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:46.810
and our continuous Beatrice did this,

83
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:50.100
the Daniel when he appeased the wrath of Nebraska,
Donna's uh,

84
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.860
that made him cruelly and just,
and she said,
I see where,

85
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.070
how one desire and then other droll day sort of their eagerness itself binds

86
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.320
itself and does not good breath.
That's the reasons.
If the right,

87
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:08.321
we'll a newers on what ground does another's violence lesson the measure of my

88
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.610
dessert,
how can it be that?

89
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.030
Because the who was forced by somebody else's will,

90
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.370
it seems to appear in the lowest,

91
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.230
the lowest birth of beatitudes.
She's on the moon.

92
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.880
Why should she be so undeserving of,
of,

93
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.960
of a closer intimacy to God?
Um,

94
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.060
so that's a curious question.
Also,

95
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.740
it gives the perplexity that their soul seems to return to the stars in

96
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:41.450
agreement with Plato's teaching.

97
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.240
These are the questions that press equally on thy will first.

98
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:49.130
Then I shall deal with the one which is more poison in it.

99
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.410
And it's very interesting,
first of all,
the language of poison.
But the,
the,

100
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:59.390
this idea of what is dangerous of the two questions is not the question about

101
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:01.100
the will that the question,

102
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:04.850
which is more dangerous is the question that deals with representation.

103
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.300
Where is the mode of appearance of the souls in heaven?

104
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.070
And why should representation do the sols in habit stars?

105
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.110
Are they showing themselves forth?

106
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:22.430
Here it is a make believe that they are here.
It's a fiction.

107
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.780
It's pyrotechnics if you wish.
And once the night is over,

108
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.530
then the soles return to the probe proper abode,

109
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.340
which may or may not be visible to the pilgrim.

110
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.090
Is this a theatrical performance and why?

111
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.950
If this is a theater and it is,

112
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.990
why should that be a question that has more poison in it?

113
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.890
Why,
what,
what's so dangerous about representation?

114
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:53.891
That's really the argument that as Dante puts it forth here at the beginning,

115
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.470
at least,
and then she goes on for,

116
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:02.270
so let's discuss it and then we'll as we discuss it,
we tried to understand,
uh,

117
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:06.680
the question why this is representation are such,

118
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.380
such a hard issue.

119
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.590
And she says not he have the set of him.

120
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.190
This is lines Paradiso four lines 28.

121
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.820
There is most made one with God the the in the choir of angels,

122
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.160
those who are closest to God,
not Moses,

123
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.430
Samuel or whichever John Doe will none the apostle or the visionary this year,

124
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.290
not Mary herself have their set seed in other heaven from this spirit that have

125
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:41.180
now appeared to the,
this is the poetics of paradise by the way,

126
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.150
that we are really confronted with.

127
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.580
How do the sols show themselves forth to the pilgrim?

128
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.880
What is the mode of Dante's representation in paradise from the spirits?

129
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.640
I have an iPad nor for there being have more years of few words,

130
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.110
but all make fair.

131
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.940
The first circle hold sweet life in different measure is they feel more or less

132
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.610
the eternal breath.
These,
which we're seeing here and,
uh,

133
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.740
on the moon are,
are,
have shown themselves here.

134
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.050
Not that this fear is allotted to them,

135
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.320
but in sign of the Hemley rang that is least exalted.

136
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.430
They have,
uh,

137
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.690
they enjoy a lower degree of beatitude than the other souls.

138
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:31.320
So they just appear here for your benefit.

139
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.380
In other words,
the whole of Paradise,

140
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.260
that representational paradise is fictional.

141
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.630
And once the pilgrim disappears,
so will the soles vanish.

142
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:47.660
They will return into the bosom of Abraham in according to biblical accounts.

143
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.500
Uh,
it is necessarily now that explains why they need for this allegorize is

144
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:58.710
allegorical,
our lego article,
language,
allegorical representation.

145
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.400
It isn't necessary to speak to us,
to your faculty,

146
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.890
since only from sense perception.

147
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.580
Does it grasp that which then makes fit for the intellect.

148
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:16.190
So the whole of paradise is literally and accommodation of Veritas of realities

149
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.760
that far exceed the powers of our mind.
And now it's,
it's,

150
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.100
it's,
uh,
a condescension.

151
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.440
The soul's condescend to show themselves down to us.
So Dante,
first of all,

152
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:34.380
has been talking about the limitations of the will.

153
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.620
Now he's talking about the limitations of the intellect.

154
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:43.220
So these are the two issues that join and intellectually speaking that the

155
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:48.360
candle for and each seems to need the other,

156
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.250
uh,
and be made stronger in the light of the other.

157
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.040
And 90 goes on explaining this,
uh,

158
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:01.100
this mode of representation which he says is not only true for paradise,

159
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.180
but it's true for scripture.

160
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.840
It's true for all the iconography of the churches.

161
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.550
And that's where he says it's necessarily to speak.
Um,
for this reason,

162
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.070
scripture condescends in the,

163
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:15.990
in the literal sense of the word and etymologically,

164
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.290
it comes down to us that accommodates itself to our limited faculties.

165
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.410
Condescends to your capacity and the tributes,

166
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.280
hands and feet to God having and other meaning.

167
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:30.930
That's the definition of an allegory.

168
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.780
The Bible in deed speaks of the hand of God.

169
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.630
It's an anthropomorphic trope.

170
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.910
The guard has no feet and has no hand.
And what it means,
it's something else.

171
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.930
It means the power of God or The Majesty of God,

172
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:49.650
the feet of God,
et Cetera,
or with the feet.
But now with this,

173
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:52.920
there is a language of representation.
Even in the,

174
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.000
that in many ways also rises Dante's own juice of representation.
Is this clear?

175
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.600
So far?
Good.
There's no,
no,
no,
no real,
no real difficulty.
This,

176
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.970
this issue.
Um,
and then you're going to tell,

177
00:12:04.971 --> 00:12:09.280
take this for this reason is that that um,
and holy church,

178
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.700
but that's what happens in the Bible.
It talks about the feet of God.

179
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.480
We read about the feet have gotten a heck of a holy church represents to you

180
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:20.050
with human aspect angels that have no human form.

181
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.080
Gabriel and Michael and the other who made top it whole again and now the

182
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:28.990
distinction between the metaphor,

183
00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:32.230
the platonic metaphor and the biblical allegory.

184
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.010
What ty meals argues about the souls.
It's not like that.

185
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.060
What we see here for when he says he seems to hold for truth,

186
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.080
that's already one,
one,
one basic difference.
It is.

187
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.580
It seems that what's what for the Bible is a metaphor becomes true in the

188
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:51.010
context of the time ears.
He says,

189
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.040
Plato says the soul returns to its own staff from which he believes it to have

190
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:59.770
been separated when nature gave it four form.

191
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.310
He literalize is the idea of the souls returning,

192
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:08.430
returned to the stars by perhaps this view is other than his words express Emma

193
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:13.600
have a meaning not to be despised if he means to return to the return to this

194
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:18.160
wheels of the honor and blame of the influence.
If by returning to the stars,

195
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:23.161
it seems to imply that at the fall of this soles is also go through the various

196
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:28.300
stains of the planet.
And,
and,
and then the return to this,
the,

197
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:28.810
the,
the,

198
00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:33.210
the planets from which they originated his Bob perhaps strikes are certain
truth.

199
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.940
The principal is understood once misled almost the whole world.

200
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.500
So that went astray,
naming them Jupiter and mercury,
Mars,
et cetera.

201
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.600
So Dante's,
um,
uh,
then,
then Beatrice says,

202
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:49.540
[inaudible] the other doubt.
This is the language of doubt.

203
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.680
Intellectual doubts,

204
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:56.070
which are always part of truth for tanties the truth that generates a truth that

205
00:13:57.731 --> 00:14:00.200
generates doubt because their mind is,

206
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.690
is that exactly the way he described the will both restless.

207
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.610
Both need a nourishment,
constant nourishment.

208
00:14:09.611 --> 00:14:13.370
So this had intellectual doubts.
The other doubt that troubles the,

209
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:18.070
the has less poison.
He repeats this idea,
less danger.

210
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.970
He hasn't said yet why the world of representation is dangerous.

211
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:24.490
And actually he lives at,
at,
at,
at,

212
00:14:24.491 --> 00:14:28.180
at this because it's mischief could not lead the away from me.

213
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.160
The other justice that other justice appears unjust in the eyes of maltose is

214
00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:35.500
evidence of faith.
And we'll go back and we'll go in a moment,

215
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:40.590
but let me stay with,
uh,
with the first question that Beatrice as a resolve,

216
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.200
uh,
for the pilgrim and for us.
She's,

217
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.970
she's distinguishing between the theology,
the biblical theology,

218
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:53.630
and let's call it the philosophical allegory,

219
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:57.470
a biblical allegory and philosophical allegory.

220
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.500
The language of metaphor in the Bible as the language of Metaphor,

221
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.900
truth in,
uh,
in Plato,
uh,

222
00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.720
and Dan himself clearly is here legitimizing his own use of metaphor.

223
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:16.040
The whole port is indeed a metaphorical journey,

224
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:17.150
um,

225
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:22.150
whereby Dante is both simultaneously a biblical and also philosophical.

226
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:24.640
He,
he's,
he's,
he's,

227
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.910
he's finding and trying to decide on the common ground,

228
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.810
the metaphorical language that the Bible and Plato,

229
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.150
we'll use an and therefore himself.

230
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.330
But why is representation so dangerous that has so much poison in it.

231
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:47.450
And Beatrice twice goes back to that image.
And I think that the answer is this,

232
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.740
that representation has the power to cancel or erase the world of references,

233
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.980
which it represents.

234
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.630
The presentation has the power to um,

235
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.490
to make appearances.

236
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.940
The only reality Simulacra the only reality that we manage to see,

237
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.420
and it literally covers it eclipses or references.

238
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.910
That's what makes a representation so dangerous.
It has,
uh,
we,

239
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.920
we are,
uh,
by virtue of the representation,

240
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.500
we ended up in a kind of quandary in the predicament of believing that that's

241
00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:30.261
all that it is.

242
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:35.261
That what that which is visible is the only real thing and invest they

243
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:36.321
appearance,

244
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:41.321
invest that simulacrum with the salt of value that it normally does not have

245
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.080
because it actually,

246
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:49.081
it points nobody that doesn't have because it points for Dante to essence is

247
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:52.520
behind it.
We have seen here the souls,
the soul.

248
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:56.480
So I wrote this is not the real home for the spirits.

249
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.580
The real home is somewhere else.

250
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.760
We may make the mistake Dante made of believing that the souls actually live in

251
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.860
on the moon and therefore that we are in a platonic other world.

252
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.110
In another world where there's holes,
go back to it.

253
00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:17.410
The journey of Dante is the journey between images and testing of what this

254
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.780
images may mean.
Finding out whether this in behind this images,

255
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.550
there is some kind of substance,

256
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:30.551
some kind of reality than politically removed between the two words and things,

257
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.060
images or representations and,

258
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.240
and appearances and the world of essences and,
and,
and,

259
00:17:39.241 --> 00:17:41.420
and tries to join the two of them.

260
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.640
So you understand why representation is the key issue here.
Uh,

261
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:49.980
let me also add that this,
this course on allegory justifies,

262
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:54.870
it gives you an idea why Dante has been that this is the heaven of grammar.

263
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.680
Since the allegorical discourse is a grammatical issue is remember that have

264
00:17:59.681 --> 00:18:04.340
been talking about how each planet seems to deploy,
uh,

265
00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.310
uh,
well,
one of the liberal arts.
But this is the,

266
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.230
the reason why we can connect to our grammar and,
uh,
and,

267
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:12.990
and the more,

268
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.990
the other problem the Dante raises in Canto for is the question of the will.

269
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.150
And,
uh,
and he,
he,
he,

270
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:26.100
that's an easier issue because he just goes on distinguishing between what we

271
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:28.230
call a conditional will,
the will,

272
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:33.231
what we will whenever we are beset by circumstances that forced on us some

273
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.000
resolutions and then absolute will the absolute will of the martyrs of those who

274
00:18:39.001 --> 00:18:40.290
are,
for instance,

275
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.090
who are unwavering and faltering in the confrontation with,
uh,

276
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.100
with particular experiences.
Okay.
So,
uh,
the souls of this,
uh,

277
00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:54.560
of a,
of Bacardi and Costanza,
they were really,
uh,
exist.

278
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.930
Exercising their own conditional will,
not their absolute well.

279
00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.560
So it's an interesting distinction and we live it at that.
Um,

280
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.610
we moved downstairs to the heaven of the Canto six,

281
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.890
the heaven of dialectics of Mercury.
A why Mercury's the,

282
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.740
why should he be the God.
Uh,
this is the planet mercury,

283
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:20.580
but the God are tied with dialectics or logic,

284
00:19:20.581 --> 00:19:23.580
which are really not exactly the same thing,
but Dante,

285
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:27.200
that's use them interchangeably.
Hermes is of course the,

286
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:31.950
that God known the psychopomp,
the one who brings,
you know,

287
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.900
you know,
that the part,
the mythology,

288
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:39.090
the God who brings messages to,
to the world,

289
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:43.050
the,
the,
the realm of,
of,
of shades,
the roam of the dead,

290
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.720
the care is the souls to hades.
That's one of the,
the,

291
00:19:47.721 --> 00:19:51.000
the ideas of,
uh,
uh,
the resonances of mercury.

292
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.440
Now there is also others that mercury is the God who are the bearer of laws,

293
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:59.790
the better of messages of the gods to human beings,
the bearer of laws.

294
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.380
Uh,
the,
the,
uh,

295
00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.690
the god of the marketplace though doesn't seem to have much,

296
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.940
much impact.
That particular relevance,

297
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.770
Particular Resonance Of the myth to this,
uh,
this cancer and this,

298
00:20:13.771 --> 00:20:17.160
the logic,
what is the,
what are they electives?

299
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.900
Gotta with understand where they electrics is one of the arts of the trivium.

300
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.580
And it is the art by which I mean to which,
which provides really a method.

301
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.170
That's the way it's defined.

302
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.550
It provides a method to distinguish between truth and false foods.

303
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.110
Uh,
so it's,
it's,
uh,
let's see how this is going to be present.

304
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:41.280
Interestingly enough,
Dante's really talking about laws here.

305
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:46.260
And actually I'm here.
He meets the great theorist,
uh,

306
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:47.020
the,
the,
the,

307
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.580
the emperor Justinian who is responsible and who is usually acknowledged as the

308
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:56.410
one who favored the reorganization of Roman law in,

309
00:20:56.411 --> 00:21:01.390
uh,
in BizOps hill,
which is where he lived.
Um,
okay.
And,

310
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:05.350
and not only needs to Gio stadium,
but he also tells the story of Rome.

311
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:08.780
So it's a cantor about history.
And the,
the,

312
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:13.790
the idea is what's the rationality of Roman history?

313
00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:18.820
Is there in rationality to it?
If dialectics is also the,
the,

314
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.100
uh,
the science of,
uh,
uh,

315
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:25.270
the power to distinguish between false hood and truths,

316
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:30.040
it's also irrational,
uh,
irrational,
uh,
discipline.

317
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:35.220
The discipline that follows the rule of reasonable means of which one can go on

318
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.750
making those distinctions.
So the question becomes,

319
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.800
what is the rationality of the Roman empire were kind of,
of,

320
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.860
of justice,
uh,
was there in it.

321
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.510
So Lowe's and at the same word,
the logos,
uh,

322
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.360
seems to be ruling the unfolding of this Canto.

323
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.830
And it begins with the story of Constantine,

324
00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:02.130
who we have met before for the famous as we are accountable for the donation of

325
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:05.920
Constantine.
The you may know,
uh,

326
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:10.950
it's the famous alienation of imperial property to the church for Constantine's

327
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:18.900
as Constantine's token of gratitude to the Pope Silvester,

328
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.360
uh,
who had cured him of leprosy.

329
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.980
And this gave rise to a famous,
uh,
uh,

330
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.760
much debated,
uh,
donation,
uh,

331
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:34.270
which Dante dismisses.
So Dante views as nothing,

332
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.250
less transgressive,

333
00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:41.470
nothing less tragic and disruptive of the older of the world.
Then for instance,

334
00:22:41.471 --> 00:22:46.240
Adam's sin.
It's really they hey ma,
cosmic propulsion,
uh,

335
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.690
because it mixes together the sacred and the profane.

336
00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:53.520
It makes the pope at temporal ruler and,
and,

337
00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:58.521
and that is the ultimate degradation of the moral of the moral authority,

338
00:22:58.561 --> 00:23:03.130
the exercise of moral authority from Dante's viewpoints.
So this is,
uh,

339
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.650
this is the illusion to the duration,

340
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.690
but the initial to a donation he is taken into.
Now the,
uh,

341
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:13.360
the reference to Constantine has a slightly different,
uh,
uh,

342
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.640
sense after Constantine,
he says,

343
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.690
turn back the Eagle against the courts of heaven.

344
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:25.110
We had followed behind him of old that took Lavinia to wife for 200 years and

345
00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:29.320
more the bird of God,
Eagle,

346
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.680
the emblem of the empire remained on the bounds of Europe near the mountains

347
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:40.480
from which it first came forth and their rule the world under the shadow of the

348
00:23:40.481 --> 00:23:45.440
sacred wings passing from hand to hand.
And so changing came into mine.

349
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:50.490
I was Caesar,
Oh,
the imperial,
uh,

350
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.610
title.
The imperial persona has disappeared.

351
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.400
And now he appears as I am Justinian here once again,
the use of that,

352
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.410
that,
that,
that shift of verbs from the past to the president.

353
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:06.220
And now I'm in the eternal life.
I am myself.
I just sit.

354
00:24:06.221 --> 00:24:08.930
And who by we'll have the primal love,

355
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:11.270
which moves me removed from the laws.

356
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.370
What it was superfluous and uh,
and vain made the distinction.

357
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:19.130
This is really a definition of dialectics made.

358
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:23.690
The distinction between the purpose and very negative was essential.

359
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.580
Uh,
let me,
uh,
give a gloss on this first paragraph.

360
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.570
The illusion is to Constantine's moving.

361
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.270
That's the other sense.
I,
it all don't donation,

362
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.570
but moving the seat of the empire from Rome to the east designs Hume.

363
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.680
Okay.

364
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.680
And this is seen as the violation of a metaphor of is the paradigm of history,

365
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.500
which was called Translab Theo

366
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.090
translatable in Perry.
Uh,
what is this?
What does it mean?

367
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.740
It's the idea of you'd all day in the Middle Ages or speak of translation all

368
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:13.820
the time.
The translation of studies,
uh,
translation of the empire,

369
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:18.110
the idea that the whole of history follows a pattern,

370
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.710
a movement from east to west,

371
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.140
and therefore the,
uh,
the,
the,

372
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:29.250
the duration of history is patterned on the movement of the sun from east to

373
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:30.650
west.

374
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:35.650
And with the idea that when the empire reaches the most western point,

375
00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:40.400
the western most point of,
uh,
of the map,

376
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.900
that's going to be also the end of history.
It's the end of the day,

377
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.080
the sunset and the end of history.
Okay.

378
00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:51.470
So constantly by turning back the,

379
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:56.180
this translation of this movement,
that's what it means to transport a transfer,

380
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.860
um,
uh,
of,

381
00:25:57.861 --> 00:26:01.640
of the empire actually delays the apocalyptic.

382
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.410
They knew more the end of time.
And the end of the day.

383
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.191
And for Dante,

384
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:11.600
this is a major violation of the economy of history.

385
00:26:11.601 --> 00:26:16.601
So it begins with this idea of a violation or tragic violation of history

386
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.210
brought about by uh,
constantly.

387
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.480
And the illusion of course is the other illusion is 20 years with whom the

388
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:28.481
empire had started after the fall of Troy had started to go west westward and

389
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:34.010
then constantly reverses all of this.
You understand,
by the way,
this is,
I mean,

390
00:26:34.011 --> 00:26:38.420
this is,
uh,
uh,
on,
on election day,
I really should mention this,

391
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:43.660
that the whole idea of manifest destiny is based on this principle of the

392
00:26:45.151 --> 00:26:50.151
Translock Feo imparity cause the empire moves west word all the time.

393
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:54.840
Uh,
so,
uh,
we are now therefore,
uh,

394
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.790
in the proper commpass,
uh,
of,
uh,
of history,

395
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.830
so to speak.
Uh,
okay.
So constantly with Levenia who went backwards,

396
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:08.020
a vineyard,
why for the the,
um,

397
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.620
of an years.
Uh,
I must also indicate to you at this could become,

398
00:27:13.621 --> 00:27:15.720
in case you're still looking for a topic,

399
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.030
this is one of the first times that Dante starts using this geographical

400
00:27:21.031 --> 00:27:24.210
coordinates,
the geographical description.
Europe.

401
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:28.170
He has really not done that in neither an inferno,

402
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.420
no improve the Tori,

403
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:35.930
but now Europe becomes an increased concern of his whatever historical

404
00:27:37.591 --> 00:27:42.570
information may have of it now.
And it's,
it's uh,
uh,
this is,

405
00:27:42.571 --> 00:27:43.650
uh,
uh,

406
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.450
the Europe and the east and none who we'll be talking about the,
the,
the,

407
00:27:48.451 --> 00:27:51.720
the borders of Europe in the West.

408
00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:55.390
There's a kind of idea of,
of,

409
00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.480
of a Europe that has his asking what kind of messages can come from Europe,

410
00:28:05.071 --> 00:28:08.820
which is still valid,
legitimate today.

411
00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:12.420
This is a sort of incredible questions that he will ask,
um,

412
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:17.690
in distinguishes between Rome and Europe in the sense that Rome,

413
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:23.150
he will say in a political track that he writes that the history of Rome,

414
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:28.440
it's different from the history of Europe.
13,
20,

415
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:33.420
he writes this kind of thing.
13,
18,
maybe he writes this threat and the em,

416
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:38.010
the,
the,
the emblem for Europe's a firm,

417
00:28:38.011 --> 00:28:39.200
sorry for rooms.

418
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:43.320
Distinctiveness is to be found in any,

419
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:47.880
his experience of meringue.
Three wives,

420
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.050
he may risk crazy as we are here from the Aeneid.

421
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.070
He may arrest Deitel though.

422
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:59.460
It's a marriage of convenience.
So to speak,
but it's a marriage.

423
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.930
And um,

424
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:05.490
and then he may raise Levenia and 90 goes on to explain the three ways the three

425
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:09.750
wives he marries are one from Asia,
one from Africa,

426
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.040
and one from Europe.
So that an he,

427
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.540
his whole experience,

428
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.520
whole history encompasses what are the time was thought of as universality,

429
00:29:20.521 --> 00:29:24.270
the three known continents in a wing of which only Europe,

430
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.210
Europe is only a part.
Okay.
So keep that in mind.

431
00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:30.690
I will talk more about this metaphor as it appears now.

432
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.160
This is the context of Europe.

433
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.840
So Justinian and the reference to uh,

434
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.300
his,
um,
his,

435
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:44.330
his reorganization of the Roman code known as they Justinian code.

436
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:49.710
And then now we have a history of the empire from the emperor.

437
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:53.620
We have what seems to be a celebration of the Roman Empire.

438
00:29:53.621 --> 00:29:54.820
This is Canto six,

439
00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:59.260
therefore like Canto six of inferno and Canto six of Purgatorio.

440
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.800
The focus is political.
It's not just the city or Italy.

441
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:06.030
Now it's the whole empire.
Uh,
and,
uh,

442
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.810
but what begins as a celebration of the empire in effect,

443
00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:15.811
turns out to be a critique of the ideology of the empire.

444
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.150
The Myth,

445
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:22.150
the mythological reading that we can find in Augustine's confessions.

446
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.530
Uh,

447
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:28.330
Dante follows two models here and there are two models that are contradictory

448
00:30:28.331 --> 00:30:31.210
with each other and they sort of presentation of Canto six.

449
00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:34.840
We have the Virginia and model of the Roman Empire,

450
00:30:34.841 --> 00:30:38.920
which is really a celebration of its origins with an years,
uh,

451
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:39.910
with palace,

452
00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:44.911
the whole account told and in the Aeneid and with the vision of what is to come.

453
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.010
But then there is around the fifth century,

454
00:30:48.011 --> 00:30:50.560
the Augustine writes in the city of God,

455
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.970
a fierce critique of the empire.
The empire has fallen,

456
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.310
the claims by the time Augusta writes,

457
00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:02.260
the claims of the eternity of the empire turn out to be hollow.
And two,

458
00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:07.261
Augustan the empire is nothing less than another one of,

459
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:07.931
uh,

460
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:12.931
another episode in the long history of a predatory,

461
00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:14.523
uh,

462
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.800
politics of imperial possessions and violence.

463
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.220
It.

464
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.220
The Roman Empire is an empire is no better than all the other empires that have

465
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:30.640
grown,
been that had long vantage and vanquished.
Okay,

466
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:31.600
so this is the,

467
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:36.010
these are the two models that Dante's evoking and in fact the very language,

468
00:31:36.011 --> 00:31:38.500
just to give you an idea,
at one point,
Dante,

469
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:43.501
we'll say it's down knowest aligns 35 and 40 that it is made,

470
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:44.890
it's stay.

471
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.490
The Eagle is the story is told through the vicissitudes of this emblem of the

472
00:31:50.531 --> 00:31:55.531
symbolic emram the Eagle for 300 years or more till the last still for its sake,

473
00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.490
the three Razzi you may,
you may know a little bit of Roman history.

474
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:01.480
That curiosity,

475
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.020
who fight it out with the duel between the three brothers and the other three

476
00:32:05.021 --> 00:32:07.840
brothers,
the three,
four,
two,
the three and you know,

477
00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:09.850
it was what it did under seven kings,

478
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.800
the story of the seven kings from the wrongs and Sebine women to the wool of

479
00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:18.250
Lucrece conquering the neighboring people around about,

480
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.600
these are all phrases that come straight out of Augustine's city of God and they

481
00:32:26.061 --> 00:32:31.061
are used as cases had exemplifying the libido of power.

482
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.110
It Rome erotic stories of erotic violence,

483
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.780
Lucretia who has been raped.

484
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.710
And the story of this Hubba and women who have been kidnapped by the,
the,
uh,

485
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:46.790
the bands of Romulus and Remus and there are other outlaws.

486
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.200
There's this idea that the empire was,
was born in,
uh,

487
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.760
in a condition of outlaws.

488
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:57.910
So damp is using the perspective of Augustan because have Gustin had used these

489
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:02.360
examples to them,
the empire and its own,
uh,

490
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.240
Barand policies,
but at the same time,

491
00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.850
all the rest is really Virgilian.

492
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.240
This is the moment when virgin and the gas didn't really disagree from each

493
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:14.690
other.
Why does Dante do this?
What is this?

494
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.720
What is the reason for bringing together two contradictory sources of historical

495
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.820
thought?
What is,
what,

496
00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:27.010
what's the idea of poetic mythology of Rome is in favor of the empire or is he

497
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:32.030
against the empire?
Is Izzy with a Gaston or is he with,
um,

498
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:36.940
actually with Virgil when one thing is clear that our Gustin who loves Virginia

499
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:39.590
of course,
uh,
decides that this is,

500
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:44.800
that the empire is an abandoned a reality in his own history,

501
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:49.370
it's already falling,
falling apart.
And,
uh,
uh,

502
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.790
he has no use for this in his theological vision.

503
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:57.740
The question that he raises is,
what do I care who governs me?

504
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:02.930
Provided this is here,
that they do not make me sin.

505
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.460
The reality is an internalized reality.
That reality is that one,

506
00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:11.460
which is in the interior life of all of us and what our empires,

507
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:13.700
if not great thefts,

508
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:17.300
he will go on dismissing all of this.

509
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:20.990
He a Roman citizen at,
at,
at,
at the end,

510
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:25.760
at the twilight of the empire as the sixth century or show.

511
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:30.860
Uh,
so what is,
what does this done to stand in between them?
So he continues,

512
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:34.820
I'll have an answer.
I hope he continues for now.
We don't,

513
00:34:34.821 --> 00:34:38.300
he doesn't tell us yet.
A Thou knowest did,
was born,

514
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:42.440
but it lustrous Romans against Bruner's.
Um,
uh,
it brought her,

515
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.560
brought low the pride of the Arabs who behind Hannibal past the Alpine crags

516
00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:53.720
from which Po,
uh,
uh,
follow stuff.

517
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.730
The follows under it.
Uh,
it's huge.

518
00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:00.950
You in Pohnpei triumph then near the time,
etc. Uh,

519
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.980
this will continue into the violation of the Rubicon by Caesar.

520
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.760
And,
uh,
it,
it,
uh,

521
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.270
and then it goes home with Charlemagne line 95 and following.

522
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.910
And now let me just read the passage,

523
00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:21.350
the last passage now the cons judge of such men as I accused before,

524
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.430
um,
and over their offenses,
which are the costs of all your drills.

525
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.800
They weren't opposes to the public standards,

526
00:35:27.801 --> 00:35:30.110
the yellow leaders and the other claims,

527
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:34.910
the lilies are friends and the other claims that for the party so that it's hard

528
00:35:34.911 --> 00:35:35.890
to see which offense,

529
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.900
the more let the Gibber liens the can't all of a sudden becomes a vocative seems

530
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:44.720
to turn into a replica of inferno,

531
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.880
six of the civil war between wealth.

532
00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.900
And he believes it starts as a celebration and then call me some of the empire

533
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.470
and its role in history,
right?

534
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.960
This westward movement of,
uh,
of,
of tor,

535
00:35:59.961 --> 00:36:01.310
then apocalyptic conclusion.

536
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:06.350
And now all of a sudden it goes back to let the Berlin's carry on the odds and

537
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.990
the,
another standard for of this is always a bad photo.

538
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:13.390
Who serves it from justice and let,
not this new child star,

539
00:36:13.391 --> 00:36:16.440
I get it with a Welsh,
but let him feel its clause,

540
00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:21.620
which have torn the hide from a greater lion many time before now have the

541
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:26.340
children wept for the father's fault and let him look thing God will change arms

542
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.210
for uh,
their Lilly's.
So what is this?

543
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:34.800
It starts with the empire ends up with the civil war and the civil war is really

544
00:36:34.801 --> 00:36:39.801
the perspective from which Dante can take this double view on the history of the

545
00:36:41.911 --> 00:36:46.170
empire,
where Dante can really stand up to the opposite,
the,
the,

546
00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:50.430
the stance of Augustan and the stance of,
uh,
of,

547
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.170
of a god Oh of Virgil.
And that when he's really seems to be saying,

548
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.950
I think is this yes,
gas,
then you are right.

549
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:04.340
That the empire is really a negative force in,

550
00:37:04.981 --> 00:37:08.700
has been a negative hope force in history.
And that the reality is the,

551
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:11.760
as you say,
and internalize the reality of our own,

552
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:17.130
the overall piece,
the kind of internal will that we can,

553
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.180
we managed to plicate,
uh,
at the same time he says for Virgil,

554
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.610
but you're also right in,

555
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.490
<v 1>okay.</v>

556
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.920
<v 0>Your valorization of the empire.</v>

557
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

558
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:33.350
<v 0>Because the empire has brought about some older and laws into the world.</v>

559
00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.100
So that's the argument.

560
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:37.433
<v 1>And yet</v>

561
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.100
<v 0>against her Godson,
he says,</v>

562
00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:42.060
<v 1>okay,</v>

563
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.960
<v 0>if there were no laws and there were no loss of the empire,</v>

564
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:51.330
then there would be no way of sheltering each and every one was in case of the

565
00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:52.164
civil war.

566
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.620
What makes the argument for the necessity of the empire is the reality of the

567
00:37:57.781 --> 00:37:58.614
civil war,

568
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:03.770
which really demands the presence of x transcendence institution that will

569
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:08.990
manage to contain the violence of human beings.

570
00:38:08.991 --> 00:38:12.810
So you can see he had agrees with Augusta and disagrees with Augusta.

571
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.570
He agrees with Virgil and disagrees with Virgil.

572
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:20.050
Virgil leaves no room for the internal.
The,

573
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.760
in that experiences of Christians,
uh,

574
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:28.761
on the other hand are Gastin leaves no room for the necessity of an outside

575
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:31.260
structure that could,
uh,

576
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.560
older the appetites of human beings that can comes to an end with a,

577
00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.710
uh,
a little bit of an auditorium,
autobiographical,
uh,

578
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:46.720
portrait or autobiographical picture.
Um,
uh,

579
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:51.640
this is now the emperor who praises a counselor,

580
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:57.270
a counselor who has fallen into disgrace within this mall.

581
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:02.550
The same per shines to the light of Romeo Romeoville nerve.

582
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.840
It province,
our core tier who had the role of a exactly.
It will being the,

583
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:12.900
the counselor for the prince was great and noble work was ill,

584
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:16.480
rewarded by the province house.
We'll rotate against him.

585
00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.140
They don't have the laugh and indeed he takes a new road.

586
00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.010
Who makes of another and others we'll doing a wrong to himself.

587
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:28.280
Raymond Bellenger had four daughters,
each of them Mcqueen,
uh,

588
00:39:28.281 --> 00:39:33.281
Romeo man of low birth in the stranger did this for him and when crafty tongues

589
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:40.090
moved him to call to account this just men who rendered him seven and five for

590
00:39:40.091 --> 00:39:44.710
10,
Romeo left,
the poor left.
They're poor and old.

591
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.650
And if the world knew the hothead,

592
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.610
begging this bread by morsels matches,
it traces him,

593
00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.770
it would praise him more.
It is an oblique,
uh,

594
00:39:55.870 --> 00:40:00.870
representation of Dante himself who has to end up begging and poverty for a more

595
00:40:03.101 --> 00:40:07.390
so as he says,
out of the,
uh,
the,
the,

596
00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:12.020
the selfishness of the political powers.
But the,

597
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.870
the other final question,

598
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:18.070
I think it's underlies this whole whole candle that has to be raised is what is

599
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:22.810
the relationship between dialectics and this representation of history?

600
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:28.390
Why should Dante connect the two wine,
the heaven of logic,
let's say?

601
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.060
Does he have to talk about history?
Um,

602
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.410
and I think that the idea is that the history itself,
um,

603
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.040
I think that he's,

604
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:44.490
this is an encomium that ends up being not quite an unmitigated encomium.

605
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:47.710
Uh,
it's also a critique of the empire.

606
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.710
That there is a reason within the empire.

607
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:55.770
And yet this reason doesn't quite justify all that the empire has perpetrated in

608
00:40:56.591 --> 00:40:59.980
history.
And I think from this perspective,
Dante's also

609
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.570
forcing on us some perplexities about the nature of logic as an instrument of

610
00:41:07.811 --> 00:41:12.811
power is one that could justify or possible powers.

611
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:17.080
So they say also a critique of a of dialectics.

612
00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.660
As much as that is a critique of uh,

613
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:24.820
of history and we skip hold together cause I think it's a little bit more

614
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:30.180
evidence and you can,
if you read on your own,
uh,

615
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.920
you can see Canto eight and nine.

616
00:41:32.921 --> 00:41:37.220
They have rhetoric and I'm a rhetoric and love.

617
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:39.620
They're very nine especially very clear.

618
00:41:39.621 --> 00:41:43.940
We move instead to the heaven of the sun,
which is a little bit 10,
11 and 12.

619
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.570
Uh,
I don't know that I'd be able to finish all of Canto 10,

620
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.600
but I want to start the discussion here.
We are in the heaven of the sun,

621
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.250
which is the,

622
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.640
the heaven of they're having a very thematic numbers and he had done,

623
00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:03.491
he goes on talking about one model of the trinity that I will describe to you in

624
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:09.410
a moment.
Uh,
Dantin counters the wise spirits,

625
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:13.580
the spirits of a,
in fact,
we are going to see very soon,

626
00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:19.220
there are two wheels of saints to Garland's representatives,

627
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:24.311
two gallons of old men who hold themselves by the hand dancing around around the

628
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:29.900
sun.
It is the dance of wisdom.
If it was at this,
that the,
the,

629
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:30.921
you could call it,

630
00:42:30.921 --> 00:42:35.900
you could also refer to it as a kind of a reorganization of the encyclopedia.

631
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:39.320
You may remember that I used this metaphor at the beginning of the cloud over

632
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:43.380
the course.
Uh,
this idea that the divine comedy is,

633
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:47.300
tries to repurposing a new circle of knowledge,

634
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.950
the way in which things can really be known.
And,
and,
and the encyclopedia means,

635
00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:56.910
uh,
uh,
the journey education is in a circle as you,

636
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.310
the mind moves around through the various arts and sciences.
That's,
that's,

637
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:02.420
that's how you learn.

638
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.440
That's you return to which you already knew from a different viewpoint.

639
00:43:06.441 --> 00:43:10.940
And you see things,
uh,
things are new and it's a,
but it's the heaven of this.

640
00:43:10.941 --> 00:43:15.440
And let me just go on a little bit with,
um,
with the cantor and then we'll,

641
00:43:15.441 --> 00:43:19.990
we'll try to bring out some of the,
the issues of,
uh,

642
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.570
uh,

643
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:25.400
Canto 10 looking on his son with the love,

644
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
which the one and the other eternally breathe forth at primal in the ineffable

645
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:36.800
power made with such holder.
All that revolves in mind.
Oh,

646
00:43:36.801 --> 00:43:41.030
space that he contemplates.
It cannot be a taste of him.

647
00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:47.240
He beans with a trinitarian representation.
The father,
the son,

648
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.900
joined together by the breadth of love the street.

649
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:54.620
That was the idea of,
of the trinity,
which is a unity.

650
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.110
That's the paradox of arithmetic,
of this theological arithmetic,

651
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.760
uh,
is an image of fecundity.
Uh,

652
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:07.190
God is being an image of love is generative of itself,

653
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:11.990
uh,
within his own,
uh,
unity.
And then Dante turns to us,

654
00:44:11.991 --> 00:44:16.640
and that's the last time I believe that he turns to us readers and he tells us

655
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.970
to be stargazers.
That's all.

656
00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:23.000
So he's saying lifted that ice with me.

657
00:44:23.001 --> 00:44:25.460
Then reader to the lofty wheels,

658
00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:29.630
directing them on that part where the one motion strikes the other.

659
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:34.620
And for a poet to take their pleasure in the arts or the master who's also loves

660
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:37.080
it in his heart,
that his eyes never leaves it.

661
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:42.330
See how from there the circle branches will bleakly that beat bears the planets

662
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.420
to satisfy the world which calls for them.
He,

663
00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:50.310
that makes her eyes to an intersection of the ecliptic,

664
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.160
the equate the cosmic equator and the ecliptic.

665
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:57.090
We ecliptic being a term that describes the journal,

666
00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.280
an annual movement of the sun.
So when they meet the pope,

667
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:05.580
that crossing,
uh,
that that directs our eyes there.

668
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:07.500
If they attract,
we're not a slant,

669
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:12.640
etc. Stay now reader on the bench thinking over this or which there has the

670
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:16.230
foretaste and national have much delight before they are weary,

671
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.640
have set before thee,

672
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.820
not feed herself for the theme of which I make describes Ben to itself or my

673
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:24.084
care.

674
00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:29.240
Why does Dantes thing over the trinity and the in the Heaven of the Sun?

675
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.990
This is the simple question that we should ask.

676
00:45:33.991 --> 00:45:36.960
I have a passage that I want to read to you.

677
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:40.650
It's taken from was I think this is the,

678
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.660
it's taken from the,

679
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:47.080
the sooner that you're nice is you may have heard of from Dante,

680
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:51.540
we'll mention it's a misses,
a mystic.
Um,
um,

681
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.440
uh,
the,
uh,
and he writes in the,
in the,

682
00:45:55.470 --> 00:46:00.080
on the divine names he writes about how the mystical hierarchy,
uh,
and,

683
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:05.200
and this will explain to you a little bit of the what is Dante's

684
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.240
at this point,

685
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:14.120
send me mystical theologists having a mystical idea of the trinity.

686
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.880
Um,
this idea that knowledge has to be love.

687
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:24.800
He begins with an idea of the trinity bound by love and that knowledge has to be

688
00:46:24.801 --> 00:46:28.990
loved.
Let me read this passage and the,
maybe we can go from there.
It's,

689
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.010
I call it a solar theology.
Uh,

690
00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:38.150
uh,
that is to say,
Eh,
the theology of the sun.

691
00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.280
I feel not about the sandbox.
Solar,

692
00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.810
the theologists would be understood as the life of the sun itself.

693
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:47.800
As You sun,
let me read this passage.

694
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.590
Think this is from a six,
nine,

695
00:46:51.591 --> 00:46:56.591
three beyond the divine names and following thing of how it is with the sun.

696
00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.510
It exercises no rational process,

697
00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.990
no act of choice and yet,

698
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.740
but the very fact of its existence,

699
00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.500
it gives light to whatever is able to partake of it,

700
00:47:14.501 --> 00:47:18.680
slide in its own way.
So it is with a good,

701
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.850
a classical comparison.

702
00:47:21.851 --> 00:47:25.570
They of course are the sun with a good in the Republic of protagonists in the

703
00:47:25.571 --> 00:47:26.830
Indian needs and so on.

704
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:32.520
So this was a good existing far above the sun and archetype,

705
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:35.230
far superior to its doe image.

706
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:40.500
It sends the race of his undivided goodness to everything with the capacity such

707
00:47:42.761 --> 00:47:47.200
as this may be to receive it such beings,

708
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.010
oh,

709
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:53.010
the presence and that unequipped and that diminished lives to this race.

710
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:59.190
They abide in the goodness of God and draw from it the foundation of what they

711
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:04.060
are.
They're coherence there,
vigilance,
their home,

712
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:08.980
they're longing for the good,
makes them what they are and confers on them.

713
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:13.390
They will be shaped by what they yearn for.

714
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:18.310
They exemplified goodness,
and this is the law of God requires of them.

715
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:23.311
They share with us below them the good gifts which have come their way.

716
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:29.380
Uh,
I call it a solar is theology in the sense of dump.
He is the,
I think,

717
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.910
thinking of a theology as sub.
Oh God.
The Trinity,

718
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:39.460
it giving as a fountain,
not the Aristotelian or,

719
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:40.383
um,

720
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:45.350
they'll mistake or Augustinian idea of causality.
You know,

721
00:48:45.351 --> 00:48:50.351
we think of God as the one who imparts it calls or emotion to things or a

722
00:48:51.951 --> 00:48:55.940
beginning.
And then you have a teleology you have effect.

723
00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.930
The idea of the trinity here is one of,
uh,

724
00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:04.150
an inexhaustible source that keeps giving and it gives tool and we're all part

725
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:09.500
of this gift.
This is the idea.

726
00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:13.170
I think that Dante is getting this,
what I call the solar,

727
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:16.630
a theology from a mystical text.

728
00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.240
We'll call the sooner the United States.
Again,
not that he is a mistake,

729
00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.860
but he lead appears as one who is,
uh,
uh,

730
00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:29.680
behind the rationalist facade of his thinking is aware of the depth,

731
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:34.790
uh,
and other ways of thinking,
which are,
which are not those of the rational,

732
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.890
rational route.
Um,
and let me just,
uh,
uh,
go from,
uh,

733
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:44.690
describe even more here.
What,
what happens with,
uh,
with this can't or 10,
um,

734
00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.230
uh,
now,
uh,

735
00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:52.700
Dante goes on seeing this too.
Um,

736
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:57.390
uh,
this tool or this tool,
garlands of,
uh,

737
00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.440
scenes.
Uh,
and,
uh,
this is,
uh,

738
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:05.450
uh,
let me read 'em.
Um,

739
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:11.180
he meets Aquinas and let me read from this passage where he,

740
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:11.480
uh,

741
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.480
Aquinas will go on giving a naming the first encyclopedic this movement of

742
00:50:19.701 --> 00:50:23.660
sages,
uh,
lines 100 and following where he says,

743
00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.120
I was of the limbs of the holy flock,

744
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:31.010
that Dominic on the path where there's good fattening if they do not stray,

745
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.881
he,

746
00:50:31.881 --> 00:50:36.881
that his next beside me on the right was my brother and master Albert of Cologne

747
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:42.410
and I'm Thomas Aquinas.
If there was,
we'd us informed of all the rest,

748
00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.400
fall off to my words with denies going round the blessed wreath.

749
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.760
The next frame comes from the smile of Grecian who served Canon Law and civil

750
00:50:52.941 --> 00:50:57.020
law,
the one and the other courts so well that gives pleasure in paradise.

751
00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:00.410
The other who next the dorms have choir was Peter,

752
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:04.790
who like the poor widow offered his treasure to the holy,

753
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.580
the holy church.
Then the fifth light,

754
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:13.360
which is the most beautiful among us breeds from such a love that all the world

755
00:51:13.551 --> 00:51:18.551
below hungers for news of it within it is the lofty mind too,

756
00:51:20.271 --> 00:51:24.080
which was given wisdom so deep.
The truth be true.

757
00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.980
They never rose a second of such a vision.

758
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:33.730
It's Solomon described through circumlocution of the fifth light and the fifth

759
00:51:35.121 --> 00:51:37.340
flight because in numerical symbolism,

760
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.490
five stands for their natural number,

761
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:45.500
which is to say that Dante casts very difficult proposition.

762
00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.880
Solomon is being naturally perfect,

763
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.210
having a kind of perfection of intellect.

764
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:58.250
It's a dangerous proposition.
In fact,
Dante,
we'll go home.

765
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:00.950
Aquinas will go on and kind of 14 says,
look,

766
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:05.210
let me just explain what I said before because it's not quite true because they

767
00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.040
say the,

768
00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:11.040
the virtual intellectual verge of Solomon consists in the fact that he knew what

769
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:14.300
to ask for when we had to govern his people.

770
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.320
He was the perfect king does.
He knew what to ask.

771
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.140
You understand why this has to be a dangerous idea.

772
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:25.700
If you believe that there is a perfection of the intellect in within the
natural,

773
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.610
imminent sphere,
older where we live,

774
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:31.250
then it means that there is no need for revelation.

775
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.320
There is no need for intermediaries,
no need for redemption.
If the,

776
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:37.520
if,
if nature,

777
00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:42.290
the natural intellect is capable of ascending as it is claimed here for Solomon,

778
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.550
then the whole apparatus would collapse.
Dante will not believe it.

779
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:51.470
And Aquinas will go back as a dramatically actually in canto 13.
St.
Let me just,

780
00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:55.790
uh,
explain myself.
Besides,
it is the light of the candle,

781
00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:00.710
which below in the flesh was farthest,
uh,
et cetera.
Uh,
this is,

782
00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:01.544
uh,
in this,
uh,

783
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:06.410
Augustan and then skip the body from which he was driven less below in chilled

784
00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.890
outro.
This is brief use.
Uh,

785
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:12.680
he came from martyrdom and exile to his peace.

786
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:17.770
See flaming beyond the growing breadth of Isidore bead Richard of some victor

787
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:23.180
who in contemplation was more than mainline one 32.

788
00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:26.790
Then read this line because I think it's a little bit more interesting in the

789
00:53:26.791 --> 00:53:30.660
Italian than it is in English.
In contemplation.
It was more than men.
Uh,

790
00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.840
Ysidora Veda,
it did Ricardo,

791
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.440
I consider our full puke of euro.

792
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:42.560
The word done pay users is not contemplation is consideration and it's a key

793
00:53:43.031 --> 00:53:48.031
word for vantage was consideration means the etymologies that of moving with the

794
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:49.434
stars.

795
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:54.060
This is if the mind they said it's the most perfect when it imitates the

796
00:53:54.061 --> 00:53:58.800
circulation and circularity of the stars.
Consider uh,

797
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.850
it's also like desire by the way.
Um,

798
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:07.230
this one from whom they look returns to me is the light of his spirit to him in

799
00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.140
his grave thought that seemed slow in coming.

800
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:15.320
It is the eternal light to CGIAR who lecturing the street of Straw demonstrated

801
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.171
in videos.

802
00:54:16.171 --> 00:54:21.171
Choose the last one that Aquinas points out in this and this,

803
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.320
this circulation of wise spirit is one of so called headache by the name of

804
00:54:28.951 --> 00:54:32.610
seizure of broadband who was an a virus.

805
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:37.820
It was condemned for his various whatever knowledge and whatever canonized

806
00:54:38.871 --> 00:54:41.050
knowledge we may have for Dante.

807
00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:46.060
It includes figures who had been judged and worthy of knowledge or heretical or

808
00:54:47.221 --> 00:54:49.680
wrong,
and now they are retrieved.

809
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:53.130
So the idea of knowledge is one that keeps changing.

810
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:57.720
The idea of the canner of knowledge keeps always expanding and it including

811
00:54:57.721 --> 00:54:59.790
voices that had been rejected.

812
00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:03.720
Let me tell you more about this representation of seizure of broadband.

813
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.950
You understand his anniversaries and we do know how to Stantec.

814
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:09.990
What about other than just saying he's here,

815
00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:13.710
how does he go about justifying his salvation?

816
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:19.130
A cantor 10 from this point of view is retrospectively one that sheds light on

817
00:55:21.991 --> 00:55:23.070
Canto television fare.

818
00:55:23.071 --> 00:55:27.940
No where we also saw you remember the verus and the epicureans.
Uh,

819
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:32.940
we though Cavalcanti those who believe that the mind,
uh,

820
00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:37.800
uh,
that love of knowledge never interact with each other,

821
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:41.760
that the,
the,
that their mind,
uh,
uh,
goes,

822
00:55:41.761 --> 00:55:46.650
the rationalities is darkened in them,
but inclusions or the passions,

823
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:47.513
right.
You remember.

824
00:55:47.700 --> 00:55:51.960
And that their mind is one that receives ideas from the outside.
All that,

825
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.000
that notion of,
uh,
of,
uh,

826
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:58.320
both the inertia of the wheel and the divisions within the mind itself.

827
00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:02.310
Nantha now is,
is,
is correcting some of those views.

828
00:56:02.311 --> 00:56:04.680
So let's look a little bit at this metaphors in Canto 10.

829
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:09.950
This one from whom they look returns to me is that I to a spirit to whom in his

830
00:56:10.591 --> 00:56:15.390
grave,
Stoltz death seemed low,
slow in coming.

831
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:20.370
He was killed by the way,
by a madman.
And Dante writes a song.

832
00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:24.790
It's about him in,
um,
um,
I'm 12,
uh,
uh,

833
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:28.300
81 or so.
It is the turn,
the light of seizure.

834
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:32.920
So we know that he's saved who lecturing in the street of stroke.

835
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.470
They demonstrated invidious true.
Don't pick,

836
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.430
give the address of this man.

837
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:44.060
He lectured a word that,
uh,
has,

838
00:56:44.061 --> 00:56:49.061
has a certain value in the university language that use the lexicon of the time.

839
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:54.610
Lecturing is an activity that implies glossing just his,

840
00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:57.220
the glow Seta of Aristo too.

841
00:56:57.221 --> 00:57:00.820
But he's tells us where he lived in the shoe,
in the,
in the,

842
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:05.650
in the street of Straw in Paris,
a strict at now is cold,

843
00:57:05.651 --> 00:57:09.610
by the way,
the,
the holder.
Wow.
But it's now called the who?
Dante.

844
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:14.200
Knowing the clearly the Persians are mindful of this passage.
Uh,

845
00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:18.610
[inaudible] is placing seizure on the road,

846
00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:23.410
on the way he's giving us his,
uh,
his,
his,
uh,

847
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:24.460
his address.

848
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.900
But he's telling us that he's thinking takes place while he's on the road.

849
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:30.693
You all know,

850
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:36.210
you all know that philosophy is always understanding itself as a journey and

851
00:57:37.661 --> 00:57:41.010
method and exodus,
right?
Uh,

852
00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:46.120
per amenities or Aquinas who thinks about the five ways to reach the ultimate

853
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:53.290
truths about God.
Here for Dante is a philosopher,

854
00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:58.050
is on the way to a theological certainty,

855
00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:00.040
theological truths and theological knowledge.

856
00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:03.790
And he demonstrated in videos,
truths.

857
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:08.791
The Italian is see low GI Joe made syllogisms out of or,

858
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:15.430
or exp demonstrate the rational.
He demonstrated in values,

859
00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:19.260
truths.
What are this invidious truths in videos?
Truth,

860
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:21.040
I'm not sure that,
uh,

861
00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:26.230
all the translators would agree in truths have to be understood.

862
00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:31.000
The gemological and this is the canter where Isidore of Seville is presently.

863
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:32.163
The,
the,

864
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:36.460
is the Roseville being the arch etymologist of the Middle Ages.

865
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.810
And Dante is showing how to,
we can play with a tomato trees.
You know,

866
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.890
he said all severe is the one who believed that the whole of knowledge that Oh,

867
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:48.340
we're all,
we know,
the higher the,
the,
uh,

868
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:53.430
the commpass of all knowledge can really be arrived at through Etymology,

869
00:58:53.691 --> 00:58:58.120
arising language,
language,
the atem on of language.

870
00:58:58.121 --> 00:59:02.320
The origin of words will give us an access to the nature of reality.

871
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.680
So language becomes a way of knowing the world.

872
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:08.140
Dantin Dodgers in the same activity,

873
00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:13.290
calling the truths that CGIAR pursued invidious which etymologically means those

874
00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:17.710
things,
those truths that cannot be demonstrated,

875
00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.440
those truths that can not be seen.

876
00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:25.840
Philosophy appears as a nod of speculation that takes us on the way to a truth

877
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.370
that it cannot fight,
have access tool.

878
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:35.000
What are these drills that seizure or broadband salt access to,

879
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:39.470
um,
the,
the immortality of the soul.

880
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:43.820
There's no way he would have known or even discovered that I just daughter is

881
00:59:43.821 --> 00:59:48.740
very doubtful about the individual immortality of the soul in the treatise on

882
00:59:48.741 --> 00:59:52.890
the soul.
He tied to consider,
to view a,
to,

883
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:56.540
to decide about the origin of the world.

884
00:59:56.541 --> 01:00:00.170
Cgiar believed that the universities,
uh,
uh,

885
01:00:00.171 --> 01:00:04.850
another one of those and the most trouble believes that the university is

886
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.290
eternal,
right?

887
01:00:06.291 --> 01:00:11.291
And this is an argument that so medieval thinkers and theologians engaged them,

888
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:16.040
either Rosen,
the one side and Aquinas who maintains a philosophically,

889
01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:20.720
you really can believe in show that the universe is really,
uh,
is eternal.

890
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.460
But out of faith you can go on believing in creation.

891
01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.050
Creational things have a beginning because it's dumb.

892
01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:28.790
You don't think that things have a beginning,

893
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:32.720
then there's never a possibility of,
of,
of uh,
uh,

894
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:37.730
allowing for giving some ground and,
and,
and rooting the idea of your freedom,

895
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:41.690
your innovations,
that possibilities,
things can be different from you,

896
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:44.030
from what they were before.
And so on.

897
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:49.390
The reason why Dante rescues seizure of broadband is a way for him though

898
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:54.730
ultimately of thinking and making this thing that whatever we believe that is

899
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:56.930
knowledge.
It's never definite.

900
01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.200
And it's whole is we are literally on the way and rethinking it and making it

901
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.160
all the time.
Uh,
an object of our own self critique.

902
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.600
This is not the only thing.

903
01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:13.170
The only place where a dentist rethinking himself very soon,
uh,

904
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:17.600
at around the notion of the Trinity Bonaventure we have to change his mind about

905
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:21.890
a main,
a figure that I have mentioned before,
joke him more flora in the next,

906
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:26.530
canto the idea with the jaw acoustic interpretation of history.
So he will,

907
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:30.680
he will,
we are going to have a kind to 11 balancing off,
uh,

908
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:34.200
Canto Canto 10.
And then it ends the cantons.

909
01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.580
They're like a clock or an extraordinary image.

910
01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.470
It's an image of time now.

911
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:43.380
But what I have to say is that you probably do not know that [inaudible]

912
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.360
mechanical clouds the way we still see them.
Where the,
the,

913
01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:52.420
a recent technological invention in the late 13th century,

914
01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:55.560
which Dante is absorbing here,
uh,

915
01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:59.930
then like a clock that calls us at the hour when the bride of God rises to sing

916
01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:04.950
Matins to the bride room that he may lover when one part draws or drives another

917
01:02:05.481 --> 01:02:08.960
sounding the chime with notes.
So sweet that they were loaded.

918
01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:13.520
Spirit swells with love.
So I saw,
uh,

919
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.540
the glorious,
uh,

920
01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:20.010
we'll move and render voice to voice with Harmon in sweetness that cannot be

921
01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:24.870
known.
But there were a joy becomes,
uh,
uh,
it turned out,

922
01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:26.100
uh,

923
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:31.160
Dante is describing this songs of the eternal,
uh,

924
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.840
of the,
the,
the blessed souls in erotic,
in the robotic,
uh,

925
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:37.440
erotic terms.

926
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:42.650
So that what seems to be a can't have pure knowledge ultimately becomes a love

927
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:45.720
song to,
and this is the,
um,

928
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:48.870
the whole trajectory of Canto 10.

929
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:54.080
Let me stop here and see if there are some questions about this three,

930
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.750
three candles,
which I'll be glad to,

931
01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:00.480
to answer that a little bit abstract,

932
01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:04.830
but I think that they respond to genuine,
uh,
uh,

933
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.560
general interesting historical problems.
At least

934
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:37.870
the question of allegory of at the beginning.

935
01:03:37.871 --> 01:03:42.871
And just give you a kind of a quick cruise you may have about what we said we

936
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.800
can't afford.
You have two issues.

937
01:03:44.801 --> 01:03:48.490
So you have the issue of allegory and the issue of the will,

938
01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:51.870
um,
where Dante goes on,
uh,

939
01:03:52.210 --> 01:03:57.210
explaining the mode of representation in paradise as a mode of accommodation to

940
01:03:58.811 --> 01:04:00.160
our limited faculty.

941
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:05.490
And he thinks that this is really the mode of representation throughout the

942
01:04:06.161 --> 01:04:10.740
Bible,
the iconography of the church,
that poem,
uh,

943
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:11.863
et Cetera,

944
01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:17.340
which is a way therefore of talking about allegory in it's slightly different

945
01:04:17.381 --> 01:04:22.110
form from where from the the,
the way he spoke of it in a,

946
01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.860
as you remember when I spoke of it,

947
01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:28.590
but he was a forced allowing us to do that in Canto nine of inferno.

948
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:29.460
What did we,

949
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.950
we had been talking about the allegory of poets are liberal theologians now

950
01:04:32.951 --> 01:04:37.600
there is no question that I think that there is really is there is no intrinsic

951
01:04:37.601 --> 01:04:39.610
difference between the two modes.

952
01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.920
You remember that I used to talk about the undergird of theologians as being an

953
01:04:42.921 --> 01:04:46.870
allegory where the literal level is true and the allegory of poets as one in

954
01:04:46.871 --> 01:04:48.880
which the literal level is a fiction.

955
01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.650
Now I'm saying that both of them for Dante have a kind of metaphorical basis.

956
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:55.050
Okay.
Both the,

957
01:04:55.051 --> 01:04:59.950
the and the relationship between the metaphor and the truth is pets of course

958
01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:00.400
it's,

959
01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.050
it's sorta certainly the language of a very similitude if not absolutely the

960
01:05:05.051 --> 01:05:09.310
truth.
And then the two,
the other issue about,
uh,
uh,

961
01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:12.360
the will,
the limitations of the will,
um,

962
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:17.670
the conditional and absolute well when we can't come to Ken to six paradise,

963
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:22.270
Dante shifts gear all together and talks about history.
Uh,

964
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:27.300
and,
uh,
the,
uh,
the framework of the empire trying to do,

965
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.430
is it providential,
I call it what is the nationality of the empire?

966
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.410
But the accurate,
the real issue is,
is there such a thing as a,

967
01:05:33.411 --> 01:05:38.411
probably then charity of the empire are which she had maintained in elsewhere in

968
01:05:39.221 --> 01:05:42.970
the poem.
And certainly in the,
in the text of Monarchia,
uh,

969
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.790
Dante come crudes now seems to,
to have to explore,

970
01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.950
give an apology for his belief in the empire,
uh,

971
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:55.540
by agreeing with and,
and siding with Virgil.
But at the same time,

972
01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.860
giving a critique of the empire that acknowledging Augustan but managers to

973
01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.240
criticize both,

974
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:06.190
both Augustan and up for different reasons and virtual had not seen the whole

975
01:06:06.191 --> 01:06:08.890
truth.
Uh,
virtual,
uh,

976
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.920
can go on into an unabashed Lao that CEO laudatory statements about the empire

977
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:17.340
are Gastin can go on damning the empire,
but a gas,

978
01:06:17.341 --> 01:06:22.341
it does not understand that if a and w within the context of the civil war,

979
01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.240
uh,
where,
where,
you know,

980
01:06:25.241 --> 01:06:30.241
the realities were Corso can turn against his sister because where the world can

981
01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:34.870
go against the good balance,
where your own brother can be your enemy.
That's,

982
01:06:34.871 --> 01:06:39.430
that's really what it's about.
Uh,
then you do need some kind of law.

983
01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.340
You read an outside world,
uh,

984
01:06:42.341 --> 01:06:47.160
and outside institution that can guarantee and protect,
uh,
the,

985
01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:50.550
the,
uh,
yourself,
the claim,
uh,

986
01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:54.660
that salvation is only then the interiority of the soul are,

987
01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:59.650
which is a Gaston's claim is not really sufficient for someone who is him as

988
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:04.090
Dante was involved in the public sphere and the public life.
Uh,

989
01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.760
I think that these are the two most important moments in Canton.
10.

990
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:12.960
Dante is moving beyond the,
the,
it's,
it's,
it's,

991
01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:17.720
it's a poetic break now takes place.
He literally moves us beyond the,

992
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:22.180
the sunlight,
the daylight of the ordinary,
natural daylight.

993
01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.730
We moving into a world now,
which is his own,

994
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:29.680
and Dante starts raising the issue of,
uh,
uh,

995
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:30.543
knowledge

996
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.310
as if to say that a new knowledge and new way of thinking now is necessary.

997
01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:40.740
Once you move beyond the ordinary boundaries of,
uh,

998
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.350
of the universe,
you gotta you,
you start asking yourself,

999
01:07:44.351 --> 01:07:47.140
what kind of knowledge do I need here?

1000
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.680
And he's rethinking therefore the,
the,

1001
01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.970
the whole relationship between truth or knowledge and narrower heresies and

1002
01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:56.740
knowledge,
uh,

1003
01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.800
the canonical certainties that Aquinas would have who now make significantly

1004
01:08:03.161 --> 01:08:03.421
enough,

1005
01:08:03.421 --> 01:08:08.421
I mistake about the faith of solid on and a and seizure of broadband.

1006
01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:13.720
So that,
that seems to be the,
the argument that is running,
uh,
in this,

1007
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.990
uh,

1008
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:18.990
this cantors he is forcing on us a different way of thinking and a different way

1009
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:24.980
of thinking begins with a redefinition of nothing less than the trinity.
Uh,

1010
01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:29.300
no.
The idea of causality note the idea of efficiency.

1011
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:33.950
No cows.
They Fiekens.
That's the way God is defined by Aquinas.

1012
01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:39.260
That's the way that Augusta Guston defines how is he lights a treatise on the

1013
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:43.010
trinity.
Uh,
with the idea of God is called Saturday,

1014
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.480
Dante ads doesn't exclude the others.

1015
01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:50.580
It would be inconceivable that something has imponderable is the trailer.

1016
01:08:50.581 --> 01:08:54.620
They could just have one formula to account for it.

1017
01:08:54.650 --> 01:08:59.650
But he adds on to it that first definition of the trinity as a unity of love and

1018
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:06.710
the unity of fecundity,
which I think is a mystical definition,

1019
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.800
the idea of God,
the idea of creation is wonderful.

1020
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:15.200
Participation of the creatures,
the idea of God as being the source,

1021
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:18.030
the inexhaustible source of light.
Oh,

1022
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:22.580
and not just efficiency and not just a TV,
all of the movement,

1023
01:09:22.581 --> 01:09:26.600
et Cetera.
And we shall see the implications of this if we go.
Yes.

1024
01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:32.020
<v 2>I was just wondering why is it such a problem for Dante to imagine like a</v>

1025
01:09:33.171 --> 01:09:38.171
perfect natural intellect and Solomon because isn't sort of auditory started the

1026
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:44.060
perfection of the wealth through Virgil's into in Bridgeville reason.

1027
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.640
And so why,

1028
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:51.790
why is it a dangerous proposition to say that a man could have perfect

1029
01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.173
intellect,

1030
01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.680
<v 0>right.
The question,</v>

1031
01:09:55.770 --> 01:10:00.770
very good question is why does Dante find it so difficult to acknowledge the

1032
01:10:01.891 --> 01:10:05.180
perfection of Solomon's intellect?
Uh,

1033
01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:09.830
when after all in him fed and improve authority,
we have had,
um,

1034
01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:12.450
some accounts or how they will,

1035
01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.020
is moved by the intellect and perfected by the intellect.

1036
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:20.850
Am I paraphrasing your batch of repeating?
But you said,
I think,

1037
01:10:20.851 --> 01:10:25.620
but accurately.
Um,
it's a very good question.
It's a little complicated problem.

1038
01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:30.650
And,
and uh,
in fact that I think that what you have,
uh,
um,

1039
01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:34.650
you,
you have to keep in mind how Dante talks about Solomon.

1040
01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:37.750
They said people on Earth,
I saw anxious was here.

1041
01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:42.830
This was one of the most incredibly debated a pro is he saved his Solomon saved

1042
01:10:43.351 --> 01:10:47.940
versus the wisest it all.
That's what the Bible tells us.
He's the wisest.

1043
01:10:48.330 --> 01:10:51.930
And we believe that by the Middle Ages argument,
we believe the Bible.

1044
01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.570
So he's the wisest,

1045
01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:00.030
but he was also known as being the most lecturers of kings.

1046
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:05.450
Tall,
big solution for Dante.
Ah,
forget about that.
He's,

1047
01:11:05.451 --> 01:11:09.540
he's really,
uh,
uh,
the wises so he's saved.

1048
01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:13.200
So that solves that particular issue of the relationship,

1049
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.850
love and knowledge.

1050
01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:19.680
And I think that's a crucial point in for the way you are stating the issue

1051
01:11:19.681 --> 01:11:24.630
because you're stating how in and improve that or you have the will directed and

1052
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:27.420
reorganized,
but the intellect,
uh,

1053
01:11:27.450 --> 01:11:31.470
so you see there must be some kind of relationship between will and intellect.

1054
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.610
Dante,
he says they will was really,
uh,
was,

1055
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:40.490
was a little bit,
was chaotic,
was dissolved as well.

1056
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.060
So we have only to judge him in terms of this majestic intellectual he has.

1057
01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:45.421
In fact,

1058
01:11:45.421 --> 01:11:50.421
he was the most perfect of figures since Adam was created in the garden,

1059
01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:54.480
you know?
Okay.
So that's,
that's the first thing.

1060
01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:57.720
But now let me come to the crux of the matter here.

1061
01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:03.260
If you believe that he had a intellect,

1062
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.140
which was absolutely perfect,
perfectly intellect,

1063
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.450
then what you really say,

1064
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.540
and this is the context of knowledge and my thesis is the Greeks call it,

1065
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.940
okay,
the,
my thesis,
the word mathematics.

1066
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:21.090
And if you believe that,

1067
01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.480
then you're really saying that loss of is the way to come to the truth.

1068
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.640
You see what I'm saying?
And the philosophies that were to come to the truth,

1069
01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:34.820
you don't really need theology.

1070
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.860
You really have to start thinking of theology as some kind of vulgar,

1071
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:44.520
vulgar,
philosophize earners and some kind of,
uh,

1072
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:49.430
the poetry for,
for the Masters for instance,
you know,
kind of,
uh,

1073
01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:54.220
uh,
a material elite like view that keeps,

1074
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:58.650
uh,
uh,
are creeping up into,
in,
in,
in,

1075
01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:03.060
in the ways of thinking about theology and,
uh,
and,
and,

1076
01:13:03.061 --> 01:13:07.020
and philosophy.
And if you believe that that philosophy is the mode,
in fact,

1077
01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:11.700
now we have a correction of the philosophers immediately after with the presence

1078
01:13:11.701 --> 01:13:13.650
of seizure.
Because of course,
she,

1079
01:13:13.651 --> 01:13:18.651
the ambivalence CGIAR is justified and saved because his mind was a searching

1080
01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:23.550
mind.
He's on the road,
he's a true philosopher.
He,

1081
01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:26.160
it's the method I was describing.

1082
01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:31.140
Logic is a method that the Greek word that means way,
uh,
it's the,

1083
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:34.230
the root,
uh,
you know,
the philosophies around the rule,

1084
01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:38.460
the processes on the way around there,
all the say they all this sea of the soul,

1085
01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:42.750
that's really,
we call it Dante says,
exodus taste is a,

1086
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:47.751
an exodus clearly countering the idea of the philosophical root.

1087
01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:50.340
There's another,
another story.

1088
01:13:50.341 --> 01:13:54.120
Another way of looking at journeys has certainly evolved in a journey,

1089
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.350
a journey of the heart and the journey of the mind at the same time.
So once you,

1090
01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:03.390
you,
you go on a seizure is on the,
so,
but there is,
there was no perfection.

1091
01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.600
He tried to demonstrate and look at the paradox in reduce this to say truths

1092
01:14:09.841 --> 01:14:11.770
that cannot be seen.

1093
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.990
I appealed to the etymology of invidious many translations and uh,
uh,

1094
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:19.560
they say I'm welcomed fruits,
you know,

1095
01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:22.720
I don't know what kind of translations actually I like my saint Clair who says

1096
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.470
invidious truths,
but many others translate that word in videos as,

1097
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:28.700
as unwelcome or the,

1098
01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:33.340
the truths that made him a bis scorn and hated by others.

1099
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:36.550
Because you know,
the,
the jealousy of philosophers,
uh,

1100
01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:39.510
it's a little bit in the background.
He lost his life.
Uh,

1101
01:14:39.730 --> 01:14:41.890
he was killed because of that.
Uh,

1102
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:47.310
but instead he is in input shoot of truths,

1103
01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.140
which is,
you know,

1104
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:54.250
the aim of philosophy of are all investigations,

1105
01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:59.580
but philosophical investigations but cannot be demonstrated that cannot be seen.

1106
01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:06.810
So there is a limitation of the philosophical road of the road of philosophy and

1107
01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:12.571
indirectly the limitation of Solomon's perfect claim of,

1108
01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:17.680
he never claimed it,
but the,
the,
that he had a perfect intellect and in fact,

1109
01:15:17.681 --> 01:15:21.400
our,
who realizes what he has said,
he says,
no,
no,
no.
The,
the,

1110
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:26.580
the Wa the wisdom of Solomon has to be viewed in his prudence for asking God

1111
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:31.920
that he'd been given the absolute,
uh,

1112
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:35.560
knowledge in the government of his people.

1113
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.730
So it's a limited form of knowledge,
but that was perfect.
You see,
it's,

1114
01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.290
maybe it strikes you as sophistry.
Um,
but I enjoy that.

1115
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:47.350
Okay.
All right.
Thank you so much.
