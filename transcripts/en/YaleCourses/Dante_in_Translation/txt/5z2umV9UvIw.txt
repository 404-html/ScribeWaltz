Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Last time, um, I finished, uh, we finished, we're not on a little note as you recall, that, uh, the detail of the garden where the pilgrims finds himself and meet the, the other, we have a poet and he declares in a way that seems to be really prideful, uh, on his place in this trajectory, this literary, uh, poetic tradition. And, um, I was emphasizing God's timing. This is a detailed that opens, uh, for us, uh, opens her eyes to the ambiguity of gardens, the ambiguity as Dante world go on, dramatizing this idea of this ambiguity of gardens throughout, uh, purgatorio specialty and then at a other areas in, in, in, in, in oblique ways, not necessarily monotonously a bucolic language. Uh, this idea of the, the ambiguity of gardens. What are some of these abuses and can't have for, uh, we are drawn naturally to gardens.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       Uh, and we are drawn to gardens because they reflect for us, uh, some he verge of, of the, especially if you're traveling through hell, then you do want this sort of, uh, you, you explore, you enter willfully this place that bears the finger prints of the human hand. Uh, it's something which had been elaborated by human beings. This is a divine place and unless gardens mean that for us, but at the same time they, they give us a sense of security and in its enclosure also sense of our lordship over them. You know, it's something we can control. It's something that we see and uh, and, and, and where we feel we belong. This is exactly the temptation that the pilgrim experiences in Canto for. He relaxes. And this happens to all heroes in epic to the epic tradition. When they enter gardens, they even, uh, set aside their arms.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       They get these armed in more ways than one. That is to say they come to understand that they are, this is a place of shelter, a place which is so peaceful and idyllic. That one is no longer or need not feel that one is in danger. In effect. That's where the danger is most powerful. Dante experiences a danger, the danger he experiences that have a poetic Hubris. He is descending into humility. That's the trajectory of his journey. And there he rests with Houma, Virgil, Lucan, et cetera. And he just says he feels that he belongs, that his hi genius allows him to be right there with them. I remind you of this little detail exactly what say that it allows me to say more precisely, uh, what, what the problems are the representation of gardens, but especially to emphasize that can't have five and the drama that is unfolded in Canto Five, a drama ostensibly of desire.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       It's a story of, uh, the great passion of a woman. One of the most famous women in literature, uh, uh, Francesca, uh, has with her in brother-in-law bowel. But the point is that that drama stems directly from the crisis in the pilgrims mind. In Canto four of inferno. In what way? It is as if the experience of Hubris about the celebrating one's home power and prowess is a port now his to confront the consequences of that claim. Now Dante comes literally face to face with a reader of his poetry and the reader reads poetry who understands his poetry in a way that that was not necessarily the one intended by its author. We have now in Canto five the confrontation of reader and port and we just did for Francesca is of course, as you remember from your reading, just having, having, having read Canto five is a great reader of texts.

Speaker 1:          00:04:24       She goes home port in glance a lot, not, not in the version of critiquing the Torah, but it's, it's, it's a parallel version. Uh, the assistance, the same bromance. Uh, she goes home quoting from the art of courtly love, this text about the art of love by, and there's Capilano's a, you may remember, I, I alluded to at least in one of the earlier talks and goes on actually quoting to Dante, Dante's own toy him in the Vietnam war that we should go and root cat in a, in a while. So, uh, let's start with Canto five. Where are we in the port? What, what, where are we located? We are in the second circle. This your notes will tell you will in the larger area of so called incontinence. And I really should emphasize to you something about that. We should look at it the more it more detail further on, but something about the topography, the moral topography of hair.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       What is the disposition? So what is the distribution of sins and sinfulness? What is actually a sin? But what, what are we to understand for sale for the time being? I'll tell you that for Dante, it's the will, which is the locals of sin. You cannot really seen intellectually, you cannot have commit since with your mind. You can have your mind which partakes and becomes an accomplice of the wheel, but it's primarily in the will in the, the, the, the voluntary action that you find. Uh, you find sinfulness. That's the first thing. But what are we now in the area of incontinence? Uh, what does that mean? Well, one thing, a way of making it very simple, you probably should know that the, um, that the, the shape, the diagram of the soul for Dante is Mary classical, very ancient. It's really, uh, Aristotelian, it's the idea of, it's more or less figured as a triangle.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       Uh, uh, which with on the left side you have, because it's always the left, the wheel, the area of the wheel. And then on the right side you have the area of reason. Okay. Where the tool, faculties of the soul, there are two factors, like two feet of the body. Uh, the two faculties of the soul, uh, where they lead. It's in the middle ages using a classical term, the call sin. They're assessed as to say, yeah, this is the other of free will in order to have free will. You have a conjunction of both will a reason. And that's the beginning of the moral life. It's not the end of it at all. It's really when, not only when you're really free, we will is free. Then you can start making decisions, are getting engaged in the world around you. Now the soul is divided into three parts, is a tripartite structure, and begins at the bottom.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       It's so cold. I should put it on the side. Will the [inaudible] percent appetite, which is really what Francesca experiences, you know, the, the, the, uh, in continents, uh, lost in this form later we'll be gluttony, et cetera. Uh, average is per the gallery in the middle area. Here you would have the sensitive appetite, which is really the middle ground of Dante's hell, uh, violence, uh, uh, the kind of beastiality, uh, that takes over the, the, the human mind. And then the third is the rational. Okay? So, uh, the older, the geometry of hair, uh, in a way, his pattern on the older of the soul, the idea of this all in, of course, in an inverted, inverted form, we begin within the area of concupiscence, the area of lust. Someone was asking me what it was last, last drive. I think that we're going to have, uh, some kind of understanding a partner.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       So this is where we are in the aid of incontinence. The first one is it's lost over, Dante would call in with a formula. It's the area of the sinners who have inverted the, the older, the hierarchical order of the reason and the will, they have made pleasure, uh, the, they have invested pressure with Supreme Lordship over the older of rationality. So, uh, recently somehow them, or it's going to be used as a rationale to explain as a kind of way of, uh, creating alibis for the passion of, uh, of, of Francesca. So this is, uh, this is the way the Canto begins. Um, the, uh, the second thing that I, I have to mention as we read here is, um, the particular, uh, landscape that Dante evokes. It's a landscape of souls go around, swirling around in, in a kind and sort of a circular, circular structure.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       And let me tell you a little detail here that you have to be careful as you read the poem, even about the directions of the pilgrim. Uh, for instance, if I were to ask you, which is Dante descending into a spiral of hair, uh, and then we'll move into a spiral. It's very difficult if you're really going left or right, of course, but he's, he goes out of the way to say that he's always going left word leftward because it's descending and as soon as we get to purgatorial, he goes out of their way to tell us that he's now going right word, which is to say that hell is the inverted cosmo. So purgatorial. So it's really, he's always going the same way. Only that is, it goes into hell. It's going down and his, his inverted, when he has to go from health to Purgatorio, the operation is going to be that of turning upside down in order to go finally in the straight way, the right way.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       Uh, the other detail is that the, the, the symbolism of the circle, which is, you know, is very ancient, very old. There are a number of ways of understanding direction in, uh, in the Middle Ages. For instance, the linear direction implies that of human beings who are caught in time and they are going to some kind of purpose of precise destination. The angels are those who circled around the throne of God, so that the circle implies the plenitude and perfection of movement. Clearly Francesca is involved, uh, who is called in in a world of love and the passion of love. She's giving a kind of parotic version, a caricature of a, of the circular perfect movements of the mind. Uh, and, and of the angels around the, around the, uh, the, the, the, the divinity, uh, the spiral, which is the movement of the pilgrim combines line.

Speaker 1:          00:11:11       And circle implies that Dante is really, the mind is going in a circular way around the divinity, but he's also has, has a purpose as an Ame, uh, to reach. So here the two, uh, uh, Francesco and Paolo are going around in circles circles that we'll have and their work experience. No rest. I think that the, the principle behind this representation of a desire as displacement is idea is always a potter's presence. Something that valorizes greatly. That's the ambiguity of Dante's thinking. Uh, uh, desire is displacement. So in this case, powdered Francesca, they get nowhere. And yet it's exactly this displacement that makes us aware that we are never, what do we should be, that our hearts at all is out of place. It's what our Gustin says in the confession that the, he begins the confessions with the awareness stuff. His heart, he says, uh, is, is, uh, I'm quiet.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       You know, that the idea of the quietness of the heart out of place. So that's what he's enacting, not this moving within the larger, um, pattern of Guston's thinking about, uh, about desire. Uh, and there'll be a lot of talk about, say, you know what the word desire by the way, which is it English as the same as, as it's an Italian or, or in Latin, you know what it means. It's, it's, it's, it's linked to the stars, you know, to, to have desire is to know that you are not, uh, quite, uh, uh, see that, uh, at the end they see that, uh, you know, we are so two very movable removed from the, the, the, the world of, uh, of stars. Uh, uh, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's a word that is linked, usually is consideration. In other words, that implies that the mind moves alongside, you know, who you consider when I consider her.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       My light spent when you consider is, is a way of moving with a along the mind managers to move with the circularity imperfection on the side. All of this is irrelevant to the point that it's at hand here. Uh, [inaudible] meets a, so we are in the world of begins is, uh, this, this candle with a number of, um, a number of, uh, metaphors of, of birds. You, you realize that first of all, he starts at online's 30 about the hellish storm. It's, no, it's, it's, it's the externalizing of, of, uh, the storm inside the, the in the storm never resting, seizes and drives the spirits before. It's my thing, a world in them about et cetera. It continues. Uh, and this in the cold season, the wings bear, uh, the starlings along the broadens flock. So does the blast, the blast, that wicked spirits hitter data downward upward.

Speaker 1:          00:13:58       It drives them no hope if a conference and not to say of rest, but have less pain. And then the cranes and Dante asks, uh, Virgil Master, who are these people that black hair, so scorchers and now have an enumeration and other, uh, application of the epic epic, an epic device, enumerating the epic, uh, that, that, that has, it's always driven by the desire for totality to include all things within the commpass of its representation. Always says, uh, this enumerative style. And now here we have a number of figures that Dante points are that the virtual points out and then all queens at the beginning, queens of founders of cities. Keep this in mind. It was a thing, a part of the issues that Dante is raising. And you can think about it, we can talk about it if you wish, is the relationship with an airbrush and politics are pleasure and the city.

Speaker 1:          00:15:04       Where does, where does pleasure, what is the place of pleasure in the economy of the city? Man. W W W W let's see who they are. One is the empress of people of many tongues who so corrupted by licentious vice that she made lust lawful in hello to take away the scanned on who she was brought and the, and the, and the, and the emphasis of the lioness. This lust becoming lawful last, becoming a public and, and, and, and, and accepted. And she's Semiramis of Syria, uh, whom within the success niners. Uh, uh, then, uh, the next one is dido. Who is, uh, uh, both Virgil invention in many ways. We're, we're Virgil in the AENEID. This is a reflection on the hernia. There's a poem of love to, you know, the, the uh, can unknown, but think about the, the place of, uh, how Rome Rome's conquest, uh, could appear to be libido of power, Libido Dominandi and yet, and he's really playing with the idea that the, uh, uh, Rome of Roma as you know, is the, what we call the have to use this term.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       It was, I can't think of an English term, uh, boost referred on. You know, what it needs that boost profit on, right? It was proffered on, it's an easy, it's the Greek term meaning a reversal, a Roma, right as in a mirror becomes arm or you know, it's Venus is the mother of an years. So there is this idea again of a link in the link between love or a love and, and politics in the city. And Virgil writes there near the, literally as a love poem, Mr Say, the ideology of Rome is an ideology or based on, on of Rome is an ideology based on desire. The which Augustan will counter by saying, yeah, this is not really love. This is lust for power. And the distinction that someone was raising here, uh, the gentleman was raising last time about how his lost related to love. You already start seeing the antagonism between the two of them are Gustin I Roman, uh, an African, but a Roman Roman thinker, uh, is really writing about and belongs and reflect on the great myths and the mythology of Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:17:46       And to him this is true in the, but it's especially true in the city of God where he just does juxtaposes the earthly state, they roam to the heavenly city, the heavenly Jerusalem, the two cities are opposed to each other. They're, he reflects or Rome as a city based on lust for power. And from that point of view, really not different from any other empires that are all Rome or like car, say the Persian empire, the Greek claims for empire and whatnot are all part where long Cifo of, uh, of uh, violence and uh, uh, imperial imperial fantasies. So Dante is, is, is thinking along along these lines and we shall see where that will take him in a moment. Then that is Cleopatra's Egypt. Allan and the story of the four of uh, of, of Troy. And then finally, the story of Tristan, who as you know, belongs, is really a medieval medieval inventure Tristan and these old we are going to see now Lancelotta Guinevere in a moment.

Speaker 1:          00:18:54       So, uh, the presence of Tristan shows one thing that all the heroes and heroines of antiquity are viewed through the lenses of medieval romances. They may belong to the grand epics of classes, the classical world. Dante will see them through that. Optics of a romance is the literature of Desire. And she showed me more than a thousand shades named them as he pointed. This is the, the, the, the, the catalog of the epic catalog. Welcome, love parted from our life. When I heard my teacher named the Knights and ladies of old times, pity came upon me and that was as one big wilderness. Now, this is really the first time that Dante introduces the notion of pity in the poem and we shall see by the end of the, of the cancer that is going to be overwhelmed by Peter and he's going to faint after he hears the story of Francesca.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       You're so overwhelmed that he fell. He says like a dead body falls. It's a feigned tickets. It's, it's, it's sympathy. Maybe it's a little bit of a self recognition. Maybe it's, we shall see that it's a way of coming to grips with his own responsibilities. Maybe, maybe some of his responsibilities. But the point I want to make there with this pity is that you do know that he does not know the RPA. The poetics of our store too, or he knows whatever is available are through Horace. And he knows it's quite a lot. Uh, the, the, the point here is that Dante goes over, reflects, they commit a paper topic for some of you enterprising spirit. Some of you may be on the relationship between pity and justice. How throughout the poem he goes on thinking about this two terms is that's justice necessarily. Need pity or is there some kind of justice that must learn how to be ptls that has no place for, for this kind of compassion or the two necessarily antagonistic or is there some way of, of, of thinking of, of uh, of a meeting, a meeting point between them?

Speaker 1:          00:21:10       This is the first time he introduces this, uh, this idea of pity kind of recognition. So to have a sense that it could be he who is in that, that, that position and he begins poet. I would feign speak with this tool that go together and seem so light upon the wind. So he doesn't talk to any of the major classical figures he chooses to people from his own time. Two people from the ordinary, uh, life around him to people in the dust. By this time, Dante may very well be living in that area of Italy, which is Ravenna, not quite Ravenna, but in that area or oven, the shall see when they are near us and that intrigued them. Then by the love that leads them. And they will come as soon as the wind band or weirded sold, come and speak to us and speak with us.

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       If one four bids it not, you realize that the name of God is never mentioned here in hell. If not, uh, as a, as a discourse that takes place here on earth. But the souls in hell, we'll all use, always use paraphrased stick constructions. Turns of phrases as if it would be, it would be highly improper or for Dante to allow them or driven for them to acknowledge that which they never really acknowledged. Now if it's one, four bids, it not, and then as dove someone but desire are come with wings. Pose the motion for the sweetness born by the wheel through the air. So this lift, the trooper dido is again the presence of Dido, uh, that, that the Virgilian, the Virgilian myth of Dido. Um, and also the other possibility of Rome, uh, virtual is writing about the, the great battle between Carthage and Rome is two ways of choosing the civilization to ways of, of deciding how one should organize.

Speaker 1:          00:23:07       One I should want to experiment with, uh, with, with cities. Uh, um, so coming to us through the malignant hair, such force, uh, had my loving core, uh, and now listen to how Francesca speech or living creature, gracious and friendly, who goes through the murky air visiting us, who stay in the world with blood. She's killed. She was killed by the way, but her husband who caught Francesca and his brother Paolo in a trust. So it's, so that's what the illusion to the blood is. If the king of the universe where our friend would pray to for the piece, since the has pity over evil plight of work, which are pleased to hear and speak here and speak with you, what the wind is quiet and here it is, and how she begins the description of her life when she was born. Most of the narratives in, in, in, in fentanyl begin with this idea of birth, your soul, that in the case of Virgil and you see her once again here in the case of, uh, of, uh, in the case of Francesca and the begin with birth, uh, for a number of reasons, but because birth is for Dante, the, that event that somehow could potentially have changed and they've imparted the different direction to the world.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       All could. And, uh, and nothing is in the case of Francesca insights, very a great piece of literature, but she of herself, uh, did not worry, achieve, achieve much. And now she talks about her city in terms of clear the contrast with this movement of the souls caught in the storm. There they go endlessly, uh, in the air. And now she evokes the place of what she really wants is, is, is, is rest. The city where I was born lies emerge of a stability of a city she has lost where the pole with the streams are jointed, descend to rest. And now three tercets in Italian, all beginning with the word love, love made into kind of transcendent divinity. It is the great subject of, uh, of her experience. Look at this love, um, love which quick is quickly kindled. And the gentle heart sees this man for the fair form that was taken from me and the manner afflicts Mr. Love, which absorbs no one beloved from loving sees me so strongly with this charm.

Speaker 1:          00:25:38       This RCS does not leave me yet. Love brought us to one death when she saying, well, a number of things and that will have to give this to you. First of all, she's really quoting, uh, important literature. The first line, uh, love which, uh, uh, uh, it's translational is love, uh, which absorbs known love, which is quickly kindled in the gentle heart. And you know that this is really a quotation from one of Dante's Sonnets, the Vita Nuova that you read, Chapter 20. Love, that's her Dante starts. And the gracious heart are a single thing is Dante quotes the poetics of the sweet new salaries when need, certainly he says, tells us in his poem, one can more be without the other one can no more be without the other then one that then can the reasoning mind without its reasons et cetera. So, uh, it's, it's clearly meant for Francesca to flatter the sense of authorship of the poet himself.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       It's part of a seductive strategy also that she could use the second image that about love that uh, does not allow anyone who loves from returning reciprocating the love. It really comes from the so called rules of love that Meridian Shampine dictates in book three of the art of courtly love. And I want to read this. Uh, it's, the translation is not quite all that accurate, but I think, uh, I'm sorry I get the wrong one. The wrong book. The Art of culture. He loved the book three and these are the famous, it ends with the rules of love. I will, I will, I'll explain what they are. And rule nine says it, I can really read some of them to use so they have an understanding of what real love is it this is the mind of which applies very well to Francesca. Francesca imagines herself is really a quarterly, uh, love heroin.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       She lives in the world of a king. God is the king of the universe, is in the court of the King of love. May Be, and these are some of the, the, the concerns of the, the, the rules of love and they are difficult to love marriages. No real excuse for not loving. It's a way of saying adultery is the law. Of course we love. He who is not jealous. Number two cannot love. No one can be bound by a double love and then they come home. Boys do not love until they arrive at the age of maturity. It leaves that very unclear what the age of maturity can be. Seven, when one lover dies and we'd hold of two years is required of the survivor. Number eight, no one should be deprived of love with at the very best of reasons. Number nine, no one can love a less one is impelled by somebody else's love, which is exactly the line that Francesca mentions.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       Number nine, why this rules of love and what are they and what is she saying where Andre has first of all this oil by having this rules of love and having a reducing love to or not, it's a way of acknowledging that love is the most transgressive disruptive of all experiences and therefore it needs to be formalized. It needs to be contained, made, may be part of a game, isn't perhaps is the thrust of undress Capilano's thinking or made to be part of an acceptable ceremony, which is the other possible reading of what is happening. Francesca false s completely, uh, squarely within this tradition of believing that she lived in a world of love where there is no other possible resistance in effect, these three persons with which, which I read to you about love La, I love, they're really meant to cast love as a transcendent force that no one can really, uh, she at least cannot withstand.

Speaker 1:          00:29:41       What she's doing is advocating the power of her will tool, the irresistible, omnipotent, uh, presence of this love. It's part of a strategy, none of acknowledging and the responsibility, it's part of its strategy to instead find for herself an alibi. I was made to do that. The literature of yours and the literature of Andrea [inaudible] work filters of love. You understand what I mean? How in romances you always have filters of love. No one is going to take the responsibility. It's like, well, uh, you know, the, uh, I had too much to drink or I read a great poem or whatever. And so I was doing that. It's a way for Dante to show the, the blindness of Francesca to the reality of her situation and this where she is a kind of willingness to give up that which is really the quality of sin and the trait of sin.

Speaker 1:          00:30:41       Habit. Sin Is sin and the measuring, which it has become a habit, a way of, a way of clinging to it and not acknowledging that there may be some kind of alternative or something different, uh, to it. So Dante goes on now enter entertaining the arguments when answer to be an alas, how many sweet thoughts, great desire brought them to the wolf house. And then Francesca that torments, make me weep for grief and pity. Pat Tell in the time we switched time, how and what occasion did love grandchild to know you're uncertain desires. And she answered, there is no greater pain than to recall the hippie time and misery and this strategic a teacher knows. But if that has so great desire to know our loves first route, which is a way of almost even that metaphor of the root of love, the origin of love, she calls it the root of love, as if the passion, her passion with the flower of, of love.

Speaker 1:          00:31:46       Uh, I shall tell as well as one way that we've in talent. We read one day for the past time of Lancelot have constrained him where alone and had no misgivings many times that reading through our eyes together and change the color in our faces. But one point alone, it was that mastered us when we read for the long for smile was kissed by so great a lover. He who never shall be parted from me or trembling, kiss my mouth a gully Aalto was a book and he that wrote it that day. We read in it no farther while the one spirit said this, the other Paolo whose name means little Latin as you know, palace small web. So that for PT, as soon as if in death and joked dropped like a dead body, and that's the end of the camp where we could say it's, it's uh, it's an amazing a story undoubtedly would, we will talk about a number of things.

Speaker 1:          00:32:44       The first thing he is, uh, uh, that this is a scene represented through, um, uh, reading the story of reading. Yeah. You're aware of that, right? This is clearly, uh, she reads the reads, it says that we're one day they were reading for delight. That's probably part of, um, the, the, the concerns that Dante has. How should we read? If we read for Delight, they read for delight. Uh, is there some other way of reading? Uh, it's delight. Clearly it's, it's, it's the constitutive elements of reading literary texts. But is there something else that we could do along the way? What is her problem really that's continued with this idea of reading. She's reading the story of Lancelot Lancelot and Guinevere. You do know the stories, especially if you could re it's not, it's not the story of creating the club or you could easily go on.

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       Uh, if you want to write about creating the Trois Lancelot and camp of five, you can, Dante does refer to the stories of critique that floor often in his theoretical works, uh, the story of a landfill, the story of adulterated court Lancelot is the secret lover of the Queen, clearly out of the desire. And that says something about the nature of desire to really supplant the king. Arthur. They said, triangle. Here it stay a triangle of desire. Uh, and, and, and Francesca imitates his triangle. I will talk to about it in a moment. Lancelin story of Lance Hill to the story of, uh, uh, let me go a little bit a bit into that. It's the story of like all the stories of, and they try, they begin on the great feasts of Christianity. It's, I think it's usually the ascension, uh, Easter Pentecost, one of the great feasts, and the heroes are sitting around boasting about themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:34:44       No one of them, uh, is doing anything heroic, but they will talk about how great they were. It's a little bit like the periodic version that you have of the battle of the argument between Ulysses and a, and Ajax in the last is the last book of the metamorphosis where they talk about who is the, the, the, the, the hero worthy of inheriting the arms of the Great Achilles. And they talk about not the present prowess now, but what they were in the story of, in criterion. Uh, clearly the idea is that the heroic age is over and done with, and the whole romance goes on exploring, pondering about that, which the reasons why the heroic age may have come to an end. And what it is, is that, uh, the secret love affair between Lancelot and Guinevere, the stories, thoughts, it goes on, what are, they are sitting around drinking and talking.

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       A mysterious figure comes from the outside and kidnaps the queen. Then the knights who were sitting around don't move and everybody's expecting Lancelot to get up and go and rescue the queen. But he won't out of fear that if you were to impetuous, it would be this, the, the secret affair that he has with the Queen would probably be be discovered. That hesitation, that moral hesitation of Lancelot is really the cause of it is it's the emblem of the falling from any store cratic virtues that is now the intrusion of it at time. A temporal wedge between the thought and the action. And then of course lance would have to go and their famous cart of shame exposed to the ridicule of the whole town before he can go on really trying to rescue, uh, the, the, the queen. So this is that. If you think about it, then the PTN is already reflecting on the crisis of the city.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       In terms of the private passions. Something is really knowing at the heart. Is it the end? It's really the question of desire, the inability to distinguish between the public and the private Nina ability to separate somehow the two or find some sort of a harm threading the, the, the, the line between those two concerns. He can five. This is really what Francesca does. Dante's exploring reading. So she is reading the texts of Lancelot and lapses into an imitative strategy of reading. She wants to be like the heroin that she reads about. She refuses to take an interpretive distance from whatever specular emerge. She wants to feel like a queen. And she thinks that Paolo can be like Lancelot. And this is exactly what, what we call the mimetic quality. It's not my term, it's the term of uh, uh, uh, [inaudible] who has written about this question of the imitative structure of desire between us and the object of desire.

Speaker 1:          00:37:46       There is always the presence of a mediator. And this time. In this case, the mediator is Lancelot for, uh, for Paolo entities Guinevere for Francesca. But there's is more to this story. For instance, you can not read this story without thinking about how don t frames the experience of Francesca with the language of time. Can you see how many references there are two time, uh, there is no greater grieve that remembering happiness, the past happiness. And this your doctor meaning meaning, uh, Virgil knows very well. And then she starts talking about her adventure. We were reading one day. You remember that day we read no further. It's soul about time. About the question of time as if an experience. So what is the problem with this idea of time? Why is Francesca understood? Why is has story represented in terms of time? In effect, I think Francesca want, there's one great passion though she has and her passion is to do away with time.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       She's expressing the desire, the happiness that lasts year. Very briefly. Brief instance may really last an eternity, or maybe, or maybe just maybe she makes pressing the wish that, or the idea, the insight more than the wish that one moment of happiness is well worth an eternity of pain. Or maybe she's just saying that it's not too bad. That the love story I had only lasted the briefest possible time. At any rate or all this shows is that primarily Francesca nor only up dedicated choice and not only thought that her own wheel was powerless, visa vi the resistible force of this transcendent idea of love, but above all, she's betrayed. The less, the older of necessity end time that her passion violates the order of time.

Speaker 1:          00:39:59       And the Bravo from this point of view, Dante goes all reflecting about his responsibilities of an author as an author, uh, when he's confronted with the reader, what have I done? What have I written? That what I write has been understood in a way that is not necessarily the one that he meant. Uh, the meaning that he meant to assign to the Vita Nuova. So these are some of the concerns and we can find some others. Let me just pass on to Canto six, which is really not a completely unlike what we have been describing here. Now we go into Kent Dante goals. That's another part of this other strategy. Whatever Dante's found out about passion, about desire, about this in the world of appetites are and whatever he has decided about himself and the meaning of this may have for him as a port in that scene of fainting at the end who will go on.

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       This will become the premise for other concerns raised in Canto six, which is, you know, is a political candidate. But this is the strategy of Dante. Let me see. I found out certain things about me, my responsibility. I found some things about the, the disruptive quality of a desire visa vi the political order. Now let me find out. Let me see. Uh, if, if, uh, let me find out how our authentic this finding may be. Let me move into a public room. So we go from the world of the court, the private world of Francesca now to literally the world of the city, the world of Florence, where we are still talking about incontinence in a different form. The question of Gluttony, gluttony and uh, politics and let's see. So he takes elements that he has already anticipated here in Canto five, the political and goes on thinking about politics in, in Canto, in Canto six.

Speaker 1:          00:42:08       Ah, here we go. Then with Canto six, the third circle, uh, the gluttonous with the return of my mind, with the return of my mind, that was shut off when the Pto state of the two kings fork, which was quite confounded me with grief, new torments and new soul's in torment. I see about me, whatever I move and turn and set my gaze. I find first of all, the, the presence of the word mind in Italian is maintain a Lineman, a very, very, very suggestive. We are dealing here now with bodies. Canto six is all about bodies. It's all about gluttonous souls where bodies who took care of the bodies. But Dante uses as a counterpoint the question of mind as if, uh, the scene of this body's the scene of this gluttonous has also been the scene of not thinking in terms of mind.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       Their mind is unnecessary counter and necessary compliment to the presence of bodies. They weren't mine of course, as you know, or an Italian in English where mentor in Italian is meant a lot. It meant really comes from the Latin for measure. Uh, the mind is that which measures things that nine is that which gives a sense of the measure of our, even our own, our own desires and the, and the, and the, and the metaphor of mind appears throughout Canto six. Uh, we are asked to think of that which is missing in this biological or reflection or reflection about the, what I called the biology of politics. Politics now reduced to the question of appetites of bodies. And it's not normally we have the pride of minds when we think about, you know, all the people who have whatever fantasies, whatever Megalomania is, whatever desires.

Speaker 1:          00:43:58       But mental above all where we talk about politics. But here it's, it's really a question of politics in terms of the inexhaustible appetites of bodies are. And so we are going to talk about politics and a and gluttony politics and borders. Dante here meets the figure that is presiding. The mythological figure that is presiding over cantos of this area of gluttony is a, um, the classical figure of the three headed, uh, servers at way of hinting about the, uh, the voraciousness Ah, uh, the many miles of this, uh, this, uh, monsters animal servers, a beast, fierce and hideous and so on. Um, and we do know that the landscape is stinking and that the, an endless rain, uh, there are hints that this is really, uh, uh, one of, uh, some kind of repulsive a form of a waste and food. Uh, it's at the rain makes him how like dogs and the Profane wretches, uh, uh, often turned themselves a one side making a shelter for the other.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       When servers, the Greek warm perceived us. He opened his mouth and showed us the fangs, not one of his limbs keeping steel in my leader and so on as the dog that Yelp to greed and becomes quiet when it bites. It's food being all absorbed and struggling to devour and such became this fall vintages of the demon servers. Uh, we passed up the shades that were beaten down by the heavy rain setting of feet on the emptiness, which seemed real bodies. Uh, this is, uh, the, the great description and figuration of Gluttony, uh, bodies that are always empty and the, the, the, uh, and the are empty now, punished to be empty as empty forms and that they seem they're not bodies. They seem real bodies that were all lying on the ground except one who set up as soon as he saw us passing before him or thou who are led through this hell.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       He said to me, recall if thou canst thou was begun before I was ended and other little reference to birth, the birth of Dante and the death of that is part of a cycle. No, there's no necessary connection between the two events. That death of a, uh, the name is Jack, come in and get pig. That's the way he was sort of named in the streets of Florence and a, the death and the birth of the pilgrim. I said to him, the anguish, the anguish style perhaps takes the, from my memory and when the word is mentor the mind, so I'll not seem ever to have seen the Tommy who you are put in a place of such misery and the such a penalty that fan is greater nannies, wholesome. And he said to me, thy city talking about Florence, this is the politics of the city.

Speaker 1:          00:46:58       They city and doesn't say, I city your city. So He's already, he chuck who views himself as outside of it, not really occupying a place within the city, which is so full of envy there already. The sac around solver helped me within it in the bright light when you citizens, once again a distance of chuck of from the the, the city of Florence called me Chaco for the damning full to gluttony is now ceased. I helpless in the rain and then my misery. I'm not alone for all these are under the same penalty for the same fold. And he said no more. Okay. Here I have to stop a little bit, uh, the, to tell you what, something that you already caught. Of course, what the basic metaphor, what the basic conceit is in this camp. And it's the conceit of the city and the body.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       You in classical the classical world, you are abused to the conceit between, of their core relationship between the soul and the city. Uh, but for Dante, this is a soulless city. The only way to talk about it is through this imagery. She's very ancient, very Roman actually. Uh, the story of, uh, uh, the city as a corporate, as a body, as a corporate structure, the image. Some of you readers of Shakespeare, you may remember your collaborators where Coriolanus makes the same speech about, uh, the city and the body. But it really goes back to a historian of the classical world that Dante absolutely loves. He's not the only one. Uh, all the way a Dustin is using their name is Livy, who wrote this famous book about from about the, from the foundation of Rome, Roman historian who tells the history of Roman. One of the stories he tells is that, uh, of, uh, uh, the famous civil war in Rome, the civil war between patricians and Plebeians, the Plebeians, the workers were so tired of what was happening in the city.

Speaker 1:          00:49:05       They were doing all the work. That's the way they complain. But they had few of the pleasures coming from living in the city that they decided to cc'd. It is a famous session whereby they go as a kind of schism. They go on the retreat on the Aventine hills, one of the seven hills of Rome and the patricians, the city's paralyzed. And you can imagine it's a strike the patrician send one of the enemy, sorry. And man by the name of miniatures to convince the Plebeians to return to the city and my name use managers to do this by telling the Plebeians if famous fable, which is called, it's still known as the stable of miniatures. What does he tell them? He said, look, this is really like a body. When you have a body, the hence work. Yeah. It seems that the mouth and joy is, and the savers, the great pleasures of foods and so on, it seems that the stomach, it can be full, but actually whatever they produce and take in and they ingest, they redistribute to the bodies, to the rest of the, about the hands, the feet, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       Because the city is like a body. That's the analogy between the corporate structure of the city, the idea that the city is a corporation and a, which by the way, we carry on the reminder of this, the how vital. This is what carried on a dime. I don't have a dime with me. Uh, but if you have a dime, you can read. Uh, a blue. The ooh means says one body out of many limbs, out of many members, still an image that we care. It's still a conceit that we have. Right? So the idea is, uh, that the city is like a body and the plebeians are convinced and they go back to, to back to order. And then recompose the order of the city. This is the fundamental structure here, but I said something else, which is really is going to, that's that believe in the corporate structure of the city.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       Uh, can it really hold together and, Aye. Aye. Aye. I go on submitting to you that he no longer believes in this. If you, when you read the Canto, uh, you will see that all the body parts are literally littering the city there are mentioned the, the, the nails, the hands, the heart, the, the, the beer, the hair, et Cetera, the mouth and sort of spread all over. And, and as if to to imply the impossibilities of constituting this body parts into an organic unified, uh, uh, totality. So, um, uh, there's another little issue here that is being raised and I want to talk about before the end of, uh, of the hour, the question of civil war and whatnot understands by civil war. It was Dante's political thought. The reality of his political thinking is always the civil war. I come to, let me just give you some textual evidence and then we'll go on.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       I answered him, chuck that distressed, so weighs on me that he beats me weep. But Tommy, if their cans, what the citizens of the divided city, this is not Florence shall come to and whether any is there is just, and tell me the cost of such discord sailing it if an amazing image discord because it's a musical metaphor. Our cord, this discord, but it comes from, it makes the heart, that's where the word comes from. This scored makes the heart, the place, the receptacle where all the MVR, all this jealousness that destroyed the city, uh, are, are placed, are located. And he said to me, after long strides there shall come to blood and the party of the rustic shall drive out the other with much offense. Then by force of one who is [inaudible], meaning the pope, that part is destined to fall. This is the world's Gibbons within which the city is divided to four within three years and the other to prevail long holding his head high and keeping the fat first and the grievers burdens for all the tears and shame to men are just, they're not heated.

Speaker 1:          00:53:22       Their pride, envy and Alvarez, these are the courses are the sparks. He calls them. These are the causes that have set this hearts on fire here. He made an end of his grievers, uh, uh, words and then Dante goes on, uh, uh, literally evoking a street scene in Florence. He goes on asking about some other characters with the city. I would still learn from the, and I begged the to grant me further speech Farinata he mentioned about whom we shall see next Thursday in Canto turn of and the guy your main of such worth Yacko boosty culture, Rigo Mosca and the rest whose minds will say, Tom will doing, tell me where they are and giving me knowledge of them for impressed with a great desire to know where they share in heaven, sweetness or the bitterness of hair. I would like to point out to you the presence of this, uh, of the language of gluttony throughout sweetness, bitterness, pleasantness, unpleasantness, uh, this really runs through the candles that Canto it gives it an end links together, gluttony and the politics.

Speaker 1:          00:54:37       It's the body can the body metaphor, but also these other experiences. But what is happening here is he asks as Dante ass about this other famous for it, his main of such worth, he says, what are they? They achieved so much, were so set on well doing in the city and the the English cannot quite render the ambiguity of the Italian and beautiful Italian is Ben Factory, which is really very difficult to translate those you don't know if it means doing well or doing good and that, that impossibilities of deciding what the sentence really means is exactly. Uh, what Dante is traumatizing here is dramatizing is the distance between human perspective humor, the judgments that we make as human beings and the divine judgment on their dealings and doings of these famous people that the discrepancy between them here on earth who may judge one way, then the real, the reality of the worth and value of this other people.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       Uh, that can be different. So we are are, we are talking about, he's talking about their mom. The black soul. Say they're further down in, in, in the fire and different faults weigh them down to the depth where extraordinary metaphor, that weight, weight, that burden of sin, but it's really an image that goes back the gravity. The question of gravity, this is we speak of civic gravity, but here it's a different kind of gravity. It's an idea of um, it's an old idea when you want to talk about the weight that we carry within us, the gravity we have within us that gravity is love. The way of deciding what's the way of understanding this line? There's a passage in the confessional from Augusta where Augustine says that he wants to exemplify what some people go up. Other people go down and he says, it's like the gravity of objects around us.

Speaker 1:          00:56:43       Stone. You drop a stone and the stone goes down out of its own gravity. I told specific weight and fire he says, goes up out of its own specific weight. We are carried. Whatever I love carries us. We are. Our love is our own gravity in the gravity and whether we go up or down, it depends according to the direction of our desires. Whether we just go back to this is uh, uh, it's to give you a sense of all the residences of this cancer, but at the heart of it all, that is the question of civil war two, wealth and gibberellins between patricians and Peruvians. Dentist is the whole of history. Roman history, whether he's going to read Virgil or we read Lucan or he will read the stages, they're all actually deals not with Roman history. This great, great epic [inaudible] reads is really reading Greek history, the story of we depose and the Tok Gleason Polynese.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       They view history at from the point of view of the civil war. Now. So let me just formulate the question of a part of the political understanding Dante has. For those of you who may have read a little bit of monarch here, for instance, which is this treatise about the, the desirable form of a Universal Confederation of states and the one emperor. That's the grand vision that Dante has in monarch. He thinks about that they need that unity of all states. I kind of the sort of, we could call it today, a confederation of States, very much patterns are all on, on the Roman, the Roman Empire, the idea of there, in fact, the Roman empire becomes the model for this kind of unification. Uh, so that's really what most of us think, that Dante's political vision is in effect. Dante sees history especially as, and it's kind of inevitable satanic form of civil war.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       So, so harsh can, is he going to be about the realities of the cities? You really wonder how can he go on elaborating a theory of a constructive theory of politics? You see what I'm saying? Once you are so harsh about the reality of politics, then you really wonder how that can one go around really thinking that politics can be in necessarily cause unnecessary. You can explain that it's somehow useful, that it's feasible. Uh, where does this idea, what is this is this understanding of Rome? Um, come to him. Dante is not really agree with Virgil and Dante is not agreed with Virgil's greatest critic who is Augustan in the city of God. For Virgil Rome is the providential empire, an empire that can really bring about unify the whole world are gusted rights against Virgil and says no because even Rome, as I just indicated to you and the learner, even Rome is part of the history of violence.

Speaker 1:          00:59:48       Dante comes along and puts together within the divine comedy that question of Rome and the needed empire and the question of the civil war, what do they have in common? What is that connects them. Dante's argument is the following you Virgil are right in believing in the unity of all mankind, stoic idea we all live in that costs more police in the city, which is the city of the world where we all find the place and you Augustan or right in claiming that the empire is all built and based on Libido and lust. You're right, you're both right and yet you are both wrong besides me. Cause you contradict each other and what Dante says Augustan if there is no empire, then we are living in a world of disorder and lawlessness. The empire becomes the necessary remedy to the evils of the civil war.

Speaker 1:          01:00:57       The civil war is the condition where my own brother, my own neighbor can be, can become my own enemy. Gaston does not acknowledge the realities of war to him. It's just empire and the empire is evil and will finish with the famous line. What do I care who governs me, provided that they don't make me sin. It's the famous Christian response to the idea of the evil, the historical evil of empires. Let me retreat into myself and find within myself some kind of of, uh, of uh, comfort and some kite of shelter and Dante will respond to him. No, that's not enough. Because once you think that you have retreated into yourself, then there is the reality of the civil war that we're reaching to you. What have been explaining to you that we stop? Uh, because I want to talk about something else before we go 10 to seven.

Speaker 1:          01:01:53       What I've been trying to explain to you is that that the movement from 10 to five to Canto six of inferno, it's a movement from the internal world of desires that seemed to be so private and so personal. Then I said, Dan has to go outside of himself to test to find out what the authenticity is of what he has found out in Canto five and 10, two, six, the political canter. We'll tell them that there is no such a comfort zone of one's home in a world that in the world is necessary necessarily part of the outside world and outside world will encroach upon. It, will end once own in the, in the world. Uh, the terms will this kind of movement between the inner and the outer, uh, really, uh, Virgil and the Guston virtual with the idea of the fence of the empire Augustan with his undermining of the notion of the necessity of the empire.

Speaker 1:          01:02:51       Dante, we'll go on a harmonizing the two visions. So he will endorse the idea of the empire and aware that that's the only possible best response to the tragedy of civil wars. Let me say just a few things about canto seven. Uh, the, the, and then I'll give you a chance to ask. Sometimes they'll should be two, three minutes for questions or came to seven. Um, uh, also is a candle that can be read symmetrically with the other Canto seven of the divine comedy purgatorial seven but Justice Canto six, I, I neglected to mention it but uh, Canto six of impairment is about the city and politics can two six approval story about the nation can two, six of paradise about the empire. So they're really connected in the same thing with Qantas ever. This is the only, can't wear that to the smoke. Individualize sinners.

Speaker 1:          01:03:46       He meets avaricious. There are issues and the protocols and there are sort of taken in a kind of, they have no, there's no individual figuration for them. It is as if this became a kind of an anonymous, therefore more collective kind of problem. Other issues and probiotics, which he represents in terms of the counter movement of Sealer and Caribbean. This. And here we have the great figuration of fortune. You remember, Eh, as I call her, the Vanna white of the time that the lady who is a wheel of fortune, uh, turning back blindfolded. And, and, and let me say something about, about this figuration as is Dante describes it as a, uh, uh, you know, what, what is it a, it's a great an idea that I, um, uh, what is it about the avaricious and the prodigals who could turn around? So a one against the other, uh, how can this be?

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       How can this be possible? Uh, uh, what is, why are we so attached to, to the things of the world? And then Dante goes on explaining a, on a canto seven lines eight and following, uh, he will say, ah, he ordained for he meaning God or then for worldly splendors a general ministered and guide who shouldn't do time change vein well from race to race and from one to another blood beyond the prevention of human, which, so that one race rules. And another language is accord the best sentence. Ah, she foresees judges and maintains a kingdom as the other heavily powers do theirs. How changes have no respite necessity makes a swift so fast. Men come to take the turn, et cetera are, this is he who is so reviled, meaning fortune by the very main that should give her praise, laying on her wrong who blame and ill repute.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       But she's blessed. It does not hear it happy with the other primal creatures. She turns us fear. Every Joyce's in her, bless. It's fortunate that wheel, but it's a figuration that in many ways it needs some, uh, some explaining. How can Nantais believe in goddess for tuna? How can he go on talking about this Pagan Deity, which is a roamer deity lady luck or how is he doing this? How can that, do you see how, how he, he lives in a world of a providential reality, whether it's an ink well, uh, and he does say that fortunate is an intelligence of God. So they are not, the Dosha is blindfolded. That is also kind of, uh, um, there are some criteria. There is an intelligence, there is a will and the meditation behind it. What it means is that a, what is up with inevitably turned down to go down.

Speaker 1:          01:06:40       This is an endless rotation or fortune and certain way when you are down, uh, you only the only it's the head, best time to be at because you don't have to, you can only go up. We are always though on these precarious repost on this, uh, on the curve. We are never quite a stable in our own achievements. How can that relate this a try id or fortune to the providential scheme, uh, that he, he uh, he regulates and shapes his own vision. And what I would have to tell you is that the, uh, the two things, the first thing is that there's UC canter's haven't begins with an illusion to the great war in heaven. The angels, the primal struggle that that disrupted the order of the cosmos. In other words, fortune is for him the divinity that rules over the world, the sub lunar, a world of generation and corruption.

Speaker 1:          01:07:41       This to say she is a minister within the, the, the world of the fall for steak. Uh, so there there's still a foreign world and that's how perception of all the changes that take place. And the other thing is that Dante is intimating that the only way to conquer fortune is to really give up a, it says kind of mystical idea. Uh, Mr [inaudible] has a spiritual idea, give up the attachment to the things of this world. So let's stop here, uh, with uh, with a brief summary of Canto seven items. See if there are questions about some of the, a weighty issues that I raised in Canto five and six. And there isn't much more that we can say, but let me see if you want to cost ask questions and maybe I can clarify things that were left in the background. Please.

Speaker 2:          01:08:36       I'm going to cancel five. The narrative of Francesco Palo. What is the significance that Francesca is doing all the talking?

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       What is the question is very good question. What is the significance of Francesca is doing all the talking and uh, and not Paolo. I guess I take the, the, the significance is that this is to me is that this is a canto or where Dante understands some of the elements that he had put forth in the Vita Nuova. You remember where we discuss the Viton Nuova and there I indicated that the great poem, women who have intellect of love, where the, uh, he discovers that they are the interlocutors about love, not only the interlocutors about love there also those are the privileges interlocutors because they know how to combine because they understand the unnecessary interdependence of intellect and love. They are not two separate entities. They are not two separate, uh, aspects. And therefore, uh, now he has Francesca as a woman who can become indeed his own interlocutor.

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       That's one aspect. The other one is that medieval romances had made this extraordinary discovery and I think is the most revolutionary change that has taken place in the, in the consciousness of, in the, in the imagination of the, in the Western world, in modern times. That is to say before it became a sociological issue, before it becomes a philosophical problem, the dignity and worth of the woman was already retrieved and vindicated by romances. It's there, but the woman becomes either the figure in charge or the partner or friend of a, of the man. Does that answer your question by the way? The answer was yes. That could not be picked up by the the video. Ah,

Speaker 2:          01:10:43       other questions?

Speaker 1:          01:10:56       I'm okay. Thank you. We'll see you next time with Kantar nine 10 and 11 I guess.
