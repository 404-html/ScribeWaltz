Speaker 1:          00:00:01       With Ken told 12, from 10 to 12, who can to 16. We are still in what is known the middle ground, which is a moral ground. The middle ground of, uh, uh, in hell. Uh, we are between the area of incontinence that we saw, uh, in the last few weeks and the area of malice when this middle ground, which is the ground of violence or beastiality as it, uh, as it is also called a, what I want to draw your attention to first of all is the fact that Dante is a presiding symbols. The presiding figures in this area, uh, all figures hybrid figures, figures of Doubleness, uh, the minor tor and the centaurs and Canto 12. You have the Harpies, uh, you know, this filthy file figures, monsters with the face of, uh, of, of, uh, women, uh, devouring, uh, all the foliage in the trees, the trees, cantor 13, uh, and then, uh, uh, Chris, we'll go on with, uh, uh, other emblems of again, monsters and the figure of, uh, uh, but that's the figure of fraud.

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       I don't want to get into that. Figures of also again, monitors and centers in, uh, 15. What is the, what is the importance of this figures in, they are, they are neoplatonic images, figures of centaurs minor tours, uh, understood to signify the doubleness of human beings, the capacity of human beings to join within themselves, both the human and the beast, steel or animal, the animal, uh, experiences, possibilities of being, uh, in neoplatonic thinking, especially in the 12th century says to give her a historical ring to what we are saying that 12th century, the so called shark fins and more so in the 15th century Florence with Pico, uh, the figures, the, the, the whole idea is that human beings are, uh, really kind of copular or neutral entities capable of, we have the potential of this doubleness within them. They're capable of becoming fully rational or descending into beastiality.

Speaker 1:          00:02:49       And their position in the ladder of being is one of, uh, Arthur indeterminacy in the 12th century. This is not the case. They still believe in this. Images are fixed, images of Ed pities creatures capable of being at the same time expressing this dual impulses are the beast deal and the human impulse. This is Dante, seems to be quite aware that somehow, uh, the, the symbols do not completely characterize, uh, what human beings really are. That the ability of human beings to redeem themselves to free themselves are of a certain state or a four plunge into the opposite state. So there's a difference between the symbols and what human beings are going to be able to do. This is the, this is really the, the, the, the reason why I focused on Canto on Canto ask you to read Canto to 12 where Dante places tyrants.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       It's an an, it's really an anonymous can't, well, there are no great figures, no great personalities. And we do know, and Dante give us a list of all the tyrants of his time and the chirons that ionizers of Syracuse Alexander, uh, the, the SLA, no of his own, his own time in Padua, uh, et cetera. Uh, they are the features of a tyranny, but at the same time, he places next to them, figures of educators, figures of teachers, uh, such as, for instance, Kyron. Uh, and, and, and this is a little bit ironic because he says, come straight after Dante's exemplary representation of Virgil's own teaching in canned to 11. You remember when, uh, virtual goes on explaining in great detail the shape of, uh, of, of inferno, he here. Now, once again, Dante takes the other perspective that which it takes to be the tyranny.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       The tyranny of teaching, they say as sort of teaching does not allow that freedom. That the very symbols, the very presiding, uh, figures of this canto also seem to, to deny they are there forever, man and beast. And Dante claims clearly that there is a teaching that has to allow the soul to, of have the freedom to move either in the direction of rationality or the freedom of the choice to move in it's opposite direction. So, uh, this is, uh, the substance I think of Canto are 12. We come though to kind to 13, which is, uh, one of the most remarkable cantos of in fairness, it's the cant of the suicides and Danton counters here. A figure, a poet, very well known poet, very well known figure of maybe, uh, the late, um, the middle part with the 13th century called Pierre the Levenia.

Speaker 1:          00:05:46       And as you can, as you read through the Kanto, you will see that he punts on both terms of the name Pierre Peter and he, he thinks of himself as a figure of Peta. One Who holds the keys, the two keys of the kingdom, the keys of power, but also the last name peer, the Levenia meaning of the vineyard. And this is verse, this is, we are going to witness now and metamorphosis of a human being. Then metamorphosis is a human being from being human to becoming a vegetable at plant. Uh, this is, uh, the story of suicides and we shall, we shall see what Dante things about suicides. One, he, why does he thinks is such, such an evil as to become them in this area of violence against the self. You do know her, Dante, I don't have to go over this, but you do know that Dante distinguishes violence against self violence against others as in Canto 12, uh, violence against nature and violence even against the divinity and can talk in Canto 14.

Speaker 1:          00:06:46       Let's look at canto 13, a little bit of a, some, some textual details and then, uh, and then we'll, we'll, we'll discuss, uh, some of the issues of the Canto. Um, Nessus had not yet reached the other side. Again, when we set out through a wood which was not marked by any path here, there seems to be no directions at all. Almost as if Dante we're revisiting, came to one of inferno, the same idea of, uh, uh, a sense of loss of self and adumbrating what suicide may also be at some, at, at, at, at some level, a loss of a loss of some idea of one's own being, some idea of what one is or should be. We are not told anything more. But then rather than shifts to the description of the natural landscape, the world of nature, the landscape, and you, uh, uh, if as you read, you must be struck by how he's highlighting a peculiar style.

Speaker 1:          00:07:52       And I want to emphasize this style, this figurations of style and no green leaves but of Dusky Hugh series of antithesis, first of all, a series of antithesis but also an APP for us. Negatives, no smooth bowels but not that and worked antithetical, but at the same time, repetition of this. No. And therefore foric no, no, no fruits where there, but most of the storms, no breaks or harsh. And then that the savage beast hate the tilde lands between the Cessna and called NATO. We are in what? In in a, in a place in the landscape where this is the style called, uh, uh, there's a technical term for the Dan to deploy. It's called [inaudible], which simply means a privation emphasizing. There's nothing positive here, but it's a way of subtracting from what is missing rather than what is there that is really a negation, the style of integration.

Speaker 1:          00:08:53       Uh, but at the same time, so the antithesis making us think about how the world might be no green leaves but of Dusky Hue say this is a style of uh, taking away and they gave taking it away from any substantial, uh, description of the landscape, no breaks or harsh and then etc. Here make their nests. The loathsome harpies again, a hybrid figures just as we had the, the same tour in the previous Canto, um, from the strawberries with this more presage of future eels, they have white wings and human next and phases feed Claude and the great valis feathered and they make lamentations on the strange trees. Uh, so we are in the world. Are we really at world of negation a world of, uh, uh, monstrosities and a world of, uh, probation, um, what is happening to human beings here? That's, that's really the, the, the question that he seems to be racing, but let me just proceed even more care here.

Speaker 1:          00:10:01       The whole scene recasts an important scene in book three of the Aeneid. This is indeed also a major confrontation between Dante whole can't dramatizes a major confrontation between Dante and Virgil, the author of the Aeneid about some of these issues. Where is the metamorphosis? Where is nature? What is the place of human beings within nature? Because Dante and Virgil things in a sharply different ways for, um, the metamorphosis versus the scene that Nancy here is recalling, um, is the scene of book three of the Aeneid where Pori Doris at causing the veneers has been killed. And he's, you remember that is the speaking trees in there to nes arrives in Trisha, which is Asia Minor. He thinks that his dad is the place which the gods of assigned to him and he does that which she feels has that which he knows has to be done wherever and whenever you want to build a city, consecrate the ground, how the ground by building an altar and by purifying the ground through fire as he tries to do this.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       The altars horror is at the center in the Aeneid at the center of the human community. He's pulling his plucking Eh, a a bow and he hears a voice and we still his, his, his, uh, his shutters is scared and the voice comes, it's poly Doris, his cousin who, who tells the story that has been killed because of the sacrilegious, I mean combated wherever. Consecration virtual once one has to believe to think of cannot be really carried out because of the sacrilege has been that of the killing of Pomodoros on account of the, the, the, the goal that he carried, that they wanted to prompt him or they want to rob him off. Um, so, and, and, and knee as he is a voice. Why do you, uh, whether do you pull me out of this and put a daughter simply asks that a proper burial be given to him so that he can descend peacefully into hades and he has complies and leaves that place in the knowledge that is not the place I signed to him.

Speaker 1:          00:12:22       Sacrilege was such that he cannot really quite found the city on the place of a crime, such an atrocious crime. Dante's revisiting that particular scene. In fact, I repeat 10 to 13, the recast that scene and it's a major encounter with Virgil and Virgil's hole pattern, whole system of values. And let's see how this is going to continue. So we have the background with uh, uh, some, some, uh, stylistics of negativity, the styles of an allegation as if suicide, where this fundamental sacrilege, uh, that denies the, the, the, some, some, some, some reality that we don't know yet. And the good master began to speak to me. So Virgil intervene, um, minding us, reminding us that this is in the book, three of the Aeneid, which by the way, and other little detail book, three of their need is the book of the veneer that Dante Joe's from the most.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       And if some of you want to write a paper on how many scenes and why you should go and, uh, go ahead and write that kind of paper. One reason is the book, three of their need is the, is the book of Nes Exile, the homelessness of Nes. Nes. We still nowhere, he's just uh, uh, has just left the, the uh, Troy he's going to, about to, about to leave Carthage Dido's home and about to get to into, into Sicily but never really quite been able to say this is really where I belong. This is really the praise one. One can call home whatever that may be for him. The good master began to speak to me virtual interrupts before the go further, farther, no, that we're in the second round and she'll be until they come to the horrible sand look, well therefore and Asha see things that would discredit my telling of them.

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       This is a hyperbole on the part of virtual. You're going to see what I have been describing in a sense. This is the reason why I'm the all the the and authority and why I'm guiding through you through this because I have seen imaginatively at least I have seen some of the things that you are experiencing and what you will see. The reality of it all will exceed my, uh, my own abilities to tell of it. It stands of humility on the part of the teacher. Then afforded a mild correction of the claims about teaching and cantor 12, he said, this is one theme that seems to be running through. And then, uh, uh, Dante continuous are heard from every side wheelings poured forth. And so none that made them so that, Oh, bewildered, I stopped. And now another conceit that we should come back to.

Speaker 1:          00:15:21       I think he thought, I thought, oh, it's clearly, um, we call it an amplification one at a way of playing with one verb, but also inferring what the thought of the other would be. Uh, it's a descent into a kind of, into the boundaries of one's own mind, a way in which Dante dramatizes the fact that there is no real conversation now going on between him and Virgil. It's, it's a way of descending into the, uh, what I call exactly the, the, the, the loneliness of, uh, of Dante's own thoughts, I think. And then reiterated once again and a, for Rick, I think he thought, I thought more of this later, that all divorces among the trucks came from people were hiding from us. So the master said, if the break of annual branch from one of these trees, all the present tolls will prove mistaken.

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       Then I put up my hand a little and proctor twig from a great stone and its trunk cried and this is in year three lines 39 and following. That's the way book through third of three of the knee begins. Why the start telling me and we had turned dark with blood. It began again. Why mangles Tommy has done no spirit of pity. We were men and now our turn to stocks, the hand might well have been more pitiful. We've been souls of serpents. It's a green brand. There is burning at one end, drips from the other and hisses with escaping wind. So from the broken splinter came forth words and blood together at which I left for the tip and still this one afraid and virtual intervenes. If he could have believed before wounded soul, what it had never seen, but in my lines in my need, he would not have stretched forth his hand against him.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       My sage replied, but they think being incredible made me prompt him to the deed, which grieves myself. But tell me who that was so that for some amens he may revive their fame in the world above what he is permitted to return. The irony of reviving the fame in a place where there is no possibility of revival, a, there is no possibility of coming back to life and they wear their natural world is not capable of behaving naturally. Where, where there is no real growth, no real change here. It's always going to be, it's the most unnatural of places. Uh, saw the shadow of, of this unnatural ness is going to be cast over the, uh, the scene with the encounter with Brunetto Latini. What is this, this idea here? Uh, in a sense, this is already the confrontational between Virgil and Dante. If he could have believed that which had described it is this, Dante wants to test the truth value of what he had read in the Aeneid.

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       He had read the scene at the end. [inaudible], let me see how this is and finds out that that which he sees is entirely different from Virgil's account. Uh, in a way we are really, really drawing our attention to what we call the act of reading. How do we read or what do we believe? When we read the story and we read a story, we yield in many ways too. So it's part, we want the, the story that we read to read us as much as we want to read it, we want the story to, to explain us to ourselves, to hold a mirror up to us to see the who we are. But Dante is literally also implying the need to violate the, the, the letter of the Aeneid is I, he had to do because whatever he had, any virtual had described, exceeded a believability.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       It was just an incredible account and he has to test the reality of, of that scene. So that's, that's really the part of the confrontation between the two. And now let's see what he hears. And the trunk said, thou swear Lewis me with a gentle speeches where we call Cup Tatsuo. I won't have to write it on the, on the, on here, on the board, the cap tax, your benevolence. Yeah. You know that whenever a great rhetorical trick, uh, whenever you give a speech or whatever, people speak to you in public, especially of our privately, they, uh, willing engage in this way of capturing your benevolence, about telling a story, playing with something about their modesty or whatever. Now you saw Louis May so fascinated. So I, uh, the lower of your rhetorical language or your rhetorical powers, we are dealing with rhetoric first of all with style and now then with the language of the text and now with the language of the exchange.

Speaker 1:          00:20:20       So this is it. It is as if, uh, uh, the, the suicide has a lot to do with this trait of language is characteristic of language that so Louis me with a gentle speech that I cannot be silent and let it not burden youth from beguiled into talk for a little. I am he that help both. The keys here is the pun on Peter. It's as if he were Saint Peter holds the two keys of the Kingdom of Fredrick's heart. Uh, and now the, you can see that all the language of believing faith that has been going around in the previous lines of the candle seem to be gravitating around the figure of Frederick. They cane who is a kind of, let's call them the god of the city, right? Uh, because his name, that's what it means in Italian. The specialists, it's not an English who say Frederick, it has a feather Ricoh, which really repeats the idea of, uh, of, of faith within it, as if all faith all believes really have to converge and go toward this.

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       Uh, this, this, uh, emperor of Sicily, the, he's a hunch fun. He's a famous German king, a ruling over Sicily and, and, and living there was the chancellor of the empire and also the founder, by the way, let me say something more about him. He's the founder. He's the one who conceived the first university, the first State University in Europe, the University of Naples, because Frederick wanted a university that would prepare lawyers, diplomats, uh, people would go on state missions who can write, uh, uh, uh, papers for the state, and they would not be at all, or one of the schools that they were universities where, uh, under the aegis of, for instance, the canon lawyers that theologians, so this was, say the first La Secular School in Europe was an imperial. CNN are like, for instance, the University of Paris, uh, which was under the symbol painters in the domain of both the bishop of Paris and the King of France.

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       And hence a lot of, uh, conflicts between, uh, between the two. Uh, uh, so he's a chancellor, he's the founder and of of the university. He was a poet. And he also compiled the so called institutes of justice for the kingdom where, which is all, uh, inspire. The institutes are all inspired by, uh, the language of moderation, the language of, uh, of, of, uh, uh, idealistic language of older, uh, and the natural law that could follow, could they could organize the state. And clearly, uh, the reality is that by his act, uh, uh, peer delivery in your shows that there's no such a thing called that he doesn't really believe in what he claims to be the principal of the legal organization of, of the state, which is, uh, uh, natural law. I have been. So I have bought the keys of Fredericks heart and turn them locking and unlocking so softly that I kept nearly every other main from his secrets.

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       He is the secretary of the emperor word as you know, secretary. Uh, which becomes very crucial throughout the renaissance is a counselor, but the secretary means comes, it's a word that comes from the Latin, from to secrete it. This is a fake. It's a, here's the figure who distills. That's the creating distills, the, the, that which the emperor keeps hidden in his heart. Oh, he's, he has this power of distillation and knowing us and through this, this selection, what has to be shared and what has to be kept concealed from all, all others. Okay. So pipe, the figure of a prestige. He views himself as a, as a strict, and he was collaborator of the emperor and that brought again such faithfulness. Now that question of fidelity in the way we read the text in the way we believe, what we read is brought into, it's sort of rephrase refracted into the language of Fidel Loyalty as faithfulness to the emperor, to the growers office that are lost for its sleep and strength.

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       The causes of the suicide, the causes of his tragic of appeared. The Levinas tragic downfall. I want to be at the Harlot, personification for envy. Envy. Uh, the, the sin there is product that Aquinas for instance, views as the worst possible sin. Yeah. Uh, because it is really very close to hatred and close to hatred in the sense that it has nothing. All sins have some positivity to it, and all you are, you're a glutton is because that piece of cake, there's something about it that no lures show to you are you have, have this jar proud. It's because you really have some sense of your excellence or some which is the real sin. Contempt for others. Believe that others are not as good as you as you would think you are. So it's not so much that you look at yourself stretching the hand toward the divinity, the pride of Lucifer, right?

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       They're real sin is that you, you kick around those who you perceive are below. You all since have some kind of positive they except for one. And that's envy. Envy only likes nothing. It's not jealousy. You know, you do have the kind of story, all of you, I'm sure our readers of Othello, right? Because that's really a confrontation with an envy and jealousy. That is the envy. Uh, how Jen Othello, maybe jealous, but the one who is really envious is Jago one once he doesn't want this demo of himself, he can't stand the idea that the other guy's happy. That's envy. Jealousy is the fear of losing jealous is almost, uh, an ingredient of love. Andreas Capilano says she really are in love. It must be some rational aspect too of jealousy in it. But here, uh, the, the cause of, of uh, uh, the court, the court, which is always that little microcosm, right?

Speaker 1:          00:26:48       Uh, even for Dante writes a treatise on language or the theorists of law about, about the function of language in the court because the court is the place of laws is the praise of poetry is the place of a, uh, political persuasion. These are the, the various dimensions of the powers of language. And then you do know about the court from Andreas Capilano's. That's another topic for you to explore Dante's figuration of the court and from all possible, uh, uh, points of view here. Dante views. Now the court is micro cause of a political oda and idealism as being literally poisoned by the presence of a contaminated by the presence of envy, the Harlot. And that never turned a shameless eyes. And You understand that metaphor. It's not so much that it belongs to the Harlot. The fact is that the word envy as you know, is a word that are in Italian or in English, in videos.

Speaker 1:          00:27:55       It's Nvidia, which is at the monetized as non video. So it's whole, it's an idea. It's a kind of blindness to the world outside. And here Dante's panelists turn the shameless eyes. We seem to be, uh, in a sort of representation of the harlot, this and the seduction of the holiday. But it's also also plays on this, uh, on this notion of what MV really means and common bane and the vice of codes and now inflamed all mines against me. Look how the language now sort of takes over. It takes over and Dante is just playing with and, and multiplying these terms, the same terms repeated over and over again and those inflamed. So inflame the dusters. The name for the Emperor Caesar that happy owners turn to this bull was, this is the formula for the, the, the, the formulaic definition of tragedy that he's giving happy owners turn to this more walls.

Speaker 1:          00:29:04       We have the Lavigna is aware of his own tragic Destinee, his own tragic downfall and, and seals his fate as a tragic fate. And now my mind in scornful temper thinking by dying to escape from score made me just unjust to myself at once again, the style of repetitions and a foric peer. The lavigna constitutes himself into a closed circuit and, and the doubling of language reflect the self. And let me just go on and tell you what I think is, is going on here. When you read the sentence and I'm dying to skip from sort of made me just unjust to myself. And the obvious question that I think you should really ask and if I gave you a chance to ask, you would ask how many cells are there in him? Made me just unjust to myself. How many, how many persons are there, how many fingers are there in one, in, in, in pure the Livy? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       The text that best glosses the scene. It's tragic occurrence here. Appears in the city of God of the Augustan book, one where Augustan is telling the story of Rome and the death of, and the end of the period of the monarchy, you know, the seven kings, right? Their stores. And with the s the story of the seven, the, the, the expulsion of the tar. Quinn's, the, the last king is attributed to the fact that the famous matron of Rome, but the name of Lucretia come down too, by the way, mentions in limbo though he's, he has a lot of ideas about who or what, what, what is the guilt of a suicide. We shall see that a great figure from an antiquity, Cato, uh, as suicide will appear and will inaugurate the proctorial canticle in can't hold one. So that is always making some crucial discriminations, crucial distinctions.

Speaker 1:          00:31:19       At any rate. They are the story that Lucre that Augustine, uh, tells in book. One of the, of the city of God is that of uh, uh, the rape of Lucretia, the rape of Lucretia and Augustan is fierce about the fact that she commits suicide. How that she then she commit suicide are of the guilt and shame that she had been violated. It rape by the, by, by, by realtors. And she says, how the shit there to take her own life. Because here is the chase through Cretia who is embarrassed of the unchaste Lucretia. This is a sin of false transcendence. The belief that I can be not completely cold. I do not coincide fully with who I am so that I have to double myself, have to see myself as different from what, uh, what I am. I can do justice against myself by doing this.

Speaker 1:          00:32:24       For Dante are going to dentist texts. This doubling of peer, the Ravinia is a saint of false transcendence. The way the suicide is praying God to oneself and this punishing oneself for wrongs that he, the suicide perceives Lucretia. She that perceived as have fouling how reality and see what I mean? This is the kind of, uh, uh, there's a kind of, um, some, uh, kind of doubleness that seems to be running through and Dante's rendering through this idea of a start by the new roads. So the street, I swear to you, never did I break faith with my Lord who is so worthy of honor and the father of your return to the world. Let him establish my memory. Still lies under the blow that, uh, Envi, uh, gave it. So, uh, the story of appear. The Livinia exemplifies the story of, of dramatizes, the story of the tragic, uh, uh, experience of suicide.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       And Dante here gives of suicide in exactly theological and Augustinian, uh, account. He views it, looks at it from an Augustinian our point of view. We skipped Canto, uh, 14, and we go now to another memorable candidate and memorable or can't 15, uh, memorable, um, uh, encounter with a dentist, teacher Brunetto Latini, um, who was probably 50 years. He senior who was a translator at, who adapted in the vernacular, a Cicero's rhetorical works, who was, uh, also who's a teacher of the Florentines, a teacher of Dante. Um, and who, uh, who really stands for the great values of the rhetorical humanistic or she's Heronian tradition. Uh, the idea of a, he opposed the idea of the Republic of Florence. Uh, he said wealth because he does not want you do know that they give billions are those who are in favor of the imperial control of the state. And for him to be a wealth is really to claim that he's on the side of the republic, that he wants the throat and the republic.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       Um, he was sent to an embassy, uh, he went to Toledo by the way, which at the time was the center of a great translations. And He may have brought from Toledo translations or of Dante new, uh, such as perhaps the account of the Mohammed's vision and be assent to, to, uh, to paradise. That's really a very doubtful a question, but it's, it circulates increasingly within a Dante Dante studies, the perimeter of Dante Studies. Uh, and, and, and Burrito what he was going on an embassy to friends, um, was banned from, he eventually returned to Florence. Uh, but he said figure that that Dante really tries to pattern himself after effectively. It's, it's uh, uh, the teaching of Brunetto is what guides him at least in the initial phase of his political concerns that other experiences, intellectual experiences that we'll intervene and we'll change radically Dante's thinking.

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       Uh, what I'm trying to do in these classes is also to give you a sense of the shifts in, in his perceptions and his understanding of the world. I will be telling you at some point that, uh, there were, there were, uh, extraordinary encounters that he had with uh, some theologians in some, some philosophers within Florence that gave him a completely different view from the one that [inaudible] instilled in him. So let's see what happens between the toilet. We are in the area. Once again, violence, this time, violence, it is nature and that is [inaudible] is damned, is condemned for a sin of Sodom. There is no evidence at all from any other sources that that's what, that's where he was. And, and, and I have to tell you that Dante also has a different understanding of Solomon when he comes to pull gatory. Um, for instance, Canto 26, uh, where the, the sodomites are in, in the process of redeeming, of seeking some kind of redemption and cleansing.

Speaker 1:          00:37:08       But Anyway, this is the candle here. Let's see how he proceeds. Now, one of the hard margins bears us on and the vapor from the stream makes a shade above such shelters, the water and the banks from the fire. Uh, uh, the, the, the focus of the cantos once again, the natural world, the natural world and natural world, which is one of sheer chaos in the natural world, which is one of violence. And look at this image as the Fleming between Vincent and Bruce. You know, the, the Netherlands is describing literally the Netherland calling called such because there are lower, the surface of the land is lower than that of the water and they have to to protect the, the, the land from the violence of, of the water and the floods. So they build this diet around as the Fleming's between Vincent and Bruce fearing the flood Rushanian on them, make the bulwark to drive back the sea.

Speaker 1:          00:38:11       And this, the pageants do along the brand to protect their towns and castles before the kid. And Tana feels the heat this were made of the same fashion except that the builder, whether he was met them neither, so high, no, so broad. So the natural world that can hardly be contained. That's the idea. The natural world that is always going to overwhelm all efforts to, uh, barriers trying to impede its violence. By the way, this is an image for those of you who are readers of literature, even beyond the Middle Ages. Uh, it's a famous image that Machiavelli was use in, uh, uh, in, in chapter 20, uh, five of the, of the prints. You remember when he talks about virtual and fortunate and that the virtue of human beings virtual the word cat, actor at a tear, you know, the virtual human beings is to build, you know, uh, shelters we talk to whenever we expect the front, but in the full knowledge that we are never really going to succeed.

Speaker 1:          00:39:16       And yet we need the shelters just in case we might succeed. Virtual is always a little bit less powerful than fortunate in his, uh, in, in that world. It's a, it's an image that in one of, uh, the history, uh, plays Shakespeare also also uses, I'm not saying that he takes it from Dante said, we don't know whether he actually read down to or not already. So this is the background of this account already. We had got to so far from the woods that I should not have seen what it was if I had turned backward when we met a troop of souls. We're coming alongside the bank and each looked at us as men look at one another. And the new moon at dusk seems to create this kind of a strange world of uh, of the night worlds, the night world and the packer, the browse on us like an old Taylor on the eye of his leader.

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       What an extraordinary, extraordinary emerge that will use something like this. Not Quite the same image. The paler, uh, when he's arriving, when his to describe his own vision of Paradise. It is a safe, the most, the humbleness, the humble, his experience in the city. Uh, in Florence, you know, the Artism, the, the Taylor can only help him. That was the only thing you can think about as he's approaching. There was sublime of experiences. That's about it. These are 33, and here this most are extraordinary. A story has also the ring of familiarity or that's really the image of a, the way I think this image works, the sense of a familiarity and that with a familiar image of the tailor and the tailor. Also figure that picture measure the Taylor is a figure of a, of the Artism who in order to fit you properly has really to have your measure.

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       Your idea of who you are. Now I does. By that company, I was recognized by one who took by the help me, but the hammock ride her marvelous and die. When he reached out his arm to me fixed my eye on his vacant looks. So the scorched features did not keep my mind from recognizing him and bending my face to his. I answered are you here seven or eight? Are you here sir? Brunetto oh, so this is the scene of the recognition in in fair? No, that's what you have seen. So recognitions more than first encounters. It is as if literally recognizing means knowing people that you thought you knew and you knowing them. I knew all the fingers that you thought you knew something about red of the recognition it means also are giving a kind of uh, understand and give me a kind of the deal to them.

Speaker 1:          00:42:13       Recognizing in that sense too. And He, oh my son, but not explicitly. If Retro Latini return back with the little and let the train go on twice. Brunetto refer to Dante's, oh my son are the sorts of acknowledging this, this Felician acknowledging, ah, a kind of familiarity that goes beyond even every, any form of discipleship. And Dante will resist that, that solicitation, that affectionate. So recitation, that familiarity, he will always refer to him as they emerge of a father, but twice. And then he says, and I said to him with all my heart, I beg of you and if you wish me to sit with you, I will if it pleases him here with whom I go. Meaning Virgil are mentioned as if Dante now were concealing pro forma. To be sure the shifted a loyalty from one teacher to another and we're considering it from Brunette within again a cancer again, breathe, Oh son, whoever this frog stops, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:43:16       Um, go under for a Chicago Matteis skirt, which some critics have seen as a sign of this is that the really Dante may have known something about Prenatal Athena that nobody else knew. Uh, uh, later rejoined my band will, who go morning that a turn or laws, uh, look at the spatial configuration of the scene. It's, I think it's very significant. The disciple is above the future is below so that the disciple has to bow in order to be able to speak to the teacher, which would be a sign of his reverence for the authority of the master. But at the same time it indicates that the hierarchy between them, it's both the higher heat between them really has completely altered from the the days that they were or are in the city, in the streets of Florence. And then he tells the story up above them and the bright light, I answered him, not, I'm sorry, there's not descend from the track, etc.

Speaker 1:          00:44:17       And he says, what chance of destiny Burritos as brings the down here before their last day. And who is this that shows the y chance destiny Brunetto has no understanding of the trajectory of Dante's life and adventure. And this is really the beginning of a series of misunderstandings between the teacher and the disciple tool. Different value systems are being deployed and there are going to be in collusion with each other. Brunetto speaks like a true humanist and men who belonged to the CIS Aronian. And who espouses this is Haronian ethics for whom here the world is one indeed of chance encounters, uh, uh, destiny, ah, that takes us one way or the other and there is nothing in the, the providential, ah, about it. And Dante, uh, a response by really giving a kind of pithy summary of his experience in the last few hours up above there in the bright light.

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       I answered, I answered him before my age, who was at the fool hill repeats in fair, no one, I lost my way in a valley. He appeared to me when I was returning to it. And by this road he leads me home. These are extraordinary rewards because what home means for the politically minded Florence centered and of existence of Brunetto is not the idea of what home means for Dante. For Dante home is the place of the soul and the place where the soul is, uh, at its most distended distension of the solar cookers for Brunetto home can only be the CTO forum. One has a political frame of reference. The other one has a theological frame of reference and they two are colliding with each other. Let's continue and see how this is extraordinary. And he said to me, if you follow the star now again, an extension of the language.

Speaker 1:          00:46:21       That metaphor picks up the metaphor of chance of destiny, kind of astrology. Follow your star, right? Uh, the astrology of the desk in the destiny of Dante Dao cannot fail the glorious haven. Another one another that is dramatizing the radical ambiguity of words that seem to be so bland, like glorious, glorious means to a humanist is not what glorious means to a theological reminded thing. You know, in theology one things of nature, grace and glory that Dante Begins Paradise One, the first word with which means it's the glory of him. Gloria, him who moves all things and glory from Brunette to means the happy ending fame and whatever the grill use heaven. If I discern rightly in there for life and then I'll die too soon, seeing heaven so gracious to the again, uh, uh, this is, you know, glorious in grace. Once again today, I would have strengthened in thy work.

Speaker 1:          00:47:22       But a thankless and Malik malignant fork, which came down with old from fears or instill, keeps something of the mountain and the rock shall become for the world doing that an enemy and with reason for among the bitter Sobes, it's not natural. The sweet thing should come to fruit. Old Fame. So from Brunette to his point of view, the reference of all the crisis, the spiritual crisis, the laws of self of Dante can only be political. That Brunetto makes an incredible mistake of believing that Dante's experience is exactly the replica of his own. He lost the city while he was, by the way, Ron says, val, the place, you know, where the, where the Great Paladin of Charlemagne or long, uh, was, was, uh, it's a symbolic place. He chooses was defeated. And now this is exactly what he thinks. It's happening also to, to Dante, the pilgrim. Um, among the bit of sobs, et Cetera, old fame in the world calls and blind people, avaricious and views and proud. This is the, the three sparks that have set the hearts of the Florentines on fire. And this pride envy, average envy and pride are the fortune holds the for such honor that one party and the other shall be ravenous against the, so then, uh, the language that the prophecy of Dante's exile, the two parties [inaudible] Berlin's will turn against them, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       And Dante answers, we're all my prayers fulfilled. I answered him. You had not yet been banished from humanity. For in my memory is fixed and our goes to my heart, the deer and kind paternal image of you with many time in the world, you taught me how man makes himself immortal and how much I'm grateful for it. My tongue where I live must needs to declare that we should tell him my course. I write and keep with another text for comment by lady who will know if I reach her. Clearly an allusion to Beatrice, though we will not be Beatrice who will make the prophecy of Dante's exile. But in this metrically, uh, connected Canto 1516 of Paradise would be Dantes real grandfather. So the distinction between this fictional figure of a self proclaimed spiritual father Brunetto and the the heroic grandfather Cacciaguida, uh, the, the, the antithesis is very, uh, very clear and in the acknowledgement that Dante gives of the acknowledgement that Dante gives of, uh, um, burritos teaching when he says, um, for me, my memory is fixed and now goes to my heart, the deer in kind paternal image of you wear many time in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       You taught me how men makes himself in mortal. There's also a little bit of a critique, a little bit of a distance that Dante establishes between himself and Brunette. For the true point. The real authentic point of Dante's experience is that men does not make himself and more, of course we're involved. Withdrawal works. Maybe there are many other forms of achieving some degree of immortality, but can make children to become more to one hope, at least a provisional immortality, continuity. Uh, but from dentist point of view, the mortality that he's seeking is not manmade, can only be a question of the salvation of his soul. So in the very great acknowledgment that form in which the disciple who just love making these claims of indebtedness to the teacher is also a sense of a difference between them and misunderstandings. Uh, and this, uh, uh, we'll, uh, we'll, we'll be in fact the trade of this encounter to a teacher who has been shaping the disciple and the disciple has been going his own way, uh, who somehow things that education means also, uh, uh, is tantamount to an experience of freedom.

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       It's what we, this is the way we began when, uh, when I spoke about the dub, the figures of doubleness in cantor 12. And this is the theme that seems to be going through even in the encounter with Brunetto and let's see now exactly then what is Brunette saw them. Your way of understanding Burritos are clearly linked to violence within the world of violence. And so, um, Dante wants to know about who the other centers are and Burrito would comply and sister all clerks and great and famous scholars and he mentions them over the father was one of the same sin pressure if famous Grameen Arion, a Francesco, the Corso who also is a, uh, by the way, I think he's a lawyer and I started as the craving such scarf, et cetera. Now then he says, I will say more, but I cannot go farther talking with the for I see there and new cloud rising from the sand.

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       People are coming with whom I must not be let my treasure in which I get live, be commended to the, and I ask no more a true teacher, I say, who gives bibliography at the end? Says, okay, now you go and read my book or just read everybody's book but I recommend to you my treasurer come in, which I get live to become mended today. Then he turned about and seemed like one of those who run for the green cloth in the field at and Luda Cambridge, an image of a race which is run in Verona. And he seemed not the Roos are among them, but the winner. So he leaves with the illusion that he is a precursor. Is it where you understand what I mean? That he's in a race. He so far behind everybody else that he seems not to be ahead of them.

Speaker 1:          00:53:47       He said, really behind the one circle that's, that's the emerge with which Dante ends this encounter. Brunetto recommends this treasure, which was a French text that he wrote this in an encyclopedia that he wrote in a while in France and he wrote it in French so much that, uh, and it's so important this text, it's one of the most important encyclopedias in the vernacular. Separate PD is being, I may have, I even gave you, are I remember you, I don't expect you to remember it, but I gave you a definition of the divine comedy is a poetic encyclopedia in the sense that it tries to gather together the broken pieces of knowledge of experience. And at the same time, unlike the technical encyclopedias such as the Britannica give you, dramatize the presence of someone who is being educated through them, a process of education. Dante is the one who is in the middle of learning.

Speaker 1:          00:54:45       So it's an encyclopedia with a path about how to learn, not the abstract one that Brunetto had written, uh, but it's written in French and it's, and, and, and I stress this fact because Ah, elsewhere one of his philosophical who were refraction's Dante goes on thing that we are all bound by natural affection for our own language. And because on account of that, there are those who have, uh, put forth the, uh, the interpretation that Brunetto is here for the value, violating the natural bonds of affection that we have, that human beings have to their own natural language to their own, uh, uh, mother language, let's call it that. It could be, it could be. Uh, but what I think this is is, uh, a dramatizes, an incredible self delusion on the part of Brunette. Here he is dead. He is circling around under the reign of fire and he thinks he still lived in his own text.

Speaker 1:          00:55:48       He mistakes first of all, the symbolic life that he has within a text with reality. That's a really, that's the first confusion. That language of images, the languages of seeming that is running, that pervades this cantor has to be understood in terms of this confusion on the part of the unit. Whether it is more, there is more to it. The mistake that Brunetto makes is to believe that Dante, Dante's whole life is a replica of his own. Read my textbooks, whatever it is that you have to know is already available to you in my own book. That is to say he faces the difference between Dante and himself and Brunetto. He refuses to see that Dante's old life can have eh, it's home development and it's home destination, which at this national, which she can not understand at all. So that's the, the end of Canto are 15 this, this sodomy.

Speaker 1:          00:56:51       Then there's also confusion between the real and the imaginary, the way of drawing the real world and to one of a fictional fictions. And imaginations. That is one scene before I stopped and give you a chance to ask her a question. Now we'll go into Canto 16. It's the end. Really. We are reaching the end of the intermediate area, the moral or the ground of violence, which to us of course, may, I don't, I just presumed that you may be surprised me. We are cultures in full view of violence really as the worst possible crime, right? And violence in, in, uh, uh, in all of its, uh, its forms and, and uh, it's, it's expressions, the several psychological, physical, uh, political and so on. Uh, for dental, the real, the worst crimes of the crimes of fraud. As you know, this is our bad enough to to be sure, but the, and that the show is about 20, enter in, canto with canto and cantor 17, and he will see a strange failure.

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       Uh, they are, they have to go over a huge ravine. There is no way that they can do this. Uh, but then miraculously, uh, uh, a figure, strange figure, a monster, uh, they are the edge of standing at the edge of the pit. And a, a figure appears. This is the figure of Jerry on that. At the end of Canto 60, let me read this image of the figure of Jerry and, uh, Dante will mount on Jerian and, uh, uh, virtual will sit behind him and they come in. The descent takes place in three areas of fraud. So this is the, the, the, these are this, this is a sequence of happenings in the cantor. Um, and now let's, let's see what Anthony says. It's, it's, it's an experience of, uh, uh, we would even call it wonder in her ex experience of foremost the sublime, uh, an infernal sublime. Amen. This, I'm reading from 16, they'll line one 30, uh, around around one 30. And following your main should always closest lips as far as he can to the truth that has the face of ally. Oh, that's fraud.

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       Mixture of truth and deception, truth and lies. That's what literature seems to do. Two though. No. Oh, since without fault. It brings him shame. But here I cannot be silent. And by the strains of this comedy is text, this text called comedy. And this historic moment of an experience of descent comedy also, uh, captures this, uh, this, this rhetoric of descent, of lowering oneself. I not just an aesthetic experience. I swear to the reader. Another, the second address to the reader, and you may remember that we saw one in Canto or nine, and I tried to explain it to you as the address to the reader as part of the strategy of authority on the part of Dante in the measuring, which I need readers and I may have readers. Then I'm constantly rooted into an author. You understand that that kind of strategic moves or I swear to the reader that I saw coming swimming up to that gross murky air, a figure, amazing to the stout as heart.

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       Even as he returns who goes down sometime to lose the anchor that is called to the reef or something else. He didn't see stretching upward and drawing in his feet. This is the story. This is the approach of Jerry on what I want to point out is a number of metaphors here. This is an aerial journey. Jerian is flapping his wings and going through the murky air. Dante describes it as if it were a journey by see the metaphor he uses his swimming. I go, I saw come swimming up through the grass grows and murky and by the way when Dante's to describe the story of a mythic sailor, mythic mariner Ulysses whom we are going to encounter hopefully next week. I think it's going to be next week in a or next time the, he describes this journey by CEO of Ulysses as if it were a journey by air and he does this because for Dante it doesn't matter how you are traveling, if you fly or you go by water, it doesn't matter because all journeys are journeys to the same destination.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       All journalists are really journeys to the absolute. He Agera one Samsung to come to play a ministerial function. He's going to minister to serve Dante and his guide and at the same time that it says here to there is some kind of plan here to this. I'm kind of something of the absolute that I have to see. So that's the first image. The second image is this idea of um, uh, the, the, uh, which will be described really later. The rotatory movement of Jerian through the air. And I have been described as the circle, the spiral, that movement in the spiral, the spiral motion of a all or, or movement in, in, in fandom. And the third, this is this idea of the swearing by dontre's own text. That text is given now the value of a sacred object, something that has, um, something one can swear by. If we began with a violation of the hernia, then canto 13. Now in Canto 16, tell poses to the AENEID and look to every places. Therefore the new text for us. It's this common it, let me stop here and uh, let me see that we have a few minutes for questions, which I will welcome and tried to answer about five, 10 minutes.

Speaker 2:          01:03:19       Yeah, I have a quick thing I want to clear up. Um, cancer, uh, 13, uh, at the end when you did let me not being the artist talking about Augustus, he's referring to Frederick said the Gusto. Yes. Make sure.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       Yeah. The, uh, it's, it's what we call a typological use of the emperor. The emperor has to be, it's Augustus or Caesar. These are the two terms used for the emperor. So it's a type, it's the kind of abstract type or the czar or the Kaiser, the bowl versions of the Caesar a myth, you know, I mean, in more than languages. So, uh, yeah, that's, it starts this. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:04:04       Talk about those people who are guilty.

Speaker 1:          01:04:09       That gets me off

Speaker 2:          01:04:10       guilty and bulbous shows over rationality. They're in the second circle. The sodomites are either the seventh, the difference there because look, we're serious. Violation of natural law, intellectual choice of near a park. Two engage in behavior, both intellect, which is much more serious then the incompetence of the people in the second circle.

Speaker 1:          01:04:46       The question is, uh, um, uh, mental, uh, have me, uh, think about the relationship between the centers of lust and the centers of sodomy. Uh, and uh, at the premise of the question is that in the centers of lost, we have a sinners who invert the order of reason and pleasure. Uh, what has mishandled the question then is why are the centers of sodomy, uh, placed in Eh, for the law down in Hell? And if this is because there's a question of, uh, intellectual choice, uh, this has been, uh, uh, at my answer is the following, uh, that the, uh, no, there's no indication in this cantos in Canto 15 that uh, the city here, that there is some, uh, that intellectual perversions. But you are right. Your question is well taken that all clinics in the sense of a clinics meaning not just where are we today thing as man of the cloth but meaning intellectuals, pressure, uh, are cool shoes.

Speaker 1:          01:05:55       Uh, who is, who is also mentioned their famous Seta, uh, of the laws, uh, then Burrito Latino himself. Uh, the scene here is a sin of uh, violence. Uh, justice. We had the idea that education, the educators in Canto 12, uh, those who are, who could, who, who, uh, what could, could pervert the very process of teaching. And just as in canto 13, we had a stoic pf the Levenia is really a story or a story called now reflects that suicide is not a virtual and the virtuous choice. But this, uh, this has sinners who have veal. The tool, whether this anger to the, and the have yield, the tool, the impulses of violence within them. Dante I think is condemning sodomy. Cause I think this is also part of the question you're asking may not be the central part, but because it is whatever there has been violence connected to their activity, this is the why would he placed them in, uh, in the circle of violence?

Speaker 1:          01:07:03       Unlike for instance, what happens to, uh, we the, when it said limb cut in Canto 26 or Caesar, by the way, there's also an illusion to Caesar in Canto 26 or purgatory. So there's a difference there. It teacher who uses violence. So that's the link between teaching a violence in Canto 12, uh, the man of a reason, the story believer in the logos. Uh, and, and, and, and, and, and the old rule of rationality, uh, are exasperates a principal and believes that he can be both judge and a and victim at sec executioner and the executed one and now in Canto 15 is this idea of, uh, uh, and then the, the, the way in which violence has taken over and, uh, and obfuscated the older of rationality. I don't see the element of choice in that.

Speaker 3:          01:08:02       Yes. Can you maybe discuss how Dante differentiates various representations of suicides since Lucretia is in limbo, died on, circled the last fall,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       and then we have [inaudible] who is in the actual circle of suicide and how is it that he makes the distinction between where they fall? It's impossible to differentiate within different forms of suicide since Dante. And that's exactly right. Exactly true. Done. Do we have Lucretia in limbo? We have dido in Canto to, among the, the last, last fall, souls will have Cato in purgatory, et cetera. And why here in Canto Canto 13, suicides are punished. Is there some kind of rationale that we can see behind the various, that's a question. The various forms of suicide. The answer that I would give is the following. Um, Dante know so well that they are the phenomenology of acts or various acts is vast and cannot quite be ever be brought to one common element so much that the beginning of Canto 14, if you turn to canto 14, Dante's going through the hot sands because it's, it's, it's, it's the burning sands of, of her and he remembered, he recalls there.

Speaker 1:          01:09:35       This must be exactly the burning sands of the Libyan desert, that Keto Cross, which is a way of saying, you know, don't be surprised. I think if you're going to encounter Cato further down, I know that you expect them to be here. So the question is how does Dante go on determining the particular, the value of particular act when we sin? This may be a little bit, um, I have to be very clear about this. Okay, what did we say? We usually can say, well, how can it be, I'm going to give you a kind of, I'm going to take a little bit of a distance from this whole question. It's easy to say, how can Dante be so mmm ruthless that someone, for all we know him have been a good human being and then the committed one crime and they are in hell forever for eternity.

Speaker 1:          01:10:41       That on the face of it would seem to be, uh, a reasonable query. You know, it was sort of indirect, too bleak way of asking for it, a little bit more tolerance and benevolence from this men who claims to be the supreme judge of all human beings have, uh, have been perpetrating. The fact is the, whenever we sin, Oh sins had involved, we think that it's only one that old sins had involved. And Dante highlights one specific aspect in the case of Dido. Her is more important than in the sense of more decisive and determines the character of that figure. Then the suicide, their suicide is seen as an extension of her loss. In the case of Lucretia put her in limbo. That is a wing which Dante really wants to make that clear distinction and leave an Antigo stadium. The stadium moment that look, creatures virtuals seem to have been limited as they are.

Speaker 1:          01:11:39       She's not saved in any way, but there is a kind of exemplary virtual that that allows him to sort of remember but not punish her for a crime, which is really to be understood as a consequence of an excessive way of understanding virtual. You see what I'm saying? In the case of Cato and we are going to see that he sees the sacrifice of self for freedom. That's really the, the, the, the great understanding. Keto dies for the sake of freedom and the whole, the Canto purgatory is a riff. The cantor one of authority is a reflection on the question of freedom, Roman freedom. And by the way, the biblical Jewish understanding of freedom of to, you know, I'm preparing you for that Canto. So maybe I'll save myself the trouble of repeating these things when we get there. Dante, we'll talk about, uh, uh, Roman freedom through Keto in the military.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       After, uh, uh, the troop of angels will arrive and they sing one song which is in exit to Israel. The Egypt wishes is to say the Jewish are this famous psalm one 13, a psalm of David. When David is reflecting about the epic of Exodus, the lyrical, lyrical reflection I party idea that caring from Egypt on the way to to Jerusalem was, which only some got two friends Moses never did is really a quest for freedom. So they are two ideas of free, not political or civil freedom and the theological idea of freedom. And that's really the key to understanding the Cato and understanding the way Dante connects these two traditions, the Roman and the Jewish traditions.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       Other questions? We have one minute and the tape probably last about 45 seconds. So we get the question or answer questions. Seems like you're saying here that Dante is almost finding a kind of sand when virtue is taken into your next steps. Yes. You can go too far. You can be too obsessed with a certain yes. Misdirection of virtue.

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       Yes. It's not a question, but it was, I said yes, yes. And I would agree. The port, the, the, the reflection is, it seems, I don't like that it seems that I'm saying, but I'm saying that actually, that, um, uh, that, that, uh, uh, in Dante, Dante, uh, views the access of virtual also are as part of something, part of the sin is sin. And I would agree with agree. Yes. Okay. Thank you. We'll see you next time.
