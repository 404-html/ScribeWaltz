Speaker 1:          00:00:01       We are going to try to finish with in fair no today. And they would like to look at the last 10 tolls, 30 31 32 may be a little bit 33 for sure. And this a couple of details in 34. Um, from one point of view, um, I'll be talking about Dantas tragic mode at the bottom of hell. This is, I hope to, to argue with you that I will be arguing exactly. This is, uh, uh, a tragic representation. It as soon as I say that you might wonder, you probably should wonder, uh, uh, but the, the difficulty of such an enterprise, uh, and the difficulty of the enterprise as to do first of all with the fact that this is a comedy, so that difficult, it should go away in the sense that, um, the tragic is really part, not an end, not a final vision, but part of a larger discourse that Dante, we'll, we'll go into, which is a comical idea.

Speaker 1:          00:01:23       He really has this idea of a comical, comical vision of a or ear of the divinity. Uh, and, and certainly of the cosmos comical in the sense that it's really the feast, the Feast of, uh, of, uh, uh, in classical times will be the feast of the Gods. Here is the, the redemptive happy, harmonious sense of it or the whole, that's one of the difficulties. The other difficulty, uh, about this, uh, mode of, uh, the tragic, uh, is that the, the, um, within the Christian vision that Dante, uh, that sort of shaped Dante's poem, uh, it's very difficult to locate the tragic, uh, there is no, that you think is, Eh, Eh, a Christian tragedy though one might say, and that will say here just to sort of of, uh, uh, give you a sense of how a new ads that you should maybe is that within that vision, within that Christian Vision, uh, we are always told that the only thing we know of God's presence in history is the crucifixion, is the story of the dying God, all of the story of the suffering of the divinity itself.

Speaker 1:          00:02:49       It is not the, once again a final vision. So there is a theological problem that he has to confront and there is also an aesthetic problem, a larger aesthetic problem. Um, so to really clarify this issue rather than just telling you all this comes from, I will, I will look at this scandals from one point to view the point of view of Dante's uh, writing a particular texts, the texts about language. So it's really going to be about language and, and tragedy in the belief that this is exactly Dante's insight about what, what the tragic maybe. So let me tell you have to go a little bit outside of the text for a while. So when I point out details here that we'll talk about another texts, you will see what I mean. You know, this is a sort of a, a also a little bit of a recapitulation for you.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       You know that Dante goes into exile in 1302. By the time he had written only one book after biographical book that had he, the data Nuova they, the new life that I had, he written only that book. He would still be known as one of the great poets of the Middle Ages, but he would not really be known for more than that. It's a little bit of a self enclosure and lyrical poem, a self enclosed. It's about as you recall, um, a kind of a sense of the self is absolute that love is an absolute itself does not allow for the intrusion of anything within its own orbit and its perimeter and Dante finishes, finishes or finish. It all, finishes it off with a vision, realizing that has to do other things in order to go on writing. He just doesn't write much at that point. He may be writing some songs.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       He is involved in political life in the footsteps of his teacher Brunetto Latini are and hoping that his life would really be very different for Brunette Latina. Ironically it is not because actually it's even more tragic. The brunette [inaudible] 13 it is politically involved in the history of of of Florence. He will experience exile but he will return to Florence enough to even go on teaching. Dante are here at has written and [inaudible] Texas, like Trasar has written allegories autobiographical allegories about his life. Dante, we're going to end in 1302. And the first thing that he writes is a treatise on language, which you know, which is called as on the Volga tongue. It's a text that written from the perspective of exile. Very much like the divine comedy because as a repeat Dante, we'll never go back to Florence. The reasons why he writes this kind of, uh, of, of, of, of texts, it's written in Latin.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       Uh, the reasons are very unclear also because he never finishes it. I'm going to suggest to you that there are good reasons why he could never finish it, but he wrote two books. We don't even know how many he conceived of a writing. What is this text about? So let me give you a little bit of, uh, of, of, of a summary of the text and then you'll see how it will go on. Um, um, reappearing in, uh, in, uh, in Dante's a poem and the, the, the final cantors of, of infant. We're in effect. He rewrites. He writes and gives a whole essence of the wholeness of the stacks and the difficulties of, and he will share with us, he sends with difficulties why that tract could never have been finished. At any rate, it starts, it's called the devil. Got It. Real quick answers.

Speaker 1:          00:06:34       It deals with the, uh, the origin of the Volga tongues. He starts very much like a medieval treatises. Start with, uh, from metaphysical standpoint, from the very high. Uh, where does human language do? Is Language something absolutely human? And the answer that he gives is yes and no. It is human because we are the only one, the only ones who do speak though he, he, he makes room for animals also occasionally speaking in the human voice, uh, and being understood by human beings making sounds that are there. And he's not talking about parrots, he's talking about miraculous biblical scenes. Uh, but he started saying the angels do not speak. They don't use the language we do. They communicate. Lucifer, for instance, he communicates, but he communicates with the other angels or with God intuitively as a kind of, so there is a reality that escapes the human, the human language, the language that we use.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       There are some things happening that we do not have. And then the language is that it's only human and yet it's not human because it's actually a gift. We couldn't really make it on our own. It's really God's gift. This is the metaphysical premise. Who was the first one of the first people to speak? It goes on Adam and eve in the garden of Eden. That's biblical enough. I think it's fairly clear what it was. The first language that they spoke Hebrew, Hebrew is acknowledged as the primal language and he will leave and go home so far as to say that he brought his never read, extinguished by, for instance, either the fall of man, mankind or are by the building of the Tower of Babel. And the whole question of Nimrod, here's a whole story about who this Nimrod is. The famous biblical giant who built a tower of Babel, uh, and with a, an act which he even he Dante.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       But this is very much like the traditional Var, the so called patristic writings. We'll see as the counter to the descent of the word know, the redemptive event of the word made flesh is really the counter to this human efforts, uh, this ascent in pride of Nimrod to try to bridge the gap between Earth and heaven. And this an effort to that fails. So he would go on, acknowledge him here, Hebrew, but I must say, uh, normally he says that it survives the story of Nimrod. He says it has never really disappeared. He takes, and I'm only qualifying it, what did we would call a, an a, an a historical viewpoint. You know, he does he own, it was almost as if Hebrew is accepted from, does not belong to the flow of history and the reality of the mutations that twitch, all things, oh sub lunar things are prone and are vulnerable.

Speaker 1:          00:09:33       Hebrew is accepted from it. I stress this fact because I'm going to go metal. This maybe toward the end of the term when we're going to read a parodies or 26 where Dante meets Adam and they are blatantly, he changes his mind. It is as if something has intervened in between the writing of that, that we've got an awkward answer and then counter with Adam. When Adam says, look, uh, the Hebrew language I spoke completely vanished as soon as I have, uh, the, the, the fruit of the forbidden fruit of the tree. So the Antigo zones or there's no trace of the original injury this to say in paradise, Dante ready to historicize the question of a human language. Okay, but not in this tree. This is a liberal gathered organs. He goes on, um, uh, describing, uh, uh, ah, the, the, the, the, the descent of the word.

Speaker 1:          00:10:29       So it's a theology of language. And then book one ends and he moves on to book two and then book to Dan. He gives a completely different context, a different direction in the street. He starts talking not about the grammar of language, where we could call the grammar of language. There is to say the ordering. How this language was ordered. That's what I mean by grammar. Of course, it's a word that explains letters, correct users of things, but also the ordering of a surgery reality. He talks now about rhetoric and he becomes almost a theorist of poetry and style, poetry and style. He goes on explaining a four. Nc goes on wondering what are the three styles of writing poetry and the, you know, because I have been mentioning some of them, you may recall the high style, the median style, the middle style and the low star.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       This style of comedy, the style of tragedy and the style of the allergy, the, the middle style of giant style. Uh, and he even suggests that style should never really be thought of as a pure ornamentation as some of us. Maybe we do what we think about side. So and so has style. You know, we all remember the phrase that the style is the man, right? The character. Uh, uh, but sometimes we say, well, that guy writes with style building that is Breo he has a particular gift in uh, uh, in, in putting, uh, putting together words and sentences. But then fissile two implies that style is really a mode of knowledge in the measure in which he says that there's a high style for high reality and the middle style for the middle reality, the mixed world, the Ela Jaya world, and then a low style for the comical.

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Well he did. He says that if you do want to understand those who are far below the fisherman for instance, or a the clowns, you cannot really give them the, treat them with the APP, that the whole room with which you treat the kings. So king speak differently with sublime kind of language. You see what I'm saying? So there is an idea that style becomes an instrument of knowledge. He goes on describing, uh, um, uh, uh, the, the, the theory of, um, uh, of the song, which is the, the greatest, uh, the greatest point, a critical form. And it's the song because he said we were bringing out the music of the language, the music, uh, Dante's responding is a little historical detail is responding to a poetic revolution that had taken place within, in Sicily at the core to Frederick. The second those, prior to that time, the province are poets would be writing, composing poetry and would, uh, uh, company their songs with dilute the famous, uh, province supports instrument.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       The Sicilians had divided those two modes. It was possible to write poetry, yeah. In and of itself without the accompaniment of music in the persuasion that the r two poetry was the effort to bring out the inherent harmony of the language. It talks to, discusses the song. He discusses the themes, what are the great themes and poetry, and alluded to that with Beltron. They're born because Dante says a bit on the bone was the greatest in writing a war poetry. Uh, the other themes. So of course our rectitude rectitude of the wheel, uh, there is to say a sense of the ethical, what are the ethical directions that one should take the direction of rectitude or really have the same, the same etymology, the, and then also love poems. So this is the way he, he proceeds, um, r and d defines poetry by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:14:07       He ends with a great definition of poetry. The poetry is that art that combines, uh, uh, music, uh, uh, the art of music, uh, and rhetoric together. And he ends there. Um, it's unfinished. I don't, we'll go on writing other things. So it's for instance, a philosophical texts. They bad ethics, which he also will leave and finished. And then we'll go on writing the political texts, the Monarchia, et Cetera when she finishes. Uh, so this is the preamble to where we are going to talk about today. Uh, and I think that the best way to begin is to tell you, since I'll be told me it's mainly about tragedy and language. I didn't want to tell you how much Dante retrieves over the devil. Got It. Opens. Yeah. For instance, and I'm not going to be be giving you a lot of details, but some, so that you can be persuaded about about this, uh, that this is really a deliberate pattern.

Speaker 1:          00:15:07       This is a deliberate retrospective view that he takes of his past, of a failure, of his own, of a certain way of, uh, why does one fair, what is so an accomplishable about a particular task that, uh, I'm using the words that Nimrod uses for his own tower of Babel, since you know that it was an, uh, I realize that it was an unaccomplishable task and I find myself using those words for Dantes earlier effort in writing on the Volcker time, but some, some, some connections between that treaties and, uh, and, and, and this lower the cantos of lower hair we've had, we've had the web, by the way, I haven't, we haven't talked about that and talk about this other cancers of the lower we are in the general radio fraud. You'd remember that, right? Uh, we saw violence now than we saw fraud.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       But if you're, if you recall, Ken to 11, where the map of the ethical map of inferno who had been given, none distinguishes between the sense of fraud and the sense of treachery, treachery subdivision of fraud, because fraud can be, uh, reiterations, falsify, or in general, uh, uh, flatters, et cetera. These are the treasury is a worse and that that's where we are now. We're in the Rome of treasury and treasuries. The treacherous sinners are those we engage in a deceptive violation of the trust others place in us. This is not necessarily true for fraudulent people. There's a project those we will can perpetrate a fraud or new without even knowing you or without even having anything to do with you. That question of treachery is different and implies a violation of what Dante calls the, the ratio of the bonds of love because implies friends, family, country hosts.

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       I think the, for instance, but Beth would be home to this type of, this the tragedy that will belong to this type of ethical judgment. I said the Eurasia of the bonds of love and nature. Uh, it is as if, as if, uh, the, the, the treasurer's sinners, I really, those who are in betraying the really betray nature itself, it is as if, uh, something is being said about the day or night late, all possible, uh, ties within a community within the self and others. Treachery is, uh, the, the, the language of, uh, nothing. Uh, it's a way of saying that matters, but no bond. There's no bond that I can, uh, I could feel an attachment to. So it's a, it's literally a severing of cells in the domain of a pure arbitrariness. I mean, this, I am above everything or I'm below everything.

Speaker 1:          00:18:09       It doesn't matter, but I certainly have no attachments to anything around me. So that's where we are. This is so much to say where we are in the context, but the connections with the, they will carry liquids. Yeah. I think that even the story of Ulysses can be read in the light of the, the got it. Okay. And so because it's a story of a tragic, uh, style, Dante had been describing the tragic style and, and uh, uh, the tragic style. And the failure of the tragic style, even the Canto, the successive can't have, we do the Montefeltro could be because it's, it's, it's literally the, the counterpoint, the rhetorical counterpoint to Ulysses is a story of it. The comical, the comical style. Uh, certainly Bertrand the Bourne is a figure who for the first time and now the second time appears in the devil.

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       Quincy and Dante has a great admiration for Burton, the newborns, a poetic heart. He says the Italians don't have, uh, the language of the porch of war, but the one who has a portrait war in modernity is Beltron the board. Clearly Dante has changed his opinion here. Uh, oh, he may admire Bertrand, they're born, but the dif, the strife, the divisiveness that his poetry fosters now sort of has, has made a victim, uh, of a, of him, but the were pound writes a great poem about Ezra pound, about puppets on the bone, but really keeping in mind more the bit of the bone or the devil a requirements here. Then, then the best from the board as far as I can tell of, uh, of in fairness. And we come to 10 to 29, uh, which is, uh, which I looked at that a little bit, but we'll come to Ken to theory for instance, and then painters deliberately.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       Now on the face of it, very little. There is very little here that has to do with it. They will get eloquence. But here he's talking about two experiences that define the tragic bode. One is look at this. So in the time being from Ken two 30 in the time when Juno was enraged because of similar, uh, the, the mistress of Jupiter against the feeble blood, as she showed once in the game after mass turned so insane, he's, he's really talking about the tragic text that divide, uh, the child where the gods themselves within the world, the classical world that gods themselves into have been said to be wounded by exactly the same mad passions that drive human beings to destruction. Yeah. This is Juno. Juno doesn't really die, but she will, she will, uh, she suffers the same passions. So there's a language here of the tragic, and let's call it the myth of boy, I can, I, it's a kind of a classical theology being tied to weather.

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       And then the story of the Trojans once again and feet, no fury of Thebes or Troy was Evan. So cruel against any et cetera. And then even further, um, on, on Canto 30 line 40, the story of mirror, uh, the young woman, um, who, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's a classical story. So it's also, it's an obedient story. The woman who is inflamed by passion, uh, incestuous passion, uh, and, and, and impersonate somebody else in order to be able to sleep with her are her father. So there is, this is a part of all, uh, uh, or, or over all this, this, uh, uh, tragic comic, call it tragic perimeter, but it, everything focuses on this story of sign on. I think I like this idea of sign on who is an impersonator in the falsify. You know, you don't really have to know a lot of Italian to know the dentist is really planning on the name.

Speaker 1:          00:22:09       See none, which means yes and no, uh, the very representation of the falsifications suffocation of personality, but it's so the tragic is tied to some sense of identity, uh, people who do not know exactly, and that's impersonation a human beings who may not know who they are and who may take on some kind of either figuration or the reality of somebody else. So it's, it's this idea of, uh, of, of, of an ambiguity already betrayed by, by the name. So the connection between madness and tragic. And let me move on to Canto, uh, 31, um, where Dante enters and now meets the giants, uh, clearly figuration and them an echo of the devil. Guardiola Quincy. This, uh, uh, and one of them is Nimrod. So this is really a deliberate reflection. Let me just read a little bit of, uh, this, uh, uh, online sixth and following where he Dante here, uh, some kind of sounds and every commentator of yours, mine certainly does, will tell you that, uh, uh, Dante's using just a, some gibberish, nobody knows what it means.

Speaker 1:          00:23:31       These are the words or fair. My Amex Zombie army began the savage mouth to cry for which no sweeter psalms, where am I leader towards him? It's stupid soul. Keep today Horn and vent myself with them. And with that, uh, when rage or other passion takes the search at Dinette bewilders hole and Asha find the strap that holds it tight, see how it lies across the great, they're great chest. Then he said to me, he is his own accuser. This is Nimrod through who's wicked device. The world is not, or one soul speech. Let us leave him there and not talk in vain. For every language is to him is his two others, which is known to none. We made our way, therefore farther on turning left and found the next, they're both sharp of savagery and larger, et cetera. He meets a number of other giants.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       Um, why does Dante, first of all mentioned giants? Both of the devil got quilts in here. What is really what is really the point of level Gordillo Quinn's. Yeah. Uh, there is a way in which the little better it liquids is written from the viewpoint of Nimrod's because what Dante wants to do something exactly like what Nimrod attempted neighborhood wanted to combine all the possible languages. That's what Baybou the confusion of the tongues comes about, was to combine, uh, to build the tower whereby human beings can reach heaven. And I said that it's really the other side of the incarnational word, the word that joins a heaven and earth one is one of the scent. The other one is the pride of a sense that Nimrod once, this is the giant ish. This is, it's his is a sin of sin. It's, it's a trait. It's a trait of his, of knowing things.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       He wants to occupy a kind of superior perspective. That's what is being a giant means, a superior perspective from which he can really see the whole of the world around him and then be able to transcend the world of contingency. This is the problem with, with, with Nimrod, this is what the Tower of Babel is about. And the theological answer is that you don't do this by pride. You really ought to do it by, uh, humility. Not but time to go up, but it buy, Eh, going down. What I'm really also saying, and we could talk about this, there's a connection between pride and perspective. Uh, so they even get an acquaintance. He's also a text of perspective is, do you know what I mean by perspective? Is What do we have Red Sofa perspective, we simply means the presence of viewpoints, various viewpoints, which ones I'm help managers spoke control.

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       I know all viewpoints in Tampa. This is the case. They were the, the, the whole, when Ferran was written, the perspective on styles. Dante uses all possible styles that have been exemplifying for you here as we discuss the poem he wrote where he uses the core three language and the cultural rhetoric. Oh, Francesca, the, the other court, the court, the legal court of peer peer delivering are the core to the, let's say the schools with Brunetto Latini. Uh, the language of the profits are, he uses old perspectives. It's, it's the whole, the whole of the divine comedy is such a perspective, a, a perspective. His story. Some of you might say, well, you really are using a language that doesn't belong to Dante's own culture. There will be a very legitimate objections because when we talk about perspective, we usually think about this is really that evolutionary language of 15th century art.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       You May, some of you may be art historians, you know, you may know that, um, though I could respond to you that actually there was a certain knowledge of perspective of prospective earlier than Dante. Nonetheless, even if they did not have a theory of perspective, which I'll explain in a moment, they had the practice of perspective in art, we usually speak of perspective in art and we usually link it with, for instance, a figure such as a Alberti. You know, you know who he is, this 15th century theorist of art who wrote a treatise called on painting, right? 1436 where he Altium literally theorizes that which other painters from job talk Dantes friend Dantes, they were together in, in Padua for years. We're done. That was in exile and, and, and, and, and Giotto was painting in the Scrovegni Chapel right there. So you could imagine they would be meeting, they knew each other, they were contemporaries.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       One is a year younger than the other. Uh, Dante is a year older and George <UNK>. Uh, so they, there was a practice or perspective what is perspective for, for, for uh, Alberti. It simply means the discovery that the mode of representation practiced in the Middle Ages really lacked depth, not only that, like depth and that somehow they believe that the world of appearance and the world of reality coincide. It perspective means that the world that I see shifts changes according to the position that I, the spectator occupy in the field of vision. I'm here and they're going to show you that I see things, I use it in their cannot see and vice versa. You see things that I cannot see. So the perception of reality changes according to the position we occupy. That's perspective. Not only that, it also implies the possibility of manipulation of the space that we witnessed.

Speaker 1:          00:29:44       We see this particular space. We can change it according to our, uh, uh, this according to the blows of, uh, of, of um, uh, the eyes, the position of the eye according to the hour of the day. I see things which are always different. So this is perspective and therefore the language of renaissance, uh, there's a called Quattrocento the 15th century changes, the whole medieval idea of representation where things were represented, the way they appeared and they say that's not true. We are never going to give the sense of the reality of things, but the appearance of things. So that's, that's really the great the difference. Dante uses this perspectivism, which I repeat really means a way of assembling various points of view in the persuasion that this is what really he has. He's in exile and 13, oh two, he has been traveling all over Italy and he thinks that he can go on forging the language, the vernacular language of Italy.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       He will go on. I mean, just to go back to say other things about the devil guided acquaints. I didn't say he would go on writing about the proximity of the, the romance languages. He invents this idea of romance languages. He says that the way in which French province, our Spanish Italian are connected together. He says it's one particle the way we use the sea. Uh, or will he talks about the province are the, you know, the uh, his uh, his uh, uh, they actually caused the say yes. They say arc. Uh, which I guess is when the other, when I had to make an affirmative statement. So he goes on talking about the, see the language of the c, the way, the language of the, no, this is what the families of languages are being built together. So Nimrod to go back to the text, the story of Nimrod and the story of Dante seems to be strangely that it costs, what is more, look at what he does.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       He, she is so the, the link with the devil kind of requests are just extraordinary. Even this line that everybody thinks it doesn't mean anything. Rafael, my yard Mech, Zombie army. If you look at it carefully, really going to tell you something, it is an imperfect, there's one letter anagram or the Hebrew line from the psalms in the reference to suite of psalms. Next will tell you that this Dante's really giving me the source, the lion and the psalm. Psalm 22 is Ellie, Ellie Lama Sabachthani. The fact that there is no exact respondents only means that the editors have missed the point that they should amend the text. So it would be an argument for textual emendation would like, that's something that the philologists are very careful about doing, but they always welcome possibilities. This is really, it's an amazing, so he's choosing Hebrew there because that's what he had said in the devil.

Speaker 1:          00:32:46       Got It. Laquinta Hebrew though this is an inverter, twisted language by the builder of the Tower of Babel, we are not supposed to understand it and yet behind all confusion, there is still something intelligible. That's the argument behind all twisted appearances of things. There, there is a residue of intellect, of intelligent, intelligible, uh, unintelligible message that is going to be given, uh, the, the what is, what are these words by the way, Ellie, Ellie, lamaze or back then it was, I, I, I can go in, right pass it very quickly in the belief that everybody will know. These are the words, psalm 22, the, they're the words that Jesus on the cross sites, father, father, why have you forsaken me? It's really big tragic moment or the moment of the crucifixion where the sun feels or is completely abandoned and that somehow the whole divine pray, the whole divine, uh, older is no longer responsive to him.

Speaker 1:          00:33:54       It's really the moment of the theological despair that we call it. Okay. And pantry. So that's now, uh, and that he is aware that if Nimrod, that's what he's done, I think is telling member of obliquely, had he not been so stupid, he would have known by using this kind of language, the way in which it would have been reaching heaven. You know, the, the, the way to have it is the way to go down into humility. And up through the building of the Tower of Babel and the confusion of tongues. And then there is this whole argument here, which I'm not going to go into work, but the, the confusion, the perceptual confusion perspective, [inaudible] is a far away and he mistakes the giants for towers reference to this famous town. There's still, if you go on the, on the, on, on, on, on the highway, uh, you can still see Montera Joan.

Speaker 1:          00:34:46       And that's, that's what Dante we're went by and he thinks that the giants have towers a question of perspective because in perspective, you learn that you see, according to the distance of the, the arrive from the object. This is the basic mathematics, the geometry, that rouge and sustains the, the theory of, uh, perspective. Uh, and then, uh, uh, it will continue, um, with, um, and let me just go on to a further case of, uh, this, uh, this question of, uh, of frustrated and I want to read through in with some care 33, uh, returned to Ken to 32 with more pursuing this line of references to the devil gather loquia answer. Look at his head. I the heart. It's the beginning of the text. Would you like to read? We read in from Canto 32 line one 12th Oh, I'm impressed. I didn't mean that. Uh, go ahead. Kent from Canto 32 line one to 12 in English one 12th

Speaker 2:          00:36:01       how do I the harsh grading rhymes that would be fitting for the small hole on like all the other rocks bear down. I would impress out more completely the staff with Mike but since I have not, since I have not, it is not without fear. I bring myself to speak, which we describe the bottom of all the universe is no enterprise to undertake in sport or for a tongue that pride mama or that and Babbo but may those ladies aid my first who aided amnion to wall and themes so that the telling may not be diverse from the fast opiod and all others misbegotten crowd who are in the place. It is hard to speak up better. Had you here been sheep or goats.

Speaker 1:          00:36:44       Thank you. Thank you. Okay here. This is a beginning that in many ways rehashes what last time I called the ineffability, Topo should remember at the beginning of Canto 28, Dante there is talking about the sublime. I Tova of Parotic, uh, I a vote of a inverted form of the sublime a saw the horror of what he was witnessing is such that he could not, he could not know that he could find the metaphors for it. This is now the deployment of a variant of that conceit. And they can sit here. Is that Dante's looking for a style? Yes. Perspective. There must be a unique style for this particular reality. And he start, I cannot go on using the language of familiarity. I have to use the bat boy, Mama the language of a child because this is just there, the treasurer souls who have betrayed first of all family.

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       So there is, that is a sort of a tragic resonance even at on that little motif. This cannot be done in the ordinary familiar language of every day because this sinners have indeed betrayed all of that. No. Uh, I can probably be done at all because I'm aware and how he could he not be in this area of treachery and fraud, that words and deeds do not necessarily belong together. I'm only paraphrasing the techs. So, uh, a search for style, which he understands as a form of what is convenient, what is decorous, where it's appropriate. That's the metaphor he uses. It's better if it were an argument of little guard Eloquii answer the principle of convention and convenient area in Latin and the convenience with a particular language over when one is dealing with a particular reality. And, and, and, and the further problem of what kind of style do I had is there, is it, can I get, in order to represent this kind of world, he appeals to anthem and the building of themes, once again, this is a tragic story of themes and the Blakely, he's also appealing to something that he himself has written since [inaudible] is the poor to move stones, but the power of his language I aversion of, of, of Orpheus.

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       Who plicate tames the, the savage beasts within the heart within us. Uh, he's, he's wants to be a kind of Ambien. The fact is that he has written stony rhymes. He has written, he's moving. It's a, it's a sort of retrospective view that he takes. He's, he's, he's, he thinks that the only kind of a style adequate to this reality is the style of the crazy poems. They're presenting that crazy time of his life for this lady of stone who change would change him into stone. We an allusion to this appeared in the Canto of the Medusa in Canto nine of in fairness. So that that's really, it begins with this, the search for a particular style and uh, uh, Dante, we'll go on, uh, uh, through this, uh, uh, this, this kind of, this, this whole, whole world of further into the frozen ice in us of health is not fire burning fire.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Uh, and now that's how the Canto and, and we start with the next candle. We had already left him a land line one 22, when I saw two frozen too frozen in one hole so that the one head was a hood to the other. And as bread is devoured for hunger. So, you know, we're approaching the most, to me, the most unbearable scene of, of, of inferno, that Canada cannibalization, human being cannibalizing, literally eating the other. I know that some of you may have your sense of your taste is, can be different. To me, this is really the worst possible representation. Tragic representation here. The one above satisfies teeth in the other, at the place where the Brain Jones, the nape, tedious node, the temples of [inaudible] posts for rage, justice he was doing with a score. And the other parts, oh, thou who buys will be still a token shows the hatred against him that he just tell me that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       Cause I said on this agreement, if thou his reason in dye complaint against him, I knowing who you are and what his sin shall, yet the required the in the, um, in the world evolve. If this tongue I talk with being naught, whether it, so we're approaching a moment where literally silence envelops or possible or presentations, there's something that nothing, not old can be all too at the sayable say something that escapes the Sayable, Eh, it's, it's that boundary and that boundary that Dante places us. So, uh, this is, uh, you know where it is. I have to read this, uh, this exchange. I will read it in and then we try to comment on it. I wish you could have a discussion about this. This canto that sinner are actually the Italian really begins. Uh, that's the, the, the sentence structure of the English wouldn't allow, it begins with a mouth that occupies the primary place in the line.

Speaker 1:          00:42:40       And Italian is Lubbock the mouth. Some of the object is, is, uh, uh, is, is primary here in English, of course, to the sinner lifted his mouth from the savage meal, wiping it on the hair of the head he had wasted behind then began that will have me renew desperate grief, which even to think of already rings my heart before I speak of it. But if my words are to be seed to the maybe fruit of infamy to the traitor, I know that she'll see me speak and weep together. If we had time. And I were to ask you whether this lines remind you of anything in particular. I'm sure some of you would immediately jump and tell me. These are clearly an echo of very good, in fairness, five Francesca's language. The language of love has become now the language of hatred because from the point of view of arena, and that's part of his tragedy.

Speaker 1:          00:43:52       He can't tell them apart. He does not know what love is and what hatred is. And he can exchange one for the other. And here we are. You could even argue that retrospectively, the language of love, Francesca, maybe it was also the language of hatred, but you would be pushing it beyond the limits of, of bill livability. I think that Dante is really, uh, echoing that Francesca, uh, and the love and the romance with Paolo in order to explain this hatred. And that's the, the blindness of all Golino and I use the word, um, uh, deliberately. No, that's, that isn't all what he lacks is any perspective on himself and on the world at island him. So, uh, it then continues that are, I ain't know, I know know who that hard. No, but what means that has come down here. But indeed that seems to me Florentine when I hear the, the focus is on language language here, which is a part of one managing to first of all, no the other and understand the other, they may know the inflections of the dialect, the Florentine dialect and they may even think that indeed and Dante's has allowed to say that if we've got a real quick idea about the question of uh, the dialects and they in the, in the instances that they can communicate in effect, there's no possible communication between the two of them.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       If I were to define for you the, the rhetorical czar that Dante Diprose here is that of what we call a dramatic monologue. Uber Reno goes on speaking and therefore he expects nor does he get any response from his interlocutor. He's a parent. Interlocutor a dramatic monologue when he goes home telling us the story of his life, the way he sees it. You know, you all know 19th century dramatic monologues in English literature, right? If not mean that this is an occurrence of that genre. I can speak. I can tell you, I can go on fictionalizing myself and I believe that my perspective or the way I fictionalized myself will become your reality. And Dante entices of course, Uber Reno to do exactly that. This cause this is exactly, this is the way in which you are in hell, where you go on really believing that whatever you tell that you can go and telling stories and the save yourself, deceive yourself, that others are going to believe what you were saying, that you will.

Speaker 1:          00:46:36       The reality that you're going home and constructing is everybody's accepted reality. This is one of the issues clearly that we were going to confront thou art to know that I was counting to greener. This is the archbishop for Jerry. What an extraordinary line. And what makes this extraordinary is first of all, the occurrence of what do we call, attributes, titles. And then the shift in verbal tense. Who Will, you know, we'll go on, uh, attributing time. I was con count to Galena and this is there is to say the object of his say hatred is unalterable is timeless. And that object of his hatred is exactly what goes on. Defining him, right? I time belongs to me. I know that I belong, I have a history, there is a history behind me and there is, and this one here, the re fied object to my hatred is unchanging.

Speaker 1:          00:47:43       I should bishop [inaudible]. So there is that, the secular and the sacred if you wish, welds and Gib liens with the idea that uh, or you know, had really betrayed the side. It was a world's becoming a Gerbil in a given him became my wealth and so on. So, uh, the, the, the recapitulation of all the infernal satanic since we have seen so far. Uh, and then how bout how by means of his evil? I shall tell thee now why I am such a neighbor to him. What another extraordinary line because it's, uh, uh, you know, the idea of what a neighbor is, right? Uh, and awkward, but the neighborhood has become, uh, this, this is the way, uh, neighbors can liberalizing are cannibalizing one cannibalizing the other. Um, um, hub. How by means of his evil devices, confiding him. I was taken and then killed.

Speaker 1:          00:48:43       There is no need to tell pat what thou canst not have learned. That is how cool was my death or shall hear and shall know if he's done me wrong. And he tells the story that he was a prisoner in a tower. We are meant to and understand all the, the languages of the other Towers Tower, which isolates him as a tower in Piza. But the way it's really the tower, this is, has nothing to do with this, but I find it irresistible. If you read the Cantos of Ezra pound, some of the most extraordinary poetry of his, uh, I think comes from when, when he was declared the traitor. Um, in, in the aftermath of the Second World War, he was put in a cage, not too far from this tower of Pisa, which is really one of the most beautiful part. It's near the school or North Malin Piza and a, and he writes his poetry about the tower that he sees.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       Clearly his own sense of trying to understand what treasury, uh, really means. Um, and, and I, what I'm really saying is these are issues that keep being present in the consciousness of, of, of some of the leading imaginative figures of our time. So he goes into this little, the, the, um, the tower of the hunger as it is called, and we'll shut up. I had already shown me through it, slit several moons when I had the bad dream, which rent for me the veil of the future. So we are dreams that, uh, uh, he has a dream and the mistake he makes is to think that the dream is going to be real. And the dream is this. This men appear to me as a master and Lord hunting the wharf and the Welsh, uh, the, the world wealth comes from Wolf, a wolf and Gibbons and the mountains for which the pieces cannot see Luca with hounds lien train the Nigga, he had sent it Valon the, it's sort of when I woke.

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       So he has this idea of, of destruction, the mutual destruction, so the wolf, et cetera. When I worked before morning, I heard my children who were with me crying in the sleep and asking for bread that were cool indeed, if the grievous not now thinking what my heart for boded and if that will not at what the style ever weep. So they were not awake and are they are now awake. And the, our approach when a food used to be brought to us and ditch was afraid because of his dream and the herd below the door of the horrible tower nailed up, which I looked in the faces of my sons with that as a word, I did not weep. I saw turned to stone within. They wept. And Motherwell. Anselm said, by the way, uh, to understand how there is a counter, there's a sort of of of movement between the horror of this tragedy and the tenderness, the pathos of it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:48       One of the ways in which dentists suggests this is the use of diminutives for and said Mucho. Ah, this a little kid that he has this kid that Lucas so farther what? Trustee at data shed? No tears. No answer. The whole day. No. That night after till another son came fourth in the world, as soon as the little ray made its way into the dough for prison and the discerned in four phases of my own look, I bet both hands for grief and they thinking I did it from a desire to eat rose up suddenly and said, father, it would be far less paid for us if that eat of us thou the disclosures with this wretched fresh and our strip us of it. I calm myself then not to make them more unhappy that day in the next we stayed or silent are hard. Earth what is done not open.

Speaker 1:          00:52:43       When we had come to the fourth day, God to throw himself out stretched in my feed saying my father, why does that now? No, I don't think it's farfetched. If I were to ask you two over here behind this question of one of the children exactly the neck of the prayer of Jesus on the cross that we heard a few that we read a few canters back. So there is a way in which the violence inflicted on Galina's children seems to repeat or reenact the great drama of the Christian sacrifice. Right. Cause he are now on are also crucified. In fact there he died and the store sees me. I so the three drop one by one during the fifth day in the six therefore I gave myself now blind. That's what it is. The lack of perspective is he's nothing. He did a four has no distance from anything?

Speaker 1:          00:53:49       No. Can he tell things are part of distinguish things, one from the other two grouping over each and for two days called on them after they were dead. Then fasting had more power than griefs and extraordinarily ambiguous line because you really do not know what he's saying according to a role there. For instance, we'll go around making a statue of this. They said the at the Moma and you can go and see that the story is that of a, that reno 80 his own church. Then fasting had more power than grief. I yielded to the appetizer the urging of a, of hunger more than grief. Or maybe he's saying just something else. Maybe he saying then fast and had more power than grief. I really died of fasting for hunger rather than for the grief. We don't know. And I think that part of the charge it bode that Dante is starting to conveys to us is that we are left and this is by the way a board has a reading book, has rights, nine uh, lectures on Dante.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       What else? Realizing the importance or number nine for the antis nine lectures on that. And one of them is on the story of who Reno and he says he actually wants us to live. He wants to leave us in suspension to believe that it's possible that he may have been eating the children, but maybe it's just the sensibility of so many critics have been offended by the suggestion that he actually could go on a candy, buys him his own children. And I think that book is is right that we are not supposed to be able to tell apart that that ambiguity of that line is never going to be quite uh, resolved. It's going to be forever there, but the most important element of this tragic occurrence and the Dante, before I go on, let me just say a rps or Dante goes on into an apostrophe gaze.

Speaker 1:          00:55:57       Piza again with this language of now he's talks, he breaks the silence ips, shame of the peoples of the fair land where sounds the C and other little touch of another little echo of the day, we'll gather, equate this to say in the moment where he's dealing with treasury, which I call the most nihilistic of all sins because you really declared no and any bond that you may have with others he uses. And that the irony is to me, glaring the affirmative particle is if there's any possible affirmation, there is none. We're sounds this, see since they neighbors are slow to punish the makeup, right? Django Gona shift and put a bottle of Nando's mouth, so the drown every soul in thee. This is really the kind of language that all reno himself at youth when before the consummation of the tragedy, he really begs the the earth or an earthquake that the earth may open up and swallow or all of them here.

Speaker 1:          00:57:00       Dante's using the exactly the same land. The idea that's so horrifying is the spectacle that he has been. The tragic spectacle has been witnessing that the whole world here. That could be an apocalyptic ending to the work. But to go back to the the, the, the key issue, there may not be time for a discussion today and I apologize, but the real tragic event though, what is the tragic event other than, okay, what if we go, Leno had the name of betraying the strongholds. Thou should not have put his children to such torment. So this has been the crucifixion of innocence, their youthful years, thou new Thebes besides the new themes and new three by we have been witnessing now made them innocent or drone and regard and the other tool named already in my song, this is really the tragic, Dan has been using other tragic language indeed that he had been hoping and theorizing in the Devil Valley rockets and then they move on. But what is the really tragic occurrence, the tragic occurrences in the very presence of the Christological language in this camp. Because the sacrifice of the cross means one thing and one thing only

Speaker 1:          00:58:18       that now all violence is finished and something because we have found the, the, the scape goat, the voluntary scape goat who goes around saying, oh, we're all innocent and that he is the guilty one. That's how we are declared. That's how we are redeemed. That's why we are, we are, we are made innocent once again, right?

Speaker 1:          00:58:42       But this story here, reenacting and echoing the story of the cross seems to say the futility since to announce that utilities, that sacrifice retrospectively says that that sacrifice too was just one of the senseless act of violence that has happened that have happened in history and the punctuate human history. Of course, this is not the end of the poem, but it's the most desperate part of the poem because Dante comes to believe that the hole that they, the law of, of, of, of history, that the law of the is really a tragic claw and there's something absolute about it and not, and not quite escapable. We shall see how he's going to move through this. And I really have to go into cantillatory for, um, so a little bit, I would not say too much this time. Can two, three, four, we're Dante meets Satan.

Speaker 1:          00:59:40       So the encounter with Satan is first of all that which gives incredible coherence to the whole movement of in federal. It was, as you remember, the story of inferno began with the neutral ingroups. Those who had been sitting, uh, watching the spectacle of the disruption of the customers, the neutral angels at the time of the, uh, Lucifer's rebellion of, of, against God. And now it ends with Lucifer. So it's really as a kind of angelic, a cosmic proportion. The other thing that I have to say is that if you imagine those of you who are readers of Milton and paradise lost, if you, and you know how what a brilliant rhetorician, uh, Satan Lucifer is in, uh, in, in paradise lost, you'll be disappointed. In fact, the Tsl and who writes a comment about this, as I said, he says, I really recommend the first time readers of the divine comedy to skip Canto 34.

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       Because it's strange that Lucifer Satan doesn't speak, and that was exactly the point that I'm sorry to say TSL. It at this time really had probably has never read that they will get it look answer then re he's not supposed to speak because it's one of the angels who really do not use the human language, but more importantly because he represents evil, defeat defeated from this point of view. Can Two, three, four stands in radical sharp contrast to canter, 33 in Cantata retreat. We sort, we have witnessed the sovereignty of evil. It is as if it were all in golfing and hovering over all of reality here. Now we witness exactly the opposite, how Satan becomes a rarefied dumb object and actually an instrument for the pilgrims are sent. It's going through the body of Lucifer that the pilgrim can go on and the guide and Virgil can turn themselves upside down and finally reemerge to the light.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       The rest of the canto good. I think that we're going to have a few minutes, but I have to say something about the rest of the cancer. The rest of the canned who deals with the cosmological argument and the cosmological argument is, uh, where does purgatory come from? And Dante gives an extraordinary events, a poetic myth and the poetic meter he events is that when Lucifer Fair at the time of the grant are angelic disruption, right? The first rebellion against, uh, against the deity, the earth retreats out of fear at the approaching of this a, this, a fallen angel and re-emerges on the other side of the hemisphere, the southern hemisphere. That's the beginning of purgatory. But you see the connection from an evil act, the chances of redemption, how in effect in Dante's cosmos, there is nothing which cannot be utilized, no evil, which can not be utilized to the ends of the gut.

Speaker 1:          01:02:47       Uh, everything they're real defeat of evil is when that itself can become the stepping stone over the threshold of evil itself in order to reach the purgatorial island. The last little detail that I will tell you is I asked you to read the last line of Canto through you like this. It's a little detail that you're like, I hope, uh, uh, the last line of, uh, of, of [inaudible], uh, is a, a queen. Do she, Maria, let's Lasalle Italian and therefore we came out to see once again, the stars. Just a little detail to, uh, remind you about the extraordinary love of symmetry in Dante's porn, right? That each canticle we'll end with that same word, Stella, Stella, stars, Stars and stars. There is to say each canticle ends with us looking up, reminding us of where we are and still longing for the stars so I can come to a little in a hurry. I have reached the end of the, of inferno purgatory now and then see if there are questions.

Speaker 3:          01:04:07       Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:04:08       Can you say a little bit more about almost like a, a total perspective through his construction of the various languages from seeing different forms of Italian and trying to get an all encompassing perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:04:26       The question is, can I say more? Good question and the question is, can I say more about how Dante is trying to construct our users total perspectives and you mean both in the end here? Yes. Thank you. Because in effect, I was hoping someone would ask me this question because I really didn't, did not tell you how this the devil got it. Acquaints is completed here and why couldn't Dante complete? They will carry liquids here. When he wrote a tract, when he wrote a tract, he wanted to unify, you know, he believed that they are the dialects, 14 dialects in Italian. He had knowledge, he recognizes 14 directs, he knew some of them very well and he wanted to make a eh, a unified language. Out of that it kind of artificial language assault of let's call Italian experimental, you know, something that you could bring together and what he was lacking.

Speaker 1:          01:05:29       So much so that they are those scholars who work on who have been working, I don't agree with that is that almost Dante seem to have a kind of, um, seem to be in agreement with uh, uh, the so called, um, um, uh, uh, logicians those who have, uh, uh, kind of, uh, the, the, the idea that language has assault of a, let's say a Cartesian linguistics as a kind of, uh, of rational, a rational structure to it and that can be really remade. The point is that when he writes to the level, got it. [inaudible] this is true. I don't buy the idea that he's following the logicians of the, the, the Middle Ages. They are Marion's we're really legit ones. But he did it lacked was a historical sense and the little detail that he brew was still the surviving language from the creation of man to our own time because, and he had a good theological argument for that because it would be inconceivable that the redeemer of the world would use a language other than the language that had been employed by, by Adam.

Speaker 1:          01:06:38       When he comes to Paradise, the divine comedy, he completely changes view in Paradiso. 26 says, I'm going to tell you that. He says, no, no. He builds, appeared with, uh, immediately after Adam fell with the fall of Adam from the garden. There was no longer the primal language. And he goes on elaborating the idea that God does not use any language, but the language of this is to say human beings have the letters and syllables of God's language. It's not Hebrew. It's not Latin. It's not Greek. It's not whatever, uh, slow Chinese. It's that really the, uh, we are the syllables. That's Dante's idea. Policies of 20, 26. So this was the, that's the, the, the, the real change. What had, what does it mean in terms of divide of the of the inferno is that he had understood that in order to write about a unified language, he had to descend.

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       Now he could not go on the tower and from their watch or the the the qualities aesthetic. What is the sweet, what is the Worldcom language and what is the less welcome, the harsh language. What are the sounds that he really should be applying and adopt in two Italian, but he didn't understand that in order to have a unified language, you have to descend into the political realities of the, of, of this cities. That's why, that's the difference between the, they will get an acquaintance and the lower in fairness, a sense of history. That's really the difference. And to see this and the sense of different, and you can be in a tower as who greeneries and be blind or you can be in a tower like Nimrod is and do not even what you're talking about. You know, who didn't go on completely reversing, messing up and confusing the Hebrew that he, he should have known. You understand what I'm saying? So that's really the difference between the two. Good question was that it allowed me to focus on a detail that I probably didn't explain. Very, very cool.

Speaker 5:          01:08:36       I don't understand how he could have said that. Died the fall.

Speaker 1:          01:08:42       You're on, said why? I don't understand how Dante could, could make that statement. Is that what you're saying? He said, yeah, that's, uh, I don't think that there are any traces of Adam's language. Uh, the, the, the question is why it's a sort of a predicament and I don't know if it, uh, he, he says he doesn't quite understand the why, how Dante could say that Hebrew died with the fall of man. Um, uh, that's what he, Adam will tell him. He, there, he meets, had them, there is another port because he's the one who names the world. Where did the scripture, the scripture nor in Hebrew scriptures or you know, uh, the language of Jesus for instances, Aramaic, we have to be careful about what kind of, uh, uh, the kind of, uh, uh, is that Adam's language or is that the language? Is the language, the changes in time, that's all. That's all he's really saying. That the new testament that in Aramaic for instance, which is a dialect.

Speaker 5:          01:09:53       Yes. So, so this, this goes

Speaker 2:          01:09:56       back a little bit to the, uh, to the last lecture, but, um, looking back over the entirety of, of inferno, it seems like Dante expresses different levels of, of I guess, uh, sympathy or pity for the people who are trapped in, in, in certain circles of hell, especially for the sellers of discord. And then later in, in other cases, like at the end of the 10 to 33, he's happy to be a churl to someone who's on being, being tormented.

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       Oh yes. What's up?

Speaker 2:          01:10:29       And, um, I, I just, it's, it's interesting though, the, um, the really the different relationship that, um, that Dante has, uh, to the different reactions. He has these punishments, given that he's essentially created all of them, that, that, that in front of is supposed to be a representation of divine justice, but it teams like overall. Dot. Hayes, the judge and executioner here. Given that the whole, how sincere leaders does Dante believe in this? In this divide.

Speaker 5:          01:11:02       I think he's in this, in the divide between himself as as this,

Speaker 2:          01:11:07       right? Or who can feel pity for the different, for the people trapped in different areas of how vs. Dot. Hay as as sort of the, the, I mean in some sense he's the creator of all of this. It was just sign everyone to each level of how, I know this is a broad thing, but I, I kind of wanted to see some, some comment on on that. Dubai, how sincerely used to submission to him.

Speaker 1:          01:11:34       The question is, since Dante is a Dante, the pilgrim has different responses to the figures whom he has created. Sometimes he's tender and sympathetic, sometimes he just kicks them. As far as that's the scene. You are referring to a and they're all his creations. How sincere is he in his vision? Um, okay. This one's is that I would formulate it a little bit differently, but you know that that's fine. Yeah. We agreed that Dante has is not the indifferent spectator to all of them and nothing that what matters to him most is to show a degree of passionate involvement with whoever they may be. He's not going to be sentimentalize about all of them are for a number of reasons. It's very sentimental with his teacher. Uh, I think he's really very sarcastic with peer. The Levenia whom you remember, he marks that language of is the contrived the I thought he thought.

Speaker 1:          01:12:36       I thought that's not Dante's language. That's really because they're living his own poetry that Dante picking up. I think that he is very, he has a sense of pathos. It may be is also seduced by Francesca Francesca. You can put this pastor that she is trying to seduce him as well as she said, users or let's powerless and use said use when it comes further down, the, the, the relationship is no longer a relationship of, uh, of, uh, this tenderness of forms. Now there is really anger, anger at what an extraordinary horror or what human beings can do. And there's not nothing Dante calls the fraud. They seem peculiar to men that human beings, they seem peculiar to human beings because they are, they have a reason that becomes part of their premeditation, part of their machinations of evil. And I find that that, uh, uh, uh, repulsion he has, I find that I'm very dramatically speaking, very convincing, very convincing.

Speaker 1:          01:13:49       Uh, it's still part of the judgments that he's making and it's not an attenuation at all of that judgment. The, the anger with which attacks Piza that, that idea that he speaks prophetically there. Why is this whole place disappearing? This is, I think that to me is, you say it's sincere. I wouldn't be using that language, but I think that it's dramatically very powerful. Uh, and that'll roof. Who would agree that, that probably the best way of referring to this term, to the, the th two. Describe the, this, uh, this situation. Would you agree? I find it, I find it dramatically very apt. It's a, because it's a consequence of the genuine horror. You imagine. I mean, you had the earlier, even diviners with a shape, a human shape twisted the head turns around. Uh, uh, then, uh, uh, the alchemists, uh, uh, also representing the kind of twisted forms.

Speaker 1:          01:14:52       It's this twisting of the human image, uh, and this and the reality of what human beings can do. Uh, an ongoing, and this says hatred has taken over. I think that is approaching them too. There is a way in which I was saying he echoes w w [inaudible] when Orino says, you know, on earth, why then was there an earthquake and which would swallow everything. I mean the, the, the language of the Itar, the cannibal, so to speak. And then Dante just says on why is there some, some kind of great, uh, uh, uh, drowning of all this wire on the islands just moving and just, and be a barrier so that the whole town will go under. I think that there is a way in which he's almost doing the same thing. So that's it almost a reenacting the kind of a sense of nothingness that [inaudible] had shown to him.

Speaker 1:          01:16:01       But obviously he does not agree with two Golino and no, it's not that there is a kind of a complete, uh, identification with them. And how do we know that this is not going to be the case? He's writing reasons. The poem is what rescues Dante from yielding to the temptation of absolute despair and therefore distinguishes him. It distinguishes own temporary impulse for nihilism with the nihilism that distinguishes, characterizes all the centers and the Volvo, the treasurers souls. Okay, but maybe we should stop here. We're going to talk about something so much more serene purgatory next time.
