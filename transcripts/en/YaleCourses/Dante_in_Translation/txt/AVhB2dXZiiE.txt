Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Last time we looked at the, at the Canto of Canto 15, or in fair nor the Canto of Brunette told the teacher of Dante's teacher and the teacher or the Florentines. And we, um, and we pointed out the, the, the rhetoric of the cancer after all Burrito is a master restoration. Uh, so it was quite appropriate. The dantes account of his meeting with his teacher will be carried out through a careful, very careful, uh, highlighting of the ambiguities of language. The way language is used very carefully to mean one thing for one order experience grenade, toes for instance, anthropocentric political understanding of the world. And then, uh, Dante, his own understanding of the world, which we could call theological, but it really means, uh, the point of view of someone who is cresting, who is moving and who will move beyond a Brunette. And how a language oscillates the same words seem to acquire different meanings in those different contexts.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       And in many ways that language, it would become the language that rhetoric, which should be the instrumental persuasion and agreement becomes in and of itself the cause of two of misunderstandings between them. Between master and uh, and disciple. Uh, but, uh, the, the candle Burrito for all of its, uh, the intensity and poignancy over personal, uh, confrontation of, of a, of a disciple who meets his teacher. And the many ways shows even there there's a sort of great deal of ambivalence, a great deal of acknowledgement or recognition of the importance of Brunette was teaching on him. But at the same time, uh, assault of distance taking leave, taking from a, uh, that teaching that too though for its private took quality. The quality of the great humanistic values of, uh, are acknowledging, uh, uh, the teaching that shows the way to how main makes himself eternal.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       That is says anthropocentric. It can be that kind of, uh, of, of, of, uh, aphorism in a way, which is, which is the way Dante, uh, seals the personality of Rachel. And yet it always had or actually has as always this, this, this exploding personal encounters doing Dante a political focus. It was something a little bit larger than their own private story. It is the encounter between them was placed within the crisis of Florence, uh, the CTO, Florence, the divisions between wells and get bylines. And then there's also the announcements, uh, to Brunette to, to Dante Bible rate to that he is going to go into his going to end up, uh, in, in, in exile that the comfort, uh, the human bonds, the comfort of the city and family and whatnot, even that will be denied to him, uh, for Burrito. Of course, there is also strategy of, uh, uh, thinking that Dante's own experience is, it's really the mirror image of his own.

Speaker 1:          00:03:49       Because as you remember, and I said this at the beginning of my remarks last time, Brunetto all's experiences, Eh, exile as he was in, Ron says, Val, uh, the, the, the classical place of the most traumatic experience in medieval history. The, the, the place where the Paladin roll on a Orlando in Italia Roma, uh, and, and the Carolingian drama, the Charlemagne soldiers are the fitted and Brunetto. That's where he, he, that's how he views his own defeat in the, uh, in the city of Florence. So there was always a public focus and the public focus was not just a context for their relationship, but they, it, it was really a way of shedding light on the very nature of their own divisions. Uh, it is as if, uh, the oscillations of language that they experience in the exchange between them are really consequences. Also have larger divisions, uh, larger suspicions that this, uh, characters living in Florence entertain told each other.

Speaker 1:          00:04:57       I mentioned that because I'm going to move today to Canton 19. We've taken quite a jump. We went through 16, we saw the flight on the back of Jerry and some, some, some, uh, adumbration got fried on the back of [inaudible], uh, uh, can to 17. If you were to read it on your own. It's an extraordinary cantor. It's the only time that virtual leaves Dante alone. And Donna has to, uh, uh, mean there the, the, the usual hours. And he had, and it is as if, uh, he had to be left without any guidance. It is if he hit to discover bite himself and by his own powers or what those temptations are and what the implications of usually it would be for him. And, and there may be a biographical biographical resonance there in the sense that, uh, a neuron with a poet as edging toward the, the, the condition of the user are engaged in the illusory recreation's illusory productions, but also at biographical, a reference to, to Dante's own father who was engaged in that sort of, um, of activity.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       And then we go through a Kantar 19, which is really the cancer I want to talk about now. And that's the point of my remarks about medical situations of what I said about, about Brunetto. I'll takes a public voice, not only takes it so you have a, uh, an experience of the shifts in his own voice. So you do know the kind of romance atmosphere in the encounter with, uh, uh, with, with Francesca, uh, you do have the kind of, uh, the seminar like tones that he uses in the encounter in limbo with the poets of antiquity, where he, they go on talking about art. And the secrets of the craft, et Cetera. Now Dante takes what? A headset. I do not hesitate to call a prophetic voice if pub he plays. Now he sees himself as a public role. They shift all the, the, the change that departure from, uh, the political rhetorical tone, uh, used and they, and they encounter with, uh, with Kurento could not be more vocal north, be sharper, more radical.

Speaker 1:          00:07:23       This is, uh, uh, this is, uh, uh, an argument now that engages him as a public figure as it were indeed as a profit. So what does it mean to be a prophet for Dante? What kind of, how can one take on this sort of, uh, of, of voice? How does one go on? How does it profit? A talk like a one thing that you make, you want to keep in mind is I go on to understand this candle is a, if clearly the pattern for all of this, the model to be the prophetic voice in the Bible, the biblical prophets, and do not make a mistake of thinking for a moment that profits are those who are foretell the future. That's not really their role. In fact, Dante goes out of the way, and I'm not going to talk about that, but really they haven't got time and can to 20, uh, highlighting the differences were between prophets and diviners, the diviners or those who for tail predict the future.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       So if the profits do not foretell the future, what do they do? They are literally readers of the present. This is the point for Dante. The Biblical prophets are those who read the present history in its unfolding from the perspective of what they perceive to have been God's promise to Israel and to them. So the profits are in a way and that not, I don't say this in any way to, to uh, to degrade them, but I, on the, on the contrary, to highlight the importance of the intervention into the presence that you could call them as commentators. Those who are in the true sense of the word, those who remember, that's what a commentator is a commentator is, it's an exercise of memory, a way of bringing ancient memories to bear on the present. That's the way Dante understands the prophetic prophetic voice. And Nether little detail before we go on with the Canto.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       You do not know. Some of you may know that that actually is a writer of many epistles. He was a letter writer. We do not know the letters he wrote on behalf of his patrons, but we do know the letters that he wrote in his own name. And he would be a writing letters that the array of which is, uh, can be sometimes moving. Uh, for instance, when he writes to a friend, uh, he would like to attend the funeral of his friend's wife and cannot, he said practically begging because he doesn't have the adequate clothes to go to the funeral, introduce him. So he's clearly begging for some kind of assistance. But he writes also letters that probably never reached the destination. He wrote letters, for instance, to the Italian cardinals who were, uh, in conclave. You, you understand what I'm saying? What I mean when I say conclave, the conclave, it means that they are shut on the key and kept in some place where they can make decisions about electing from within themselves or from the outside a pope.

Speaker 1:          00:10:31       And they could not agree about whom to choose. So he writes a letter, a letter to the Italian cardinals, and he begins the letter are addressing them as in perhaps all of you will wonder who is this man who gives him the authority to say, to speak to us and address dressers and spur us on to action that's in here. Remember, this is Dante speaking and attributing this thoughts to the cardinals. They are the possible objection to the intervention of a layman's voice within sacred things fast. He remember the lesson of the Biblical prophet, which he doesn't mention. Uh, the name is mentioned, who on seeing the arc of the, of the alliance being carried into, into the city of Jerusalem and seeing the are tottering. He stretches his hand, trying to protect it to, to, to make sure that it won't collapse and break into pieces and God intervenes and, and through lightening and four minutes and man kills him.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       So Dante's aware of the danger of taking on. That's the point. He goes home, say spring them. So I'm not really touching the ark and Brady spring, the oxen who are not going anywhere. Let's see the absence of the letter, but this does not concern us here. But the point of concerns as here is that in the background to this canto where he takes on the prophetic voice, he's aware of the possible profit nation that he's engaged in, in addressing as he does the so called symbolists, it's time to get into the Canto of the so called symbolists who are the similes, uh, in fact that we just saw, I was just reading this little story, the sisters of, of joys that I have been reading that before. But I know that that is really a story of, I don't know how many of you are English, uh, uh, students and students of English literature, but he writes these stories about, so two 20, early 20th century version of, uh, of Simonia.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       And if someone of you might want to write a paper, uh, connecting, uh, the sisters, this beautiful gem of a story by [inaudible] and Canton 19, you can, and you see the differences that they are, uh, that the, between the two of them, the similar lists are of the followers. It's, it's a, it's a word. Uh, like we said, they're machiavellians. For instance, our followers of Machiavelli's those who think like Machiavelli, the Simone is, are the followers of Simon who was called a mongoose or a sorcerer or a magician. Simon Simon. And actually we call this phenomenon when you have a name that gives, sort of creates a trend or a way of thinking, it's called an EP on him. I thought that you might from the Greek [inaudible] him, this is an Simoni Simoni of the photos is uh, Simon, uh, the magician. So it's Dante is beginning the story, um, with a reference to a founding event in the constitution of the church, goes back to the acts of the apostles were there is this story that of, of a sourcer men engaged in witchcraft in illusions.

Speaker 1:          00:14:04       Simon who wants to buy the gift of prophecy and the power of making miracles from Peter, and therefore then he challenges him to, or let's see who can fly, et Cetera, and then they go up on a tower and tied to fry Simon. Of course, we'll go down and we'll die. What Dante's doing? He's now encountering the popes of his own time. Nicholas the fifth bone, if it's the eighth, one of the great minds, great jurist, by the way. Uh, in fact, there are those storylines who really think that Dante is, is a dead mouse in him. That you know, there's some something personal that we, we can't quite see bone if it's the eighth and Clement, the sixth, the fifth, I'm sorry, the three popes and whom Dante lived, who are engaged in say money. What is symphony? It's a sacrilege. Symphony is the act exactly like Simon in the acts of the apostles who wanted to buy the gift of prophecy.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       It is a sin whereby one can go on in making commerce of sacred things and thereby engaging in blast. For me. The question then is, what does Dante thing this hate crime is? It's a constant theme in his, uh, in his reflections is a constant theme of his thoughts. Uh, what is the sacred, how do we determine it? How, what does it mean to violate this sacred? Simon violates the sacred that pope now who are, uh, of his own generation are engaged in the same kind of blasphemy and the same kind of profit nation and in effect, let me just give you a little detail that you might appreciate this ambiguity. The other neighbor of Peta, you know, Saint Peter, the guy with the two keys, we saw an illusion to him. We can to 13. The other name of Peter is Simon, so he's, in fact, he's known.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       It's Simon Peter. It is as if by having this tool, the, the, the, the sourcer, the magician called Simon and the pope called Simon Peter, and they should be a, or who successors. That's pope's should be the first pope and the other. He's Dantes actually, uh, uh, giving us a sense of what we call for, give them the, the rhetorical term, immature Nimic proximity, a contiguity in near illness between them. The nearest between the prophetic mode and a, the perforation of the prophetic mode. How, how precarious is the boundary line that divides the two? How precarious the divide line that separates the, the, the sacred from the proffer nation of the sacred. So this is really what Dante's, we'll see how he dramatizes all of us. First of all. And the question that I raised with you is how do profits tall? And one thing that you will see here is the apostrophe. This is a candle written in terms of a positive is look at this. Um, and we read the Canto. So I'm reading the Canto. This is for the transcriber. Uh, um, can talk 19.

Speaker 1:          00:17:21       Ah, Simon Margot's. There is the apostrophe. Think about why their posture, what is an apostrophe? And you, his Richard followers who rapacious prostitute for gold and silver, the things of God, we should be brides of righteousness. Yeah, that's the definition of Samaria. Uh, viewed us and adultery, a corruption, therefore of the chastity, of, of, uh, of the marriage between God and the soul. Now must the trumpet sound for you, for your place in is in the third pouch. We were now at the next tomb and that climb to that part of the ridge, which hangs right over the middle of the ditch. Oh, and other parts and other invocational would call it, but it's, it's, I'm not so sure that we can quiet that. I couldn't quite decide the difference in between an invocation, which is obviously a prayerful and an apostrophe, a calling on and address a, that's what the apostrophes, how great is the art that shows in heaven on earth and in the evil world.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       And how Justin it has that power. The Spence I saw along the sides and on the bottom, they live in stone full of holes. All of one size in niche was rounds. They seem to me of a, with no more or less than those that were made in my beautiful Saint John the Baptist story of Saint John in Florence. And these are this, uh, the, the, the wells were baptisms take place that usually octagonal in shape. The eighth day, you know, the, the, the, the idea that the rest of the direction is on the eighth day. Uh, it's, it's, uh, it's, it's the idea of history based on the seven days of creation, the eighth day of the resurrection, they were made in my beautiful Saint John as funds for baptism, one of which not many years ago I broke for wonder, was drowning in it. And to this, I set my seal to clear the mind of everyone with Dante's doing is acknowledging what could, what could have been seen as an act of profound nation.

Speaker 1:          00:19:43       He broke one, which is really as a figurative because they're are huge and I can't believe that he could have the unit 10 people to break these things apart. Uh, so it's a figurative idea that he stretched his head into holy things and violated the holy things. But he did it. And that's the excuse is giving a, he did it in order to save someone's life. So there is nothing gratuitous. That's the point in his own intervention as it is called. It's called an intervention in Zachary's stretching the profane hands into holy things and two sacred things where he's, what he is really, uh, removing himself from is the charge that is act may appear purely gratuitous prayer or to the tutors. And if it's not gratuitous, what is it driven by? Where does it come from if it's not, one can say, well, it's a gratuitous act, which means you can dismiss it, but this is not the two, two.

Speaker 1:          00:20:46       So what is the reason behind it then he, he, if he serious enough, it should provide us this region from the mouth of which projected of each projected the feet of a center and the legs as far as the calf and the rest of us inside. He's representing the popes were here upside down. That's the way, that's the way Simon fail. And they'll give a little story about that too. It was also the position that according to legend Saint Peter wanted for himself. He asked that he be buried upside down because he wanted to show what the cue, the erection of for the soldiers are sent. And purification would be the idea that wedding, I remember in an inverted world, a world which is upside down, and therefore to be with a head down you, you, you are really a right side up. You are going toward the, toward your proper destination so that it is playing with this iconographic Motif of Peter who asks to be crucified with head upside down.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       And the story of Simon who very much like him now is as a, as a, as, as, as a punishment is with the head upside down. How were they punished in an avert pat or day of the Pentecost and the flames of fire? You know, the story of the Pentecost. That's the story of the Pentecost is the story of the gift of language that come down as a rain of fire on them. Now they have flames on their feet. This is what, this is the soul to have a horrible, uh, turning around of, uh, of prophecy. End of the, of the, of the gift of languages, meaning that we all speak everybody else's language, which clearly means I'm sure that that was polyglots among view, but it clearly means that we all speak one language language of charity and therefore we can all understand each other that way.

Speaker 1:          00:22:47       So, uh, that's uh, that they would have snapped with his uh, and ropes is flames on oily thing, on oily things, the old unction. Uh, so it's a further allusion to the, this equation that is taking place here moves only over the outer surface. So it did there from the heels to the toe. Who is that one done tasks, wants to know who it is that he's his master that rides in his torment more than any of his fellows. I said, and this licked by a red flame and he answered me if that will have me carry the down there by that more sloping bank. Does Sheryl know from himself of him and of his misdeeds and I all is. Well for me, that is a pressure that with my load and knows the depart node from the wheel, the nose to what I do not speak.

Speaker 1:          00:23:44       Then we came on to the fourth dike, turned and descended on our left down to the pitted and narrow bottom. And the good master did not set me down from his home to he brought me to a whole of him, the solar mentored with his shanks, whoever, whoever that wallet I began unhappy sold that are held upside down, planted like a post if that were able to speak. And now the series of inversions is introduced here. I, Dante says stood there like the fryer. He is the layman to changing of roles and the pope who is going to be unveiled his own reveal his own identity in a moment. He is there, uh, like an assassin because an assassin that perfidious assassin, I mean the one who broke faith, that's what the word, uh, perfectly, uh, means that Shrives the treasures intolerance, the paddle fee though as an assassin who have to being fixed calls him back so that he delays is that, and he cried.

Speaker 1:          00:24:52       This is the one of the pope's Nicholas who misunderstands, but the misunderstanding is highly suggestive. He's telling Dante and us that the reigning pope or Dante's writing Bonafides, the eighth, one of the RCD family, one of the great families, Roman families has already arrived. And he says standard style. They're already standard stuff. They're already Bonhoeffer's by several years the writing lied to me. And also soon sated with this gains, which thou did not fear to take that by guy, the lady beautiful and then do her outrage. So, uh, this is uh, uh, the comic con, the accusation that Dan picking launch, Eh, the, the figures of power, the prophet who takes home a power and unveils it's abusers. I became like those that stand as if marked, uh, not comprehending the reply made to them and knew not what to answer. And Virgil said, tell him quickly, I'm not here, I'm not here, that are thinkers.

Speaker 1:          00:25:59       And I answered as if as I was bitten and that the spirit twisted his feet together, then sign in with lamenting voice. He said to me, what does the want with me then? If to know who I am, concerns the, so much that has come down the bank for it. Know that I was invested with a great mantle and so on. And Dante, we'll go on into, uh, uh, a general attack, uh, which is really the, the prophetic moment. Let me just, uh, I do not know. I'm reading from lines 90 and following. I do not know if, uh, on that I was over bold when all my answer to him was in the strain. Pray. Tell me now, how much treasure did our Lord require of Saint Peter Before he gave keys into his charge? Surely he has nothing but follow me. Nor did Peter on the other take gold or silver from attires and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       So this is Dante. Now, uh, the Prophet Dante, the, the, the man who speaks because, and he, he feels that he ought to speak. And that's the distance taking from the gratuitousness of the accusation because all figures of authority lack in the presence of this eclipse of authority. He thinks that it is incumbent upon him to go on taking that authority used to have patient of over voice is a patient of authority in order to make up for what he thinks is missing. And the problem, uh, this whole question about the, the, the confusion of orders, the confusion between the secular and the sacred and profane and the sacred is brought back to one great event, which was known in the Middle Ages as the second sin of Adam. It was so great. They understand what the first sin of Adam was. The transgression or the transgression of the, the command given to him not to eat of the tree of the, the, the, the forbidden tree are the forbidden fruit of the tree.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       Uh, the vent, Dante goes back to his event of the so called donation of Constantine about which I want to say a few things and then we move on to the next cancers. And so it's the donation of Constantine. It is a refers to the fourth century when the Emperor Constantine, whose name I think I have mentioned, uh, uh, gave extended, gave the land to the pope x in other words, made the po the ruler of a secular, um, domain to Dante. This was a confusion of registers, a confusion of responsibilities that the pope should be only engaged in spiritual pursuits and spiritual matters. He becomes instead involved in secular matters. So that scene of ceremony is really the problem between, uh, the has to do with the donation. Of course in an issue. By the way, and I will tell you why this is important in a second.

Speaker 1:          00:29:09       The issue is we'll be really clarified around the 15th century when two figures, two people, two figures, one is Cruzan knows, some of you may know him or Nicholas of cruiser went on repeating the moral arguments against the donation of Constantine as much as Dante does here. But the one who really proved the falseness of the documents with which, uh, uh, Constantine supposedly made the donation to the pope was Lorenzo Valla with a philologist who went on examining the language of the text. And by examining that language, found out that this, the, the donation was not reading the document had not possibly have been written in the fourth century because the board, the traces of 11th century, uh, Latin. And so he went home and specifying that that the region had been a forgery and the forger had been committed in, in a, in a, in a convent in the south of France with extraordinary linguistic position.

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       What is the, why is this important to Dante? Dante makes this issue of the donation of Constantine, the confusion of olders, the spiritual and the secular, which Simoni embodies Simoni crystallizes the real problem of the, the crisis of his own time. So, so huge. I repeat that. It's cold as the second scene of Adam [inaudible] political texts called Monarchia, which is really an argument in favor of the, uh, the separation between these two orders. The church and the state, uh, had to be neatly divided both to protect the state from the intrusions of the church and to protect the church from the likely intrusions of the state. So it's really an argument that goes into, into two directions, uh, so much then for to 19. The last thing I have to save it as I began talking about the rhetoric of the profits and said the profits really, um, uh, use apostrophe ish apostrophes, which are forms of lament are Simon.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       You can see it's a kind of morning. Uh, it's the language of, uh, of, of, of, of grief frank primarily. But there is also from a linguistic point of view, something else about unopposed because an apostrophe, it's has an indeterminacy of its own. It's not really language. He says nothing. It's, it's a scream. But it's a, the sense of we need to break the silence. In other words, you are using an apostrophe or emit a cry because you cannot be quiet. And that's really exactly what makes this aspect of prophetic language so crucial. It's between silence. One is overcome by what? One. The, the enormity of what one sees and the refusal to acquiesce. So, uh, and, and I should leave you are constantly, that's another apostrophe. There was also the whole Cantu is punctuated by this rhetorical form that wants to break the silence and, and, and cannot quite find the words.

Speaker 1:          00:32:18       That's what I call the indeterminacy of the rhetorical artifice. Um, let me just go, ah, I know that I said that. We'll read 21. Maybe I can talk about it. I have to say very little about comedy. Dante uses the language of comedy. And what I had, I had with time, I would talk about how Dante out of the way, 21, two, is he an hour, my comedy, the language, the humble style at this as if he wants to free himself from the shackle, the complications of using their lofty language or taking on this extraordinary position of being, being the profit of his own times. So he goes on to their, my comedy, but it's common is also linked to a peculiar experiencing it that he tells in Canto 21, the fear of falling, the devils are after him. And that was the, the, the, of course he calls them a wealth and he believes in other way of thinking about them was the war between, he says whites and blacks, Bianche and airy.

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       That's, that's the way that would distinguish themselves. So this demons are, his enemies are the blacks, the, the, the, uh, the Gibbons who are trying to throw him down. And the point is that comedy is always attached to all is flagged with the idea of the fall. Laughter. This is where it begins. At the moment when someone falls, someone slips and, and so we could really talk about that. Had a little bit more but not much more. Had a chance to, if we had a little bit more time, but I'm anxious to get into 26 and before we get to 26, there is a passage in Canto 25 that I have to read. Dante's been going through the Rome of the thieves can took 24 and 25 and he is overwhelmed by the metamorphosis, the form of punishment of these thieves, uh, that goal and changing, um, form that become snakes that are human beings bitten by snakes.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       They become snakes that turned into ashes and the recomposed themselves in an endless cycle. This is the punishment. And Dante goes on writing as a poet, breaking the flow of the narrative of what is happening to him. And this is what he says he is. This is some 10, 25, 25 lines 90. And following his, he describes the, uh, actual reading from blinds eight and following. It's the lizard under the great scorge of the dog days passing from hedge to hedge seems lightening if it crossed the way. So appeared meeting for the balance of the other two. A small, fiery serpent, livid and black has a peppercorn and that part by which we were when we first receive a nourishment, it transfixed in one of them then fell down before him stretched out the ones that's fixed it, but said nothing only stood still in your mind as if sleep per fever had come upon him.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       He kept looking at the serpent and it at him. The only one from the wound, the other from the mouth smoked violently and the smoke meth and now he's down talking as a poet. He breaks the account that the chronicle what he has seen the witnessing since that's what he is. He's the witness in all of these experiences and there and that's what he says. Let looking now be silent with his tales of Richard's Abellio and the CTOs and let him wait to hear what now comes forth. Let all of it is highlands about card, the most angelic Tusa for if in his lines he turns him into a serpent and her into fountain. I do not grudge it to him for two natures face to face. He never saw transmuted that both kinds. We're ready to exchange their substance. All right. On the face of it, Dante saying that the kind of metamorphosis is describing really is, um, more horrifying than anything says that [inaudible] the author of the metamorphosis or who is all his guidance, his mom metamorphosis by a belief in the, in the bondage and the bond of, of, in the solidarity between humans, human beings, and the natural world.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       We can go on shifting forms and there is a kind of Syrian, a transformation happening in, in, uh, in, in, in, uh, innovate. And he also, he also says that he's different from Luca and other author of, uh, in of matter of a scene. So metamorphosis in his story about the civil war. But the point that I, that I think is really crucial here is that it's a different one. Dante is repeating, reenacting exactly the kind of aesthetic temptation that we already witnessed in Canto four of inferno in limbo where Dante meets the poet and he's so taken, so complacent about undoubtedly that great imputation of being sitting, sitting with, uh, can you imagine Houma Virgil, Horace Lucan of it. Exactly the people that he mentioned them retrospectively, that scene of harmony that can't have four seem to dramatize now completely, completely vanquished. You know, here he is, he's really saying, I am their rival.

Speaker 1:          00:37:54       I am even better. I'm seeing things that they didn't even imagine. So if you had the illusion of an idealic relationship among poets, uh, you are this abused at this point. But it is a temptation nonetheless because once again, Dante's going down for, in, in, in, in, in an expo and the descent, which is at the center of spiritual humility. And yet his voice seems to be going up in an opposite direction. One of Hubris, the same kind of temptation that he had in Canto for, and this is what happens. Again, the structure repeats itself in Canto for Dan pay claims that he built up a fellowship, a great poets. He comes into pental five and he has to confront the responsibilities of writing the responsibilities of being a writer. And he encounters his own. A reader of his own Dante merges into Canto 26 and meets none other than Julissa's their master rhetorician whose experience and whose journey will lead himself and his are companions to a tragic end.

Speaker 1:          00:39:08       For Dante. This is an extraordinary moment for a number of reasons. Ulysses is a steri point of reference for his own adventure. Ah, he would keep thinking of him in Canton 19 Oh Purgatorio El Canto 28 or paradise when Dante is about to leave beyond the whole, the physical universe. He looks back to see this as he has traveled. And the only thing that he sees is really that passage way where you listen as violated or boundaries clearly what kind of boundaries in my violating you listen as a mode of being a possibility of being for Dante himself. And so we come into Canto 26 and I would like to take as much time as we possibly can without tiring you all, uh, about, uh, this can't, let me begin with, as I sought to preamble, tell you a general, a general, a general point.

Speaker 1:          00:40:04       Every school child in antiquity and in Dante's on time knew one thing, that Ulysses was a famous Greek hero, polio tropic as homer calls him the main of many terms, the many who knew it. All, the men who had been seasoned in order experiences. They know that he had done to the war of Troy, that he was the one to suggest that the building of the Trojan horse and the stealing of the palladium, as you know, the simulacrum of Minerva wisdom, the figure of that, the image of wisdom. And then it took him that he was involved in the bath or about inheriting Achilles arbs with Ajax. And then we, everybody knew that it took him 10 years to return to Ithaca. Right? This is a story of the Odyssey. He turns, he goes to, we do not only that, the, the, the nostrils as the Greeks call, call it the return, the journey of return.

Speaker 1:          00:41:04       He becomes the hero of nostalgia there going back to a place that he has. Everybody knew this in, uh, in Dante, in antiquity, in Dante's times, in antiquity. They knew it very well because then the story of Unisys had become a nun. The as philosophical allegory of the faith of the soul. The idea of Ulysses who goes from Ithaca to Troy and then go, goes back for 10 years after the war of 10 years, another 10 years of vicissitudes, cleansing himself in order to reach, to go back to, uh, and, and, and, and testing himself to go back to his hometown, um, was really the story of the soul. That's what this whole does. It's incarnates itself stroll fee and the pissed of it. It goes through the soul, goes through the planets and gets tainted by the attributes of the, of the plan. At some of us are lunatics, others are mercurial, others are Saturnine, you know, that's from the planets.

Speaker 1:          00:42:01       But then by cleansing ourselves, there's salt and go back to its place of origin. That's the circle of the return. That's, that's the way the Alexandra neoplatonists understood the allegory of the Odyssey. So this is clear. Dante violates this rule. That's what you have in Canto 26 Dante begins with Ulysses, his return to Ithaca and starts his journeys of exploration all over again. The idea of the eternal return, the idea of a closure that he has come back home is not, not part of Dante's imagination or sensibility. He is [inaudible] the poet who is truly restless and always placing himself and his heroes on some kind of quest. I want a method on a roads, on an address, whatever, whatever the the, the idea is the philosophers were always on the road is in thinking about some, some, some way of reaching wisdom, reaching truth. That's where he puts them.

Speaker 1:          00:43:05       And that's what happens with the story of, uh, of, of Ulysses. Ulysses, uh, starts all over again and goes and to die is involved in a journey that is absolutely the gratuitous, a journey for wisdom, for wisdom into the unpeopled world who got to see this in the moment and, and dies. That's, that's, that's it from one point of view. And I want you to be careful as you read the Kantar because you will see, you'll notice one thing, the first thing you will notice is it's not Dante who conducts the interview with Ulysses. No, it is virtual. The Port of Latin antiquity and supposedly they speak may be Greek or some form of, uh, clearly Greek. Um, uh, it is Virgil, the poet of the Aeneid who thinks of himself as the fitting interlocutor of the great Greek hero, not Dantes, Dantes excluded Dante just watches and witnesses this.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       But there is more to this idea of stylistic, the core because one can say, well, Virgil, this is in fact that as tragic as a text get ever get supply, this is not a comical text. This is Virgil, the author of a tragedy. That's where Dante calls and the tragic style, the sublime style and Julisa speeds in the most in the loftiest way possible. But it's not just a question of stylistic decorum at stake. There is something else you listen disguises himself as an ears as and tells the story of his life as if he were an ESBL. Now let me just tell you one little thing and then we get into the Canto. Ah, this is part of a story in many ways. If you ask readers of Virgil and homer, they probably will tell you, well virtual, yeah, good port. But you know, let's face it, the first six books are just the, all this say and the second books I just, the yearly that he sort of gives her a raise, you may have and so on. Not at all. Not at all. And the difference between the two heroes is this. Ulysses is a place to go back to. He goes Mythica to Troy back to Ithaca and he has has no place to go to. His is the open question. The open the, the road on open ended road and open a red and the journey. And this is the way you listen is, will think of himself the further the last thing and then the really we'll get into the cancer. The last thing I'll say is that

Speaker 1:          00:45:49       extraordinary ambiguity. I want to point out the extraordinary to be ambiguity with which Dante represents Julissa's. But the ambiguity of Unisys is part of the story of Ulysses from the start. The variant from the very beginning. Ulysses is a philosopher and he's a rhetorician. He's someone who can manipulate or knowledgeable his own ends. And this, this, this, this ambiguity that in many ways, Dante is a fines. Very alluring. Okay. Let's, let me start with the Canto. The Canto start starts with, uh, uh, another, uh, very topical relation. Uh, very topical allusion. Dante is, uh, joined their attention to a specific place to the city of Florence. It is as if he wants to a more himself angle himself to something that's concrete as his immediate time, immediate place, uh, his own native place. And, and, and, and it's an apostrophe to Florence, rejoice, Florence, since that was so great.

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       let me just stop here. Moment.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       Pay Attention. As you read the Canto, pay attention to one, a stylistic elements, the antithetical, the empathetical our use of great or uh, tall and small at the same time. Uh, rhetorically sometimes, uh, all women with the idea that uh, uh, of, of making us ask and one that, what is the relationship between within that which claims to be so large and so big and that which claims to be so small. You list is obviously thinks of themselves in terms of loftiness and Dante. Now rhetorically starts with Florence in south. So great. That's how tight it is. Obvious that overland and see the Beatles, they wings and through hell they name it spread abroad. The whole point is that he has seen some Florentine thieves are named even among the thieves are found five such citizens of dine. That's shame for them. Comes and once again, the prophetic voice of Dante peers here and that they will see that this is, is fairly important in the narrative we set out.

Speaker 1:          00:48:09       Second paragraph end on the stairs which they're projecting rocks had made for descent before. My leader mounted again in drew me up and following the lonely way among the rocks and splinters of the ridge. The food made new speed without the hand. I grieved then and grief now are new. Then when he was a pilgrim watching and witnessing the stories, this is going to tell her and now as a writer they said double focus. That Dante's using the focus of the pilgrim and the focus of the narrator I grieved in and agree with. Now our new, when I turned my mind to what I saw and more than I'm warrant, I curb my powers and this is going to be at least the attempt of Dante to curb his powers as he witnesses the story of immoderate hunger for knowledge of a flight of the mind.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       That's what we have here. The flight of the mind, which is like the flight of battles, which is like the flight of Icarus that seems to know no boundaries. Ulysses is he who transgresses all boundaries but doesn't Dante also transgressed boundaries? He won't say, so here he wants, it seems that he takes you listen as an exemplary figure that would lead him to want to curb his powers. Let's continue, uh, uh, uh, less, uh, less they run where virtual does not guide them, uh, in the languages that of a horses. Of course horses, the horses of the soul and virtue is the ability to hold that black and the white horse on the chariot, uh, to hold them together. And so that's the illusion with the t that Dante is using and your platonic language so that it favoring star or something better have granted me such a boon.

Speaker 1:          00:50:13       I mean not drudge it to myself. And now the first description of the landscape as some are landscape, as many as the fireflies, which the peasant resting on the hill in the season when the heat at lights the world least hides his face from us. What an extraordinary emerge at preferences to talk about the sun is the night when the sun is hiding. And you'll see the implications of this metaphor. I hope we're in a moment seize along the valley below in the fields. Perhaps where the, he gathers the grapes and entails with so many frames. The eighth, which was all gleaming is a perceived as soon as I came where the bottom was insight and this he, that I was avenged but the bearish, so the chariot of Elijah, his departure when the host rear the roads to heaven who could not follow it with his eyes, so his to see anything but the flame alone, like a little cloud mounting up.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       So each flay moves along the gullet of the ditch for none shows the theft and everyone steals away, uh, center. Uh, Dante's not comparing himself to Elijah, he's comparing to someone who watches Elijah, Elijah, who is also engaged in a flight to fight to the soul. Right, exactly. Like Ulysses who is going to be represented. It's the antithesis to your listeners, but Dante is not that likely larger and he would like us to believe that he's not really like Ulysses. He is like Ellie sales, the one who inherits the mantle of prophecy from Elijah and the one who, who witnesses watchers. It's, it's, it's, it's his way of, of trying to avoid the extreme of the profit. And now, as it turns out, the iteration, this is, this is the way they lay out here is between Ulysses and, uh, and Elijah. And so I was standing on the bridge and then he goes on.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       He's told them within the flames are the spirits. She's a folk frame. And there are two souls die, uh, erases and Diomede pay attention until this little detail, except in the case of the, uh, the, the suicides, Dante or reeses pairs of sinners. Here's Diomede who doesn't talk. And he sees also, uh, he sees, uh, Ulysses. And I suppose that the reason is that Dante really wants us to know about the social quality of a moral violation that are moral violation. All his implies, uh, somebody else. It's not quite ever, except for the suicide, which has a peculiar form because you have witness homicide and victim mode in one. But in, in, uh, in, in the other centers, you always have a sense of, of, uh, uh, uh, a witness, somebody else who has been touched or an accomplice of, uh, uh, of, of, of the center.

Speaker 1:          00:53:15       Uh, so within, we know that he answered, who are these people I really wish to us the who is that fire hose, which comes so crew and at the top that seems to rise from the buyer with a t Oakleys. What's led with this broader, the stories that abide by the two brothers were enemies, ATO please and Polynese. Thebes what are they have an introduction of? This is all about Greek mythology, uh, in Greek mythology with brothers city over the story of Thebes, which Dante knows through stages, uh, the idea of the depots of course, and Jocasta and the tragic city, uh, the, the Thebes becomes, uh, the, uh, the term becomes a metaphor. The, the, the, the basic metaphor of, uh, of the, some of the tragic city app because in effect presents also one of the reasons that for dentist crucial, it presents birth EEOC lists and Polynese, um, childs, the children of either pose and Jokasta is tragic events.

Speaker 1:          00:54:31       This is something that distinguishes radically the Greek idea is Dante understands it. Uh, the Greek idea of cities and birth from say, Virgil's idea of birth. You know, something to be celebrated all the time. None of Virgil is always the one who celebrates the birth of a, a senior's polio, et cetera. Now we know who these are. He answered me within there are tormented within their tormented. You listen, that you made and that's together they go on the vengeance as under wrath cetera. If they're able to speak within this lights. I said, I earnestly pray the master and pray again. My prayer Availa thousand fold that not forbid me to stay to the horn. Flame comes near though ceased how bent on it with desire. And he said that prayer deserves much praise for consent to it, but to restrain that Kong first little earlier, he wants to curb his powers.

Speaker 1:          00:55:35       No, Virgil asks him to restrain his time, leave it to me to speak for, have understood with a wishes for perhaps since they were agreed that was the same I speech. So we have really a sense of the hierarchy of styles, Virgil and your listeners. And then in cancer 27, it's going to be redone. The MONTEFELTRO and Dante, uh, or you are to who are to within one fire. If I deserve what I lived, if I deserve to you much or little once again, the oscillation between high and low, much or little when in the world I wrote the lofty lines, do not move on, but let the one of you tell what are being lost. He went to die. The Greater Horn of the ancient flame began to a murmur. Justice if would've beaten by the wind and weaving. The point to and fro is it's where the tongue of the spoke.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       If Frank Fourth of voice and said when I parted from Cersei who helped me more than a year, the guy atia before an ears so named it. So you said clearly you list tells his story through the myth of an ears claiming priority of raininess but also the knowledge in one thing. It's an incredibly, I find it a very moving line that uh, any his names, places in memory of his nurse. You know, your names, the city of gate. He's a founder of cities and names the CTO gator, not fondness for her son, no duty twin aged father, not the love I owed Penelope. Look at this, what we call heavily ethical language. You listen speaks in terms of what his duties are, fondness or sun, the duty to alleged father liberties, the love I owed Penelope, which should have gladden her could conquer within me the passion I had to gain experience of the world and the vices and worth event.

Speaker 1:          00:57:38       This is, seems to be an ethical quest and nothing can stand in the way of this virtuous action. You, you as thinks of himself as a virtuous Cuesta after visors. Understanding and gaining experience of, uh, of vices and, uh, and, and, and virtual and the worth of men. And they put forth on the open deep with that one ship, uh, the one shore and the other I saw as far as Spain and Morocco, Sardinia and he's a man of, you mentioned places all the time. This narrative, he always mentions places, cities, Morocco, uh, Seville sailed on the other side of the Mediterranean. Um, it is as if he is a man who lives in space. He left, his father, loves his son. That would be a temporal description of him, but he lives in space because it is, if he never really knew his own place in the world, he's always looking for something he doesn't even, he doesn't know where he, he, he, he belonged and, and I come, my companions were old and slow when we came to narrow out with per Hercules set up his landmarks so that men should not pass beyond on my right hand.

Speaker 1:          00:58:58       I left Seville on the other already left Celta and now the speech he makes to his own companions and look at the rhetorical that a torical wisdom with which he moves, he addresses them as brothers, which is the biggest cup. Tatsuya benevolence. We are all together. There is no hierarchy here. I'm not your leader. I'm not yo king or brothers. I said, who threw 100,000 pedals? Look at the hyperboles. Oh, if you want to seduce people to come companions to come with you, you have to tell them that they are mighty actions and he does. And then magnify all the possible dangers or hundred thousand pedals have reached the west. North definitely plays the west vague and yet lofty, uh, to this. So brief vigil of the census. So the modesty, the oscillation between hyperbole and, and, and, uh, the light totay as it were, the, the, the, the recoiling into the sense of orderliness and small that remains to us choose not to deny experience, which I find an extraordinary word, experience.

Speaker 1:          01:00:11       And they probably will, uh, uh, stop here with this experience, as you know, is a word made only of prepositions, uh, expert either. It's a journey. It's going, uh, through, uh, bear, no experience. It's understood is a journey. It is as if knowledge, that's what the etymology of the word is. It's a going through, uh, it is knowledge literally is compared to a displacement through a traveling, uh, through, through a, Eh, uh, Khattab assists even in this case, which is the, the, the term to indicate the descent into the beyond in the sands tracks of the peopled, world tech thought of the seed from which you spraying. If you want to know the end of things, you have to know the beginnings. You have to know the seed, Huh? Uh, this is the, the, this is Julissa's perception. Uh, and because we have a new Boosie than you do know that your, there's a kind of natural determination in his own, uh, his own mind, uh, that he will reach in the noble end.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       You were not born to leave as brutes, but to follow virtual and knowledge as extraordinary, extraordinary line, uh, he promises that human beings will leave behind. What did the illusion may be through a metamorphosis of Cersei that I changed the companions into pigs, right? The Koreans, the hogs of Picuris into the voluptuary experiences. And he promises to re store in them not only the human image, but to bring them to a virtual knowledge. And it's an extraordinary promise. It's a very difficult promise. It's almost an impossible promise. It may even not be a correct promise because he's making a promise that virtue is knowledge. I lead you to virtual knowledge and they may not be the same thing. I may have knowledge, but it does mean that I have the virtue of that, that I claim to have knowledge about. And My, my, my, it can be anything. Anything at all. I can know what prudence is. It doesn't, that doesn't really make me pull it. That's, so let's stop here. I'd want to stop here and I'm want to see if there's some questions and then resume next time with, uh, the camp. Yes,

Speaker 3:          01:02:44       USC is because people aren't going to any definite place. Is that what you said is like USC? It's because people don't have

Speaker 1:          01:02:54       the question is uh, I mentioned a, actually Ulysses mentions knowing that he speaks to Virgil mentions any years and uh, uh, so that's the ad. That's a y n e s and Julissa's. Vaguely. That's true. Uh, they clearly were fighting the same battle and Troy verge, a Ulysses must know that engineers had lost his hometown and he took his son. I like your recess. He took his father on a, on, on his, his back. Literally they is immigrant and his son and the lost his wife Crozer and goals looking for a place without really knowing, but it plays his, for him. You leases knows what he wants to go. He has a certain idea of its destination, which is Ithaca. He gets a lot of temptations along the way. No C Cup. And what a temptation. Ah, sir, sir. And other great temptation he manages to move beyond those two conversations in order to go back to Ithaca. That's the great difference from, from the Roman myth of the immigrant.

Speaker 3:          01:04:03       But in this version, aren't they still really different because you, let's see. I mean, he, his quest doesn't have any direction at all. It's just experience. Um, I'm unused. It's quest. He doesn't know where he's going, but there's still an overall plan so that there is a definite

Speaker 1:          01:04:18       exactly, absolutely. So there is a difference between them are, becomes that that nes was stop at one point. Uh, he has temptations to stop in Sicily. Oh, you remember their, that they're, they're famous games. Uh, the games ritual games in memory of his father who had died, the death, that hallows, that ground. Then the death of, of, of, of, of, of, of, of unkindness that women burn the ships just as weeks. This is tube to, this is utopia. I don't, we don't want to go around and do this epic adventure. Let's stop here. He wants, he's always a misunderstanding. Oracle's, he doesn't know where to go. He's always looking backwards, but looking forward at the same time. But at one point he stops he and the, and that's part of, if you wish, the, the realism of, of any as he stops at one point, they cannot, we will not go any, any further. Ulysses go spec home and then he starts all over again. But that's Danfoss reading of Ulysses. Okay. So he's really reading him as very much like as if he would have a variant of a, of Dante by the way.

Speaker 4:          01:05:33       Uh, yes, it's impossible. I to be is to represent the dichotomy between Dante, the poet and Dante, the narrator as well, because no one has a definite places looking back at that place where he was going. And the other is taking a journey of experience in unsure where he's gone.

Speaker 1:          01:05:51       Uh, the question is very interesting and it's, is it possible to think of a nes and your listeners is a two functions? Is it were of Dante, the pilgrim and the poet? Uh, yes and no. Um, it's a very interesting question. Um, but I, I would know, um, I, I really hesitate to agree with you for one reason. Uh, because, uh, writing for Dante

Speaker 1:          01:06:19       is a prolongation of, of the search than politically can not stop. It's not that, you know, he on the face of it, he has seen the beatific vision, right? That's new to the story. The story of a man who goes from the wilderness goes to hell, purgatory paradise and here's a beatific vision and now he starts telling us about it. A fighting against forgetfulness. You know, here's a lot of, as a writer, he is a lot of temptations and yet the writing itself is fraught with, with uh, dangers, temptations. It's a different sort of journey, but it's the journey of writing and therefore there's no clear cut distinction between the two. I, in fact, I just read in Canto 25, uh, the little scene when he challenges Luca and dove in, which it really is, let the past yield to the present. You know, that's, that's, that's really the kind of claim that they can make.

Speaker 1:          01:07:21       Uh, let them be quiet cause I know what is happening and the stories that is a writer, he is a lapsing his falling into a number of them as if it were to peel them. You can expect that from a pilgrim to being fat, being fascinated by, uh, by Francesca. I'm having all this, uh, in the divisions, Dante is a deeply divided man. He has to calm them and at the same time has to sympathize as, as a, even as a pilgrim. So that's really the, that's that's the only little detail would I would, uh, uh, I would not agree with you, but maybe you have right? I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:08:02       Oh yes. Can you speak about the fact that nothing changes? The ending is stories and had some drowned at sea that have intertwined the, again,

Speaker 1:          01:08:12       he returned. Uh, the question is, can I speak about how Dante changes the ending of your list? A story. And the answer is this, uh, Dante makes you listen this go back to Ithaca, but then he breaks the circle of this close circle. Let's call it the circle of the epic. Let me talk formally about it. You know, the, the idea is that you are what, what are some traits of the epic, the epics deal with foundations of cities and destruction of cities all the time, no matter what the city may be. So he has destroyed, they said it goes back to uh, to his own city to cleanse it. That's, which is Homer's way of saying, I think, uh, you Greeks were so, so great when you were out in the world that Troy, let us see how that heroic ethos is going to help you, that you are back home where the probably you are going to need more courage and more determination, as much courage, at least as much determination as you did have, uh, in, in that great celebration of the newly found Greek unity, uh, in, in Asia, minor in, in, in Troy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:26       So that's that. Now Dante takes that ntss no, there's no closure here because he rejects the idea of Dante to the epic. He replaces the epic with a novel. This becomes a kind of novelistic story. Where is where we're in a experience is being arrived at as one goes. You see what I'm saying? In the epic, you have a kind of, uh, indeed things return to the poets of, uh, of departure. Uh, that's, so that's the difference. It's a difference between two radically different ways of understanding experience and the self down to put himself on the open road. But you listen will remain that constant reminder to him.
