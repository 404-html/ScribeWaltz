Speaker 1:          00:00:06       We're meeting

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       kitchen. Um, and there's the middle section of the poem, literally a place of transition between, uh, the have the world of health and, and, and all the evil that we have witnessed. And then the, the, the realm of glory, which is going to be paradise. Um, uh, let me say a few things about purgatory, both as an idea and, uh, as, as a, a poetic construction, Dante's poetic construction, um, as an idea, uh, the were Dante understands it. Precatory is part of a human geography, as you know, it's, uh, located in the southern hemisphere. There are two hemispheres in medieval geography, the Northern Hemisphere, which is that when we inhabit, and then there is the southern hemisphere, uh, the purgatory is an island. I have tried to explain to you last time the origin of this place in Nantucket Mitchell boy, uh, uh, thinking, uh, it, uh, it's an island that emerged from the northern hemisphere at the time of Lucifer's for, uh, the earth trembles and retreats.

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       That's the idea, uh, as Lucifer approaches and such does, it creates the void, which becomes hades, the abyss and the island. And the, the purgatory emerges on the other side, the southern hemisphere, the top of the pool. That story there is the island of, there is the, the, the peak is the garden of Eden. They are where God placed Adam and eve. So that, uh, from this point of view, purgatory is part of human geography, but it's historically in accessible to human beings. One hero that already we already met you listen in, in federal 26 tries to approach an island at retrospectively, we can understand that that was, uh, the island of purgatory. This is a place of immortality that you listeners wanted to reach and uh, could not that journey of his and the, the shipwreck and tragically, uh, in federal 26 is the text for that kind of concern.

Speaker 2:          00:02:38       The other trait about a purgatory moral trade, uh, since this is now, uh, we are going to enter the realm of reconstruction of the human and the soul to make sense. A dentist should place it immediately after hell. It is as if only by knowing, only by experiencing more or less as metaphoric ways we can through the poetry of Dante. The nature of evil and the horror of it. Can we begin to have an appreciation of, uh, of the good, the good toad, which, uh, now the pilgrim is going to climb. The other, the other thing that you should keep in mind about, uh, uh, about, uh, progress or in the difficulties that the poet we'll have, uh, is the following. Uh, the perception of moral life and political life in purgatorial was so satanic, so narrow, so terrible that Dante's going to have a lot of quite a, quite a, quite a challenge to try to explain the, the usefulness and, and the, and the possibility of reconstructing a moral world and the political world.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       He was, he came very close to a total rejection of a, of a historical world and the political world. And now he has to find out how that reconstruction is going to be possible. The way he will do this is literally to go back to the natural world. Do not expect Dante to imagine a place where there is some kind of redemptive intervention from the outside. I can tell us this is the way you do it. No, no. The natural world, a world, the natural world, it must be capable of producing within itself. Some at least contain some seeds for a need to reconstruct for a need for the good. So this is going to be part of, uh, uh, his, uh, his strategy and his difficulties at further tray to purgatory, which was really completely missing in the Fed. And the Fed we had never had a sense of time.

Speaker 2:          00:04:48       Time was the biological clock of the pilgrim who was the only living creature, the only truly displaced figure. And he is the only displaced figure throughout the poem and purgatory who will find further. They're all displaced figure. So it's a more human, uh, world. Uh, but here now they have their sense of time. In fact, the first thing that we, we, we come to understand is how, what time is it's time understood as future oriented, as a projection in some kind of future. And at the same time, this idea of time also turns out to be in a return to the past so that as the pilgrim is going ahead, he's literally discovers that he's going backwards. To the garden of Eden exactly there where Adam and eve were placed at the top. Who Purgatory. Bye Bye, bye God at that time in the store that you have in, in Genesis, uh, uh, for instance.

Speaker 2:          00:05:47       But this idea of time, this will become truly a light motif throughout full authority idea of what is the relationship between the past and the future, since the only real time is really the future. And from that point of view are, which makes you understand that even the past was the future at some point at least. Right? So the future is the only thing that Dante is going to be interested in and the future will come and the possibility of a future and the way it's related to the past will become, are the object of his concerns, the object of his thinking or openly as he goes through the various Ah, ah, Ah, the Veterans Ledger. So purgatory, poetically, the poor guitar is divided into two, two to three parts. I would say actually the, the first part is the so called anti purgatory made of souls were awaiting, uh, don't, don't really penitence yet, but waiting to be assigned a particular place along the ledges.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       And then the so called penitents who are going through the process of cleansing, beginning with pride and ending up with ending with luxury at, uh, just before the pilgrim gets into the garden of Eden. The ordering of sins is the exact reversal of the ordering of, since you had an in fair no, here you begin with a spiritual, sane or intellectual saying the question of pride and end up with the most physical and material of the more luxury, which as you'll recall, is the, the inverted image of what happened in, in, uh, in, in fan. All right. With the Lucifer and the scene of Lucifer being really seen of, uh, of pride at the end of Ken to 30 for the, well, having said this, maybe other things will come to mind as I go on. Uh, uh, uh, today. And let me begin with, uh, uh, with, uh, some other couple of details is just getting to plunge into the, the can to one where, where is the pilgrim?

Speaker 2:          00:07:51       Now, the poem, the journey began on a good Thursday, as it's called, right? The Dante spends the first night, but the journey, the real journey begins on Good Friday in a clear imitation of a, uh, Christ's, a harrowing of Hell and emergence into the light on a Easter Sunday. That's where we are now. Easter Sunday morning, if the federal begins at dusk, and therefore, uh, the, the, with the idea of the approaching night and night that stands for the and no ability of whatever he's going to confront. The dentists fascinated with the idea of the night throughout, uh, in fan reimagine. Remember a Ulysses who travels following the sun and then the, and, and, and ends up really gazing at tonight, the unknowability of his destiny. They had no ability of the place even where he is. Now we'll begin with dawn and therefore 10 to one of purgatory becomes that which in province our literature, it's called an Obod.

Speaker 2:          00:08:53       Oh, from the word [inaudible] in Italian a U, B a, d, e the, the song, the dawn song, a song that in many ways reverses, uh, the grand tradition of, uh, the erotic lyrics of a, of a province are, uh, poetry, uh, where the dawn becomes the unhappy time for the parking of lovers. And here now it's regained as the great time when finally, uh, um, the pilgrim can go on and the port and go and mapping literally now mapping the journey, sailing through or sending is the metaphor that he asks a that he adopts or can be in deployment. The second part of the point purgatorio begins first of all, with an image of water and, and, and therefore it, it carries further this motif of the cleansing and purification. But really with a better metaphor from our point of view to course of a better waters, there'll bock who my width now lifts her sales leaving behind her.

Speaker 2:          00:09:58       So courtesy and that will sing of that second kingdom where the human spirit is purged, it becomes fit to ascend to heaven. But here, let poetry rise again from the dead or holy musers since I am yours. And he'll let Kalia pay rise up for awhile. And the company, my song without strain, which smote the ears of the wretched pies so that they despaired of, pardon, it's an extraordinary problem, uh, to, to purgatorial with for a number of reasons. First of all, [inaudible] picks up the metaphor of the, the, the, the epic oppose the epic metaphor of, uh, of, uh, the, the, the journey, uh, with which the poem began in the middle of the journey of our life as you recall. But now this, uh, uh, this, this, this idea of the process is indicated with a all failing. Therefore, literally recalling the, the, the sea voyage of Ulysses.

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       What's, that's one an oblique metaphor, but I want to draw your attention to the use of this adjective, a comparative adjective. That's where we call it in grammar, as you recall, the better waters. Uh, it's Dante's emphasis at exactly on the process. And then the con, the comparatively good. This is not the best of waters. It's not the worst of worst. This is the better waters. We are really in the, on the way to, uh, to better things. It's, it's a world of be green, uh, that Dante introduces visit that have really believes in a, in a sort of hierarchy, in the hierarchy of, uh, of, of values, of states, of, uh, of powers, of a, of beauty, of intellect, the world be a, it's an a dualistic world between what's bad and what's good. They said a lot of mediations, mediating steps along the way, and now he already introduced this, this, this, this whole question with an ocean of the better waters, the little backroom, my witness.

Speaker 2:          00:12:11       This is not only a journey. The interesting thing is this is a journey of poetry. It is as if Dan Pennell wants to highlight a motif which is going to be very crucial throughout the poem and in our reading of this poem that they really, at this point, I have been addressing this issue. So some of your questions that there really is no sharp, no drastic discontinuity between the, the journey of the pilgrim at the journey of the port, right. That the journey of the poet is an extension. It in itself is a journey in itself, is a journey of knowledge and a journey of discovery. And Dante makes, uh, a large claims for poetry. Poetry is a way of knowing. It's just not a and ornamentation recommed memorization of the past. Now here he talks about the journey has been the journey of poet, the little bark of my weight.

Speaker 2:          00:13:02       It's a conventional way of thinking about the bark of poetry with which he is. So they say, there seems to be a way of saying this is now more at this stage, at least it was to us to think about the journey of poetry and not just the journey that he himself will use. Uh, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll undertake the journey of the pilgrim, the hard, difficult to journey, uh, filled with fear, uh, that, uh, that he was experiencing in, in, in, in federal. And I also want to draw your attention to another little detail of the text. This is this the first time now that Dante, we use the future tense. I will thing we're in the world to open to futility and if it's open to future, the only way of thinking about futurity is made possible by a belief in the new.

Speaker 2:          00:13:53       You have to not really think, yes you can think of the future, but if the future is exactly as as as it is today, then you really have no future, then you really think that all is released into the domain of sameness. You know, if my day today is exactly what more the the, the world that I experienced yesterday, there's no new, no idea of the new and that instead here now users the future and clearly implying that there is an alternative, a difference, a possibility of doing things in ways that have not been done before. This is going to be a new departure and new departure for thoughts and new departure for the imagination and now he says it has to be also a new departure for poetry itself. I emphasize this idea of the future, I will sing the first time that he will.

Speaker 2:          00:14:45       He wasn't saying this in fan. Of course he couldn't even say that in the Vita Nuova you remember that I pointed when we were reading the little autobiographical great text called the Vita Nuova, the beginning of the term. I indicated to you that there is never the future tense used in that, in that, uh, in that text it was all a book of mammary with the difficulties and the dangers of mammary. Dangerous with memory being that memory changes can draw us into a world of fantastic. That's one of the, it's not a rejection of memory, only a way of highlighting. It's possible dangerous, right in the belief that they should live with some idea of danger. Maybe we are not really thinking are hard enough. So here now it's the, the, the only time that the future was using the Vita Nuova was either in the idea of death, when Dante has a prophetic dream and he hears a voice that he perceives as a kind of so, so, so truth leading is that voice that he thinks of it as a kind of, uh, of profits is a Soto of Oracle speaking to him.

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       You too will die. Beatrice has just died. And then the death of Beatrice brings to his mind the fear and threat of mortality to him. You too will die. That's the way the future's going to be understood. But then the poem, the whole Vita Nuova ends with a statement of hope. I hope to work and write things whereby I can say I can dry. I can say things about, uh, uh, about Beatrice. I had never been said about any woman. And so that becomes the two possibilities. So that's usually the only, literally once grammatically, the future tense. And the other one with, through this, uh, petty faster construction too. So bleak construction. But the hope, the verb, we use that to, uh, in with the idea of the future indicator there and then, uh, but he'll let poetry rise again from the dead and the prayer to the musers very much in the style of the epic tradition and especially of the music two one, the Muse of the epic poetry Kaleo pay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:52       But then this, the focus on Calliope we really tells you something about the kind of, uh, uh, I think retrospectively Reid explains, but let here they'd poetry rise again from the dead. Uh, the poem presents itself as clear. It was the mother of whom anybody remember? You remember your mythology, okay. No, you don't now, but it's, it's the mother of all fears so that they let their poetry rise again. Uh, let that poetry rise again from the dead. It's, Dante presents himself as it were, a Norfolk poet. He was Nora Norfolk poets, but it's for the airport in the traditional Morpheus who wants to conquer death. That's clearly enough for him. That's, that's what the old fuse descent into the underworld really is. The way of conquering death, the belief that poetry can do the trick. That's true poetry. We immortalize ourselves, we conquered death. He's going very soon to talk to him to understand that that's not the way he is going to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:17:57       And then something, a second paragraph, I want to read it a little bit because it really gives us a different sense of the tonality of Purgatorio because there's not only you have now morning and time, you also have for the first time light, not this hotel have a spectacular shades of light. The blue, the reds, uh, uh, the green with which he experiences and dramatizes paradise according to the lights emanating from the various planets, red of Mars, the white of Jupiter, the blue of Saturn. And so there is a kind of public, chromic, a pallette that is going to be deployed here. It's now a more human and natural world, the natural world. And listen to this. And then this enables me to say something else about the traits of, or the sweet hue of the Oriental Sapphire, which was gathering this region, face of the heavens from the cleared zenith to the first circle.

Speaker 2:          00:18:58       Gladden my eyes again. As soon as I passed out of the day there we should affected my eyes and breast. They're fair planet that prompts to our Venus the morning, the morning star that loved me, the older east laughs veiling the fissures, which were in her trains. I turned to the right. You remember that? I, I sort of tried to explain to you that with one exception that I can't explain, nobody can explain. And on very few people have noticed, uh, the, the, uh, Dante now is turning to the right, which is to say that even while going down, spiraling down in the world of l, he actually was going to the right, though he'd said that he was going to the left and he was going to the left because it was upside down. Now he's right side up. And so the directions of the human world are going to be, uh, to be regained.

Speaker 2:          00:19:54       So I turned to the right. He will never use this image again and set my mind on the other pole. And I so far stars never seen before. But by the first people, Adam and eve, the sky seemed to rejoice in the flames. All we do, regions was the north since Dour, denied that side. The northern hemispheres where we are, Dante's in the southern hemisphere, he is connecting with us, telling us what we are deprived of in by not knowing, by having lost a paradise. A couple of things that I will not since then we'll go back to these images. Um, the, the way he literally orients himself, let the metaphor he uses is that of, uh, here, uh, is the oriental light. Uh, and the way he's always orienting a reorienting himself. How do you know where you are is now in, in purgatory and also in paradise?

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       When thinking about about, uh, uh, characters, uh, here on earth and, and, and, and recalling their lives, it's always by looking at the east. It's always by looking in the light of the east. And from this point of view, Dante really retreats that most incredible metaphor that is available among the mystics, medieval mystics. And I'm thinking, or thinkers I'm thinking of even bullied. He was Casio doors. I hope they're not just names for you who think, who, who believes that you can only think that we in the West, a western in Clyde can only think by looking toward the east. That the way in which we can be orienting ourselves is by trying to capture that, the source of that light. And I mean this in the most metaphorical and as we shall see, the widest sensors, uh, possible. But that's all he's saying now.

Speaker 2:          00:21:48       But at the same time and the language, it's incredibly hard, has shifted between the first paragraph and the second paragraph that which seems to be the excitement for the light. And now he's experiencing again, it's Easter Sunday. He and he understands that it's direction. This is going to hit him very, very strongly now. Uh, but it's also an allergic. That tonality is Lhi. And the idea of what we have laws that widowed region of the Northern Hemisphere, uh, the sense of the sense of general laws, though it's a provisional privilege for him to see all this. But this indicates, it introduces that the, the, the extraordinary tension poetic pantry in purgatory, the dialectic between excitement for the future and then log for the past pilgrim is called in between and we shall see the consequences between this is zero, the level of, of, of tonality I would call it, but we shall see what this really means in a, in a moment.

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       This Dante approaches now, um, I had drawn my grade race and so on. Uh, this is lines, uh, uh, 25 when I had withdrawn my gaze from them turning to the stars, turning a little toward the other pole where the wind had already disappeared. I saw beside me an old man alone, worthy, but his looks of so great reverence that no son owes more to a father. His beard was long and stretched with white and his hair the same. Uh, double trust falling on his breast, et Cetera. This is going to be the encounter with Keto. And I want to talk about Cato. Wow. Let me just give you a real bit of, uh, extra, uh, Don Teske information. I mean, in a way this is, you probably do not know that this representation, we call it, uh, this, this, uh, the script seal of the old man with, uh, the, the, uh, with a beard or white street with whites.

Speaker 2:          00:23:56       But on two sides really is the, the paradigm, the model that, um, Michelangelo writes a Michelangelo follows in his conception of Moses, though Dante doesn't lose sight of the fact that this is Kate or just a little piece of how Michelangelo Red Michelangelo read this particular particular meeting. So who is this Keto? And Dante describes as an old man, and we also know that he's a Roman pagan fat. He's in Raleigh, a pagan. He's a man of laws. The first thing that he wonders and he says, pattern of who are you that have fled you? It's, these are, these are just, uh, are, are people who have tried to literally escaped from prison, the eternal prison against the bright scream. He said, who has guided you or who was your lantern in coming forth from profound night that holds the perpetual blackness, that valet of hair or the loss of their best?

Speaker 2:          00:25:02       Very Roman. This is the room and tradition of the law, right? How the loss of their best, in a way, this is a man, was a stranger to the world of purgatory. Strictly. It certainly doesn't seem to understand that there may have been some grace. It may be Dante and his guide that here out of some providential intervention, which has not, not to be explained by Lowe's or by natural or by the laws of nature or by Ben men. Men made laws at the loss of their business, broken or has a new decree. He wonders, been made in heaven. Uh, that being damned, you come to my clips, my leader Virgil, the two Romans talk. Now I'm for myself. Then I answered him. I'm sorry. Uh, the Nance with him or myself. I came, not a lady, be Trish recapitulation of women fair. No one descended from heaven for whose prayers a sucker.

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       This man with my companionship. But since this is a wheel to have it made more plain, how intrusive stands with us. It cannot be mine to deny. Denied. This man never saw his last hour, but by his folly was only a twit. That little time was left to run. I will send to him and have shown him all the guilty race and our purpose to show him those spirits that cleanse themselves under the I charge how I have let him would belong to tell the there descends from above virtue, which aids me in bringing him to see there and to hear the made please lead to be gracious to his coming. He goes seeking liberty, which is so c so dear as he knows who gives his life for it. And the reference is clearly to Katelyn himself who historically historical failure actually committed suicide, uh, in the civil war and refusing to take sides between, uh, Pompei and uh, uh, and, and Caesar as it's told in the great epic.

Speaker 2:          00:27:08       By looking the Roman Spanish poet who wrote the so called civil war, uh, a tax that is, uh, uh, very polemical between in between or among other things, uh, with, with, with Virgil that notice it since death for it was no bitter to the, in Utica, in North Africa where the did sleeve, the vesture, the body and which, um, in which, which is a great day, we'll be so bright. The terminally dates are not broken for us, for this man lives in minus, there's not buying me, but I'm of the circle limbo. Where are they chase the eyes of Marsha, his wife, who in her lopes still praise the holy breasts that are hold her for thy known, for her love, then do, are inclined to us, allow us to go through the seven kingdoms. I will report to her kindness if that deigned to be spoken of there below.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       And he responds, Marsha, so please my eyes. While I was younger, he said then that whatever kindness she sought of me I did. Now that she dwells beyond the evil stream, she not move me more by the law, which was made when I came forth from thence. But if a lady, et Cetera, et Cetera, um, it, this is an amazing, uh, from insubstantial terms and amazing beginning in the poem because Dante Meets Cato, who redefines. We are being told there that he's an old man, a pagan and the suicide there traits that virtual singles out bleakly referring to his adventures and that clearly contradict the, to purgatory. Purgatory is a Christian canticle this is Easter Sunday. Why have it inaugurated by the presence of a pagan who knew nothing of the, of, of the incarnation? Why have it? It's the, it's the, it's the Rome of every new life.

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       Why started with the suicide someone who we saw what Dante thought to the suicide when in a, in a complicated way, throughout, in fair, there were a number of suicides inhabiting various aspects of various, uh, regions of hell, but especially among the Er with the violent against nature and inferno 13. And so an old man as suicide and the Pagan. Why does he do a figure that he drove out of the, the world of up of Lucas? Um, what we are told about him. This, it's usually whenever you have representation so that beyond, you always have a young man, for instance [inaudible] or is this is a kind of day, the Latin term meaning a young, uh, in the lien for instance, it's always a young man or a young woman welcoming to indicate the, the renewed life. No, the novelty, the freshness of our life.

Speaker 2:          00:30:09       Uh, you certainly don't have an old man and you certainly do not have a suicide. Now the question, the suicide is probably the easiest to, to determine cause Keto suicide. It's a suicide for freedom. And let me say a couple of things about freedom because it's, um, I call purgatory really the, um, the domain of freedom. It's really the place of freedom that he begins here explaining as it were, political but also moral state. It's a political because it's, it's, it's, it's a refusal of the disarray and chaos brought in by the war between pump brought in by the war between Pompey and Caesar. At the time of the civil war. But it is also a moral state because Cato decides to put an end to his life in a sort of sacrificial move as if to draw attention to the, that the, the, the way in which the state had been, uh, killed, had been destroyed by the rivalry between this two, uh, these two great figures who have not opposed, but they'll have a rivalry about power.

Speaker 2:          00:31:24       That freedom is the fundamental problem. It's a woman issue at me. Just say non paid wants us to think of it at, at, at the very beginning of Purgatorio in pagan intellectual terms, freedom, uh, the whole, the whole precatory ends up with a pilgrim regaining and being crowned as he'll say with the attainment of free will. So the whole poem really moves this idea of from uh, uh, Keto search for freedom, personal freedom, and the pilgrim attainment of freewill. Now there is an obvious relationship to begin with between freedom on the one hand and, and, uh, I would say the future on the other, right. Uh, the poem begins with the future and now we are going to decide what are they, what is the virtue of the future? You cannot conceive of freedom unless you have an idea of the future. You cannot con you understand that the connection between the two of you cannot conceive of a novelty unless you have an idea of the future.

Speaker 2:          00:32:25       And unless you have an idea of freedom, the notion of originality is actually even poetic. Originality is impossible unless it's tied to a certain idea of freedom. It treats you poses the more so that the attainment of freedom really means a poetic originality ideal of the future. The notion that things can be different if I am a slave to the past, if I'm a slave to a political order, if I am a slave to my own vices, internal as internalized as that quest can be, then I really have no freedom. Keto embodies one who refuses living if living means living in a state of tyranny to, uh, civil war violence and therefore to the possibility of a moral life. Okay, so that's easy to determine. That's easy to explain. I even think that the notion of the old man can be expanded. Dante wants to draw attention first of all, that somehow this search for the future, he's, it's, it's not, not an alternative to the past.

Speaker 2:          00:33:30       It grows out of the past so that we, we, he's rejecting the idea that there may be some sharp distinction between the two and that the seeds of the future I don't really contain in the past few years, such as an old man, a Cato. The third problem is the question of his being a pagan. And this brings me back to that, which is the project. Dante's project in the, in progress toward the project is that there is, he must make a careful distinction, which center Graston could not make in the city of God. Damn. We'll make it. That's his, that's Dante's, uh, target polemic or target are Gustin really distinguishes between the earthly city and the heavily city and the heavily city may live on earth, but it's really a pilgrim church going on told, uh, told the beatitude and the encounter with God. The earthly city is corrupt and in many ways, uh, not assimilable to the, the world of a, of the redemption.

Speaker 2:          00:34:32       This is, this is may if you are at another stint eons and you have very supple view of a, and may strike you as crude, but I don't think that it really, it really, uh, violates the essence of that dual idea between the earthly city and the heavenly city. Dante is literally talking against the Augustinian dualism. There is in nature that is within the pagan secular historical world. There are seeds that can become crucial for the making of the political, for the making of a new moral life that will be really consonant with not dissonant, with in a chord with the redemption and the Christian redemption that he will be actually seeking. Keep this very much in mind, a sign of this incredible tension time, the meaning of freedom, the value of the pagan world. The insistence on the secular as as a capable of producing some kind of a seed for the future emerges really in the second paragraph, wouldn't.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Finally a virtual tool bend, uh, to the, the harshness to temper the harshness of Keto says, look, let us go through bills. I know your wife very Italian. I know your wife and I'm going to go very back. This is to say, you know, uh, I know who you are, so do me a favor because I'll be doing that a favor. Let me go and Marsha, let Marsha. I would go there and they'll tell her what a great man you are. What a good man you are. What he's doing. He's appealing to Kato's affective memory and it is an appeal. It's a solicitation that Cato refuses. She can do nothing for me. He refuses to be determined by the past. You see the ambiguity's they're running through. Dante understands that you have to go some, the poet in the figuration understands that you cannot really have a sense of the future without being rooted in the past.

Speaker 2:          00:36:34       And then here you have Cato who can only make sharp distinctions. She can do nothing about me. I could tell you that this is a very, the appeal to Marsha, they appear to Marcia's memory for, for Cato can become also a cook is full of ironies. And I, I, I would only tell you or I will take us to too far a field. I can tell you that in effect in the history of Cato, Marsha had left, Kato had asked Taito to divorce her because she wanted to marry somebody else and that the death of the other, the other husband, Marsha asks Cato to take a bag and she will. And Dante is the accounts don't recounts this whole story in the banquet and views it as a sign of the extraordinary generosity of this man. So the th th th th there is all of that law in the, in the background of this reference to Cato, but from our point of view, then it is a question of the power of the power of memory and the limits and the limits of memory.

Speaker 2:          00:37:39       And then finally, um, uh, the, he will go home saying, giving some Mar Keto, we'll go on, uh, giving us some, some mum, uh, rules that he has to follow in the process of cleansing. You go and wash yourself from the stain of in. I, he will tell him and gird your loins. They will be there. Uh, he would mention a go to the desert of shore, uh, therefore, uh, go and, uh, uh, this is the last pattern of the dawn is the dawn song was overcoming the morning breeze, which Fred before it. So that I described far off the trembling of the sea. We made our way over the lonely plane, like one returns to the road. He is lost until he finds it seems to himself to go in vain when you were a part where the do resist the sun. And being in shade is little dispersed. My master, Jen's relate both hands out, spread on the grass. I therefore aware of his purpose reached toward him. My tear stains cheat. That's the ritual of purification, uh, which he had appealed. We must undergo. And on them. He hoarded, restore the collar, which have I did an in me, we came down on the Deseret shore that never saw men sale its waters after had experience of return. Whom are you supposed to over here? Here. What is the reference tool? Andy Buddy.

Speaker 2:          00:39:02       Absolutely. Absolutely. He makes it very clear. The Cato and your listeners out of the two pagans that he said difference, he intrudes. He in Sydney, Wade's a distinction big within the body of pagan culture. You listen to on the one hand and his own transgressive search for knowledge in the belief that it really, there is no knowledge without some suppression, which is, which is considerable and and worth would be worth considering. And on the other hand, uh, the, the, the experience of Keto himself. Now here we are here with that different at different pagan there he girded me as the other head bitten. That's a phrase that comes straight out of infinite 26 or marvel for as the lonely plant he chose such did spring up again immediately in the place of where he had parked it. So Dan has to gird himself that way.

Speaker 2:          00:39:54       Jordany man would, whenever they undertake a journey in antiquity, it all, whether this, the biblical journeyman or the Romans, the gird that they fought this Gerbil around themselves, uh, they, they, the gird their loins. It's, it's, it's, it's a moment of gone payment of, of self, right. And that, and that's the ritual he has to, to undergo. Uh, from my point of view though, the emphasis falls on the power of the natural world to the store itself because immediately, and it's an emblem of the resurrection here now, but it's still, we're still in the natural world. That is no, no element of grace nature. The, the, the plant in an inversion of what had happened in, in federal 13. Uh, the plan is, uh, is, arises again this born again, and then we'd come to Ken to, to, uh, the, the, the, the situation changes somewhat.

Speaker 2:          00:40:48       But, uh, let me just begin another point of, uh, it starts with another search for orientation. And I mean that in a, it's an easy pawn, the east, the Orient and orientation for the pilgrim. And now it becomes clearly Jerusalem and you will see the reason why it's going to be Jerusalem in a moment. Well, one reason why they didn't just say it immediately because has nothing to do with the, this has to do more with a, let's say the myth about then with the text is that hell and purgatory is at the antipodes of Jerusalem, uh, against the feet of Jerusalem. Jerusalem was known as the, the, the, the navel of the earth. And now we are in, it's in purgatory, uh, edits antipodes it's always starts already. The son had reached the horizon who's meridian circle covers Jerusalem. So Tillerson will become the point of reference with its highest Poland and night circling opposite.

Speaker 2:          00:41:47       It was issuing from the Ganges with the scales which fall from her hand when she exceeds the day, etc. I was white, the rosy Chico Federal Aurora with her increasing age where turning orange, we still beside the sea, those that ponder on the road, who go in heart and embody linger and extraordinary image of this location of being both being body and mind and the wear of a break between the two who have expectations and hopes of moving ahead. And yet they're kept in place by the heaviness of the body. And low is on the approach of morning. Mars glows or ruddy, uh, through the thick vapor. Slow in the west of the ocean floor swore appeared to me. May I see it again, a light coming so swiftly over the seat that no flight could make it match it. Speed. Uh, and here he sees a boat, a fast boat, um, bringing, carrying the souls of Penitence who, uh, reaching the banks of purgatory.

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       Uh, they're very opposite to what we saw with children's boat in how the boat of you remember of, of the sinful, uh, souls. Uh, and then an angel of gardens. And then as the divine bird came, told us more and more, he appeared brighter so that my eyes could not bear lines 38 a cast them down. Uh, and he came on the shore with a vessel source with the enlite that the water took in nothing of it on the poops too heavily steersman such as the blessedness, assuming that written upon him and more than a thousand spirits set within. And they sing a song he Nexi to Israel, the Egypt toe. So on, according to the vulgate one 13, it's the song we're in, which the Jews are remembering their exodus from the bondage, the slavery in Egypt to the, um, to Jerusalem. That's it. That's really the story.

Speaker 2:          00:44:06       This book of Exodus in Exito Israel, Egypt, you understand retrospectively that reference to Jerusalem that gives a kind of unity to the whole Canto. It's a song. It's a song that are, uh, a number of things about this. The only, the only text that Dante sites textually sites, he made references to the Bible all time. But the only text of the Bible that done through really sites literally in pigs from textual, it is always the book of Psalms, probably an acknowledgement that it's poetry. Uh, and, and that he responds to that poetry. But I spatially he does so and our only, because it's the probably the text where for the first time we have, we have a representation of subjectivity in western Western consciousness. It's the story of someone who is looking inward and finding out the diseases of, of, of self, the appetites that passion's et Cetera.

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       That may be what reasons in say is engaged in that kind of a, he himself appealed and was engaged as sort of quest. But there is another reason I believe because the psalms are basically lyrical recapitulations of the story of exodus. So that Dante's saying that exodus is the figure that the divine comedy is the lyrical representation of the story. The Biblical story of exodus that he too, that is human history is engaged in that search. A search from slavery to liberty. So, let me just pursue this a little bit from another point of view. In Canto one of Pro Victoria, we saw that the presentation of Roman political, moral liberty. Now we have an idea that the whole of history is really engaged in this exodus, a journey toward liberty, two types of liberties, a Roman one and the Jewish one which Dante wants to connect.

Speaker 2:          00:46:06       It is as if he understands that there are two traditions, both of which are based on a quest for liberty, that there is a sense of in both of them though in different ways, a sense of beginning that he must try to harmonize. He must try to explore and probe in depth. What do they mean and what are they about in one a kind of legal idea, uh, moral political idea of liberty, Cato that comes to a point of self destruction. And the other one, the question of spiritual exos, by the way, a second thing I can say about this reference to, uh, the, this psalm one 13, is that Dante uses it as the basis for explaining his use of allegory. You remember that I spoke about the allegory of poets and allegory of theologians and that the difference was the historical basis of the narrative, sort of exos for dentist historically.

Speaker 2:          00:47:05       Uh, true. It's an event. So this gives a kind of biblical Figaro Aura to Dante's representation or they go record a presentation at least. Uh, and the third thing has to say is that the story of exodus in many ways embodies, um, crystallizes the real intellectual issues of what is this photo of exos about horse. They leaving behind the house of bondage or as they call it, the house of bondage. Uhh, they taking along the gold of the Egyptians, which really means the secular knowledge. A secular knowledge is also part of what we must carry with us in the journey toward freedom. That's that's, but it also means that they stay in the desert. The Jews stayed in the desert for 40 days. They feel that they're abandoned by Moses who has caught up to receive the tables of the law. And what are their abandoned, they engage in idolatry.

Speaker 2:          00:48:11       This is the story of exodus story of the people caught between I dollar tree and revelation and promises and prophetic promises, prophecy and idolatry. And the ideology shows itself as a statement or as an experience of nostalgia. That's what the, the making of the golden calf is a statement and way of, you know, desperate is, they may be because they are now leader less and they will be for a while. Then they engage in a, uh, an act of a desire, a longing for at least the safety or what they perceive as the safety of their dwelling in Egypt. Mindless of the fact that the were in bondage. This is if safety, the safety of living where preferable to them even in, if that is a safety, uh, uh, provided, procured and in the shadow of a, of tyranny of bondage. So you see this as a, these are the concerns that Dante we'll have as it comes into a program.

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       Toilet. The whole Purgatorio is literally a journey of what we were looking back and forth between the future and the past and the future and the past, her rivaling with each other for the control of the mind of the pilgrim. Let's see how this is going to be, uh, developed. Uh, and I hope I have time to, um, uh, go give you time for, for, for questions because I, I'm, I'm really, I realize I'm saying a lot of things in there. A lot of things. I am not even saying the poem, The candle shifts from this grand historical concerns, this reflections on how the pagan world experiences beginnings and new departures only with an ideology of freedom and this idea, biblical idea of, of a new beginning, which is really a break with slavery, a break and, uh, the, uh, the retrieval of the idea of, of, uh, of freedom in a general one historical way.

Speaker 2:          00:50:22       Now it shifts the narrative shifts and the, it's, it's whole internalize the pilgrim moves within himself. And the first statement is that he does not know where he is. And that's an emphasis. This was a way of alluding to this exhibit exhibit predicament he has. He literally has, he does not know where to go. He already had indicated that his state of mind was as that that have one who with the mind keeps going toward some place but with a body his kept behind you remember that line which, which clearly dramatizes the split with a kind of inner self dislocation for the pilgrim and now he just is no meeting this penitent so souls who are as lost as he is, uh, about the place and they all ask him for directions which, which, which were they are singing in exit with there in that desert, the desert to be in the desert.

Speaker 2:          00:51:23       Where is the desert? This is where one is the desert. If you don't know which way to go, the desert is the unmapped space between Egypt typological speaking and Jerusalem. It's some space in between. I have no roots. You have no paths, there are no carvings and markers left for you. And so they ask him, you can you are lions sips and foreign if you know, show us the way to go up the mountain and virtual answered. You think perhaps we are acquainted with this praises but we are strangers. That's what it means to be an exile and that's what it means to write this poetry of exile. That Dante, we'll right this a pull, that Oreo is the place of the desert. There's a spirituality even of the desert and certainly the statement of the exit condition. We really don't belong here. We're always displaced and going somewhere else and the end up at the basis of the Dantes or religious longing there is the sense of displacement.

Speaker 2:          00:52:27       There is a sense of where we are somehow out of that our hearts are out of where they should be. We came but now we're a little while before you buy another road, which was so rough and hard that another client would seem to us as a pastime. The souls who had perceived from my breeding that was still in life turn Pale with wonder and this to a messenger who bears and olive branch that people crowd to hear the news and no one, he's a crush. So every one of his fortunate souls fixed his eyes on my face as if forgetting to go and make themselves fair. Now he then becomes the object of temptation for the penitent souls. They should be going somewhere. They should be going up the mountain and yet they stop where they are. So another, another way of thinking about forgetfulness and, and the sense of, uh, of, of uh, of a name of a place to, to reach.

Speaker 2:          00:53:24       Let's see how this is developed. I saw one of them come forward. There's so many, so much affection to embrace me that it moved me to do the same or empathy shades except in sandbars three times a clasp. My hands behind them and there's often brought them back to my breasts. Wonder, I think it was painted in my looks at which the shade smiled in Lubeck and I follow him, pressed forward gently. He obeyed miss then. Then I knew who it was and begged me that he would stay a little and talk with me. This little detail of the embrace, the field embrace is one of the three failed in braces and way of acknowledging for the pilgrim. And NASA had knowledge that the really the soles, you have no substance reality that we can grasp. Okay. Um, this is the first and there will be two more that I will talk about as we proceed.

Speaker 2:          00:54:14       He answered even as I love the my mortal flesh. So do I love the, uh, fried, therefore a stay? But thou, why are thou on this journey? Micah Sela Dante meets a friend of his youth and musician and musician who probably had even said to use it, not his own poetry, men from Sienna, clearly his died. So it's, it's uh, uh, to relieve the hardship of the journey as this is a parent. An exist are more a moment of indulgence, a way of a meeting with a friend, a little pastoral interlude if you wish, uh, to break up the, uh, the hardness of the desert and the implications of, of that metaphor. The world of, not the quest, but now the pause, the pause of, of refraction, the paws of relief, the aesthetic relief that this can give him my cassela to return at a time.

Speaker 2:          00:55:18       But why are you, uh, or take this road? But from the how has so much time being taken and he said, no wrongest than me. Uh, et cetera. He explains how he got here and die. If a new law does not take from the memory or practice of the songs of love, which used to quiet, oh my longings. They said that this clearly is a reflection on the power of aesthetics and on the limits of aesthetics made. Please do refresh my soul with them for awhile, which is so spent coming here with my body. And so Casella starts singing a song, which is a poem that Dante himself wrote and now he sets it in music as he probably may have done in this life. Love that this course is to me, my mind, he began then. So sweetly, the sweetness sounds within me stale and his sweetness is to be understood as the attribute of musical harmony.

Speaker 2:          00:56:19       I know the sweetness and I indicated this when talking about the, the is, it's always the language job of, of the Palette and, and, uh, the savoring a certain savoring that goes on with the gluttons here. It's really a musical attributes. This, the quality of the sound. Uh, and, uh, my master denying these people who were with him seemed to sec, it's contentious. If nothing else touch the mind of any, we're all wrapped into attentive to his notes. When low Cato, the venerable old man crying. What is this laggard spirits? What negligence, what the glaze, this haste to the mountain to strip you of the slough that allows God to manifest to you. Uh, okay. So here is an aesthetic, the, the uh, an anesthetic enclosure. Uh, the port listens to his own song with a little touch of narcissistic amputation there. His cassela is playing up to him, reassuring him, giving him a sense, this is you and I know who you are.

Speaker 2:          00:57:25       And they're all wrapped and they forget about the ascent. And then of course, Keto comes the ethical voice, the voice of the law. So you may have a kind of, you may even want to write about this scene as a sort of conflict between aesthetics and ethics. How are they working against each other? But one thing is clear here that Dante is forgetful of the real lesson that he had learned in the encounter with Keto. It just happened that Keto himself, therefore he intervenes. And His anger is, it's the anger of the teachers. But I just explained to you what the problems are. Cato, Virgil had approached Cato hope and had hoped that Keto could be swayed by the memory of the past in Cato had rejected the power of that memory. He of the, the affection or even in the pleasure of that memory.

Speaker 2:          00:58:22       Dante comes in Cantu too, and he's involved in, let's call it even an idolatrous moment, the moment where he just witnesses some things that he has been making, uh, that he has built, he has composed, is taken in by it, but essentially it that has the power to distract him from his own ascent. He has forgotten the reasons why he is here in purgatory. And so the whole program story begins with the s the explicit statement about the importance of new beginnings, new departures, the recognition that everything new and the future can only come out of some sense of the past. And then the discovery that the past can interfere, can intrude. And therefore the steady process of a continuous quest that continuous rethinking a opens up in front of the pilgrim and in front of us. Um, and the, the interesting thing and the, and he had, I stopped, Keto uses one word.

Speaker 2:          00:59:25       What kind of negligence is this? And you know what the word means? Negligence. We're all negligent. But what are we, when we are negligence, what does, what does the word called pain? Since they were talking about beginnings with pollution, but at the model j, which is the language of beginnings, negligence means not to choose what Keto is. Reproaching Dante and his guide and all the other souls is reproaching the power of poetry to produce this atmosphere of non choice. Ah, and obliquely that's then what his ethics is that we always engaged in an act of choice. He speaks from the perspective of freedom, which literature or the [inaudible] has the power to tame and somehow for a moment at least here neutralize. So you see the extraordinary degree of self reflection and self reflection as it from all points of view. And let me stop and see if there are questions and the hope to be able to answer some of this. Uh, um, elements in the introduction of prudent pouring.

Speaker 3:          01:00:47       Yes. He talks about leaving behind her so clueless. And they struck me about the arc of his intellect leaving

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       the barcode was with, it's called in English. Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:01:01       Is um, is that also a reference to past poetry tradition besides, I mean I read it as sort of, um, he's looking behind me right now. Yes. It is. It also reference to how he's leaving behind and excelling past, uh, past epic tradition.

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       The question is the metaphor, the beginning of Purgatorio when the, the, the poet, so he's leaving behind a such a cruel sea. Uh, the crew seems to be in this, actually we can agree easily add reference to two in fair. No. But then the question is, can it be also reference to pass epic, uh, uh, traditions? Uh, it could be, but you would have to be a little bit more specific about what you mean. The all this, say for instance, or the Aeneid, uh, journeys by see Dan pays the divine comedy is constantly imbricated with his other, um, poems. Uh, and in fact, uh, the great poem that he recalls a pass epic traditional is Luken. Uh, and he chooses Luca because Luca is, so I'm coming back to your car, your, your question and tried to, tried to welcome it and say that indeed the it, it's possible, but I have to explain why I think it's possible.

Speaker 2:          01:02:22       The Lukens Pharsalia is a unique text epic and the epic solution because it deliberately places itself as a historical or historical work that polemic of [inaudible] toward Virgil is that Virgil sure. He had been talking with was talking about the foundation of Rome. And for the Roman, there's nothing more historical than that. As you'll know, the Romans had the peace holds a practical people that will count. We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll calculate history from the foundation of the city. They never a scheme about the garden of Eden or be the host that's rioting about, uh, uh, unknown events in the past or whatever. Uh, the Roman starts with the foundation of the city, live it there. So, uh, Virgil writes about the origin of Rome in front of the point of view. He a historical author, but he, he mixes his historical accounts. It's so much mythmaking that Luken rejects the form of poetry.

Speaker 2:          01:03:25       And he writes in epic about the civil war. Luken, uh, writes about Caesar and Pompey, which clearly is a boy of other braiding and other more pressing civil war that between Anthony and Augustus and, um, and, and, and, and, and, and alluding to the one between Sula and Mario's, the whole sequels, civil wars that had punctuated and given it's, uh, uh, it's, it's, it's the quality and the, the, the, the, the distinctiveness of, of Roman Roman history. So, uh, in a way I would say that Dante is rejecting a certain type of a epic poetry, uh, that deals with, uh, some kind of generalized, a metaphorical account though. For instance, he's, he's, he's going to be Jason. He's going to be a knee as I'll give to keep her in mind. It would be a turn to, uh, at least in Canton one a turn to the historical world.

Speaker 2:          01:04:23       And we've making poor gatory part of history because that's really the secret or purgatory. Purgatory began by saying it's part of human geography, you remember, but not all of human history. Dante wants to make it part of human history. We really can go back to the garden of Eden if not directly through some reconstruction and shadowy, um, re figuration something that looks like there will be of the garden of Eden or something like that. Not really utopia about something can approach the older of the garden of Eden. I must have confused you with this, this answer and if so good. Thank you. Well of course not, but I think that I was going five different directions that, and I apologize if I did. Yes, journey

Speaker 4:          01:05:19       poetry has the power you want to, you can work your way to clarity through the beauty of the poetry. And then you were just talking about though, how aesthetics can get in the way and how you can have a neutralizing effect. And could you just talk a little bit more about the tension there? Like what do you think to the common rule which you should be able to let you act towards the action and then they'll still neutral?

Speaker 2:          01:05:39       Yes. Great question. The question is that I begin by talking today about, uh, the journey of poetry and really ended with the idea of the danger of poetry that are that aesthetics of confrontation that are the pure that the poet Dante has with a poetry of his own youth. Ah, so what gives about this tension? Since I'm talking about a tension between two modes of poetry, I claim on the one hand that poetry is for Dante, the way of knowing. And then he has seems to get in the way a scandal. It's a scandal. It really stomach makes us, makes him stumble. Uh, so what is this a, the connection between these two, these two forms? Yeah, that is, that is a really great question. I think that Dante understands that. Uh, first of all, let me just give him a great deal of credit.

Speaker 2:          01:06:34       By the time Dante writes, poetry was still by and large a little game that the province are poets were playing in the codes of pro Vance and northern Italy where little games about secret love stories, little games about hunting, et Cetera, or the great poems of the so called goal yards. The gluttonous one said the belly worship, Dante comes along and says, no, this vernacular poetry can really become the medium for knowing everything up. Everything that we can humanly can about ourselves, about God, and about all the things that we can, we believe in and the things that we would like to believe in, all the hopes and defeats that we have. So that's a great idea of what it means. And so it's from his point of view down to engage his poetry within the circle of knowledge of what I call the encyclopedic commpass of knowledge.

Speaker 2:          01:07:34       So he involves all the sciences, but at the same time that you asked me to think about that day, electric one is not conceivable without the other. In order to really know, the first thing that poacher has to do is show that it knows itself usually the way, the reason my poetry is it's treated as a, as a lonely art. You know that the, because this meretricious it doesn't sa it gives itself to everybody. Uh, I'm saying all of this builds the scene of canto to really recall a great scene. We haven't got time to go into that in recourse, in other grades in. And I think that Dante's really rethinking the famous opening scene of fuse, the consolation of philosophy, which I don't know if you have read, but I have mentioned it, but you will, you look like someone who would go to the library now and pick up the beer. It's, it's really, it's really a book. It's a no, I'm serious. It's really a book where the philosopher is sick

Speaker 3:          01:08:30       in bed.

Speaker 2:          01:08:32       He is, he does not know his disease and other to find comfort, he picks up a book of poetry. The musers go to him. What's up a book of poetry, which probably is what most people will do with the got the flu. It's time to read good poetry, right? And then all of a sudden lady philosophy your peers.

Speaker 3:          01:08:52       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:08:52       And banishes this musers get the hands, you hollered, he calls them of the theater because you don't give any real remedy. You just only provide provisional solace. So what [inaudible] is doing is, so the whole [inaudible] philosophy is really better than than poetry. Hey, way of recasting the old platonic oral as, as we know from even the republic, right between the debate between poetry and and and, and, and the, and philosophy. What Dante's doing this, no, no. Poetry may have this dangerous temptations, impossibilities. But that's what makes it part of its own self knowledge. I want to, I can not guarantee or promise that poetry will lead you to knowledge unless I show that the medium that I use knows itself. It knows its whole own temptations. It's known, it knows its home meretricious possibilities. You see what I'm saying? It always a comp one. It says, would you want me to highlight the reasons of that day elected that tension and that the only answer I can give is that one flanks, the other constantly. So the voice of Cato and the voice of Casella there at the same time, they belong necessarily belong together in, uh, the, the unfolding and the articulation of Dante's old Nah voice. This is, you know, you cannot expect to have one a while then. If this is really dangerous, can I have something else? No, no. It's not either or. It's both end the either or the ethical or the aesthetic and the ethical, uh, as if they were to a post forms just will not.

Speaker 3:          01:10:34       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:10:39       Other questions? I wish you had another hour here so that I could really talk about some of these details, uh, in the, in the, in the beginning of the poem. Well, since I hear none, no other questions. Thank you. See your next start.
