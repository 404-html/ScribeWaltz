Speaker 1:          00:01          All right. So I'm professor David Lummis and a professor Mazzotta asked me to come in and substitute for him today since he's traveling and can't be here. So I guess we'll get started and I just wanted to write since there was a midterm last time and remind you more or less of what he was talking about whenever you left off. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:27          okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29          The last lecture I suppose was about the relationship between spacious and Virgil, the specifically poetic relationship and the ambiguity that arises in the father son relationship, that stage between stations and virtual. So Stacy has recognizes the Centralia virtual for his own poetic career and his own moral development by saying through you, I was a poet and through you I was a Christian, but at the same time, um, his poetry challenges that have a virtual professional mounts up that concluded, you know, stating that, um, stages, stages. His poem is about a tragedy about the tragedy of birth. All right. While Virgil's is about the, um, the history making quality of the event of birth, that this would be, it challenged Virgil's account of, of the foundation of the foundation. And of history, but he grew as a poet and converted to Christianity by engaging with virtual zone ideas of history, specifically with the uh, fourth log.

Speaker 1:          01:46          And there there's a misreading. So the generative quality of, of Virgil's poetry did it, was it intrinsic in the poetry itself, but was based on stations to this particular reading of the text. Um, and today we're going to be talking about condos 24 and 26 specifically, but I'll be saying a few words also about is 23 and 25 as a kind of frame to those two con d. Um, and in these two condo is 24 and 26. Um, they can tease Canthi, continue the, um, the meditation on political relationships that were going on in 21 and 22 with stations.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Now the restaurant mounts out there in his book, the Dante, the poet of the desert, has pointed out that Dante utilizes the, figured out a method of reading history, uh, whereby the past prefigures the president in the future in a poetic fashion in order to understand, um, the genealogy of poetry of poets and in order to place himself in a typological genealogy of poets. Um, and then these Conti Dante is engaged in a kind of, in a sustained reflection, not sought, that says on literary history and the powers of literature to engender moral conversion and in probing the inevitable limits of poetic fictions. And there I quoted from his book, um, Dante poet of the desert now since 24, which you read for today, follows directly on [inaudible] 23 with a conversation between photos, it Donati and the pilgrim. I want to say a few words about 23. Um, especially regarding the relationship between, between poetry and gluttony. Okay. And although a number of Penitence are mentioned at the beginning of this Condo, Dante only speaks to two of them. Four days. It doe not the born on June to that Luca. And both of them are poets. And the first one is specifically a friend of Dante. Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:03          Um, now for is it or not? They do not for [inaudible]. Donati was and in Dante is youth. Um, like I said, a friend and they exchanged a series of recuperative sonnets in which they insulted each other back and forth. And it was filled with, um, with language of bodily sensation. And um, uh, I suppose in this Condo, the language of the conversation between four days there and the pilgrim, um, sheds a new light. The memory of it causes a bitterness in both full days and in the pilgrim. And the difference between the rhetoric of the two texts, uh, Mark's a new moral vision in the pilgrim. Okay. So blood before in these, in these sonnets, they berated each other's wives and um, and their, their vices and this condo, they recognize each other, they treat each other like brothers. So it's really a, um, [inaudible] formation of a poetic community that was in some sense distorted by these two songs.

Speaker 1:          05:16          Maybe these analogies. Six A son. It's three for each poet, um, in, in the, in this Condo, the glutinous are finished and disfigured by hunger and their pin hints right? And do not, these wife wears it on. His wife is recalled and she was treated with obscenity in the sonnets and she's remembered as it's steel and vista kind of woman, um, whose prayers ironically have helped four days. It arrive at the terrorist so quickly. Right? So in a, in a way, it really converts that kind of letting this bodily poetry into a different kind of moralized moralizing poetry, I suppose. All right. It corrects it. Now I guess the connection, another connection with gluttony is that, what is it along with a number of other Italian poets such as Jak one jeweled Yeti, um, it was probably the most famous was a burlesque poet and this is also known as Goldie odic poetry. So from Gulag Latin for wrote or for gluttony. Um, and so this oblique connection allows Dante to speak about poetry in this condo of gluttony. All right. Is the real connection is that it's a world, the whites, they're worldly type of poetry that doesn't look beyond itself beyond the concerns of the flesh, I suppose. All right. Um, I would like to point out at the end of this console, um, Dante remembers their ribald literary exchange with, with bitterness at lines one 15 at the very end.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Um, he connects the, the period of his friendship with the Nazi, with a dilemma back in the dark forest and come to one. Okay. Um, let's see if we got the right place. If that bring back to mind without ha without west with me and I with the, the president memory will be grievous still. So yeah, he's pointing out that he has a different perspective on that time of his life. Okay. He, that goes before me turned me from that life some days ago when the sister of him and I pointed to the son, showed herself around to you. It is, he that has led me through the profound night of the truly dead with this true flesh that follows him. His suckers have drawn me up, events, climbing and circling the mountain, which straightens you, whom the world made crooked. So the motor, I guess if it's of his, of this change that Dante experiences are both virtual and Beatrice.

Speaker 1:          08:10          So he's pointing towards what's making him, what's, what makes him different from what he was a few days ago. So, and they actually, the exchange with four days, there was probably not that long before the composition of the divine comedy. Okay. Or at least not that long before the, um, the fictional date of, of the divine comedy. Um, and this, in reality, I guess it was a prelude to how he dramatizes the differences between the, his poetry and that of his fathers and brothers, the ones that he meets in 24 and 26. Okay. That's just as a preface I suppose to what happens in 24 were junk. They really just juxtaposes his own style of poetry. Would that of his predecessors specifically embodied by born on June 3rd, I Luca. And it's interesting that the June who notices that Dante, um, is different, right? Because when I drink that Luca wrote a poem to we know we need to leave, we will meet in 26 criticizing how he had brought the terminology of the university and the terminology of epistemology and metaphysics and theology into the lyric of love. Okay. So it's, that's probably one of the reasons why boardrooms that comes out here, not necessarily that he was important for some specific reason to Dante, but probably because of that the fact that he, he came out and notice this, um, in public of weeding suddenly, okay. This change.

Speaker 3:          09:49          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          09:52          So I'd like to have a look at in the text when born on June comes out and addresses Dante. Okay. He says in versus 49 through 51. Um, but tell me if I see, hear him that brought forth the new rhymes beginning with ladies that have intelligence

Speaker 3:          10:18          love.

Speaker 1:          10:22          So it's born on June two who, who recognizes Dante and specifically by the first line in Kip it to the point that that basically makes the center of the VTN. Moreover the turning point and they'd be tenable. Eventual. Remember [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          10:38          MMM.

Speaker 1:          10:43          And cause in this, in this poem, it really marks the transition from a self centered poetry of love, where the poet praises himself obliquely by service to the woman, to the lady who he loves, and his transition to a poetry of praise that is mingled with metaphysical claims for the ladies to value. So it's, it's Dante is transition from a courtly lyric to a more philosophical lyric. Okay. Now Dante responds to two going on Juanita with a really beautiful, beautiful phrase, and he says, and I said to him, I am one who when loves, love, breathes in me, take note, and in that manner, which he dictates within, go on to set it forth. Okay, so this Dante is claiming his novelty, right? Um,

Speaker 1:          11:42          and at the same time he's saying he's linking his own writing of poetry to the activity of a scribe. Write. He says, I take note twin someone out when, when love dictates. Right? So He's, he's explaining his inspiration right in the Italian, um, the word for breathe in his speeder. Okay. And he takes, he dictates within Dante. Okay. Now this inspiration, I think it should, it needs to be understood. It needs to be understood in a theological man. It needs to be understood theologically. And as we'll go on, I'm gonna go on to talk about condo 25 and this, which explains this retrospectively, um, in a moment. But let me just say for now that it, that the words noto and like take notes and Italian and, um, deep data to dictate an Italian, um, point towards, uh, the, um, the inspiration as this breathing in as the Holy Spirit.

Speaker 1:          12:57          Okay. As a movement of love within the Trinity. And that Dante is explaining how, um, how poetic inspiration is really a parallel to the unity of the trinity. Okay. Um, this inspiration comes from within. Um, but it's like someone who dictates from without. Okay. Now in the monarch, and then we're not ikea. And Dante is, um, political treatise on empire. He describes God as the only dicks dot. Or the only person who dictates. Okay. So we have to understand this, um, description of poetic inspiration as one coming from, um, and internal instantiation of the divine. Okay. So there's a connection between this inspiration and the divine. Okay. Um, now one on junto follows up on this by professing to understand the not right, the not that kept him, um, and his like the, we tone it down, right? So Jack or Medallian teeny who is the notary, um, from arriving at that style at the tourist that begins at line 55, he says, oh brother, he said, now I see the not that held me, held back the notary and we tone it and me short of the sweet new style that I hear, I see.

Speaker 1:          14:27          Well how you were pins followed close behind the dictator, which is surely did not happen with ours. And he that sets himself to examine further sees nothing else between the one style and the other. And as if satisfied he went, he was silent. So we're not doing the things he has this perspective that purgatory gives him on his past life and he understands that not. And then the no though is also describe use to describe the sin of gluttony. And at the beginning of Canto 23. So here again, we have this lack of moral understanding. It's like a moral perspective in life being, um, paid for in the afterlife in purgatory. Um, okay. Um, but then so the poetry that Bono winter represents, um, it was the one that concentrated on worldly beauties and qualities. Like I said before, it feigned a service to the lady only to concentrate on the self of the poet and it never really went beyond, um, wouldn't beyond itself.

Speaker 1:          15:38          It was a self reflexive kind of poetry. Um, and in that sense I guess it could be assimilated with gluttony. Um, and I absorbed an imitative, what came with from without, without offering fourth, anything without being generous, such as the poetry of Virgil was in it. Um, it's interesting, interesting enough. Um, but not Giunta says him that brought forth the new, the new rhymes. So he brought the new rhymes. Fourth, he offered them out. Okay. So one on June is able to see the difference between the two styles of poetry at this point. But I think he doesn't recognize, um, the kind of uniqueness that Dante is, is claiming for himself here because he, he says, um, that your pins follow close behind the dictator. Right? So he's pluralizing what Dante says only about himself. He says in Italian II me sewing the wound care.

Speaker 1:          16:40          Okay. And people have pointed out that this, um, I am one who is both humble and that it's like I'm one of other, among others who do this, but it's also a, um, it's also pointing out it's his uniqueness. Others have pointed out that it, um, it echoes line three 14 of Exodus Eggo. Um, some queen soon. There's what God says to Moses, I am who I am. Who Am okay at this self reflexive [inaudible] me sewing the wound care is an expression of uniqueness. Okay. Couched in humble language. Okay. So Dante is really pointing out that he is, he is doing something unique with his poetry, um, that perhaps Bono junto doesn't really recognize the full extent. Okay. So if there is a school of the dogist steel normal, right? If there's this sweet new style, who composes the school right? Like the Sicilian school that proceeded it, which I'm sure Professor Maths Sophia talked about in relation to, they'd be tenable Alpha.

Speaker 1:          17:49          Um, then Dante is creating something new within that school. Okay. That's, I think what's going on here in those lines. Um, okay. All right. Um, so I suppose what, what Dante is doing in this condo is marking a extreme contrast between his own poetry and that of the people who came before him. Okay. Um, there is a line that divides these two schools. You know, the [inaudible] who was a Tuscan poet who imitated Sicilian poetry. This is [inaudible] who imitated a problem, sell poetry. He's detaching himself from them because of their lack of immoral purpose, I suppose, in their poetry. Which one I drink that recognizes retrospectively. All right. Now I wanna just wanted to point out as the, um, this sort of, as this comes, as this conversation comes to an end, Dante describes that, um, the [inaudible] 64 through 69, how the penitents depart, he says as birds that winter along the Nile, sometimes Nica troop in the air, then fly with more speed and go and file.

Speaker 1:          19:10          So all the people that were there facing round quicken their steps, being light with both leanness and desire. Okay. And as one tired with the running, let's his companions go on and then walks till the heaving of his justice. So relieved, so foot as it let the holy flock pass and come on with me behind. Okay. So I just wanted to point out the contrast here. The image of birds probably reminds us of the image of birds in Condo. Five of the inferno, right? With, they're just, the sinners were described as cranes who were being buffeted about by a tempest, right? And they kept returning to the same spot in a circle, like an internal return. Okay. Um, here, the same kinds of birds, right? This leads love. Poets are coming together in a troop and moving along together. And not only are they moving along together, they're moving forward.

Speaker 1:          20:09          All right? So there's a progress. That's a count that opposes the circularity of the, of the storm of birds in, in federal five. And this will come up again also in Canto 26. Um, now I know we didn't, didn't read it for today, um, council of 25 of purgatory, but I think it shed some light. I'm going to say a few words about it because I think it sheds some light on what Dante was talking about in relation to inspiration. Okay. We talked about that earlier. Um, now what, what happens here is Dante ass Dunkin's perplexed about how the centers can be punished with their bodies if they don't have bodies. So he asks this of status, right? So th the whole Condo, basically he has this of, of a virtual, I guess in Virgil says it's better stages, explains it to you. Okay. And, um, so the pretext of it all is how can this happen?

Speaker 1:          21:10          What is the physics of what does the biology of the soul basically in the afterlife, but what stations does in explaining this explains how God and genders the saw, how he, how he creates. So, okay. Um, now is it placing this discourse of the generation of the, of the soul and the body between two condos that are basically all about poetic inspiration? Dante think is drawing a parallel between, um, divine inspiration and divine creation and poetic generation and poetic creation. Okay. Um, okay. He's been using it as a parent. He's making a parallel between, um, poetic generation inspiration from, um, input, inspiration and the divine creation of the, of the soul, the inspiration of the divine in the creation of this. So I'm going to go on and explain what I mean. I'm just wanting to get that. Does that make sense? Okay. All right. Um, I'll slow down a second. Um,

Speaker 2:          22:22          all right.

Speaker 1:          22:25          So basically he's staging here, um, the relationship between the predecessors and new poets, so himself and his past basically. So he's explaining how he is born out of the past but is not imitative and is not, can't be a merely reducible to that past. Okay. Um, I can read a little bit of this. It's, um, it's a bit scholastic I suppose, but that's okay. Um, now I can read it all if you want. It may explain it better for you. He says at lines 40 Anthony at 38 I believe, 37 38 perfect blood, which has never drunk by the thirsty veins and his left like food that remove is from the table, takes in the takes in the heart in informing power for all the bottling members like that, which takes its course through the veins to become these further digested. It does since where silence is, is fitter than speech and then drops afterwards on another's blood in the natural vessel.

Speaker 1:          23:37          They're the one mingles with the other and the one fitted to be the passive and the other on the account of the perfect place from which it springs. That is the [inaudible] active and this, so United begins to operate first. Coagulating then quickening that tube, which forest material it has been, it has given consistency here. I think it gets a little bit more interesting. He says, the active force having become a soul, like a plants, but so far different than it is on the way and the other already on the shore then operates to the point that it moves in, feels like a sea fungus. And from that goes onto produce Oregon's for the faculties of which it is the seed. Now my son develops and spreads the force that is from the heart of the beginner within her nature makes provision for all the members.

Speaker 1:          24:28          But how from animal it becomes a child that they'll see us. Not yet. I'm going to skip a little bit more to the top of the next page. Open I breast to the truth that follows and know that as soon as the articulation of the brain is perfected in the embryo, the first mover turns to it rejoicing over such handiwork of nature and breathes it into it. A new spirit. He breathes into it just like the inspiration that Dante claim for his own poetry before. Um, it's spirit full of power, which draws into its own substance, that which it finds active there and it becomes a single soul that lives and feels and is itself revolves upon itself. So what I think is, is going on here is that

Speaker 3:          25:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:17          ostensibly, basically,

Speaker 3:          25:18          mmm

Speaker 1:          25:22          Stacy has describes the creation of the body or the biological creation of a body which comes from the mingling of bloods, right?

Speaker 3:          25:29          MMM [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          25:32          and then after that, how the animal that is created basically is given a soul, by God becomes a rational. It becomes a human being. And the human being, the human here is described, he said, just translates it as a child. But the word that's actually used as a fun thing now fanta would be basically just derived from the Greek word for speech. So fun. There would be a PR one who speaks. So how an animal becomes one who speaks. So humanity is, is defined in a sense by the fact that we can speak and reason basically.

Speaker 3:          26:06          Okay. Okay. Um,

Speaker 1:          26:11          and what happens here I suppose is that even though the father is the j, it generates the, um, the body, the soul is directly created by God. Okay. That, so that there's two kinds of individualities I suppose. You have the body and the soul and the soul is a, is a uniqueness that is directly created, inspired by God. So if we consider this poetically, even though Dante may have been influenced, right, in a sense created by the poets that came before him and the less he has some kind of direct inspiration that separates him from the poets that came before him, at least that's how I understand it. Okay. And they, I think it's connected. I'd done it points out the connections, especially by the word speed or he uses the word speed, our inspiration twice right there, they admit they imitate each other, they parallel each other. Okay. And the connection between fun thing, this, the child who speaks is a direct connection to language. Okay. The language of poetry. All right. All right. So that's, I think it explains rec retrospectively, what Dante is claiming in Condo 24. Okay. About his poetic inspiration. There's difference between his own poetry and that of that of his predecessors. Now Canto 26 and can pass on to come 26 he passes in to the terrorists of the last full. All right.

Speaker 1:          28:03          And here he meets his own self. He's on the stage to poetic father. Um, we don't, we need suddenly, and he has his father wrecking. He recognizes his father and his, he is a debt to his father and at the same time he was recognized as a brother by his father. Okay. So his, his individuality as opposed as recognized. The recognition is staged here. Okay. The mineral ratio, they paternal relationship becomes a fraternal one.

Speaker 3:          28:35          MMM.

Speaker 1:          28:38          So I guess what I'm trying to point out with this, the biological embryology, um, is that he can be seen as derivative and different at the same time. So he's the same and it's distinguishable at the same time. Okay. Now this condo is in sharp contrast to 24, I think because Dante wanted to distance himself from those pellets in 24 and here he wants to show, um, and similarity. He's trying to sit and assimilate himself in a certain kind of poetry. That was, uh, four, four, which metaphysics epistemology and theology where all central, okay. So it's a philosophical kind of love poetry. All right.

Speaker 3:          29:24          MMM.

Speaker 1:          29:29          And I think he also redeems this love tradition, which is in a certain sense was condemned and in fed no five. Okay. With Francesca. So this courtly love that was, that caused in a way, I suppose at least that and Francesca claimed cause her downfall, um, in saying that the gala halt was, um, was the book. Right. And in fact, no five here, he redeems it and he, he purges it ink. Is it okay. Um, we can start off by reading the Theresa that begins at line 94. Whenever he, whenever we'd up, we need, sadly identifies himself to the pilgrim, says such as in the grief of lice circus, the two sons became unseeing their mother again, I became, but with more restraint when I heard speak his own name, the father of me and the others, my betters, whoever have used the suite and graceful rhymes of love and without hearing or speech, I went on a long way in thought gazing at him and did not where the fire go near him. Okay. So Dante [inaudible], he, he loses his faculty of speech here because he's, he's an almost like a child before his father. Okay. So his behaviors or imitates his relationship to, um, to we need suddenly. Okay.

Speaker 3:          31:03          MMM.

Speaker 1:          31:09          All right. And I'll point out here as well that the, one of the, one of the main differences I suppose is between the, the two poets is symbolized by the casting of a shadow on the fire, right. So his act, that reality of his presence there and his body is what's really, it was with the physical aspect that separates him from the others. And it's stands in for the, um, the aspect of his poetry that separates him from the rest of it that rest of these poets as well.

Speaker 3:          31:44          Um, let's see, and

Speaker 1:          31:50          since we're talking about poetic genealogies, it's interesting that

Speaker 1:          31:57          Dante is, um, he refers to him as a father, but then we need sadly responds by saying, Oh, brother, he there whom I point out to the, was a better craftsman of the mother tongue versus of love and tales of romance. He surpassed them all. Okay. So in these, in these, what, 15, 20 lines? Dante as a child before his father and his den acquainted with his father by being a brother. So they're put on the same level and they're assigned another father. Okay? So the grandfather of the mall becomes the father and his father, I guess who's not named is note Daniela. Okay. Um, an important poet for Dante and remit, remit, throw us in the stony rhymes, which professor Metsul dimensioned. Um, Dante imitated him, irritated him in those, in those runs, he was a poet, famous for his difficulty in reading and, and underneath, it's very, very hard to understand.

Speaker 1:          32:59          An example of the thrombotic loose. Okay. Um, so and in the same paragraph in this and these same series of, of tercets paragraph in the English, again, we had the differentiation of um, the kind of school I suppose that Dante is, um, associating himself with and the other school which would, she wants to differentiate, differentiate himself because he says like out of note is different from the one from Limo Jay. So he is different from we Tony, we turn it on, right? So who was named alongside when on June and Jack and Woody Allen Teenie. So he's separating himself from um, and sort of aligning himself with a different kind of poetry. All right. Um, so let me gather my thoughts. He, um, I, so I suppose he reinforces the kind of genealogy that he wants to create for himself. All right.

Speaker 1:          34:11          Now this genealogy to I guess has its own consequences in the modern age because the word, the words in Italian for the better craftsman in New York. Fabro where the words with which ts Elliot dedicated the wasteland as her pound, as you probably know. All right. So this conversation here really becomes an emblem for happy political relationships, I suppose, which you can recognize your betters, recognize your forefathers, and at the same time come out with something that you recognize as new. Okay. All right. Um, and some scholars have pointed out that we didn't really, I don't think if we had concentrated on in federal 24 and 25 where Dante utilizes a number of metaphors from avid in Lucan and he has this, there's just, Topo is called the Tucky at noon quick be silent now, Luke, and be silent now. All of it, he says, and he basically steals from their lines without recognizing I'm okay saying that he is surpassing them, but at the same time as he surpassing them, he's using their own poetry to surpass them.

Speaker 1:          35:27          Okay. People have pointed out in these con d of the feeds that Dante is participating in the sin by stealing from orbit and Lucan and that this kind of poetic relationship, it was a negative one, right? That he's stealing the identity of the other. Well here we have a different kind of understanding of I'd poetic identity, right? We have one that, that recognizes the paternity of the, of the father, while at the same time allows the sun to come into his own. And this is coming into his own, um, is I think pointed out by, um, by Dante, the poet. Whenever you says then at line between Lens, uh, one 30, one 40, then perhaps to give place to others who were near him. He disappeared through the fire as though the water, as, as through the water, a fish goes to the bottom. Okay. So here the, the father moves out of his way so that Dante can go on. Okay. Um, and I guess he can progress okay. That he doesn't get in his way. Right.

Speaker 3:          36:39          Um, so

Speaker 1:          36:49          if Dante recognizes these people, these poets as his predecessors, um, how does he differentiate himself? Like how in this content and does he differentiate himself from them? Um, I think we can look at it through the Lens of contract 25. Um, we're the paternal virtue. Um, the cell or the generation of the slow granted, the paternal virtue, it's place while simultaneously claiming claimed a direct creation of the soul by, um, the spy ration of the Holy Spirit. I think Dante isn't poetic individuality, um, rose out of the artifice, the style that they concentrate on here, this sweet deck deed mortar, this sweet sayings of love that he attributes to it we need to sell. So it grows out of the stylistic artifice that these two poets represent our note and um, and Guido to form something new, a new kind of speech and new kind of poetic speech that's imbibed with the divine, that's guided by theological

Speaker 3:          37:56          Gordon moral meaning. Um,

Speaker 1:          38:01          and I think we can see this

Speaker 3:          38:03          and how the, um,

Speaker 1:          38:07          how these pair of poets are our cleanse and how they're represented in this come to him. All right. For example, we need, sadly, when he first calls out to Dante, before we know who he is, before he's even identified himself, I think it's around line 17

Speaker 3:          38:22          following, um,

Speaker 1:          38:27          he's, he's uh, he says, oh, thou that ghost behind the others, not from tardiness, but perhaps from reverence. Answer me who burned with thirst and with fire. Okay. Now the line in an Italian is and focal the door. All right? Now this is a direct quotation of we need Sally's on poetry. Okay. I'm in a sign it which he says in grand piano and Foco out of town. Okay. So I'm in great pain and fire. I burn. Okay. So in Foco outta those basically repeated verbatim. So the love poet who's burning for his, for his lady metaphorically, and his sonnet is now burning literally, and the penitentiary in the like the penitent fire, um, that's purging is sin. Okay. Um, so I think this punishment shows how the perspective of purgatory is really modifying, giving us her moral sense to the love poetry that gradient sadly belong in this school of led poetry. Think when you say belong to, okay.

Speaker 3:          39:35          MMM.

Speaker 1:          39:38          Another thing that differentiates them, like I said before, with Dante shadow showing that he's actually there and that they're in his body in flash points to something else. And that is that his lady is actually the beginning of it. It started a chain of grace, right? So that there is a connection to his, not just a metaphysical connection or epistemological connection and value to his lady, but a theological value as well. Okay. Since he's like, he says at line 58, I go up hints, no, uh, no, not to be longer. Blind lady is above who gains grace for me, by which I bring my mortal part through your world. So what these poets couldn't recognize in their own lifetime, Dante is able to, because of his poetry, this bringing together that he does, which is actually hit the newness in the new sweet, new style, I think, um, which isn't just a metaphysical, but it's the illogical. Okay.

Speaker 3:          40:46          MMM.

Speaker 1:          40:49          Did it put it in another way if for greening? Sadly are, no. Danielle, we don't have on candy who's not mentioned here. All right. Um, again, um, if for these poets, the lady was a philosophical or intellectual phantasm, I suppose, um, we're Dante, she's a real woman who enacted a real change in his life. Okay. Who did that? And that caused a chain of grace to descend into his own personal story. And his poetry, I think seems seeks to close the gap between the metaphysical, theological reality of God and the historical contingent of history and Dante, his own personal story and that history. Okay. So love poetry for Dante takes on an entirely new meaning here. Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:44          And I think we need to at least shows that he understands this difference with a perspective that purgatory gives him towards the end of the contract when he asks Dante to say a paternoster for him to Christ whenever he enters heaven. Okay. So it's really a coup, a conversion, I think of, of love, poetry, a purgation of the worldliness of love poetry. Okay. Um, and finally I want to say we're going to end a little bit early because I actually have to run to another building to teach right after this, um, my own class. But I want to conclude by saying a few words about our note. All right. It's, it's very peculiar that Don, this is the only place I believe in the divine comedy where, um, and other modern romance languages quote is that quoted. Um, it's not Italian. Basically. I could be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure it's the only place I'm now out was, was famous, like I said, for is obscurity.

Speaker 1:          42:49          The extreme difficulty of his ex, his poetic expression and hear what has done they do to him even though he, he quotes him and the original right, and he didn't really write these lines. These lines are done things, but what he does is he makes this difficult hidden poet come out in the open, right to quote him. Um, he says so much, I don't know. Note Seth so much. Does your courteous question please me that I neither can, nor would conceal myself from you. I am, are not who weep and seeing as I go, I see with grief past, past follies and see rejoicing the day I hope for before me. Now I beg of you, buy that goodness, which guides you to the summit of the stairway to take thought and do time for my pain. And then he hit himself in the fire. That refines it.

Speaker 1:          43:48          Okay. So there's a little bit of a, Dante's playing here with, with our notes on language, if he was a difficult poet and poet of love, um, besides Dante makes them really come out into the open and say, what are you, what are you saying? So, um, and here also typical words from the problem Saul, um, traditions such as the value and now the follower, Schwab, um, Cortez and shutdown, they all take on different kinds of meanings that before the, the valor of value of the, um, of the love poet was not what it is here, right? It takes on a completely different meaning in purgatory. Okay. So he really stages in our notes on words, the purification, cleansing, and bringing out into openness of what loved poetry should really be, where it should really lead you.

Speaker 3:          44:53          Okay. Um,

Speaker 1:          44:56          and I guess to conclude,

Speaker 3:          44:59          mmm.

Speaker 1:          45:07          I want him to say that in the next condo you'll see Dante submitting himself to the same kind of purgation as these poets. If these poets are cleansed by this wallet, by this fire that refines them, he ended up passing through a wall of flame in order to get to where you can enter into the, um, the, uh, the terrestrial paradise. Um, so that he's in reality cleansing himself of the same kind of issue I suppose. All right.

Speaker 3:          45:46          MMM.

Speaker 1:          45:51          And I guess now I can take a few questions if,

Speaker 3:          45:55          um, you have any, hopefully it wasn't too disjointed the lecture, but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have or try to,

Speaker 2:          46:21          yeah. And to bring critical eyes at the patients that line. I'm wondering sort of looking at later to cancer and then you have the proper relationship, I mean, station sort of slowing, turning started going again.

Speaker 1:          46:59          I think you can reconcile them. I mean, whenever Dante, whenever he, he meets me and sadly he's silent, right? He doesn't automatically make himself, he doesn't move his father out of the way stages. And Dante both know if I'd done that, Virgil is not going to be able to go the whole way. They know that he's only going to be able to lead them a certain amount of the, of the, of the trip, of the journey of the journey. Right. So,

Speaker 3:          47:26          mmm.

Speaker 1:          47:30          So I guess I would interpret it as an act of reverence, just like Dante is silence whenever he meets. Um, whenever you give me squeezing sadly is an act of reverence that he doesn't push them out of the way he does it, trample them. He's not in a hurry, I suppose. So does that make, does that make any sense? But I think it, I think it's, well you can interpret station says if you want to see him interpret that as him slowing his way on the way to God, basically, then you could interpret it as an act of reverence to the person who allowed him to actually be there and not in limbo. Right. So that, that's how I would, how I would interpret it. I suppose, um, that Dante in this and 26 is referenced to his, to his father's at the same time as he's showing him, that he's showing how he's moving beyond them by giving a theological meaning to two. They're questionable. Worldly love poetry. So to answer your question,

Speaker 4:          48:38          hmm. When Dante talks about the inspiration which you've identified as the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, is he making love synonymous with the Holy Spirit? And if so, um, don't, looking back at the beach in new and when he personifies love in the masculine, um, I've always sort of thought of in literature, you read religious poetry and stuff, the Holy Spirit's often sort of a feminized. Now are those things, um, one in the same to him love and the Holy Spirit,

Speaker 1:          49:16          I think there that he's thinking of. Let's see. I think, I think in that, at that point he's thinking of love. Um, I think Thomas and Saint Thomas Aquinas mentions love as the purse, like a procession of love as the movement of the Holy Spirit within the trinity between the father and the son. So that both really are within, I participate in the same spirit. So yes, I think in that spot he is really talking about love as the Holy Spirit as this kind of inspiration or at least as, as parallel to it. It's ambiguous, right? He says he doesn't really say that love is the Holy Spirit. Does he? He, he's purposefully ambiguous I think because love poetry always has that, the possibility of leading you astray because it's an aesthetic practice, right? It's, it's dolce, right. Sweet. So I think that, that, that, uh, um, that yes is talking about love as the Holy Spirit, you know, as this divine love. But he's also talking about, so I guess in reality that, that there is a connection between, you know, the contingent historical world and the metaphysical world of God. Um, but then he leaves it ambiguous because it can always be misinterpreted it and the aesthetic can always lead you back down to the terrestrial realm. Okay. So does that, does that make sense? Okay.

Speaker 2:          51:00          Oh Griffin. Why do you think, or what do you think is the significance of the fact that, uh, the biological discussion of guide reading this goal, the fact that that's handled by stages and that not, they really highlight that by saying yes, they just say if it's very good as well, that he explained that that one was [inaudible] not permitted to know God. It's a good editor if they'll speak about the vinyl. So I don't want to get out of that, but, uh, I just couldn't understand why. Yeah. Species.

Speaker 1:          51:48          Okay. Well, I guess if, if, if the question really had been about what is the nature of the soul, right? Like what, like what, what is Aristotle saying? And the Dyneema about the, maybe a virtual could have told them about that. But the actual question is what does the nature, how does the soul live in the afterlife? And that is entirely Christian question. That's based on a Christian theology. So I think the fact that, um, that Virgil defers to Stacey, thus there is showing that is connected with the fact that, that the question is the actually about, you know, the afterlife and the afterlife is specifically a Christian context. That station is permitted to know and not virtual. Right. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 2:          52:33          Yeah. Capacity

Speaker 1:          52:35          technically. But I think the fact that he asked her, they asked virtual first. I don't know, maybe he's, he's saying that that's, it's actually in Aristotle, you know, this idea of the immortality of the soul when, after that it's actually there and, um, perhaps virtual could answer it, but then Virgil differs to stations because it's because it's a theological question that he's not privy to. Is that okay? All right. Well, we're going to end a little bit early. I hope that's okay. Second, go change gears here. Alright. Um, thank you for your attention and for putting up with me. All right.

Speaker 2:          53:16          Yeah.
