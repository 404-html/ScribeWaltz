Speaker 1:          00:00:02       I the allies that we read from assignment to assignment and part two, because we read in a very selective way. I know that a lot of gaps in the, in the, in our readings, I never really have tried to share with you the idea that, that he's align and now that they've line their conceptual line running through the poem, the candles, I looked discreet units, poetic units, uh, without much relationship worthy. The links are to be found symmetrically maybe with Qantas fall apart from the cancers that we're, we, we, we are reading. I think that there is a continuity, uh, going through or through many of them and there is no data. For instance, between the cantos 15, 16 and 17 of paradise we read last time and Kansas of 17, 18 and 19. That is actually a thematic expansion of some of the issues that Dante racers in the heaven of Mars, um, to begin with.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       Cancer 77, 18, uh, Dante in Canto 18 is still in the having of marsh and he meets and he lists, I know that I did not, the number does not appear in your, in your syllabus, but you know, uh, just bear with me so that I can, I can, uh, go home. We decide this. And he just lists the number of, uh, a warrior souls who are Wa figures, heroic figures, the heroic lives, uh, very much like catcher Weda himself who appears is one of the blessed from lines forward. In following of Canto 18, he mentions he sees and he mentioned, uh, Joshua Biblical figures, Joshua and Judah Maccabee years. And then he goes on a mentoring medieval figures. Uh, Charlemagne. There's clearly he's justifying retrospectively, uh, the whole issue of the Crusades to which catch a weeder took part in, which can really be brought back to Charlotte mains, uh, experience in France and in Spain against them.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Awesome. So he mentions it lists a Charlemagne and of course his power. Then the great, the so called the Achilles like invulnerable Roland who however dies at [inaudible], which is a the side of the war between Muslims and Christians. And he dies because of the Hubris that characterizes his wife, uh, the Hubris of not wanting to blow, uh, the bugle that it would be heard by Charlemagne and Charlemagne could have come to his rescue, as I have probably said before, that became in the western imagination and most traumatic experience, a traumatic experience because it showed the, uh, that the myth of invincibility of the Christian, of Christian real Christian Europe was simply that an illusion, uh, to be turned into rubble by the invading of Victoria Sa, uh, Christian armies. And then he goes on mentioning the figures of the second crusade, uh, 1109, the Godfrey of Bujo. Uh, and, uh, I figure a Norman who defeated actually that Muslims in Sicily, uh, the discard Robert this word and brought about in the early 19th century, in the late ninth century, has about 75 years.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       The Muslims were there. The, the, the expulsion of the Muslims from, from Sicily. Uh, so we, we clear thematic thread between the previous cancers. And this can too is the question of what is a heroic life. And the heroic life can even involve a defeat as in the case of Roland it in price, however heroic life clearly low that he said, typology that runs from Joshua's defeat of uh, and, and seizure of the, of Jericho. You know, this is the great, the, the, the, the, the epic Biblical story to whiskered contemporary history, almost contemporary history for, for Dante, it implies really, uh, uh, division. It implies a heroic life, which is the, they, the, the power to establish a and live for a cause, which is going to be for Dante to just coast. But it's a cost that brings about divisions. So it's not, uh, a heroic figure is not necessarily a figure that would unify a and cut across, uh, barriers and, and individuals on the contrary.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       But Dante's indicating that it's supposed to, the, there is a possible heroic life on, to, uh, a giving of oneself to a cause much larger than consults. We could just leave it at that. Okay. Uh, and we'll come back to this, uh, this issue in a moment. What I would stress and in, in, in a few minutes, what would stress though about this particular, um, particular scene is that Dante is really a way of divisions, a Whir of divisions, aware of the need even to separate, uh, what is mine from what is not mine, what is hours from [inaudible]. So it's, it would seem, he seems, will be perpetuating

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       a myth that's, uh, uh, that or an idea that some might find it objectionable that indeed the separation is dangerous and it's in itself caused by war. And the cause of wars, you know, this is the, the objection to this, uh, this problem. It's not the only time that Dante is a establishing divisions. When, when I've been talking, uh, uh, over the past few weeks about, for instance, uh, divisions and boundaries that Dante establishes even when talking about continents, you remember that, uh, in Canto six of paradise, uh, when there's the story of the Eagle of the Roman Empire, a dentist goes on talking about the periphery of Europe where the Justinian and the bird of the empire had Nestle's, uh, the east, the eastern part of the empire that was the periphery of Europe. And we have been talking about the, the whole, uh, how in, in, in Canto 12 of, uh, of paradise meeting, uh, Dominic, uh, uh, Saint Dominic Dante talks about the western part of Europe and goes out of their way to mention this already.

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       So they are always divisions. There are always barriers. He seems to believe that Rome and the history of Rome, uh, really escapes this logic of separation and then affect this. I know that I mentioned to you in a Monarchia that political tract, he writes, he fast stress the fact that nes is really enrollment and not, for instance, he cannot really be thought of as a nation, which he was Norgen he be thought of as a European. And he stresses the fact that he has a kind of, some, there's a sort of a universalizing history in him, a universalizing impulse in the measure in which he may read three women from three different continents craves from Asia, Dido from Africa, and Levenia from, uh, from Europe. So he does distinguish between a kind of, sort of, uh, the history that transcends barriers, but also an idea which is really heroic here of a over history, that manager, what keeps barriers that this, that these are people who fought at the Crusades. This is the, the, the, the many of them. So certainly not Joshua and Judah Maccabee use, but, uh, Charlemagne nor the Crusades, but against them. I was on a Roland, uh, but, uh, Godfrey of your and so on. And we'll see what the consequences of this may be. Now another conceptual thread. I'm, I'm really going around two or three. Uh, I think I'm keeping two, three themes in my head now, another conceptual threads between 17, uh, and uh, and the, and the remaining

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       part of a 18, 19, and, uh, 18, 19 and 20, which is the heaven of Jupiter, uh, is the question of a very abstract question. I've done tasks. What is a place? And that was the underlying problem in [inaudible] 15, 16, and 17 and 15, 90 twice to determine whether his history could be reduced to the boundaries of his own native town and decides that that was no longer possible for him to conceive. Uh, the famous chronicles, he, he tries to figure out, uh, uh, where exactly he can be in the history of, uh, in the midst of Florence himself. It's a itself and decides that he is an exile. That was the final prophecy of culture. Weeder. Exile is a word that it means it's Latin word, uh, in Italian and or in English it comes to being out of one's own soil. That's what the meaning is.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       So that in the Middle Ages, they never really thought of. Exilis is just a spiritual condition. There's to say, I feel this located, I am, uh, my, my personal existential predicament. Is that a feeling up, I'm out of it, that I don't belong or that kind of, that was not the conventional understanding. Dante changes this meaning of exile in making it into a spiritual condition. It's the condition of, it's the precondition for his writing poetry to begin with. So that poetry and exile seem to be, uh, going, uh, going to here in 18, the real issue that he raises is what is it place? Okay, I am an exile. I do not belong anywhere. Uh, what is it, what, what, how do we understand here? And how do we understand their, uh, what does it mean? What are these terms? What, what, what? Um, at any rate, so he starts and he enters now and two can talk with the remaining part of the Ken to 18.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       He enters into the heaven of Jupiter having a white light, which he links with geometry. You know what a geometry is a science, very complex science. It encompasses what it means is the measurement of the earth. Uh, it's the whole worth that you want can measure with medieval, medieval George's. It means, it implies the presence of perspective within it. Uh, with the idea that a geometry is what regulates the idea of space and the, the, uh, arrangement of space. It, it implies altimetry, it implies the measurement of the depth and so on. Uh, it is, as you know, traditionally linked to ethics. It's has a profound intimate linkage with ethics because for the simple reason, well, uh, when done to discuss this justice for instance, in Cantos, uh, in, in, in Fab, no, he distinguishes between a distributive justice. You remember in federal seven, the, the goddess for tuna who manages to distribute a, with some idea of him of, of impenetrable or Colt equity, a cold justice, the goods of the earth, or she's blind folded and uh, uh, moves the wheel around the, so that can be some kind of a uniform.

Speaker 1:          00:12:26       If you are up, you're not going to be up all the time, you may be down, et cetera. And if you are down, you eventually, if you are on the shift, the curve of fortune, you are going to be up. It's a sort of, uh, uh, other theoretical notion of equity. You know, if you have, sometimes you have five, then you lose three and you get to have to whoever has one we'll get to et cetera. The other form of justice was also geometric justice, which tend to describes in the so called rule of the counterpart counter passion in the country pass. So in fair, no, 28, when he has to establish the relationship between crime and punishment, it could not be an even one, you know, one and one. You cannot park someone's high because someone has pluck your eye. That's not necessarily justice.

Speaker 1:          00:13:14       You cannot cut someone's arm off because you have a perpetrated that crime or kill be killed because he has to have been killed. There should be some kind of proportionality, uh, the arguments. So the idea is the geometry is always part geometry. In fact, uh, uh, uh, the, the is, is, uh, is, is related to ethics simply because it's a, uh, it's extension always implies a point, which is the beginning of a geometric reflection always implies the existence of other points. It establishes relations. Therefore, that's a, that's the language. So, or in this candle, Dante discusses primarily justice. Okay? What is justice? That's the idea that runs through this. The other thing that you have to be as you read this cantors, and I hope you read them with care, um, and I will not say much about it, is that, uh, uh, he deployed Dante deploys the language of geometry. Now, you know that this is a technique of his, if he were dealing with the arithmetic, he, we'll do a music who will do that. But I just want to give you a few, a few words,

Speaker 2:          00:14:26       samples of, uh, of this. Uh, uh, this, this is yours. For instance, uh, uh, just letting me open here in, uh, uh, the notion of a god, the geometer for the, uh, he will go on, uh, uh, talking, for instance, this is in, uh, uh, can tall, uh, 19, uh, uh, Canto 19, um, anywhere really like [inaudible] look at this, uh, uh, the primer will, which is self good from itself. The supreme good neighbor was moved, whatever a with it is in that measure, just the language of measure, no created good draws it to itself, but rain fourth ray, which in Italian is both radius. It's the ray of sunlight, but also the radius of a circle are, creates a good as the stoke circles. There it goes. Even the, the, the various shapes, circles over the nest. And then a little bit further down wheeling it, sank then spoke cetera.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       Wheeling again, circular, a circular motion. And, uh, and, and, and this continues, a literary continues throughout the, I want to, to find for you the image of, um, uh, the, uh, the image of, uh, of, of, of the compacts that, uh, I thought it was in Canton 19. I, it's not. So I, we'll, we'll get to that. We'll find it. So the number of this, uh, uh, this, uh, uh, geometrical terms. However, the most important thing here in Kendall 19 is that as soon as he enters the heaven of geometry, now we encounter in the, I'm sorry, in Canto 18, he, we, we, we come across a play, a divine spectacle. It's, it's, it's all 12. Uh, uh, the heavens are a sacred theater where God will go on speaking to human beings by using to us on earth by, uh, by using the souls of the blessed.

Speaker 2:          00:16:44       This is, uh, um, uh, this is the, the, the passage I saw lion canto 18, nine, seven and following us. So in the torch of Jove, the sparkling of love, that was their trays out. Our speech to my eyes. And this birds reason from a river bank is if rejoicing together over the pasture make of themselves now around flock. That's a geometric image for you. Now another shape. So within the lightly lights, holy creatures, we're singing is the fluid made themselves in the figure, the figures they formed. Now d now I know l first singing, they moved to their own notes, then becoming one of these shapes that posts for a rental and were silent. Um, within the, the, the having a majority, even the letters of the alphabet, Joe Geometrical lines, the same circle of the, uh, the two, uh, the perpendicular line of the l and the perpendicular line of the eye.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       They'll do. We are, we are, we really discover that the beauty of geometry underlies the rigor of the alphabet, so to speak about more importantly, we discovered that this souls that disposed themselves in letters. I really, uh, the way, God's way of speaking to us that the language, Dante, that God uses is the language of human beings. We are the syllabus. We are the letters disposed in order to convey this, uh, this whatever God's message may be, the show themselves then in five times seven vowels and consonants. And I noted them severely and what they seem to me to mean, the league eater, you stitch them, they spill out, align, taken from the book. A verse from, uh, the book of Wisdom, love, justice, delegating [inaudible]. You who Josh, who judge the Earth. That's another reference to the actual ultimate measurement of geometry. The earth. I just, that's the meaning of a geometry, the measuring of the earth.

Speaker 2:          00:19:00       So, uh, uh, geography in a certain way is part of, uh, the world of geometry. Then, then Dante goes on describing a metamorphosis, how on the m of the fifth word, they kept the oldest of the Jupiter same, their silver pricked up with gold and that's what the hot lights descend on the very summit of the M and settle there singing, I think of the good that draws them to itself. Then as with burning logs are struck, rise in numerable sparks from which the foolish are accustomed to make auguries. So more than a thousand lights appeared to rise again from there and to mount some, uh, some much, some literal, this hundred kindle them appointed when each ad set on that's place, et cetera. Uh, I know that some of you are working on the aesthetics of collars. I would point out the scene to you and the complications of color, the white of Jupiter, the gold of the letters, the red of the flames.

Speaker 2:          00:19:57       Ah, there is a kind of chromatic, chromatic deployment, dramatic elements within this, uh, this grand spectacle, uh, Dante's indicating directly and indirectly they this chromatic, uh, uh, symbolism. So this is what we are, what, what, what w the way the heavens speak to us on earth and to the, and those and the rulers of the earth. Uh, and then Dante goes on in the next Canto 19, uh, wondering what is this idea of justice? What does it mean? Um, oh, he last Canto 19 clients 28. I know where the doe, the divine justice is mirrored in another room of heaven. Yours apprehends it without a veil, you know, with that intent has been prepared to listen. You know, what is that doubt, which is so old. If a fast in me, he's hungry, Dante's hungry to know what divine justice is and what are we here is, uh, uh, the faculty, etc. The, uh, the, the bird or the ego goes on saying he that turned his commpass. That's God as the geometer an image that clearly yet

Speaker 1:          00:21:27       goes to biblical texts. One is of job 38, the famous passage, some of you may know Dante terms with repeatedly, where were you when I drew the boundaries of the earth? Oh, that's the geometrical, they, they the, the matrix, so to speak. Uh, I mean it was the age of, of, uh, of, uh, this, uh, metaphor of a god, the geometer and the other one is in the book of Wisdom. Uh, um, the, the, that goes on talking about, uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       I was there with him and that was his delight when he was drawing the circle around. The deep that's in the book was a two, two biblical passages that insists on this, uh, both a geometric and then aesthetic it theater. The idea that to the shapes of the world are really representations of, is this perfection of God's geometry. There are two metaphors. The dentate goes on, uh, deploying. But let's see what the substance of the argument now is. He then turned this compass. You know, we understand what he uses, the word compacts and the image of the compass that's clear, not remain in infinite access. That's to me another geometrical language though. The two words are slightly redundant because access means the, the uh, the eight something which is measure less. Ah, AH, the, the, the language of measure, the language of, uh, uh, accounting and the language of limits is set against this idea of a, something, not, not finite, something that escapes the, the logic of geometry. Okay. The logic of measurements and Infinitech access. In fact, I find the phrase deliberately redundance is also an only infinite, but it's also excessive idea of the infinite, uh, to drive, drive the point home. Um, you, uh, manifest, could not make his power to be so impressed on the whole universe. Even the Word Universe is, uh, as a, uh, as, as much as the poetic I, uh, uh, term we speak of verse in poetry

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       and that wonder how many of you have ever wondered whether that's that word come from, it comes from geometry. Cars in price, it turning, you know, you come to the end of the line and you turn and you draw geometrical figure. And so that's the universe. It's one tourney. It's this fear. You can have a hemispheres, but the two hemispheres make the universe.

Speaker 2:          00:24:07       No, these are all as you see, uh, uh, I hope you enjoy them as I enjoy them telling you about, uh, uh, about this and improve this. The first proud spirits Lucifer. Now that's geometry of the soul. Oh, the first, the first proud spirit who was in the, you know, Dante connects pride and geometry or perspective as we said before. Um, the first proud spirit who was in the highest that was highest of all creatures,

Speaker 1:          00:24:38       fair and ripe with a great adjective. Uh, uh, Lucifer falls and ripe because grace in price or ripeness, ripeness, the idea that you are ripe when you have been touched by grace, right? And it says, all

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       one could say using another, referring to another text, not by dance, through, uh, through, not waiting for light. That's Lucifer from which of this play that every lesson needs is to scan to a vessel for the good, which has no limit and measure. I'm not going to indicate that anymore itself by itself. That's so vision which must needs but be one of the rays of the mind of which all things are full cannot by its nature we have such power that it should not perceive its origin to be far beyond though there appears therefore, and that seems to be the um, the essence, the brunt of the argument. The site that is granted to your world penetrates within the terminal. Justice is the eye into the c four. Though from the shore it sees the bottom in the open sea. It does not. And yet the bottom is there, but the depth conceals it. Uh, the idea that uh, we can see justice only when we have a very superficial and we see just to see the, the, the bottom of the, of the sea when we are near the shore. Only when we have a superficial understanding of do we do we do we see the bottom. Otherwise we don't. God's justice is imponderable and unfathomable as the sea floor can be out in, uh, uh, out of, uh, away from the shore. There is no light there, but which comes from the clearance on and the changes and then done

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       complicates the issue a little bit. And he really asks, where is the justice? Is Justice Limited to a place to a continent, to the economy of Christian Europe? And how is it related to other places? We have an ocean of what nowadays we call our parity. You must have heard that term. The other, the idea of the other, uh, it's uh, in the Middle Ages, by the way, it was not alien to this thought of the other. Uh, I can give you a few titles of uh, um, uh, Aquinas writing a track against the errors of the Greeks. That's, that's the sense of idleness establishing this, you say differences or Aquinas writing is summa against the gentiles. The pagans. We usually actually where the philosophers of the time, the, the, those who do not have access to or exceed the one to succeed to revelations the, have an idea of otherness.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       And the, the of another nurse is always that over acknowledging that particular defense. I do not see at this point yet any substantial deviation on the part of Dante from the myth and the examples of the heroic life. The examples of the heroic life are those who literally established boundaries, who within those boundaries managed to live according to the fullness of the virtuals. That's a heroic life. And that's really the boundary that he establishes. Now, tasks. What is that boundary? Okay, I understand that, that divine justice is impenetrable, but then he asks this extraordinary question, what is a place where is a place? And so this was a main, it's born or the Bank of the Indus line 72. I think this is the most complex and the most extraordinary question in the whole of the divine comedy from, from the point who have the awareness of, uh, let's say I'll tear it.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       No, Maine is born on the Bank of the English Asia and none is there to speak or read or write of Christ and all his desires and doing her good so far as humor. Regencies without sitting in life. Who speech, he dies, I'm baptized. And without faith, what is this justice that condemned him? What is his fault? If he does not believe? And then, uh, now who are the other would sit upon the bench and judge a thousand miles away, more geometry or mode space, more distance if is comes to being not only one of depth. Now one of huge distances in space with the site short of a span and the spending, you know, by the way, it's a great, you know, that it's uh, it's, it's uh, a measurement, a geometric term too. That's the, that's the span. The distance that goes from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger. Uh, you know, this is technically Italian

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Spanish and the English is span, uh, comes from it. I should surely for him that will reason it out with me. The scripture were not set over you. There will be abandoned room for questions. And then he goes on talking, uh, as the stalks circle and Dante's clearly circling over this stuff himself over this, uh, this issues. And we have, uh, it turned to Europe, the whole of Europe and our peers, the whole of Kendall's, Nah, it's a hundred and uh, uh, and, and, and till the end. And let me just read this passage where, um, uh, the eagle, the Romans and well done to goes out of the way to say when the shining fires of the holy ghost had posted in sign that made the Roman, uh, rev, Romans, reverend to the world, it began again okay. With a illusion therefore to the Romans as if to uh, as a kind of idea Rome to Dante's become an idea, an idea of universality, you know, uh, to this kingdom.

Speaker 2:          00:30:46       Never ever rose who did not believe in Christ either before or after he was nailed to the tree but no many Christ, Christ, Christ who shall be far less near to him at the judgment. Then there's 10 such as, no, not Christ in such Christians, the Ethiopians, Africa is being mentioned. Check on them when the two companies are partnered, what can the Persians, Asia, once again, the three continents are going to be. So that divisions of belief now and its divisions who believe seem to lose or consistency because you may be a European and that is immoral. Alterity within Europe, it's altered. It is not just a question of geographic, uh, disposition sort of part of the economy. Someone who is a Persian is other than me. It is, but there is in terms of the moral life, clearly there is an alternative within Europe. In fact, Dante does, he starts with a kingdom of Prague lines 18 Alberta by which the Carroll Shelby made desolate and then to France then shall be seen.

Speaker 2:          00:31:54       The misery brought on the second count. All the countries, by the way, he seems to know the history of on the same from the debasement of the currency. By him, the shall die from the charge of a bore. There shall be seeing the pride that makes Thurston so madness, the Scott and the Englishman that neither can keep within his bounds. Oh, there is a, there's a history of violence that transgresses also boundaries are right and that can be a violence and I will give you a little story about that. It will show the wantonness and soft living of him, of Spain, and of people of Bohemia who never, who never knew worth no salted. It will show for the cripple of Jerusalem, his goodness marked with an eye. What an m. We'll mark the opposite. It will show the average and cowers of women, the whole to the island, the fire,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       Sicily, where are Kaiser's and his long ended his long life. And to make plain his insignificance, his records should be in contractions. So we'll note much and little space and manifest all should be the foul deeds of his uncle and his brother. But who my lineage so illustrious and two crowns have been dishonored and he'll Portugal and he over Norway shall be there known there. And he of Russia, Russia meaning a real literary Russia who to his own hurt has been the calling of Venice or happy Hungary. The ironies heavy. Uh, if she no longer let herself be wronged and happy Navarre, if she armors, if with a mountain that surround her and for earners of this or men should know that Nicole Asia and Pharma goals that are meant and complain of their own beast, which keeps it's place beside the rest. So the whole of Europe, this is now the history of Europe in a way that Dante has given the history of the empire Roman Empire.

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       But this is the history of Europe, Eh, history of distillation and moral, bitter election. These are the terms of, so what is here and what is there? What is, what is, what is within an economy of redemption? Where is not out of the economy of redemption? This is exactly the question that Dante asks. And the answer is that we do not know. We do not know how this, uh, salvation, uh, it's going to work hard. No one can claim, therefore to, uh, decide, uh, uh, what exact moral boundaries can exist between a place and then other, um, that seems to be, uh, the idea that a 10%, therefore, the notion on the one hand, the idea of boundaries. And on the other hand there is also this notion that boundaries can, uh, are, are political, but they are not. No. Can they be thought of as being moral boundaries?

Speaker 1:          00:34:38       So it distinguishes the two, the tool, uh, the two issues. What, what is his, so what is, is trying to say before I tried to tell you about this, let me tell you about a little text. Has nothing to do with the Middle Ages, but I'm sure you know the techs. It's that little story that Geraldo who is a great Greek historian, tells this story of, uh, in, uh, uh, the history's really before the beginning of the Greeks are getting ready to invade Egypt, go into Egypt. And he really writes a story to warn them about what, uh, uh, the dangers that they might be surprised by all the dangerous, wherever you go across boundaries, that and violate boundaries. It's really an argument in favor of boundaries. And he tells the story of a King, the king of Egypt, a cow, the cow, the arrows. I think his name is who, oh, was not a very sharp man.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       A very, very bright man. [inaudible] was not a very bright man. He also had a very beautiful wife and he was so taken with the beauty of his wife that he wanted everybody to know about it, but he can't tell everybody. But he tells his advisor and the advisor who is a very prudent man, says, sire, Your Majesty. I don't want to, I believe you don't tell me more about this, but you got to know, you've got to hear me because you know, normally you got to hear me. I want you to see the naked beauty of my wife, the young belief. And I want you to see it because human beings tend to trust their eyes more than what they hear more than the ears. We don't really believe what we hear is that there may be at power. We see is directed. We want to have access to it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       The, the counselor, a very prudent fusses and sorry, this is really too much trouble. I can not disobey you, but you are forcing me to, to really insist that I believe you completely. You can go and telling me about how beauty, I don't want to say it. No, I mean a range in this, uh, he contrives a little plot. The wife has to go bathing some in the room next to the bedroom. He king leaves the door ajar, open for her to come in the bedroom door. Um, and so while she's away, he allows the counselor to hide in the shadows of the room. The little corner. The queen comes in and addresses the counselor, sees her naked and very quickly, uh, works out, hoping silently and hoping not to have been been seen. The morning after the Queen, it was a sharp queen. Calls him into her office and says, I saw you telling me what we're doing there so the counselor has no, no choice but saying, your majesty, the king.

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       Your husband asked me to come in there and the Queen says, I imagine that that's really what happened. But uh, at this point, one of you two is one too much, too many. One of you are that you kill the king or you kill yourself. Yeah. Idea that I have been ashamed and be seen a naked but two men is unbearable to me and the counselor, that's what I'm sure all of you would do. He became the cake. A very simple, uh, and by the way, uh, her other schools only even saying that, you know, he lived a very undistinguished life. It was not a big deal. I said, well, he's wording her other visibility, warning us to understand that there is always a limit to that have to set up and protect between what we say me or mine, I, and what I say you, this is the land was a dentist uses the beginning of Canto 20.

Speaker 1:          00:38:45       They say, ah, they say I in mind when they mean we and our, you know, this is, this is a very thin line that has to be observed. Uh, uh, the king of course, just to finish that little story that king was, was, was a fool. He had no clue that he had no sense of, uh, the, the, the difference between the private lives and the public needs. It had no idea that there are things that you keep to yourself and you don't share with others as one can go on complicating the problem. But the issue is that he understood limits. You are going on into another man's country. You have to act a safe. Uh, you don't have to go too deep into it and you don't have to try to violate. It's uh, uh, countries, a woman's nakedness, meaning they, the essential sent the private sense of, uh, of oneself.

Speaker 1:          00:39:37       I do not know that Dante would really agree with her auditors in this, uh, in this, in this cancers. But what he's been doing is literally setting up, uh, a needed cultural difference. Somehow there is a, that they exist cultural differences and at the same time allow for the kind of moral circulation of ideas. Let me put it in general, medieval terms to tell you what I think he has been doing because the, the argument when he makes this argument, a man is born on the river of the Hindus and does not know anything about Christian faith and baptism dies. Why should he be them, et cetera. He has been living, uh, decorously and rationally. Why should he be not saved? That's the question we asked. Well, he's taking on, there didn't seem to be what we call in medieval terms, Appalachian Appalachian stance and you know, now I think I have said before, but let me just repeat this.

Speaker 1:          00:40:39       Pathogen is an adjective that comes from the name of a British monk of the, roughly the time of Santa Gastin, the fifth century Bellagio's who really maintain that by the exercise of, by the true works, through good works, human beings, every sec living according to principles of nature, human beings can be saved. It didn't seem almost that Dante's taking that position to a position, by the way, which she probably even held in the philosophical text called the banquet. That was one of, it's one of, I don't, I don't agree with that, but it seems to be such an emphasis on the ability of human beings to live rationally that, uh, the, the, uh, the demands of grace and the demands of faith, uh, somewhat bracketed and, and, and, and, and a little dim and under is, I think that they are, are only that he's talking is a philosopher.

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       And the issue is this, that Dante here is asking for the conversation between, between philosophy and theology within reason and faith in the sense that he really understands that philosophy without theology ends up in a sort of labyrinth of a tone constructions and get it may lose the way. And theology without philosophy may end up in mere opinion, which has no validity at all on, for people who believe in the power, the power of reason not to connect it with the previous scandals. I think that Dante has been literally extending, uh, this, this whole, uh, uh, problem about what, uh, uh, exile is an exile, which does not mean, uh, the random movement, uh, but always a kind of a, uh, a sense of the proper problematical qualities of, uh, uh, a place in the world. And, uh, uh, the relationship that we have with ourselves and our own, our own ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:42:49       I know that this was such an attorney to get a little bit that I, uh, taste taking me away from the other candles, but let me just read 21. Uh, and, uh, the cantors or just went to turn very briefly. I don't think that I'm 21 and 22, uh, which are candles were Dante meets. It's the sphere of Saturn, which as you know, is the heaven of, uh, it's the heaven of contemplation. Uh, the word Saturn, them, the myth of Saturn is the myth of time, uh, devouring everything that it engendered. That's what you remember the time is the first cannibal of history eating up. What it producers, this is, uh, you know, the minutes that are just taken in. It's the name seems to come from the saturation desaturation of time. And Nancy's coming to, this is the last planet and it's also the heaven of astronomy.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       Uh, so he's forcing on us the idea of what contemplation is. Here. He finds the contemplative and among them there is the soul of a founder by the name of Benedict. Uh, the first, uh, the, the from one of the contemplative, older came to the word contemplation. A really implies two things. If you ask, what is it? Contemplation. Because there's always a debate as to where the Dante's a mistake or it's not realistic. I think that if there's anything that he has is, he's a contemplative in the true sense of the word. The word contemplation translates the Greek theory, which is really the turning of the mind toward the essentials, uh, theory or contemplation. The word comes from,

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       uh, 10 bloom contemplation, which is, as you know, the Latin word for pen for, of a temple borrows from the Latin word for temples. They're the same words, you know, uh, temple there words for template in the words for time. I have the same origin and they both come from the Greek word called Devon Minnow. Uh, the Greek word [inaudible], which means to cut, to cut Saturday time with a scythe cuts. Their contemporaries are those who cut a space of time and privilege it or a space in place and cut it off from the flow of history and the flow of a profane place and make it the, the, the, the sort of ground for turning their minds to the consideration of higher thinks. This is the poet that Dante is driving. His going to discuss the degeneracy of a, of the older, but I want to really end with you and I didn't meant to talk about this.

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       Up Sign will emerge at the end of Canto 22. Uh, we're done. Pinole is really has reached the, the periphery of the planetary system. Now who will go into, uh, the stars, the, the, the, the, the heaven of the six stars. Okay. We have a little bit of time so I can go slow here. Uh, lines canto 22 lines. Um, uh, let's say 126. This is Beatrice speaking that word. So near to the final blessedness Beatrice began that thou must have denies clear and keen. Now that's Dante's. He will, he will, uh, deploy this language of visionary leaders and the language of visual learners. Visual learners will, we'll start with the emphasis on clay purifying Vance and refining one's own, uh, uh, once hone nice and once physical eyesight. Uh, and therefore before you go farther into it, look down be it is. It's one of the two, uh, the two invitations by Beatrice now to turn back, turn the ice bag and having a contemplation and Dante will contemplate so to speak, the earth not up.

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       The heavens turned. And therefore, uh, before you go further into to look down and see how much of the universe I have already put been beneath my feet so that with the fullness of joy, that hearts may present itself to the triumphal host that comes rejoicing through this rounded ether with my site. Dante now is engaged in this retrospective glance down to the earth. I returned through every one of the seven spheres and I saw this globe such as I smiled earth and it's paltry sum ones. The perspective is that of a space, I wouldn't call it infinite space, but the vast distance of space, I don't call it infant space because Dante's notion of the universe is not that it's infinite down to is the notion of the universe is uh, eh bounded but a vast uh, connect, uh, Vasta a enclave. It's really like a book.

Speaker 2:          00:47:59       That's the image that he uses and that judgment which holds it for least I approve as best and he has thought is on the other things may rightly be called just I saw Latona his daughter, the moon growing without the shadow for which are to believe that to be rare dance. They science aspect Hyperion, I in Europe, there and I, so both Maya and they own a move in the circles. Many mercury near him from thence appear to me, the tempering of jove between his father and his son. And from thence they changes were clear to me, which they're making their positions. And those seven showed me what is the magnitude and what is the speed and the distance. This Dave, so we have an astronomy here, they haven't of astronomy, but whoever in astronomy, which is indicated mythically and neuro only mythically but also through a process of failure patients is the daughter of black Latona, the son of a Hyperion son, uh, processes affiliation.

Speaker 2:          00:49:05       So it's really as if the university itself has followed the logic of generation of production has been uh, uh, producing and reproducing itself. And then does he go, continues. Dante goes back to looking at the earth. Uh, um, I'm sorry. Another seven showed to me what is the magnitude and where is the speed and the distance, the stations, the little threshing floor that makes us so fierce. All appeared to me from hills to river mouth while I was willing with the eternal twins. Then to the fair eyes, I turned my eyes again. I want to draw your attention to line one 51 where dentists is the little threshing floor that makes us so fierce. All appear to me like who all she far to Pharaoh [inaudible] chief are looking at that line, look at it. Uh, to me a little hill trigger months while I was reading with eternal twins.

Speaker 2:          00:50:08       Uh, Nantum anyways, has, uh, uh, now that's part of his view of, uh, of, of, of um, uh, astronomy. He's given his horoscope in directory here, the, this idea of uh, uh, the twins being the sign, the which he was born. It doesn't imply an astrological laps on his path. It's now that he can be free. And here's this determined to the limitations of astrological determinations. He can go on alluding to his birth sign, but I want to draw, I just want to do the attention to this whole point about the CI. We a dentist is that will threshing floor that makes us so fierce. It was for all its distance. And this says this and this, it can pick and be, um, this for all the distance, which is implied by this poetic fiction. His distance from the earth. Is He ever wash this pronoun?

Speaker 2:          00:51:10       She pass us the pronoun strains to have it both ways. On the one hand than search distance, uh, the claim of a perspective of eternity on the world. And, uh, uh, but he does not. That's the other way. He does not want to surrender his place in time and in history like he's part of us. So at the end of all this great gyration through the universe, Dante again claims every claims for himself, a place with us in the world of history, in the world of time, the synthesis of the tool, the claim of eternity and the sense of contingency of the self in time is the ultimate goal of the poem. And the ultimate goal of, uh, uh, the, the, the journey, uh, that for Dante will be as we shall see maybe next week, the very vision of the incarnation, the to the idea where this, uh, this to the structure, the mutable structure of history and the process of time. We'll, uh, we'll come together. Um, let me, uh, stop here and see if they are, they are questions that I would, um, about some of these issues that I raised that I would, uh, I would welcome them please.

Speaker 2:          00:53:14       The passage by the way, about, uh, maybe we should, even the passage where Dante talks about his old horoscope was given, uh, a little earlier line, one 12 of Canto 22, where the anthesis Oh, glorious stars, all light pregnant with mighty power from which I acknowledge all my genius, whatever it be, uh, with you was born and with you hidden he, that is the father, which mortal life. When I first tasted the Tuscan area and Nafta, when Greece was granted me to enter into the high wheel, that bears around your region was assigned to me, to you, my soul. Now size devoutly that is may gain strength for the hard task that draws it to, uh, to itself. This is the, uh, uh, Dante ballers is the differences between astronomy and astrology. But from this point of view, he belongs fully to his time where there is no intrinsic. The, we, we, we think of them as a straw bridges of superstition and astronomy is the science that it was not the case, uh, for, for Dante. But, um,

Speaker 3:          00:54:25       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       the, uh, another little details is a, I'm, I'm introducing the question of visionary nest now in um, in cantos with the contemplation. Uh, let me just mention this, a initial emerge to give you an idea of how Dante proceeds the initial image. I can two 21 of the very beginning of Canto 21 Dante is in the sphere of Saturn where the contemplate a contemporary of his heart. Uh, and he says the ladder, the ladder of ascent. Um, but let's, before we get there, uh, this is the passage already. My eyes were fixed on the face of my lady and with them, my mind, which was withdrawn from every other thought. And she did not smile. But when I to smile, she began to me. You will become like similar when she was turned to ashes for my beauty, which thou has seen kindle more the higher we climb by the stairs of the Terminal Palace. He so shining that if it were not tempered, they more two powers in it and it's blazed would be as a branch split by thunderbolt, we have risen to the seven splendor which beneath the rest of the burning lion race down now mingled with its power set a mind behind, denies and make of the mirrors to the shape which in this metro will appear to t uh, this is an extraordinary merge the image of the myth of similar, the young woman who fell in love with God

Speaker 2:          00:56:10       that would seem to be, uh, of course, uh, Eh, an extraordinary spiritual story of it tells it has a very carnal story. She wants to love a Jupiter and Jupiter will agree to love Semele back

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       on one condition that she never ask God to show himself forth for what he is. She has to accept his, the guards disguises if variant, if you wish of what later will appear with a players. The idea of arrows and psyche. You remember the love of the, the relationship with in mind and love. Uh, love mate. That's not one to be seen for what it is. And always once Simulacra and a deceptive, uh, uh, figures to cover its essence. This is the same thing that he's asking that, that, uh, Dante's recalling and of course what happens in all of it is that seminar and love and because of love, love, impels curiosity. Uh, she was Jupiter to show himself, fought for what he is mindless of the danger that Jupiter had predicted this would be for, uh, and the danger of death that would be for her.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       In fact, he shows himself and she cannot bear the extraordinary beauty of the guard and gets destroyed, turned into ashes. That's the myth that antiques recalling. So that the inevitable question for us is why would Dante recall this story here at the beginning of the cantors and contemplation? And the answer that I could give you is that, uh, Dante Dusseau because he's aware of the dangers of visionary claims. And this is, look, if you read the Bible for instance, you do know that there is a tradition in the Bible among the Jews to turn their back, for instance, to even the passing of a what is viewed as whole. It would be the holy ark or they cover themselves in because of the, the, the, the wisdom or the tradition of not seeing, never trying to, to, to have mix the profane and they say that all the sense of the danger that would be for the, the uh, those who are in the space of the, of, of the profane space or what outside of the sanctuary.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       Dante is making this abuse resist telling him that he has to a newer delimitations of his human nature and that his human nature that is the trade of his mortality, a which is that of seeing through images and, uh, in, in, in, through obliquities cannot yet be given up. He does this as he enters the con, the heaven of the contemplative who they themselves were longing and desiring to say God, but accepted this longing as the sign of God's presence and gift to them. This is an extraordinary passage in terms of what [inaudible] thinks of contemplation and clearly the danger of thinking of contemplation as the conditions that would allow and bring about the vision of God. Such a visual, Dante saying is not going to be impossible while we are here on earth. So there's, this is the, the sort of, the number of, uh, uh, ambiguities about this problem.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       And then we could also mentioned the, uh, why Benedict, uh, why benedict here, the, the figure that appears in Canto 22 as the exemplar. First of all, he's the founder, as I said, of the, the, uh, of, of, uh, the life of contemplation. But allow for contemplation that appears is the danger of contemplation because Dante goes on talking about the decadence of a, of the contemplative all dark, which is by the way, uh, quite true. And what that which occasion, uh, historically the foundation of the mendicant holders, those Franciscans and Dominicans who may already have encountered who want to be part of the world and roam around in the world. But the, the, the danger of the contemplation though, is that they can bypass and drive a wedge between the contemplative life and the active life. The ideal of benedict has been betrayed because what he wants is an action and the life of action, the life of contemplative prayer.

Speaker 1:          01:00:57       So that's one of the causes of the degeneracy that Dante Porsche's. And with that we enter the world of, uh, now we're done to returns. And this is where we're going to do next time to what I call basic words. Uh, somehow the whole commpass of knowledge, the whole idea of a geography and spiritual geography, the whole idea of how, of what triggers the writing of a poem that has been taken care of, uh, or at least it's Dante seems to have been facing and delivering to us his particular understanding of this problems. Now the question is, with all of this in mind, what are the mean? What is the meaning of the basic words we use and the basic words we use? And that's where we're going to talk about next time are going to be love, hope, and, and, and, and faith. But we call the three theological virtues.

Speaker 1:          01:01:54       And there are basic words because there is no such a thing as a life without trust or the difficulties of the life without trust that can, there is no possibility of a life without hope. And certainly that which remains the biggest mystery of all. There's never the possibility of thinking about a life or without love and becomes a mystery. It was, he can be fine. The other two words, he never, he escapes the responsibility of defining glove. I see. It is as if that were really the biggest mystery, uh, throughout the divine comedy and in, uh, in his experience. So let me see for some questions. Now. I have thrown up out of a full time out of chestnuts on the fire as we say. So it's a

Speaker 3:          01:02:51       please

Speaker 4:          01:02:53       earlier lectures. It was a physical journey, um, and in how we could see that he was, he emphasized like his weight in the earth and you know, smells of things. And now, now that we're in paradise, it's more vision and light and color. And is he trying to characterize God or God's relation to Earth Somehow by contracting them?

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       Uh, the question is that in the previous lectures I discussed that I would talk of hell is the place where the, the, ah, the smells, the concrete or particulars of the earth would be mentioned. It would be part of Dante's warehouse of, in, in the representation of, of how, now that we're talking, we're entering the world of paradise, who been told discussing paradise. Dante seems to, uh, separate himself from the aesthetics. That's the sensual I, uh, aspects of, of Helen talk more, which is still central. They'll callers a lie, uh, uh, callers and visionary ness. Ah, right. So, uh, and then the question becomes, uh, it does this mean that Dante is clearly, clearly finding a distinction between Earth and heaven? That this is really the, am I in rephrasing it accurately? Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:04:20       Is He, is he tried to, I mean, because clearly it's not that he's trying to separate God from physical reality because what we see and colors are still very physical. Yes. Descriptions. So what is the distinction between them?

Speaker 1:          01:04:35       Yup. Well, I the, the, uh, the, the answer would be this, that in, in, uh, in paradise, you do have a lot of, uh, what did we call earthly experiences. That's the only way he can really, he could really understand that anything about, uh, about, uh, about paradise, uh, their dances, their songs. You do have, there are games that they play. You do have the language of playfulness in the forms of India in the form of simulations. Simulation is a very, it's a form of game is it's a reduction of the world tool on seriousness, right? The Gay, the play, um, in, in, in, in, in the, in the, in, in the form of the degradation of the noble idea of play because play is, see this things are all very ambivalent, uh, that we were dealing with the same reality, only seen from different perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:05:30       And I mentioned play because paradise is all about play. It's about playing about, uh, uh, the dance of the stars, about the spectacle, the theater, which he just, Dante is just seeing a little log performance put out for him. Can you imagine that? Then some of the stars that go on, it's, it's like seeing a, the spectacle of the, of the Olympics. Uh, in China. You know, the goal with distribution of shapes and forms that is play, uh, it's a statics. So there is no difference there between, uh, uh, between the tool. Uh, I don't see a difference. Of course that has nothing to do. Whatever he's seeing in paradise has really nothing to do with the understanding of the divinity. I am not even, I haven't decided yet, not for any reason that because they may not really be time and that would, I could, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be a, wouldn't be doing justice to the difficulty of the problem.

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       I haven't decided whether to discuss the whole, the cosmology of paradise of the, of the, of the universe that appears in Canto 29 of paradise where Dante goes on talking about tool universities for instance. So there is the physical universe that somehow he has traversed only to understand that when he goes there, there is another universe which is completely spiritual and it's not the platonic idea of an inverted, you know, played with this idea of an inverted cosmos. We are in the world, which is really the projection. Yeah. Projection and unreal projections. It's projection meaning meaning a shadow of, of the real costs. It's not really that there are two adjacent cosmos, both little real, and that's the one where we live in where we don't live beyond that. Beyond that is a real, a speck of sand. He says, as a speck of sand you, there is a light that clearly is the right from which hole or creation, uh, emanates.

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       So God remains forever a transcendence. Ah, what Dante does see at the end, this is his image, uh, in his own image, in the plural our emerge, which to me implies the idea that we as Christians read the, the whole notion of genesis is that in a, since we are shaped in God's image, there is our imaging God. Okay. There is a human component in God. So that's how he sees. He sees maybe the incarnation, but it's all of that is all wrapped in a kind of extraordinary, uh, and deliberate fogginess of a overrepresentation. Um, but the, the paradise that he describes, it is not the same that they're proud of us of central delights of the Koran, for instance. Uh, but there's a lot of gay men play and, and as the stars, the arm motors, this scores of paradise engages in involves, even though the stars, they're gone.

Speaker 1:          01:08:34       When you, it, this is literally the whole cosmos is involved in this extraordinary dance of love. The keeps it together, makes it go here as opposed to say, Lou Cliche, this idea of an archaic universe forever on the verge of, of falling apart, that the, this is the real models of, of the cosmos. You know, let's call it Lucretia's and Virgil and the way epicureans Epicurus and Plato, you know, this is a Danton the, and the heavy, the heavy traditional is, it's very heavy, traditional materialism. The spiritual tradition is very small in comparison to the heaviness of a, of a, of the physical or the scholars of physics who want to see the cosmos in physical terms but not the opposes it. Then somehow he finds a kind of that that's what the universe, that's what keeps the universe together is really love and that's where we going to find out that uh, that we'll read the rest. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          01:09:43       I thought questions. Please be interest is warning Dante not to look directly at her face because he might become like simile and just turned to ashes. Do you think Dante is trying to allude back to Medusa and the danger of just looking directly into the thesis of something so powerful and being reduced to, you know, something that isn't human like, oh no, I was, I was reading down, she said set that in mind behind nine eyes and makeup and mirrors to the shape in which, uh, which in this mirror will appear to the SF. Like the mirror is sort of, the mirror is less like the eyes, like the intermediary, just like the shield was the intermediary for looking at the Medusa.

Speaker 1:          01:10:25       Very good question. I think just record the question. Uh, the imager of Beatrice's Samela ah, whose smile could potentially destroy the lover, the, the, the pilgrim who were to look looker, her face. Uh, the question is, does, is that supposed to be a salt of, let's call it poly Nordic variant or version of the scene of Medusa? Uh, in a, in federal nine, uh, who threatened also the, in that case, the pilgrim, uh, with, uh, pacification with the turning into stone intellect would, uh, would petrify that's really the, the allegory. Uh, and they are of course in the Canto of Medusa, ah, there was always, always the shield, the shield of poetry, right. The Shield will pursues, uh, uh, and the answer is yes. Absolutely. This is exactly what is happening. I think that this is a, yeah. If you're thinking is, I think you are of writing, uh, about, uh, are you thinking of writing? No. Uh, about Medusa? No,

Speaker 4:          01:11:34       I haven't decided yet.

Speaker 1:          01:11:35       Okay. Well, but if you think you'll be right, I think a paper about the middles, I think that you are absolutely you would and the two scenes you'd be absolutely correct. The story of Medusa is what is interesting. This sort of Medusa is the story of a, we could view it. We view that as you remember the temptation of it looking at the past, a way of or fuels a turning down to cast himself as all fuse office. You know who is told not to look back and yet or few stands for assault of impatience. A kind of a skepticism about the injunction. The fear that you read is it may not really be following him. He turns and losers. Some modern mythology offers even see that low carb. I'm thinking about a man by no brunch roses. He really wanted to lose. You read the sea and because he saw this way, he would write poetry so of Porridge or can become the perpetual voice of absence, etc.

Speaker 1:          01:12:29       It doesn't not go that far, but it's clear that it's tied to a pointing experience of his own. The, the, the interesting thing about what you are saying, uh, we could go into that may in, in conversation, uh, laser because it's, it would take me too far. It's that this enigmatic, the, the double phase of Beatrice comes to the fore here that she has, you know, uh, she was confronting this Irene and threatens against the siren. And now she also appears as the, uh, the sorcery and in danger of beauty, beauty. That is that which was the language here is beauty. Beauty, which can, which we, we hunger after. And yet it's that which can destroy us. And, and, and, and, and this seems to me to be, uh, I, I put that in the, in the, in the consciousness of the Dantes, uh, uh, the contemporary thieves that Dante represents, this doubleness that you wrong to see. And yet you may not have to, you, you better, you are better off than not seeing. But it's true. That appears also with the ambiguity of beauty and the beauty of Beatrice. That's, that would be true. Yes.

Speaker 4:          01:13:44       So if, so, if the mirror is sort of like intermediary, just like the shield. Like, what role does, um, vision and the eyes play in, in, in, in mediating between what you see in the world and, and in the mind that it protects?

Speaker 1:          01:13:57       Well, Dante, we'll law is no slowly, uh, slowly preparing for this final vision. And this is going to have intermediate stages. Uh, when he will see at the end he will see a, not God, he will see his own image within the beatific vision. This is how far he will go. Not only that, he will go, oh, also there in the clips of the, in that I have memory, you know, memory is thought of as being the, in the eye of the imagination. That's the, the classical d, uh, uh, the script definition of a, of memory. And that too will be completely clips. He will forget. So that at the end of all this experience, we are ending up with a forgetfulness, uh, with, with a full from that vision. I don't know that I'm answering exactly your question, but I don't know that, uh, I haven't understood which really want to know, uh, which really asking. So

Speaker 4:          01:14:59       I guess I'm just asking more about the role of vision, like it makes visualness. Okay. Yeah. Just like it is the, I suppose to be an intermediary or, or protection of, of the mind and what you think

Speaker 1:          01:15:13       the I, the, the, the, what is the eye is the intermediary or the, Oh, an extension of the mind. That's really what it, what the I is by the visual he will have, is not going to be a physical vision. It can not be a physical vision. This could be a spiritual vision. And so there are the limitations of the sea. That's, let me leave that, that I'm going to get that. Okay. Thank you. See you next time.
