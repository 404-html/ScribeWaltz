Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So we begin with the Paradise, um, which clearly is different from the earthly paradise to paradises. We, we went through the earthly paradise. This is, uh, whenever we begin the third Cantica, which is called the paradise. And this should read, use find that Dante uses eh Ptolemaic, um, structure of the cosmos. Atomic structure means that, uh, for him, as for Ptolemy, the earth is at the center of the universe, um, unmoved immobile, and there are a number of, uh, seven planets that circling around it. The moon is thought of as a planet, Mercury, the sun, then there will be Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Beyond that, there is this, the heaven of the so called fixed stars. And beyond that the, uh, premium, the Imperian, the heaven or fire from which all motion, uh, begins, uh, from which time starts. That's really where they, the, the roots of time, uh, our, our, uh, found and they stretch out into the finite world, uh, so that we really are in the shadows of the leaves of time, uh, which means that they are, uh, all is falling and, uh, being, uh, being replaced.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       Um, but another thing you have to keep in mind as you go into paradise is that, uh, uh, Dante links the, uh, each of the planets with, I have said this before, I know, but it bears repeating, uh, with one of the liberal arts, uh, and their respectively. The liberal arts are the seven liberal arts. And then there were the, there are two more's in say, nine heavens, uh, begins with grammar in the planet of the moon. And so you will have to expect that you will find the language of Grammarians Grammar, uh, the moon and grandma, the, the, um, if a very wide definition or what grammar can be. It includes poetry, includes history, even include some rhetorical tropes, um, and then the heaven of, uh, of, of mercury with dialectics. And so you're expecting to find the language of dialectics deployed and it's going to be the, uh, deployed throughout the Canto, the having of Venus and rhetoric that probably is the least surprising, uh, arrows and rhetoric.

Speaker 1:          00:03:08       Uh, I have an old a kinship. They seem to each other. Then they have enough Mars, the god of war, which he had Dante couples with music in the persuasion. That music is a harmony made off of discordant parts. So that there is a, is kind of the same time simultaneously a pool and a strife within the heaven of, uh, of Mars. So that old music then beyond that, there's geometry, uh, linked with, uh, the temperateness of Jupiter and beyond that astronomy and or Saturn, uh, they haven't really fixed stars is tide is linked to, um, ethics. Whereas the heaven of the Imperian is really the heaven of metaphysics is Dante, we'll call it. And it will see the kind of interesting, uh, uh, arguments that Dante we'll have because in effect is, has changed his mind in when writing the philosophical text known as the banquet.

Speaker 1:          00:04:15       Uh, you know, now the come Viveo he writes it in Italian. Uh, he had a really claimed that ethics is the first or the most important of the arts. It's really the, the, the discipline tote, which all the are to chose other arts are subordinated and Toad, which they all points when Dante writes the Paradiso, he has changed his mind about that. Though. He also knows that in many ways you cannot quite separate ethics, whatever he means by ethics with some theory about how the world is, they really are inseparable. And Dante, we'll go on back and forth in a, in a re, uh, configuring the relation of those two, uh, uh, disciplines. The other thing that I, uh, I should mention before we go on is that, uh, uh, much of the Paradiso really, uh, it's, it's, it's going to come through as a way of, is it teaching?

Speaker 1:          00:05:18       Uh, it's already implied that this should be the thrust of Paradiso, but the very idea that, uh, the, there is the disposition of the arts and sciences in through parties, which means that the journey that Dante, we'll have this cosmological journey. It's an interplanetary German, he goes from planet to planet, uh, is already, Eh, an educational journey. That's so he goes through grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, et Cetera, et cetera. Til He reaches a metaphysics or, and beyond that there will be theology. Uh, so it's, uh, it's, it's, it's literally a, an educational journey. And this is already understood. Those words already carried out by the focus on, uh, the teaching that Beatrice will deliver. So I have to say a couple of things that Danfoss teacher in paradise and this is, is an innovative, very imaginative and highly unusual move on. The part of a port is not some kind of abstract matron called Dame philosophy.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       It's not some kind of allegory of nature. You know, you do have this kind of allegorical, didactic categories where nature appears as a, uh, larger, the disheveled woman wounded egos because nature is fallen teaching. Uh, the, the, the, the, the pilgrim or, or that or that or the tray or the traveler about the secrets of nature and the wealth of nature. Here is a personal, uh, his, his girlfriend to be sure. And it's someone who also replaces all the other likely candidates for this teaching, which is w would be Aquinas, a boy he'd used to Bonaventure Oh, figures that he's going to meet. Um, it's a mistake to believe however, that as some great scholars or of Dante have said in the past, the police was really a journey to be a Trish. That's what they did say. That's not the case because Beatrice will disappear from, she would still be within view, up to a point in, in, in paradise.

Speaker 1:          00:07:29       But a role ends with Canto 30 of Paradiso. And that from that point on, a mistake by the name of Bernard, the historical figure, Bernard of Clairvaux will take place. So this leads me now to a further clarification. Um, they may be the tendency in some of you to view the [inaudible] as some kind of account to the mystical experience. Uh, you know what, I'm, what I'm saying that Dante sort of goes beyond his own self beyond and the idea of rational understanding of the world. They're so rendering of his own subjectivity to some insight into the whole this, I don't think that this is what's happening here. Dante, we'll preserve his rationality and his sense of distinction and separation from some kind of cosmic or cosmological and cosmic hall till the very end. Uh, there is a way in which Dante we'll deploy the language of the, of the mistakes.

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       And I want to give you some evidence of that because I think that it opens up an interesting chapter for your further readings. Uh, but it's, he's not, this is not to be read as a kind of subscription of a mystical experience, uh, where the text then goes on in some kind of a random approximation or random copying of what the mistake. So, and becomes ineffable. Dante uses occasionally if toward the end the language of ineffability. But this is, remains a poetic construction and imaginative projection into where it is a journey into the absolute unknown, into a space. No other imagination had really traveled and if those, and have been those who had traveled there, but they never really took, came back to tell us Dante, we'll play with that. His is to use that language and kind of a way of, of getting into that which had been left inarticulate and silent.

Speaker 1:          00:09:28       It's really largely a battle against, uh, the, the, um, for a poet threatening a boundaries of silence. Something that threatens him with, uh, with uh, uh, uh, with the defeat. He will not be able to speak. And from one point of view that the feed for the Christian could also be of course a victory, but Dante is suspended between the two, the two poles. If I had to define, and I have already given a kind of general definition or what kind of ages and which rubric, uh, should we try to go on reading? Uh, this part of the poem, I really think this is, um, uh, is, is really a poem about beauty, uh, in the sense that, uh, uh, Dante Hill tried to understand what the beauty is. Beauty is the visibility of, of Patina says this. It's the, the visibility of being, he calls it being life.

Speaker 1:          00:10:30       The whole of life becomes visible only because we have perceptions and images of it. So it's, it's, I think that Dante's trying to, uh, to, to see that, to explore, uh, what is that lies beyond that which we see, um, what is, is this beauty skin deep is it were, because that's really one of the dangers of focusing on beauty. That it's really the surface of things, the appearance of things. And, and, and he will go between appearances, images, and some s in the idea that there are essences are lying beyond them. Um, okay. So I really have said more or less, all I had to say in the mode of, uh, of an introduction and I immediately get into the, uh, can't have one. Uh, let me just read, Canto one a little bit with, in some detail the glory. That's the way it starts.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       The glory of Him who moves all things penetrates the universe and shines in one part more and in another less. That's the first tercet famous for [inaudible]. And I will read this in Italian so that you sense how even the, the rhythm, the rhythm of, of, of, of the poem completely changes the rhythm and even the syntactical structure of the poem because you made a call and I say this, uh, knowing that you have already noticed that, that if you read Canto one of him fair, no, or Canto Wando purgatory did to exhort idioms of the other canticles you know, that the poet is immediately casting himself into the role of the agent. Right in the middle of the journey of my life, I found myself that's really, uh, uh, the very start of in fair no one and in purgatory or to, uh, uh, to course of a better waters, the ship, the boat of my genius now goes and I were saying, you remember not so in paradise or there is a way in which immediately the first tercet which has a car.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       So to premial value, uh, seeks to bracket the idea of the self and the idea of the subjectivity. It emphasizes the question of uh, uh, what God becomes the agent here is to say it in a very direct as director, the season says the glory. It's a circumlocution once again, but let me read it in Italian so that I can, I can give you a sense, as I said, of the new music that he has found a new sense of, uh, the in the Harmoni that toad which language you have to, uh, strive La Gloria the curoil to move the Loonie Val's so pay and they try to respond in an Aperitif view, a I'll trough. That's it. And it's rendered very, very faithfully by Saint Claire. I Dunno the other translations, but probably they can deviate from edge, but very much, and I read it in Italian because I also would like you, and this is understandable to the eye, if not just to the ear for you, uh, how he's playing with in line one, the glory of Him who, or moves.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       So God, the mover, I'll talk about it in a little more. The, the, the, the one who moves all in that, oh, then becomes one in the next line universe or the old becomes a that which has turned into one. That's what the team logically the universe. Uh, and then, uh, it goes on, pen penetrates and uh, uh, the university and shines in one part more and in another less, um, well, uh, the thirst it casts. Um, God, Oh, this is about God as a circumlocution. He's not a, it's really a god who is visible through God's effects. Uh, is God appears, is kind of course now. Then if you really understand the effects it means is a causality. I don't want to get into too much into that, but you know what I mean? That simple. You only know the effects. You know the glory.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       We see the glory, which is the light glory. It's a semantic for us. The first thing we have to say, this is a, Eh, a shift, a change in the history of the word. That's what poets do. What it was. The poets invent reinvent language. That's largely what they do. They change the meaning of words. Glory. In the classical time and all the way down to the renaissance in the romantic age, our glory means, uh, it means fame in sees the child of clear, I mean the, the power we have to survive now try the posthumous life because whatever noble deeds heroes may have achieved, that's not what it means here. Glory means light. It's like, of course they're light to once fame if you wish. But this is the light and fast. And why do we know that? Because light now is linked to two verbs of the glory of Him who all think moves all things, uh, penetrates the universe and shines.

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       So you see there is says there's a metaphor of light that is conveyed here. So the first Tercet, uh, presents God in the, in a, in a cosmological row, which is double one of motion and one of light to things. It, he come, Dante's combining. And that is still telian idea of God as the prime mover, the one who imparts motion to all things. And the second image is that of God as the principal of light and neoplatonic idea. So He's fusing together. Two contradictory apparently contradictory traditions, light emotion. One is talking in terms of causality. And the other one really, I'm not going to go much, much further than this. The other one in terms of, because light does that penetrates, shines all over, uh, according to a principle of hierarchy more unless there is no uniformity in and with light. And I'll come back to this notion in a moment.

Speaker 1:          00:16:52       Uh, but so one idea cast God is the prime mover according to the tradition of restore telian philosophy. The other one thinks of God as in the mode of light or participation. They are two different theological modes. God participates is part of creation, right? Uh, the natural world is part of the supernatural world. It's not just a causality, uh, the course begins or things and then somehow, uh, retreats in some sorts of, uh, uh, invisible, uh, and unknown, uh, uh, non space or of its own. Uh, the other, uh, item and this, the first tercet is that of the, that I want to emphasize is the principle of hierarchy. Light shines more and less. Uh, I have been hinting at this, this is really a great problem for Dante in, in, in other parts of the poem, you remember two course over better waters, Dante says in Purgatorio one, and that implies of course, that there are bad, good, better, best, uh, that we are in the principle of hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          00:17:59       Differences are very crucial for Dante because they, they, they, they allow us to know things. Only two differences. And also the, because, uh, this, this differences and that's the value of hierarchy are still combined in some way. Some kind of unified, uh, structure. Hierarchy is a structure that unifies all differences according to the principle of degree. Uh, more of this a little bit later as we go on. And then Dante, now, uh, I said he's not a mystic subjectivities not erased that mistakes. 10 though they all claim a unique vision, they all end up resembling each other. When they talk about the ineffable. Dan Introduces now the subject and he says, I was in the heaven that most receives is light. There is to say past in the Imperian, which is sort of spiritual, uh, he was in as close to God as it can be, a which will also be as far from God as it can be.

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       Um, uh, I was in the heaven that most receives his light and I sold things which he, that descends from it has not the knowledge of the power to tell again. So, uh, no sooner does Dante introduce his subjectivity as and, and his, his, uh, a way of knowing and the are this intimacy of closeness to, to the, the, the beatific vision than he has also to cast himself as a visionary, has no knowledge or the power to, I saw things and you will see how Dante goes or refining his eyesight. A little detail that you might really enjoy is that we do know that Dante would use lenses, glasses, uh, toward the end of the had just been invented. You know, there are books written about when we're a glasses in the, whether they invented in piza where they invaded in Padua. There have been wars going on about this claim, but then he uses uses glasses.

Speaker 1:          00:20:10       So he really had difficulty. That's the point in seeing and the whole of Paradiso is about the refinement of site and the refinement of vision. How you're going to be able to, a, to attune as it were, your eyes to the objects that aren't you. Anyway, he cast himself. Now he's a visionary with an internal vision. You know, it's, I'm not casting him as a homer who is blind that therefore he sees everything with the inner thigh, but he wants to be a visionary report and they, so things which this to say, one who sees things as a whole. That's what the difference between ear, you know, there are great, great debates within the ear and AI is that the ear you hear and you hear all this old for bomb in the, in the linear way and all the things can come from all sides, but you can only catch a thing at a time with the eye.

Speaker 1:          00:21:00       You have the eyes, the Olgan gives you the chance to the old one of the contemplative gives you a chance to see, uh, totalities I ISO things which she had the sense from. It has not the knowledge of the power to tell again. And then he explains why he explains to the status of his poetic language. I, so what is the relationship between language and vision? That's the, if you want to put it in a very abstract way, how are the two related to farther intellect? Joy near to its desire? Uh, intellect, uh, yearns longs for the object that it desires. So there is a desire of the mind that desire. It's not just the desire of the up intellectual desires. A sink so deep that memory can not follow it. Very simple. Forgetfulness intervenes so that the, he may have an intuition and insight into things.

Speaker 1:          00:21:57       He can not quite go on a recalling what it nevertheless, so much of the Holly Kingdom is, I was able to treasury, my mind shall now be matter of my song. So whatever he's going to tell us is literally a shadow of things he manages to remember. And it makes sense that he should not remember because part one of the paradoxes of this political structure is the following you. He has a beatific vision. How can he retain in his mind, the site which is finite, that which is infinite, if not through vestiges and if not through through shadows. You know, how can you, how can my memory, which is, which is a metaphor of time, right? By definition, I remember certain things, but how can I go on remembering and holding that which is without time, which is infinite. So the first paradox of, in the representation of Paradise, let me go on with the next one.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       Next paragraph. Now, Dante turned to the god of poets to a Polo or good Apollo for the last labor make me such a vessel of their power. Ah, he's, he's, he cast himself into a passive mode vessel one who receives, uh, he's, he's, it's, it's the language of, uh, of restraint. It's a language robe holding back. It's, it's, uh, it's in a sense, it's really the classical are commonplace, you know, of, of, uh, asking the muse to breathe through us. You know, sing to me your muse. Remember, uh, the, uh, the, the, the, the, the Elian, uh, uh, in this, hey, I'm a variant of the same thing. A variation of the same thing happens in the office. Oh, good. I apologize for the last label. Make me such a vessel. That power is, that requires for the gift of their loved Laurel. What an extraordinary image.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       This is a remembering the story of the God who chases Daphne. The object of his desire. We chicken, not really obtain, that's the stolen, you all know the story in the metamorphosis, but he can only obtain, uh, Daphne, which means lower in Greek, but he only killed, contain this young maiden, uh, uh, Daphne in the form of a metaphor for the Laurel crown. So it's a sort of a journey, which is somehow, uh, the object of which becomes the procession of the object becomes the, becomes this located not quite what the God himself wanted. But this introduces something else about the, the, the, the Paradiso thus far, the one peak of per Nassis has to face me. You may remember this is a recall of the dream of Parnassus in purgatory that we saw when the stations and Virgil were flattered into believing that what they had dreamt is actually the, the, the simulacrum of the, of the earthly paradise.

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       That's where the one pecan for NASA says, suffice me. But now I have need of both language of humility, um, entering into the arena and the arena that remains. He's a struggle. Now. First of all, they had introduced this image of himself as a vessel receptive to the, uh, inspiration of Apollo. Now, the language of even violence into the arena where there's a sports, whether it's is, uh, battles are fought, enter into the arena. Now entering on the arena that remains. And now look at this, come into my breasts and breathe there as when thou Jewess Marcis from the Scabbard of his limbs, uh, an echo of the struggle between the poet and the God. He does not want to be like Marcis because Marsha's Harold presumption. So that's now you understand the language of restraint and withholding the Lang, I will presumption Marcis had tried to outdo a Apollo and of course was defeated by a polo and flayed by Apollo.

Speaker 1:          00:26:09       Dante is not want to, but this is about is the fear in the battle for the description of paradise. That the fear that he may be usurping God's role, the fear that he may be transgressing and violating that which is the, uh, the sovereign claim of, of the gods. So he continues now, or power divine. So that's one of the, uh, images of a, a fear of blast for me. Fear of transgression. And this will continue to them about the possibility of Hubris, in other words. And then it continues our power divine, if they'll granted me so much of myself that I made sure for the shadow of the blessed kingdom imprinted in my brain, thou shall see me come to the chosen three, call rule and crown myself. Then with those leaves are which the theme and thou will make me worthy. So seldom father are there gathered for triumph of Caesar or poet.

Speaker 1:          00:27:07       Falton shame of human wheels. That opinion bowel must be get gladness in the glad Delphic God when it makes any, any long for it, a great frame for falls, huddle, spark, uh, etc. And then the lamp of the world, I'm just give you this, uh, uh, Dante is, uh, uh, approaching, uh, he's moving. He thinks he's on earth. Uh, and, and he discovers that I will not go on into to details in the, he discovers that his, uh, uh, on, uh, uh, heaven, uh, in, in, in, on the moon. Uh, so he describes here, this is the image at the bottom. Page 21 line 65. And following Beatrice stood with her eyes fixed only on the terminal wheels and on. Ha, I fixed mine, withdrawn from above at her aspect. I was changed within as was globalist when he tasted of the herbs that made him one among the other gods in the sea.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Uh, it's, it's a story of, uh, clearly the pilgrim is moving into another level of experience and our level of being and hearing remarks on the transformation that he is undergoing and the, the, the emphasis falls in the distance between the UVD an account of, of, of uh, Glaukos who believes that he's immortal and jumps into the water of the tasting of some herbs. And Dante himself is indicated by that little preposition within the transformation occurs in Dante from within himself. No in some literal way outside, uh, on the outside. And then he continues the passing beyond humanity cannot be set forth and words that the examples of Pfizer therefore for whom to cook, for him to embrace, uh, reserves. The experience, experience the pilgrim is having is unique and irreducible. And the poem, we can only be read as an example, as an account of, uh, of, uh, what has happened to him. And then he continues. If I was only the part of me, which that creates this last thou knowest love who goes to heaven, who with Dai flight did raise me and your, your, your notes. Your footnotes will tell you that this is a, uh, a reference to the second letter to the Corinthians chapter 12. Bye Paul. Bye. Same Paul, uh, with uh, he also tells the story of um, uh, his, uh, being wrapped to the third heaven.

Speaker 2:          00:29:55       So

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       we have the two accounts and Canto one of, of, of, of experiences. One is that of a, of encounters with a divine. One is that of the profit nation by marshes. And the other one leaves by saying, Paul, who is, you recall Dante, uh, uh, casts as one of the possible models for him. Says when at the beginning he has to set out from the Jordan says, I'm not an ears. I'm not poor. Now we see how Paul comes into play. Who am I? Then that was the whole thrust of the point. What happens to Paul? Paul goes to the third heaven. Uh, and, and, and, and people have a way of a head away in the Middle Ages especially said why many have inside of their, uh, you know, the third heaven and what is meant by the third heaven was the third modal vision. There are levels of vision that they emphasize that is a literal level.

Speaker 1:          00:30:47       Uh, the, the carnal worldly level. There's an imaginative vision. And then there is the ecstatic vision that Paul our head. But the think is that the second letter to the Corinthians is the Paul went to the third heaven head. The, the, the, the vision of God, the beatific vision he returned and could not speak about it, hit it because what he saw had to be kept wrapped in silence. So this is now Dante is between, uh, on the one hand Marcis and that funeral definition. And now Paul, it is as if he also is transgressing the teaching of Paul. That the whole of paradise is about limits and the possibility of establishing clear limits. He will do what Paul himself could not do. Paul kept quiet in the belief that the silence was the proper language of this. His sublime experience. Dante, we'll go on speaking pill. It's possible to him to do so. The final, he really has forgotten, uh, everything that I've seen. So you see how he's casting himself, his own point, the powers, his own subjectivity between two different modalities. He doesn't want to go as presumptuously far as Marcy has did. He does not one tool retreat as a s a s Paul did. Okay. Uh, I really think that I should let you know. No, I take a little digression before we go into the second part of the Canto.

Speaker 2:          00:32:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       And Ken to one and two where Dante is really going to face a peculiar issue. The universe. I mean, is it a material universe that's the, that's the, the, the, the thrust Canton tool. Is this a natural than part of the natural world or not? Cause I'm talking about the spots on the moon, that's Cetera. We'll come to that. Um, and here in Canton one was just see that he's going to discuss the, the, the arrangement of, of the cosmos. But you have to know. I want you to too. I want to to, uh, share with you a couple of paragraphs of a letter that Dante writes, uh, to introduce paradise. This is what had happened. Um, he lives in Ravenna when he's writing. He's probably [inaudible] at the time. He writes, uh, the earthly paradise as you know, he makes references to the garden of Eden in terms of the park, the pine wood, the wood or pine trees around the city.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       Um, uh, we do know that he will live and die in Ravenna, uh, but he decides to send the first 10 cantors paradise to the, uh, so called, uh, can, uh, the, the, the great dog of Verona who had been his patron for a number of years. And he introduces his 10 cancers that his ends with a letter code. The letter to, uh, can grant the anytime they say Dante writes, I, you know, that this is the 10th letter over a number of letters that he writes. This is, uh, this is the, uh, let me just read this. This, uh, um, it's a kind of glossing. It explains the genre of the poem, explains what his, uh, um, models have been, how has to be read. But look what he says about this, uh, uh, circumlocution here, um, about Paul the apostle. They feel this is from paragraph 27.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       It's not a really long letter, but I couldn't read the whole thing with uh, uh, putting y'all to sleep. The philosopher presents an argument constant with the above in the first book on, on Heaven, uh, the philosophy of meaning at a store too. Well, he says that I, heaven quote, has material more normal than that of other heavens beneath it. To the extent it has this more distance, then they from the earth and ability, uh, in a hierarchical structure, the nobility of matter, it will depend on its proximity to the source of, uh, of a, of light and life. Uh, okay. And to this, and too, this might be added with the Apostle Paul told the Ephesians concerning Christ who was centered above all the heavens that he might fill all things. This is the heaven of the olds. Pleasures to which pleasures at Gq refers in accusing Lucifer.

Speaker 1:          00:35:26       Thou was the seal of resemblance, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty that was in the pleasure of the paradise of God and after having said in the silicon persecution that he wasn't that part of paradise, he continues meaning he meaning I himself by stating that he sold things which he will descends sense, cannot relate and it gives the cause of they're saying that the intellect goes so deeply into its desire itself, which is God that the memory cannot follow to understand what this means, it should be noted that in this life, the human intellect, because of the affinity test for the separated intellectual substance with which it shares its nature reaches such a height of exaltation when it is Exalted, that upon his return to itself having transcended the order of the capacity of men, memory fails and this idea is implied to us by the apostle addressing the Corinthians passage.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       Just read where he writes, quote, I know a man, whether in the body or out of the body, I no, no god, no with who was caught up to the third heaven and who heard secret words, who it is not granted to men, which is not granted to men, to Arthur c when the intellect had passed beyond the bounds of human capacity and its exhortation, it could not remember what happened outside these bounds. And the same idea implied to us in Matthew where the three disciples fell down on their faces and told nothing about it afterwards as if they had forgotten. And it is written in the GQ quote I saw and I fell upon my face and quote, but if the PA, this passage is not satisfy the skeptical, let them read Richard, have some victor in his book on contemplation or Bernard of Clairvaux in his book on consideration or Augustan in his book on the capacity of the soul and there will be no longer skeptical or if they should bark out against the possibility of such exaltation because the sinfulness of the speaker, they should read Daniel where they would find that even the book of Donna's Sir by divine permission, so something which was a warning two centers and then forgot it for he who makes the sun to rise upon the good and bad a rain it upon the Justin the adjust manifest his glory to the living, no matter how evil they are sometimes mercifully for the sake of the conversion, sometimes harshly it as a punishment and to a greater or less degree according to his will.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       And the reason why I want to share this passage with you is that it really places a with some clarity itch. It casts it projects a light of a that makes things clear about this state. The status of the poem, the poem involved a number of models which are all in the contemplative philosophical tradition or again, it's not a stool, the prophetic tradition, but he makes them agree with the same mode of the visionary, you know, you see, that's what the profits do. They see in order to speak. He has no you, if your readers of the Bible, you probably have heard, uh, you may be right. If we were to believe that there really is no necessary link in the Bible between vision, between the mistakes, those have visions and those who are profits. They are two different experiences, two different states, not so for Dante.

Speaker 1:          00:39:01       It may be true, uh, in, in the Bible that they are to Dante things that they too will go to air, that you have vision in order to speak. And that's really what the, so it helps us understand the sense of, uh, of, of, of, of poetry with which, which Dante invokes here at the beginning of Paradiso. Let me go now. Uh, Dante has to go on, uh, tries to find out landlines 900. So, uh, or so, uh, uh, how, uh, us a question about, uh, uh, what has been happening to him now. I said, been moving. He thought it was on earth and the Earth, earthly paradise. Now he seems to be on another, on another planet. Client 95. If I was freed from my perplexity, um, Beatrice dismisses some fancies of is you make the surf dog with false Dan fancies, sort of cannot see is the woods, if that had cast them off, you are no longer on earth as you think, but lightening flying from its own place never ran so fast.

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       Is that return to dine the journey? Dantes is traveling so fast, the speed of light to go from the earthly paradise to the moon. If I was freed from my perplexity, um, dope, but the brief words, she smiled to me, I was more entangled in a new one. And I said I was content already resting from a great wonder, but now I wonder how I should be rising above this light substances. Um, two, three things. One, uh, that I, I should, I should, I should mention to you and that will never mention them again, but better. This was all or unfolds the whole, the, the narrative economy with the pilgrim experience in perplexities in doubt, which Beatrice will clarify. And in turn those questions, those, those, those, those responses go on triggering new doubt. So it's really a question of, uh, uh, doubts answers in an unending process of the mind and lodging and large in itself and always filled with wonder.

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       And that's really the language that I want to start emphasizing for you here. Uh, how Dante's using this figure of admiration recalls at line 97, or I was content resting from a great wonder. Now, why wonder and, uh, uh, this will, uh, you will see continues throughout the beginning of, uh, of, of, of, of Paradise. What is this wonder? It is, first of all, a definition of the aesthetics of paradise. Wonder translates the Latin, uh, Admin Rasia uh, that's the Italian word in English. Admiration, uh, which actually is to be understood at me. Roseo the Lathan English admiration. But for, for the Middle Ages, it's nothing less than the sublime. If you wanted to translate the medieval era and mid axial or alliteration into an equivalent English and aesthetic English term would be the sublime, the suit of the United States ideas. [inaudible] it's not a romantic idea is probably you are, you're led to believe it's an old idea.

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       It's the, uh, it's a Greek notion of indicating the mind that is overwhelmed with the spectacle of things that do wharf. The mind thinks that the mind cannot quite comprehend. That's the sobriety. They can be the sublime in nature. They can be the sublime and in arts they can be other forms. And the Sublime Dantas mode of paradise is indeed. This is the oscillation of a mind that is opening up full of doubts, which really now that's what he becomes subjective, critical. And then the experience with sublime overwhelming him, uh, uh, show. But this idea of the sublime now introduces a picture of the universe, the way Beatrice will deliver it. She therefore, after a sigh of pity, I love her and I say, you know, the way she's going to two, three, Dante, like a child that is formed as a result, a bent her eyes on me with a look of a mother cat.

Speaker 1:          00:43:37       Look, her mother casts on her delirious child, delirious in the theological sense. I don't think that he's really actually crazy delirious or the word English word. We use delirium since me as simply means getting off the furrow. Leerom in Latin means the furrow. Wherever you go off, uh, the rat as it were or some or the further you are tracing, then you are delirious. You are going off on your own in some kind of a silly a direction. And she began. That's the, the first picture of the universe. And we are going to find that this picture is going to be refined in a number of ways, but this is what he can understand. Now. All things whatsoever have order among themselves. That's the premise in Dante's costs and they will just add for you. And he continues. She continues. And this is the form that makes the universe resemble God.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       This is so, so that the universe has enlightened us to the divinity, to things to be said immediately. The word order in case you don't know it's or though that our deo means beauty, it's idea that it's, it's the symmetrical arrangement of proportionate light, full of light and clarity. Uh, um, uh, structure of all of the whole order. This, even the word Pharma, one of it means form means that there is a shape to things, but it translates the Latin [inaudible] another synonym for beauty. The picture of the universe that Dante, that Beatrice evokes for Dante is one of beauty. Um, uh, which in turn implies a vision because beauties and they find that that was she seen, gives me pleasure. This is the famous definition of Aquinas that which has seen, gives pressure. That's beauty. It's a sort of subjective idea of beauty here. Of course Beatrice thinks of an objective order of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:45:54       It's not, it's not the fact that I like it. Only though Aquinas also gives that, that, that, that, that, uh, explanation of beauty that which scene pleases, that implies a self, uh, it tastes a personal taste and made the very, very rich, medieval understanding of the aesthetic experience. But there is also an objective idea of the whole universe laid out in older shape clarity. These are the proposed number, proportion clarity. These are the attributes of a, of beauty. And this, this cosmological do that. And just to, with this line that the universe is, resembles card seems to be such a nice way of thinking about the universe. But if you really think about it, it's really a heretical proposition. You know, the universe, it's like God, what about the evil that there is in the universe? Is the idea that there is a continuity between God's transcendence and God's eminence that says, Hey, I know that he's a little bit like Marcis and he just doesn't like it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:02       He just likes to be a little better than Paul. There are at least he's going to talk, but now this is really strange statement and therefore has to be clarified. And I think, uh, uh, she will, I talk like this because I have to explain that I just was looking at an old, a great text of 'em in view of my class today, last night. It was really a great text by a Lovejoy. So some of you may know him. It was a great, one of the truly great inventor, one can speak to this. The whole idea of the history of ideas in, in, in the United States used to be a great professor in the forties 50s and early success at Johns Hopkins. And he wrote a great book, which I still advise people to read the great chain of being. Cause that's really the idea, you know, the great chain of being.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       It's this, that God is this great chain of being. It's this a virtual, a metaphor of the continuity between the world of unity and the world of multiplicity. And parality said, you know, and it implies that we are on the, uh, that the whole universe is this arrangement, a chain and invisible chain. It's an idea that reappears in the 18th century English literature. Pope, for instance, he uses his, that I read this in, in Lovejoy, uh, the, uh, but it also implies it's, it's a strange idea as it implies that the value of things, the values of every entity depends on the position one occupies in the various rings of the chain so that if you are an angel, then you're really above, uh, above human beings were made all bolt where beastly and angelic at the same time. We have this kind of paradoxical quality of being spiritual, an animal at the same time.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       And then we are according to the idea, don't, some of you may doubt it. We are better than dogs and dogs are better than stones and so on is in a kind of hierarchy, a system of degrees. And, and he loved Joel goes on saying, well, this is really the moment when Dante has, is adopting the idea of the great chain of being and this great chain of being makes him a really unorthodox. I want to tell you that that's not true because I think we should read more carefully this passage. This is the beginning here and others about this resemblance. Uh, the universal resemble God. Here Beatrice continues to the high creatures. See the impress of the terminal excellence, which is the end of which that system itself is made in the older I speak of all natures have their bands. We all have our own specific gravity.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       We're all drone. We have done by our desires. We go, we're, we're at desire, uh, takes us desires. And so there's a kind of natural instinct, the natural movement in this way in which a stone, if you drop it for or risk to the ground naturally because of its specific gravity and the fire, if you light a candle, the fire will always go up. Instinctively, all things move according to their weight, according the specific weight. It's a spiritual gravity. Now, are we like that? Is that really what Dante is saying? That it seems easy? He seems so that's where he seems to be saying according to the different laws and near to the source and farther from it. They move there for two different poles over the great sea of being each with an instant given to it, to Barry wrong. This bear fire up towards the moon.

Speaker 1:          00:50:56       Uh, this is by the way, this is really the passage, his lantus rewriting a passage from Augustine's confessions. This is the motive force in more to creatures. This binds the earth together and makes it one and not only the creature that with our intelligence as this bow shoot, but also have intellect and love meeting us. We have intellect and love. You know the, remember the famous great poem from about women who have intellect and law. Now we all have, yeah, she says, she says Internet, the providence that regulates all this mixed forever quiet with its light, the heaven within which turns out of the greatest speed on top of the Primo Morbidity and didn't now as to a place, a point of the power of the bow string is bearing us which aims at a joyous mark. It is true. And now that's the correction to Lovejoy's interpretation. It is true that as a shape of and does not accord with the arts intention because the material is definitely responsive. So sometimes the creature having the powders impelled to turn aside another way deviates from his course and there's fire maybe seem to fall from a cloud lightened inc for instance, like does not go always up tight, can call also down. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       and this farmer is far from my couch. So the primary impulse diverted by false pressure, it turn to the earth. In other words, within this description of the order of the cosmos be as it goes on to say that human beings are the odd, the old figures that we somehow have the power to.

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       Did you deviate from this pattern of order that we can undo? We have this paradoxical freedom that makes us are the stay within a particular idea of what God may have meant or really for us or really, uh, uh, uh, breach that particular or the human beings are the certain elements in this older portrait of the universe. And that is the whole statement of freedom. So the Dante's removing from a deterministic, that w w that's what it would make it into a heretical texts at idea of what are the cosmo Moses. Then she turned her face again to the sky. Let me go. I was a little bit, uh, quickly on or can to, to, um, and so, uh, but I will need a few minutes. Came to to Dante now is in the sphere of the moon. Um, you know that and there'd be a discussion on the spot.

Speaker 1:          00:53:48       This is whole medieval legend. Uh, if you look at the moon and full moon, you see the dark spots and the legend was that cane and the medieval legend that cane, uh, running away from, uh, the, the, the knowledge of the murder of her, of his brother had actually, uh, with the help of God that had removed him from the earth and had taken refuge there. And wherever we see there is just the imprint of Cain. Dante dismisses this legend. What goes on talking about science. She, Beatrice will have a scientific discourse. And the question is, is this unnatural cosmos or not? Do we, do we see shades on the moon simply because they said density or, uh, not orality, uh, of matter? Or is it because it therefore light has a way of going through this Ma matter of the moon, uh, according to the principle or more or less the radically and density?

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       Or is it because there's a different way in which light is distributed? The Solution Dante gives or Beatrice will give? It's the second one. We should the shadows on the moon simply because I said different source of light. In other words, the natural cosmos has to be understood in terms of its metaphysics. The physics has only can only be understood in terms of metaphysics. But what I want to stress to you is that the natural and the supernatural are always seen by Dante as holding hands together. There are not two separate worlds. They're not two separate. Uh, uh, they, they mentioned that two different ways of looking at the same, at the same thing. But let's see how he introduces the Cantor, which I think is important for a number of reasons came to true or you who in a little bark. The language of humility, uh, is suspects at this point because we know that the sublime is, uh, is the mode is the trope that he will use or you in a little bark.

Speaker 1:          00:56:00       You, he's addressing us is beginning a dressing. Readers eager to listen, um, have followed behind my ship. The singing makes her way turned back to see your shores again. Do not put fault on the deep for perhaps losing me. You would be left bewildered. That waters I take what? I never sailed before. Oh, that's uh, it gives poignancy to the little bark. It's a little bark and he was, I'm doing such, I mighty. I'm engaged. Such a magnificent, extraordinary adventure. Right? The one is the take we're never seal before. Minerva breeds are polar pilots. Me and the nine busers show me the bears and then a restriction of the, the children's that he has been addressing. You are the few, uh, kind of reductive apostrophe. The very few here. The, it's the lucky, I'm the lucky [inaudible] he would say, have you guys a very few really know and are interested in the mysteries in the, in the most esoteric, uh, hurricane sciences that he's going to put out here.

Speaker 1:          00:57:13       Uh, you are the few that reached out early that the language actually says turn your neck. Uh, this is really poor translation. I don't know what other, um, since later say, uh, you are the few who turn your neck because it's the whole idea. Uh, another form of presumption. You, you may have heard, you may recall in the Bible, but the stiff neck, right? The definitely the, of course the neck is always the emblem of conversion when you want to, when you, for Plato, you reach a conversion. You really turn the neck. That's how you do toward a, not for Dante that he turned upside down, but in, in play to you turn the neck and you know where the source of light is. The Biblical counter to that is the, maybe the, the stiff neck, those who do not, who lack humility right behind this metaphor.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       That is the whole idea that what makes a human being, what confers dignity to a human being is the power that we among all animals have to look up at the sky and see and look at the stars and therefore wonder all other animals are always looking down, right? We are alone. Of course, there are other people who believe that what makes human beings give particular dignity to human beings is something else. The of all of them as those who said that we speak of course, but they have all of them. The one I really like is that we are capable of laughing. Uh, that's the exploration. It's an Aristotelian idea, but it's exploration of, uh, of, of, of comedy. Uh, to hear. It's that that's the illusion though. You have who feel, who could be also implying like me that do not be too arrogant about this.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       Who reached out early for angels, bread, knowledge for knowledge by which men here live but never come from. It's satisfied. You may indeed put forth your vessel on the salt that holding my furrow before the water returns smooth. Again, those glorious ones who crossed the sea to call Chris. We're not amazed. Once again, the language of admiration, that language is sublime. Or can I come to this in a moment as you shall be when the they sold Jason Turn. Plowman okay. Um, well, the metaphor of the journey by water to describe now an real journey. So an anti Dante is clearly thinking of that metaphoric compression that we saw in Ulysses. Remember the sailing that became a mad flight. Now here, if the flights that becomes a ceiling, um, and, and the notion that he's guiding us, so the sense of his responsibility, he's turning his back, unlike Ulysses.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       Okay? We dispose of that mythic resonance, uh, very quickly. But what he's really saying is that the journey we're undertaking, which is the reading of this book, can become extraordinarily dangerous. And why? The reason why it becomes dangerous is because he's traveling over water that leaves no wake behind it. This is the, the, the, the what I would call the danger of the seafaring in seafaring. You have no preestablished roots. There is nothing. There's no way, no road, no path that can be they're fixed then you can find. So he's inviting us to keep very close to him, but we might be losing him at the same time. The journey by water is not exactly like the journey by land because there are no pre established directions marked are for us. And then finally this allusion to Jesus. So he's not like a uterus. This is like, like the, the hero of the organoids who has gone looking for the Golden, the golden flees.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       And He, uh, it's an image that he appears at the end of Paradiso 33 where Dante has the god Neptune from the depth wondering at the extraordinary power of the human imagination and the human will that wonder at the heroics of Jason, uh, telepathy owners without, uh, he can't quite believe what he, when he sees it's clearly an illusion to a Dante himself is going to do in, in, in, uh, seeing God face to face. And then, uh, and then returning to the earth. But what I want to emphasize in the here really I will stop. They'll give you a chance to ask me some questions. The is that we probably never read. Uh, I think we skipped Canto, um, 18 of him. Fair? No, I think we did. I don't think that I asked you to read it and I don't presume that you would go and read what I don't ask you to read.

Speaker 1:          01:02:17       So you, you never really did. But in Cantwell 18, Dante, you there, if you go and read Canto of inferno, you will find Jason punished among the flatters and the juicer because he's the famous for seducing hips pile and abandoning her. Okay. It's a version of what happened. Fees. You said media. It's, it's one of the great fixation Salva of Greek. Chuck, one of the great situations of repeat the situations of a Greek tragedy. But the interesting thing is that bumper now is distinguishing between the ethical judgment of Jason who is behind in, in February team and the imaginative aesthetic value of the adventure itself.

Speaker 2:          01:03:02       No.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       Is he saying that if for that the good and the Butte and the beautiful I really two distinct things, he's warning us about that. And that's what I want to pick up the conversation, uh, next time where we are going to be talking about the value of images and uh, the ethics of images. But let me finish here now and see if there are some questions which I will try to answer.

Speaker 3:          01:03:45       Please. Turning your minds to the bread of angels. And then he talks about the image of water and all of those symbols that come in. But it seems a little strange to me that you're talking about translation did that you're turning your mind to bread. It's very strange. I was just wondering if you could talk about that symbolism or significance of that is turn your mind.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       The, the question is about explaining, uh, the image of bread, uh, in the beginning of Canto two of paradise, uh, where Dante says dressing the readers that they are turning their, uh, their, their neck, uh, too early to the bread of angels. Uh, I have a question for you. What we'll do. You find that strange?

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       Well, I have nine that instead of turning your neck, but just,

Speaker 1:          01:04:42       okay. Oh, right. Okay. The, well, the bread of angels. So I would see the bread of angels and the breadth of angels is his knowledge. So I think that the implied, uh, the, the, the, the, the transference, the metaphorical reading by Mandelbaum is accurate. Uh, I wish it were a more literal, um, but just justice. I think that my own translation, of course, saint clay are also, it's one of the few times that he, he, he, he, he, he deviates from the, the literal, because the literal burden of the, of the metaphor, uh, has a number of residences, which I think are valuable. Like exactly the stiff neck, the, the, the turning of the neck, uh, in, in the context, in a context like paradise where Dante starts out by clearly, uh, locating himself within some, some contradictory possibilities, the possibility of a transgression or the possibility of, uh, uh, trespassing in the case of, uh, of Paul. So what exactly is he so that that image is his, his by the image of the, of the, the turning of the neck, uh, early for the bread of the angels is also a reverberates with anxieties that he has about his own adventure and a, and his own enterprise. That's, I don't know if this answers your perplexity but yes.

Speaker 3:          01:06:15       So the random angels

Speaker 1:          01:06:17       knowledge, uh, of angels is no knowledge. Yeah. That, which, you know, the I the idea that you find in the banquet that why, why do philosophers, what I'm sure that it's literally true that there is nothing better for a great philosophical conversation then, you know, a glass of wine and you sit it out and then you'll, you and, and, and your talk. But it clearly is, uh, uh, is the food for, of knowledge, the food of the mind, the food of knowledge, uh, the taste of knowledge, et Cetera, all those metaphors.

Speaker 3:          01:06:53       The bread of life.

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       Yes. Since that's very good. That's very good. Because I think, uh, cannot be also grace. Yes. That's what it was. Because we are healing the world of paradise. And I know that I'm really, I'm, I'm giving a Chi sort of philosophical, our emphasis, but there is also the, with Paul that is also the fuel. So we were dealing with a poetic, more than the philosophic, the poetic and the theological together. Absolutely. Very good. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:07:18       Um, other questions please. Um, beginning of Canto Lynn, when he describes how God shed some more or less pure men light on different parts, um, the phrase pure of men, it was also used in purgatory, um, to describe different aesthetic perspectives. Is Dante trying to bring that in here or is he just talking about the hierarchy of who God chooses to shed light on?

Speaker 1:          01:07:48       Well, good, good. Uh, the question is in a line three of Paradiso, one, uh, Dante uses the phrase more and less talking about the light that shines on a creation according to a principal of more or less. And then the, the concern is with Dante uses this phrase quite often in Canto 10 of purgatory, where in the world context of art, uh, that is that phrase about approach. I call it the approximation. Uh, uh, so it's, it's, it's, it's done to joining the tool. Does he want us to, uh, to, to put the two things together and let me answer that far, be it from me ever to say no. Dante does not want us to do that. The whole reading, I mean, if there's a principle to the way I read is that they're more echos. You can find the better it, the better.

Speaker 1:          01:08:45       I think that we serve, whether we understand the appointment, we reserve what we, I take it to be the intention of the poet. Uh, but I had never really conjoined the tool in my own mind for one simple reason, because here I think it's, it's Dante's asserting the principle of hierarchy. I think that improved factorial dentists doing something completely different. Uh, since it's the context, there is pride. He's really reversing or forms of, uh, of, of, uh, what is the measure the human beings, how do we measure human beings? I could say that this is actually a problem that goes here every time you have a higher, okay. You know, um, really placing myself in between a Noda, a rank, uh, of, of, of different values. And so I can say that that is also happening in, in, in, in a, in Canto one. But frankly, the context will not allow me to go far to much beyond this.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       So yeah, there is a way in which every time I talk off of hierarchy, I'm talk, I'm talking about a rank ordering and, and therefore the sense of my place. It's a little bit removed from the concerns here, uh, of uh, uh, it's there, it's there, but not the most compelling argument for me. Uh, you may, you may prove me wrong of course, but, uh, I would say this issue, uh, appears there. You know, we can we join things together. Let's try to keep also each entity in its home specificity so that we really understand that the, the, how far he's thinking can go with a representation of a scene than another. But I like that. Good. I like the fact that you true joy, you combine, yes,

Speaker 2:          01:10:43       we're speeding. Why people paradise, how one would need to know about philosophy and theology. And politics in border.

Speaker 1:          01:11:07       That's the question is

Speaker 1:          01:11:11       who on earth could Dantes audience B? We know who the audience of Houma Virgil, uh, can be. Uh, [inaudible] is, uh, w w what about the audience for, until someone who has to know philosophy, theology, uh, and so on. Uh, and my answer is, you're right, we do know roughly about Houma, uh, because after all the, there is always the modal course in the all this see who, uh, is singing to the audience at court till your list disappears and their episodes and Houma, uh, is, is the, uh, one of the reps holds. I may be the one who stitches together. The voices are episodes that gives us immediate, your, uh, account of an audience. Um, um, with Dante is a little bit more difficult to understand. It's, I think con, I can tell you in our contemporary reports think that Dante is a poem, especially in federal, ought to be read in the streets.

Speaker 1:          01:12:20       Like really [inaudible] going on the ancient Greece. They would go from one fair or market place and the day with the market to another and gather people together. They feast days of the community. Um, but I can be a little bit more romantic that I think it's true. Uh, but that Dante probably did read some of his cantos when he was in Ravenna and a over owner to the, the in the evening gathering the circles of, uh, of courtiers. Uh, but, but I don't think of Dante's a coacher. I mean, it doesn't seem to have the values. Pairs are the Socratic values of the mind, of course, but he doesn't seem to share the social problems of the court. I can think of, uh, some aspects of Shakespeare being, Eh, Eh, the poet of the court, the poet who would be read by the Queen and he wants, he wants the queen to read his, his texts or the theater.

Speaker 1:          01:13:23       We know about the theater. Uh, uh, a part of Paradiso was not known at all. Some people, the first time cantors were sent to the patron who would probably give him a check. But today we'll call it grant. You know, you apply for a grant. They'll give him a, uh, a gift for, for the great, extraordinary dedication. That's what patrons would, the role they would play. But I think that Dante, and this is going to be a very romantics, are Benjamin now, uh, I think that Dante writes this kind of poetry at the end to for God. I don't think that he could care. Uh, uh, I only has a, an empirical audience in mind. He really means that the few, I don't think it's a total strategy at the end. You feel we're going to read that and, and uh, it's too much written.

Speaker 1:          01:14:19       It's written too much in the mode of a quest for God. You know, the, the prayer actually, it's a more a moment at one point where language bends into a prayer and they're hit with the language of a longing that, that, that goes with prayer. That I really think it's meant for God. I mean it in a very serious way and ends with a prayer. The Great Kanto 33 is what an extraordinary prayer. Um, so that's my answer. Uh, I'm sure that the, you know, I have a dear friend, uh, who wants to make a movie about reading Dante in the streets. And that's fine, but I'm not sure, uh, that, that's what Dante thought. I mean, I read them. I'm not sure about that. Um, great question. Thank you. So you're excited.
