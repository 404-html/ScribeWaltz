Speaker 1:          00:00:01       We'll begin today with, uh, uh, in fair, no, let me say a few things about the poem in general as the structure of Department of form or structure. And then we get into the, uh, the cantos one, two, three, four, which have been assigned to you. Um, I already, in passing in my introductory remarks, I did, I did say something about the title. As you recall, the title of the poem, the poem, we referred to it as the divine comedy. It should be comedy. That's what Dante calls it. And he called it comedy for a number of reasons. The first reason is that it ends in, uh, with in, in, in happiness. It's a story that begins with a kind of a disorder catastrophe if you wish, the pilgrim who is lost in the woods and then works himself out toward the light, told the truth toward God.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       That's so comedy describes the, the, uh, thematic trajectory of, uh, the poem. It's, it's, uh, it's going from one condition to another. And from this point of view, it's the very opposite of the tragic movement in the tragic movement. You'll always have some kind of initial state of cohesion or an initial state of happiness that then goes on going toward the, uh, some kind of fatality or a disaster. Uh, but it is a second reason for the title comedy at the second reason is stylistic. Uh, Dante, he calls it a comedy because he adopt the vernacular first of all, as opposed their possibility would have been writing it in Latin, in a kind of a, the language of philosophy and the language of great cultural exchanges, but it calls it instead, he uses the Italian vulgar language. It also means a, stylistically he adopt a humble style.

Speaker 1:          00:02:02       You know what the theory of styles is coming to us from ancient Greece and Rome. Uh, there are three levels of styles, uh, three levels of style that is the high, a tragic style, the sublime style that describes exactly the events that involve kings since style is must have some, some kind of APP tennis to the situation that the story describes. Then there is a middle style or [inaudible] style and then there is a, a low style, the style of comedy, the style. Then did Dante, uh, with adopts lowly, uh, that this is a kind of a peculiar implication for Dante to call a story such as his, a comedy. And this is the implication that are in effect, he undercuts the idea of a rigid hierarchy of reality. There is no such a neat separation of the high, the middle and the law that which is low and humble, such as the experience is describing or his own experience and no ordinary human being of living around the year 1300 who manages to have this extraordinary experience of going up to see the face of God and come back to return a call back two years to, to tell us about it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       Uh, it's really a sign that the lo can become high and the high can become law. That is that a classical, uh, distinctions that we read, the of which we read in the poetics of virustotal that Dante did not know or in horses poetic heart that Dante did know, uh, are really, uh, false. I really user it. This is not the way to proceed. So Dante has a number of items that he's pursuing in calling this text. Uh, uh, the comedy. The other thing you have to say about the formal structure of the poem is you all know it's divided into three parts, hell, purgatory and paradise easy. Each of them has 33 cantos with the exception of, of inferno in federal has 34 cancers, which means has one can to, one is we're going to read in a moment plus 33 they are neatly separated in that can to one represents and stands for a kind of general rehearsal.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       It's a journey that fails, downplay the real journey. We'll begin with Ken too. So uh, it has 100 canters but the basic unit of his narrative is the three. Number three, in fact, it's written in so called a style or a magical formula. He devices are so called Delta Rema that I'm sure you recall from your own readings in high school or in other courses that they have even, which uses the rhyme scheme is always going to be a, B, a, B, c, B, and so on. Number three, once again, is the, the, uh, the fundamental symbolic, a number of division within, uh, within this text. What is the reason for this? There is a large aesthetic reason and aesthetic reasons, but it can be found, formulated, crystallized in a verse from the Book of Wisdom. You are God have created everything according to number measure and weight. And so the divine comedy has to duplicate the symmetry and the older and the harmer he that he thinks he sees in the universe.

Speaker 1:          00:05:37       The poem is presented and produced as a reflection of that superior divine order of the universe and wants to be part of it. So it's both as this kind of ambivalence to reflect it and become what we call a Maconomy, uh, the part that wants to be to a larger, uh, ho. Uh, so these are the, some general concerns that you gotta have it now, uh, about deploying some general ideas that will help you understand the pattern of parallelisms that are we going to find within the poem. And that can give you one very quickly. Now in a sense, I'm really asking you that when you read the poem, you should be aware that there is a kind of linear structure from one to 100, uh, and yet within the triple a, the traditional department hell, purgatory and paradise there Qantas that correspond to one another, 10 to six of inferno, uh, prefigures Canto six Uga, toto in both of them in turn will prefigure Canto six of paradise can [inaudible] and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       It can be done, but can 10, 10 and 10, it can be done in a fairly systematic way. So, uh, if you wish, sometimes you could really read, uh, one, two, three, four and yet one, one and one which is, oh, maybe you wait until the end of the poem when you have read the whole poem and then you can go back and read it. A horizontal is it where as much as vertically down. So these are some, some uh, employee ideas, general concerns and implications in Dante's structure of the port. We begin now with Canto one. It's a very well known cancer where the, the step general preamble, uh, you know how the poem starts is I'm just reading the Eh, the famous lines. Everybody reads a and everybody probably remembers in the middle of the journey of our life, I came to myself.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       Those of you have a different installation, will nonetheless, uh, get the gist and it's, it's the changes. The shifts are really minimal. I came to myself within a dark wood where the strict way was lost. Ah, her hardest thing it is to tell that would savage and harsh and then the thought to which renews my fear so bitter. It is that death is hardly more. But to give account of the good, which I found there, I will tell of the other things I noted there. I cannot write retail how I entered there. I was so full of sleep at that moment when I left it through rea. But when I had reached the foot of the hill at the end of the valley, we should pierced my heart with fear. I looked up and so it's shoulders already clouded with the beams of the planet that leads men straight on every road.

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       Then the fear was quiet to the little which had continued in the lake of my heart during the night had spent so PTSD. And as he who with labeling breath has escaped from the deep to the shore terms to the pearls waters and engages. So my mind, which was still flight turned back to look again at the pass, which never let yet any go live. It's an a great beginning. It begins in a very, uh, extraordinary way, begins with, uh, in the middle to begin with. Right? So that's the, the beginning is in the middle. The beginning is the present a reality of the pilgrim who finds himself lost, but it's more in that first line in the middle of the journey of our life. Um, what is he saying? I think it's fairly clear the first conceit and the fundamental conceit of the poem is that life is a journey, which means her, we are always on the way.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       We don't know where we're going yet. Uh, he will find out soon, which means that we are displaced, which means we're going to have an number of adventures. It means that we are not yet where we want to be. Life is a journey. In fact, he will go on. We're only calling in the middle of the journey. He also calls it our life that, that that's a possessive our life. It's sexist way of establishing one fact that this is not really yet a unique experience is something we all share in something which might also concern us. That we are also not only he is in the journey of his life, but we too are in that journey of the common journey of her life. And then in contrast with that, there is now an autobiographical focus. There is a stress of I found I are, I came to myself within a dark wood and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       I, so this is going to be very much the story once again very much has the Vitor. Moreover, uh, an autobiographical story can only be a personal story, but here the self is going to see the world is coming to see himself through the prism of the world. He will lend to a public space. The great difference I will say between the Vita Nuova, which we just looked at last time, and the divine comedy is the following. The Vita Nuova was destined to fail as a narrative. Exactly because the, the, the, the protagonist went home, uh, drawing us, enjoying himself within the solitude, the inferiority of, uh, of his own life alive, which was completely disengaged from the concerns for the outside the outside world. The divine comedy starts exactly with that kind of ship wreck, the shipwreck of some other intellectual activities that he will go on describing.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       And I will describe it with you as soon as we read this first slide. I came to myself in a dark wood. And you, if you read a lot of traditional commentators, medical treasure commentators will tell you, oh, well, Dante is here in the state of sin are the dark wood, uh, is really the condition of spiritual. Maybe despair. He's an impasse, an impasse. We know he doesn't know where to go. I think that this are a little bit too easy and it's not really, we have no evidence for this in the poem yet. We don't know what, what did we do know is that Dante law is lost in the landscape. That is terrifying. He's caught within it. He's clueless about how he got there. I don't even know how he goes on to say, I don't know how I got myself in that situation, whatever that situation was.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       But he knows one thing that he wants to get out of it. He understands that. He understood. He does not know yet how he has to get out of the situation, but he knows that he has to get out of it. Impanelment of the wood. Um, and uh, and then he goes on our heart. That is et cetera. So bitter is that death is how the remote, but to give a count that's an ex terse it of the good, which I found there. I will tell the other things I that in a way the problem is already over. He's now shifting from the narrative of events. You know, I was lost in the van. Savage hush would have a night. His gaze rents this night, tries to find out. I cannot see anything beyond himself immediately he says, but to tell you the good day noted there I have to tell you other things that poem has right from the start, the double narrative focus.

Speaker 1:          00:13:17       The first focus is that he's going to tell us the story of a pilgrim who is caught in the quarter. We call the diachronic the time bound. The daily events are a number of encounters which he can not quite this hide as to their meaning. So He's, he's led by virtualizing going to find out soon but he doesn't understand what's happening to him. And then there is the second focus and it's the focus of the poet who has seen it all and then enjoys what we would call an omniscient perspective and the whole poor and really moves around this double axis. The axis of Eh synchronic view synoptic view of the poet a lot who are senior, who has, he becomes a port. It was a pilgrim. Has had this experience. And then he goes on telling us about this experience. That's what I call a synoptic adolescent narrator.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       And then, uh, he looks at the, at the, of what the pilgrim did not know. This, a kind of irony in this discrepancy between the day or chronic viewpoint of the pilgrim and the synoptic viewpoint of the, uh, of the port, uh, goes without saying that the structure is not that neat. You will see that there are moments when Dante would go on one's point of view, will encroach upon the other. So we'll tell you more about this particular structure and now he starts this. Now let's see what has happened. Uh, I can not tell how this is the second paragraph of installation. I cannot rightly tell how I enter there. I will still of sleep at that moment. It's a kind of torpid, lethargic, uh, that lack of consciousness that like the lack of any, everything, his faculties are dormant. Let's, let's paraphrase it like that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:03       When I left the two way, but when I reached the foot of the hill, at the end of that Valet, we should pierced my heart with fear. I looked up and saw the shoulders already quoted within the beams and the planet that leads it in straight on every road or he does don't has come. Uh, dawn breaks and he looks up toward the sun believing that the natural sunlight is going to unveil to him the layout of the land and he may find Eh, uh, uh, an escape route from this particular disaster. Uh, apparently one thing that if this were, eh, a platonic narrative, that point would come to an end right here because this is what happens in a platonic narrative. You are in a cave. You know, we are all, this is a famous myth of the republic. We see nothing. We only see flickers of light.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       It's like being at the movies, flickers of light and real. There are simulations of the truth that they are being projected on the side of the cave. And we mistake those shadows. Four realities. If you are really wise and you are a philosopher than you do know that you can turn your neck around and find out where the source of true writers and then you are saved. The whole experience of the cave is predicated on this premise, that knowledge save shoe, that knowledge is virtual and knowledge that save you to the extent in which it really can heal. But why call? So what one could call the, the, the wounds of, uh, of the intellect, ignorance being the wound of the intellect, which knowledge, learning, uh, uh, education philosophy could really cure Dan too. We'll find out very quickly that that is a false promise that in many ways that our realities and that his own reality is going to be a little bit what complex then are, what one can find in books, manuals or philosophy about how we get saved and how we can save ourselves.

Speaker 1:          00:17:13       And let's see what he says and what happens. So he sees a, he turns toward the, uh, the light. I saw the already they've the sunlight and then he, the he fear are this, this passion, uh, because it's a passion of the soul. The fear that paralyzes him and paralyzes is discernment. He cannot pay it. It literally stops him, does not know which way to go. And it's, it's, it's the, the overpowering, uh, passion at this point of the point was quieted a little which had continued in the lake of my heart during the night I spent so PTSD a dark night. What, what leads some basics done. This is not a mistake. Please clear the alluding to the dark night. This is the dark night of the soul. This is a spiritual experience that has found now it's coming to a head. Uh, Eh, if you wish.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       And this he who the laboring breath has escaped from the deep to the shore, turns to the perils of waters and gays is so my mind, which was still in flight. You see, look, the whole passage, I have to tell you this whole, the two paragraphs with it is replete with neoplatonic language. He's talking about himself as if this were a fright of the soul sought the flight or the mind, my mind, which was still in flight. This is the idea that we have experience share, pure intellectual, that kind of experiences that we can all find when we're reading a book, we are studying, we are thinking that mine takes its flight. Okay. This is an intellectual problem. Other, there are other many other terms here that remind us of the, his use is deliberate use of neoplatonic language. For instance, the word woods, which is it a lot in this, uh, in in the Italian is Silva, uh, which translates the Greek Cuellar which isn't always the prime or matter are the which then the demiurge or form and shape reality.

Speaker 1:          00:19:02       And yet immediately there is a great shift that I want to, to focus on briefly after had rested my weird frame for a little, I took my way again over the desert slope keeping all with the lower foot from and low almost at the beginning of the steep peppered light and very swift covered with a spot at hide. And it did not go from before my face, but so impeded my way that I turned many times to go back. Uh, he has been just now talking about the flight of the mind. My mind was still in right. It's an experience of a shipwreck for wall that many epic stories begin like that. Think of the Aeneid, the shipwreck of in years on the, on the shores of Africa as he's about to enter the city. Dido is about to build, right? And that will bring him to a great revelation and their great love story with Dido here, there's no such, such a relief for him.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       It's the shipwreck of the mind and mind that seems to be literally unable to define both his whereabouts and his destination. But as soon as he does, as soon as he understands that what, that's what the problem is, he shifts the language from mind to body. My weird body, and this is the great difference between neoplatonic narratives and Dante's kind of experience, the intrusion of body, and what is the body, what does the body stand for? The limit of purely intellectual journeys. The real journey that he has to undertake is the journey of mind and body. And their body stands for the irreducible historicity of oneself. The stands for one tone. Uh, the reality, the passions stands for one's hall. Well, this is the difference between what the Greeks understand as the great, uh, intellectual ventures, which is one of knowledge and Dante's idea that the real problems are problems of the wheel.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       We may know all where we are and we all may understand that we are not happy with the situation that we find ourselves with, but we can look quite solve it because the problem by knowledge, because the problems are problems of willing. What is he doing? Let me just try to make this very simple. There are two schemes. I'm really simplifying it too because I think this is dramatic enough in and of itself. I don't have to overdo it with, with unnecessary complications. That is a Socratic scheme whereby all issues or issues of intellectual, intellectual, the intellectual sought. Uh, I know, and therefore I'm virtue. I know, um, I know what justice is and the implication is I'm just, that's a false implication was if, if I go around the room here and ask you all to give me a definition of each and every one or your definition of justice, you will tell me something that justice is a justice within the self.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       That just is the way I relate to my family or just as a way or relate to the city or just as a way to take care of the problems or whatever of the world that I find myself in. Dante, we'll say this is not the knowledge of what the definition of justice can not make you adjust. The issue is one of willing desire. The other scheme that downhill poses to the Socratic idea that all issues are issues of philosophy or ratios of knowledge is one of the will in the letter to the Romans Send Paul writes the good that I will do that I do not do the evil that I would do, that I do. He draws attention to the essential existential problem. The problem of herself, my will is divided against itself. May the the only way I may know where it, what to do, but I do not know really.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       I'm not sure that I will, uh, will it, that's the fatality of life. And we all know what's good. Many of us go around choosing and doing what we know, uh, where he goes. So is we know it's good for us. It's not the best in terms of our own judgment of situations. So he's willing and uh, the perspective of the will becomes Dante's perspective in coming to terms with the limitations of philosophy, intellectual knowledge. We shall see, uh, Dante talks about the will in, in a, in a number of ways. Last time talking about the Vita Nuova I was, I began mentioning to you that, uh, they will, is even better of course for him then unwilling and yet the best experiences life seem to be those a one does not want to happen to us. As I say, Dream for instance, the dream or falling in love or, or sometimes in the death of the beloved.

Speaker 1:          00:23:56       No, you don't. He didn't search it. Didn't not want that death of Beatrice. It's a way of understanding that unwilling is as compelling as willing. And yet he understands that as soon as he focuses on Beatrice as the figure, the real contingent, historical figure of love, that he has to give a direction to his own desires that he has to, to define the wheel so that it's, you understand what I'm saying? Uh, and he understands that too. So that's already an anticipation of what, uh, of the problems with the will. Now he starts exploring other problems. We should, we'll see both as they relate to the self, to the psychology of the character, but also still relate to politics, for instance, to a vision of the world as an act of, and the projection of our own will that the world is the way we want it to be.

Speaker 1:          00:24:49       And that may not to, to the way in which we relate to problems, which are problems necessarily problems, the problems of reality, et cetera. For the time being though Dan prepare pigs the will as his own or the body, his own, uh, his own perspective. He find out, he finds out that he can not go up the hill, that he has seen three beasts, just paraphrasing the tech's, a leopard, a she wolf Elian on that all the lion and the she wolf will block his, uh, his journey up. And so he's going right back where he finds himself in this. He's now back into the, the, the, the, the deepest despair possible because there seems to be now really no exit then, ah, he something he sees something when I was rushing down to the place below the, appeared before my eyes, one whose voice seemed weak from long silence when I saw him in that great waste.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       And as you know, because this is, uh, uh, the first words that he, Dante was ses have picked, the pilgrim have pity on me, whoever the, our tech tried to him shade or real men. These are the words taken from the psalms, Ms. Herrera, of, of, uh, so his, his prostrating of King David. So He's prostrating yourself. And that stress this because the voice, the village voice will constitute an important strain in this matter. How does Dante Talk? That's, that's one of the ways and we should see how discreetly it will appear further down in the poem. And now the conversation when he meets is the fear he meets is Virgil. Uh, no, not, not Maine. Once I was a man said, look, we can stop a little bit to reflect on what is this experience here has been like, and we can we define it in some ways.

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       Dante finds him sort of lost in a landscape. He does not know how he got there. He, the sunlight, the natural sunlight as the light of truth by fallen, which he thinks he can reach the plane of tools up to the top of the hill, the top of the mountain from which you can survey the land and find, uh, the exit. If I in an escape finder, it's transcendence, what to call it, let's call it a way of getting out of that, this entanglement. Then he comes right back. He says for three beasts that we don't know what they are. They are, are they sins? Are there this positions too? Since there are animals and therefore their stand for animal projections of our desires of his desires. The she wolf, that lion and the leopard. That's all we can see about them. Then he meets a, figured that and can even know if it's a shade or a man.

Speaker 1:          00:27:27       His dramatizing what in medieval thought in medieval literature there it's called the land of disability. [inaudible] the land of unlikeness. He finds himself in a world where things are not what they seem, where there seems to be a disparity between, let's call it, let's use the literary language within signs and things, science and their meanings, things and what they stand for and part of his effort is to literally stitch this to this, this break between signs and symbols, meanings and signs. Stitch them together. First meeting then this with this figure by the name of Virgil who will become his guy. No Man, you know who he is. He's the author of the need, but look how he presents himself. I think it's crucial. You'll pay attention, but not man. Once I was man and my parents were wrong. Bart, both management by birth, I was born soup Yulia in Caesar, which is true though it late in his time and I lived in Rome.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       He gives a biography of himself, his self presentation in terms of his life, the historical circumstances, and also his works. That's what we call a miniature biography, right? The sense that I came into this world and somehow this is what it all comes down to. This is really the sense of my birth cause he speaks about his own birth, uh, our live, the Roman that the good Augustus in the time of the false or lion guard. I was a poet and single that just sound off on crisis in years. Who came from Troy after proud Elian was burned, but you, why are you returning to such misery? Why does that not climbed the delectable mountain, which is the beginning and calls or happiness, meaning the mountain of purgatory that will take him to Eden, which is really what all things according to the biblical version of a cosmology or things started and he'll say, are you thou than virgin?

Speaker 1:          00:29:31       Of that famous witch, that fountain, which pours forth to reach a stream of speech. I answered etc. Or glory in light of where poets let the study and the great love that has made me search. They volume my me that what my master and my author that he from whom I took the style whose beauty has brought me on. This is Virgil, clearly the poet and the extraordinary recommendation, which I can tell you as a teacher, every teacher really would love years after the students have been with, uh, starting the teacher is kind of greater acknowledgement. How I remember your teaching. That's what he does. And rhetorical, we'll call it, uh, uh, the, the rhetoric of capturing the benevolence of the interlocutor, but it's clear that he exchanged between them and the recognition of Virgil is as a poet. And therefore I have to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about this.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       It's because virtual, we know, uh, he's the poet of the Aeneid. Clearly the, the story of a journey of a grand epic journey by an ears. We'll talk a lot about that. The hope you believing that, that, that poem if you haven't already. Um, but that's not the way he was known. Virgil was not known this way in what we call the, um, the 12th century Europe in the cultural immediately proceeding Dante's time, uh, he virtual more than as a poet was known as a philosopher. He was a neoplatonic philosopher and your platonic philosopher, they say one who had written a poem, but the substance of that poem was not the fiction about the burning of Troy, the journey of a nes to as an exile who could go around and looking for a new land, uh, with his father on his back. And the kid, uh, the, the, the, the escape yours by his hand, it was not nothing like that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       He really had some philosophical depth. It was a way of acknowledging that poetry is capable of, of, uh, providing philosophical illumination. So what was the, the philosophical message or call it neoplatonic those, it's very much like what they thought was the, all the say. And that same, the Odyssey, the story of Odysseus or Ulysses who goes from Ithaca to Troy. And then after 10 years of the war in Troy goes back to to uh, ethical techs in 10 more years to do that. The neoplatonists, the or Lego risers were viewing that poem as the metaphor for the journey and experience of the soul. It was the story of this. All that goes from the point of origin. Once home that's home is always we call one's home. That plays at once by one soul is what one can find oneself somehow, right when, when he's familiar, comfortable, wherever.

Speaker 1:          00:32:23       So he left, he lived lives. It's like a ghost to trolley goes thrive and then he has to purify himself in order to go back as in a circle and neoplatonic circle back to the point of origin. This is the neoplatonic lived all over the, all this say they would do the same thing the 12th century. France. I could give you names if you wish. Bernard Sylvester Full Gen z use a little bit earlier. John of Salisbury, who is an English manor, the 12th century who goes, go on writing about the, are there any or there's a story of a hero who is born in Troy and then goes through the stages of life. Each book represents a stage of life, childhood, youth maturity with all the temptations of the thrush to happen with Dido. Uh, and then he goes back to two k arrives in Italy.

Speaker 1:          00:33:15       That's the book six. They will never really bother reading the other. The other book, so the engineer that was viewed as a philosophical text illustrating the, the, the pattern and the movement of life. It was really telling us, and that's really the promise of philosophical knowledge. It really PR that we all like in years our board, but with care improvements can reach the promised land, Dante changes and this interpretation. And he changes this interpretation by making and insisting that you, that Virgil is a port. He replaces the philosophical promises with the idea of poetry in the belief that poetry is better than philosophy. And that philosophy can not quite reach the depth of immense life. That makes two general promises. Toy everybody tells us that we can all be like you, like, like an ears going from Troy to Latam. And Nantais says, no, this is not really say much that say anything or talk about the reality.

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       And the individuality of my life. Poetic language is for him. The language that addresses these issues and therefore poor to here is seen as a version of history. You know, this is, you had the writer, he says to Virgil, who wrote that poem dealing with Roman history, poetry and history, the deal with the world of contingency and not the world of universal and the, and therefore potentially empty promises. So that's the, the uh, the great change, the great new interpretation that Dante's advancing about a part of virtue. And what Virgil, we'll tell him is that, uh, uh, the, uh, the go on talking about Dante, we'll call him a master and a, and author. This is a, uh, great sage and all that. And uh, and virtual says to him, this is very simple. You must take another road. You are going the wrong way.

Speaker 1:          00:35:17       This is not, that's what I call the, the idea that came to one is the rehearsal to the whole poem. It gives the story of a journey, a journey that fails, a journey that is a bolted, that's not the way you go. It's not, you know, you find yourself lost. What do you do? You try to go quickly up to the, uh, uh, to the destination. You can climb up the hill and you think you can make it. No, no, no. Uh, virtual replies that he has to go in a different way. He might reach the same point, the same destination, the world of justice, division of God, the idea of love, the good as he calls it. But he must go down that the way up is down. He has to go through the whole spiral, through the horrors and the suffering of hell then reemerged through purgatory in order to be able to reach the beatific vision.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       That's very simple. The way up is down. And this is something that, that marks the difference between philosophical presumption and the notion of a spiritual Christian humility that he has to pursue and wants to pursue. So this is, uh, uh, it, the, the, the, the conversation between them, uh, goes on with this a prophecy of the so called Hound, uh, page 27 line 100. He says, you know, the, uh, the world is in such disarray and yet 100, they're very mysterious and enigmatic prophecy that will come to when they discuss by the time we come to the end of purgatory. And so now the journey begins. Then he set out and I came on behind him. That's the end of Canto one. And we come to Canton to where now it's worth the time of the year since this is, this has to be a historical irreducible and, and, and, and, and essentially a biographical experience that has to be very careful.

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       He will give us the time, that precise time and place of his experience. Uh, we are, are the poem starts on Good Friday in the evening of Good Friday of the year 1300. These are the, so it's, it's, it's a very crystal mimetic we call it an invitation of Christ kind of experience because will emerge to the light to purgatory on Easter, Easter Sunday. But Dante says, but why should I take this journey? It's such extraordinary. You hear such a, this is the whole brand, the whole substance of cancer to ignoring. He as he says, I'm not poor. Why should I be here? Why should I go on, uh, uh, w poet? I'd be in lines 10. You got this, me consider my strength is a sufficient, you tell us if the father of silvers as he went, uh, meaning, uh, meaning of course and ears, uh, et cetera. And then you also tell us about the Paul.

Speaker 1:          00:38:17       Uh, and he concludes, but I, why should I go there? Line 32, and who, granted, I'm not in years, I'm not Paul. He's, first of all, these are the coordinates, the imaginative coordinates for his own journey. And he is the hero who brings about the foundation of, and then Paul the apostle to the gentile, the 13th apostle who really brings about who also goes to Rome, but he goes, oh, the the, the, the, the spiritual domain of the church. So these are the tool. So who is he? That's the first question he must answer. I'm not an ears, I'm not poor. The implication is who am I? This whole part of this story is to find out who he is and part of this journey is indeed to find out the part of the beginning of this journey at least, is to find out that the poem is written in order to bring some degree of redemption and clarity to the world.

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       He really believes in this in this way we call salvific role of his own, of his own voice. Not without either, not without discouragement, not without a sense of that. This may indeed be a proud, arrogant kind, sort of a posture. This whole idea about who he is is immediately countered by a reflection on his own divided we'll line and that just want to read this thematically. And there's one, one wheels where he willed and with new thoughts, changes purposes. So he withdraws from what he has begun such I became on the dock slope for by thinking of it. I brought to not the enterprise that was so hasty in its beginning. Uh, it will take me really too long to give you a sense of an appropriate gloss to this lines. The alliance about the limitations were willing be, Dante begins by claiming the importance of the will in the act of knowledge.

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       And we do see that he saw aware of it to your waist. One detail that I did not mention you, you, you, you realize how the pilgrim moves throughout, uh, in the, in Canto one. And he will move in December. We will never talk about it again. He hobbles in, uh, in, uh, uh, toward the light hits. It goes around hobbling. And that hobbling is part of his being, being wounded and having a wound that will, that he must somehow heal, so it would say, well good. Dante said, voluntary voluntourist not quite. That doesn't believe in philosophy and intellect, not quite. He believes that the two faculties of the soul, intellect and will I like the feet of one's body. They got, if you really want to walk fast at least and safely, you're going to be using both. Yeah. Use the intellect and they will buy soon as he claims the importance of the wheel, which this Socratic experience had somehow neglected.

Speaker 1:          00:41:11       He goes on reflecting about the limitations of the will and what are the limitations. One of it is we all can be divided against itself. The second one is that they will need something to regulate it because I can, I can. We'll any day I can go this and that. How do I order what I will? The third limitation of the will, and we'll talk more about the company, some of these aspects, but there's a third limitation with the will, is that I can never really go faster than my home wiggle. I'm a prisoner or if I believe that that's all I have, my where I can't go faster than it. If the will is weak and slow and divided, that's what I am. I can't, I can't go past it. So some, some of the difficulties. So he, he goes Ken to true, trying to think about I the identity and the purpose of this journey.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       Who am I? I'm not in ears. I'm not poor then who am I? That's a great question. And as soon as he does this, he, he admits he, he, he sheds light on the first internal issue that he must show. And an internal issue is the divided, divided. Well, we come to Canto three. I'm sorry. There we go a little, little fast, but that's, we are, we'll moves fast. Uh, so, you know, this is now Dante enters to the hate. The Gate of hell are the famous, uh, uh, inscription through me the way, pretty scary and that scares him. Uh, uh, uh, quite a lot. And Dante meets the first, uh, the for sinners that he meets the so called neutral angels can two, three around line student flooring. I and I, my head is circled with said, master, what is this are here and who are these people who seem so mastered by their pain?

Speaker 1:          00:43:05       And he said to me, this miserable state is borne by the wretched souls of those who live without disgrace. And without praise. They're mixed with a Katif choir of the angels who are not rebels, no faithful to God by word that my Texas for themselves, the right translation is by themselves. Because if you are for yourself, you are for someone. These are the angels called neutral, who in the great cosmic battle with which the world begins between God and, and the satanic forces just became spectators just watching. So that sensation is bear in Italian says bear Stacy, which we translate this by themselves. So taking a separation. In other words, Dante begins by dramatizing that which to him is the most serious of sense, not being disengaged, not taking sides in the belief that somehow you wait and see what the outcome is. And then you can go on taking sides.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       That's the, the, the, the start of this, uh, of this experience. And then he goes on a wire, the grievers, and he responds, they are, have no hope of death, et Cetera. Our PT and justice despise them. Let's not talk of them, but look at them and pass. There's even name them. He won't even name them because to name them will be to bring them into reality. And then we'll travel at the stands and is a sign of their way in which they, the realize the world that he use the world tool, a pure show of their own for their own spectatorship. So, uh, he, he goes on from here and, uh, and now, uh, the second action is that he, he sees Charin the famous, uh, uh, uh, uh, he goes into the ferry who will share, who will ferry the oldest souls. And, uh, uh, gives an extraordinary description of this figure, uh, and the souls who blasphemed God and the parents, the humankind.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       And then there is an extraordinary image that I want to read with you when Dante's to describe the souls and what he sees as holes that go on the boat of chairman. This is toward the end of Canto three lines. Month one, one 12, and following as in autumn, the leaves drop off one after the other. The branch is old. It spoils on the ground. So the wicked seed, um, the, we could see the Adam fling themselves from that shore one by one at the signal as a falcon. And it's recall that's the part of the dark water. And behold they've landed on the other side, a fresh cloud collect again on this, my son said, the culture's master, all those that die in the wrath of God assemble here from every land and they're eager to cross the river, et Cetera. But I really want to focus on this image of the autumn leave whereby Dante describes that dead souls as the leaves in autumn that had fallen from the tree.

Speaker 1:          00:46:31       And the conceit is that the souls are leaves and it's an image that Dante takes straight from the need of Virgil. When books six, also virtual describes the book, six of your need, uh, focuses on the descent of engineers into hades. And there he also weights and he sees the souls waiting for reincarnation. The famous theory of the met them psychosis, you may have heard this term, she doesn't mean it's a reincarnation of the soles. The souls are waiting to be reincarnated and come back in an endless cycle. And in Dante, virtual himself had taken this emerge from Houma of course, but Dante changes Virgil's the thrust of Burgess image because in Virgil it's quite accurate. He has a Pythagorean understanding of existence. They say life is a complete, a continuous circle. The we love becoming Plato's we'd of becoming time goes, goes on and on.

Speaker 1:          00:47:37       Returning on itself, we always witness the circle and cycle of the seasons and this is also what happens with human life. There's nothing really unique about us because we die and then we can wait for the reincarnation of our soul. Okay. So death in Virgil is an Ilit Jaya experience. It's never really tragic and cannot be tragic because it lacks that edge of the, the uniqueness there. Yeah. Just something particular and special has been happening to the world because I am here certainly to my world because I am here and then I made this appear. Okay. Dante changes this idea of the circularity, the [inaudible] quality of death and life that we have in virtual. Why do I call it a giant? Because you die and yet you can come back. Because we're really like leaves and justice leaves fall in the autumn. You just wait for the spring where I will not be the same leaves, but leaves very much like those that have just fallen.

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       We'll return them to look about Dante does. Dante goes on focusing on the idea of the uniqueness of every leaf as in autumn. They leaves drop off one after the other till the branch sees all the spores on the ground. So first of all, the wicked seed of Adam. So the we there is already some kind of a, some evil, uh, being acknowledged at the root of, of, of, of our own existence. The wicked seed of Adam flinging themselves from the shore, one by one at the signal Sfr corner that's recall, that's the depart of the dark water. And before they have landed on the other side of fresh crop crowd collected. And then, uh, on this. So for Dante, this image shows not that leaves our souls are like leaves, but that a leaf can be described. This is soul. Only few insist on it's own uniqueness and the fact that it will never return.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       That is one con fairly contemporary report who understood this. And I really want to quote to you a few lines. I don't know that I remember the ball. It's Gerald Manley Hopkins. Some of you who have read, who read English literature. Remember this, you may remember this. He writes his famous poem called Golden Grove Margaret Golden Rule. You know the poem, you know what I'm talking about, Margaret, are you grieving over Golden Grove and leaving leaves like the things of man you care for? Can you are as the heart grows old or come to such sites called et cetera continues. What is Hopkins? Who really is reading this image? What is he really saying? He Sang, he understands. It leaves like the things of men. You care for Kenya, what comes back. It's not the life of human beings. What comes back at the things that human beings may use and waste those things so that the right analogy for Gerald, Gerald Manley Hopkins in a sense really in the wake of Dante is between the things of man, the things that we have that the things that we can produce and leaves not souls.

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       In formal terms. This really means that Dante is replacing the notion of epic circularity that you find in the classics, the classics of Homer, the clocks, classics. How such as the Aeneid with an idea of linear, novel, the life of human beings is best described the formerly by a novel in the sense that we are caught in a journey that goes on. It's unique and will reach its destination, whatever it will be. We don't know yet at this point of the poem. And now Dante enters into the circle, into the, the garden, the first experience in book and Canto for, uh, I will, uh, I want to give you some time to, uh, but I will have to deal with Canto fall and then I will stop after to come straight to the point about Canto for, uh, Dante comes to what is called limbo are the, a word that comes from Latin in Latin.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       That's what the limbo is. This is, uh, uh, the edge. That's what it means. Lambros you're usually in Italian, you speak of the lay of the lenders of the air, the edge of, of a, or a dress or my jacket and so on. Uh, uh, comes to the area of health, which really is outside of her. In fact, it's a, it's, it's, it's a, it's, it's very much like, uh, the Virgilian, uh, afterlife of the virtuous and here he meets a lot of which it's described as a garden, one of the gardens, one of the three, four gardens. You find sort of pre figuration of the, in many ways of the earthly paradise and Gardens in, in purgatory, but it's also prefigure aeration of the world, of, uh, of paradise, where, where the city Jerusalem is described as a garden. Uh, so the first thing about this, uh, uh, it's called, uh, the, uh, it's called the locals are Mainers, uh, in case you want to know what the technical serve, uh, low who's Aminos, uh, the kind of idyllic place.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       Uh, and at that, this is a term of first theology that belongs to my very much the epic world. And in the epic world of reasons later in the renaissance, uh, whether it's going to be spent her or, or even Dasso or Milton, there's always the story of the hero who reaches this idyllic bucolic place and relax. So it's really appraised of the breakdown of the, the, the, ah, Everence hailed as the hero of the, the adventurous spirit and all his shows. So this is the irony in Luther restructures that whenever heroes seem to look for a pause to the quest by reaching the garden and relaxing, that's where they find out they are in the most dangerous situation. That whenever you think that you are safe and you can disarm and there's, you know, there is uh, uh, the running cool water of the river that is the shade that is the fragrance of the landscape.

Speaker 1:          00:53:59       This is the way that, where the w the, the, the where with all the, the, the, the, the, the, the description of this bucolic gardens. That's exactly when the snake will appear. That's exactly when the enemy will be capable of reaching you and overwhelm you. And this is also, in other words, there are all his places of temptation. And that's what happens here. Dante here, uh, uh, arrives and he sees the poets cantal for, it's an extraordinary, they're all virtuals Hayden's, he sees the poets and the breakpoints poets that, uh, uh, uh, he will see the first post that he'll see are, first of all, he is all the, the, the, the figures from mark. He will enumerate the characters, scientists, philosophers from the Greek and Roman world, but put a little bit at the edge. You know, the, the real don't seem to have much impact on the situation here.

Speaker 1:          00:54:54       But then, uh, the dramatic situation is when he, uh, uh, uh, lines 80 and following, uh, or you, uh, he sees the poets, the classical poets from homer to Horace and Ovid, or you who Horner owners, both science and art, who are these two have such honor that it sets them apart from the condition of the rest. And he said to me, the virtual speaking, the honorable fame, which resounds in their life are both case against favor in heaven, uh, et Cetera. Honor the loft deport. He has his shade returns that left us with the voice had paused and there was silence as a footbridge shades coming to us. The looks were another sad, no joyful. It's be fit. Limbo. This is really like life here. Uh, that's what the afterlife is in Dante's conception. It's only an extension or we choose to do on this earth.

Speaker 1:          00:55:53       If you really think that what life, the beauty of life, which is not a bad idea, is talking about having endless seminars of aesthetics, a poetry. It's this poet's too. That's what your afterlife is. You sit down on the sit on the grass and you go on talking about beautiful things. He says, he says the good master, begin mark him that with their with sold in hand who comes before the three is there lord, he is homer. Um, the sovereign port, he that comes next is Horace, the moralist, all of it is the third and the last looking, uh, famous, uh, epic poet, Dante will again celebrate in purgatory. Since each shares with me in the name that one voice uttered, they give me honorable welcome and in this Duwell, thus I saw assemble the noble school school in Greek means, uh, it's also leisure illusionary life scholar, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       This, the, the, the, the, the world of play and the [inaudible] load of lofty song who flies like an eagle homer above the rest. And the irony of course is, is it blind and the Eagle or to have the sharp, the sharp view, the sharp vision that they, Homer's visionaries and then the vision, right. He looks he's blind because he's looking inward in order to know what the psalm he has to say or be about after the head talked together for a time, they turned to me with a sign of greeting and my master's smiled at this and then they showed Mr greater honor for, they made me one of their number so that I was the sixth among those higher intelligences. Thus we went home as far as the light talking of things, which were fitting for that place in a widget as well. Now to be silent.

Speaker 1:          00:57:45       So he is Dante, uh, inscribes himself in the history of western poetry from homer to dance. He counts himself as sixth. Among them is Virgil is Luca is all of it has Horace and of course the master of them all. Oh, mom. Okay. So we go from homer to Dante. It's a little history if you wish of western Western poetry and Dante things that he belongs to it. We could say a number of things about what they are talking about. He says, it doesn't say, uh, we talk about beautiful things which we infer. We can easily infer. They talk about poetry, they talk about their craft, right? They may be a little link that I would like you to reflect on, on your own between the garden and the kind of poetry, the kind of beauty that they are really talking about. This is the way Dante's imagination works.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       You have to pull together things that don't seem to be described. So this is the garden. There's some kind of self absorption about this. It seems to be a kind of self enclosure. Part is kind of poetry. It's a, it's a little scene that reflects on what their spiritual condition may have been like. But what is the most surprising and what constitutes the temptation of this camp? The temptation of the scene for the pilgrims on spiritual pilgrimage is involved in a spiritual descent, which turns out to be a sense. He says at one point I was sixth among such genius to see, do you see the discrepancy? Did you see how this is jarring? Can you hear it? He's going down for redemption, his descending and humility, and yet now he talks as a poet, his poetic voices, one that elevates itself. There seems to be a kind of discrepancy between the two.

Speaker 1:          00:59:33       That's the great temptation of [inaudible] to believe that is a poet. He has been claiming that poetry is better than philosophy. That porch is like history and the first concern now he has is to reflect on the hollowness of this claim. How this kind of claim about the importance of poetry can turn out to be a temptation for him. It's a Hubris and I, I, I focus on it as I have focused on it because in effect, but we're going to discuss next time canto five is an extended reflection at way for Dante to reflect on this claim and extended reflection on the dangers of such a claim and the responsibility of writing poetry. Dante, we'll meet the great heroine of all love stories. Francesca, everybody knows about this. Fantastic figure, a lovely figure. Francesca who dies for love, but Dante's actually encountering a reader of his own poetry and he witnesses the kind of traps and, and, and risk that reading in price.

Speaker 1:          01:00:47       We are going to go on next time thinking about this whole question of, of reading a responsibilities of writing the can't afford, but I can not live without saying something about the epic quality. But I've been just talking about, uh, I've been defining the poem really is and novelistic visa vi the circular structure of uh, uh, uh, Virgil's understanding of, uh, the reincarnation and therefore the great notion of why or what an epic is. And now I will say, actually Dante goes on mixing these John, as soon as you formulate something, Dante has a way of undercutting that formulation. Can't afford ends with a miniature representation of the epic quality of this text that goes on enumerating all the souls that are, he can see, which is really, as you know, if you remember from urine, uh, your ilium on the gates who really are my one point, Helen will go on a numbering.

Speaker 1:          01:01:47       All the ships of the Greeks to old prior. Remember that scene? Some of you may remember that, and this is the weekend or four ends with lines. Uh, one 2014 in there before me on the animal green were shown to me the great spirits by the sight of whom I'm uplifted in myself. I saw electra with men in her company and you Hector in the knee is and sees us. So Camilla fantasy layer. So legislation, King Levenia, I saw Brutus who drove out Tarquin Lucrece, Julia, Marsha, Cornelia. And by himself I saw Saladin sign of honor, the salary and who sits by himself. I said kind of lofty state. And when I raised my eyes a little higher, I saw the master of them, not the now sitting a minute. Philosophic family, Socrates, Plato, uh, the other one was always thoughtful. Democritus they origin is all the Greek philosophers.

Speaker 1:          01:02:39       And then Orpheus, Cicero, lean was Seneca, Euclid Ptolemy. Um, yeah, it version of classical and cycled PTO. All of the knowledge is gathered here and yet to has a website, keep it in the, the traditional of encyclopedias. This formal structures as he want to organize the world of knowledge. That is something, one thing about them. Why, what's one thing they never tell you? How you can really educate yourself. Then never described the process of education to know that to describe the process of education, you got to have an encyclopedic poem where you are showing the phases and the stages of learning as the pilgrim. We'll show, we'll show it twice. The second thing that I have to say is that in any enumeration cause you have here an epic can hemorrhage and that will close by the marks for the day and you buy Asians always imply the wish of a narrative such as an encyclopedia cause it's a little bit of an encyclopedic form I say

Speaker 1:          01:03:47       to encompass the whole of reality. That's what encyclopedia as one to do have reality of it intellectual reality and yet enumerations by the very virtue of being a numeration. So we'll tell you that no total ideation is possible. That is something that always escaped the, the, the four more ordering that, the encyclopedias one to reach. And for now, I stopped with my remarks and we have a few minutes, uh, in case there are questions as I hope that, uh, I, um, welcome questions. So I will repeat your questions by the way, for the benefit of the videotape, Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       Please talks about the first group centers who were for themselves. It didn't take a side. Do you think that was also a political commentary?

Speaker 1:          01:04:47       Yes. The question is, uh, Dante talks about the neutral angels are, uh, he calls him for themselves. So we say it's by themselves. Uh, and the, and the question then really is, is that also a political commentary? And, and before I could rephrase a, I could repeat this, the question I said yes, absolutely. Down to we'll use the very same experience for himself later in paradise where he will say that in many ways being by one by oneself, there are times when that can become inactive virtual. What are the notion of neutrality is going to be redefined? Nancy doesn't like clearly neutrality, right? Uh, why, why is he, does he find neutrality? Uh, because it's the language or provation for him. It's really a way of, uh, um, you know, it's, it's, it's, uh, uh, it's in the, the, the decision or to take decisions because we are always making a decision even when we think of, we are not making good decisions.

Speaker 1:          01:05:46       You really are. But to him, that is the sign of a great cover dish. He explains that in cosmic terms, this is the metaphysics of the, the, the Great War in heaven, which by the way enables me not to say that it gives the whole of hell a kind of symmetrical structure because it clearly begins with the neutral angels and ends with the encounter with Lucifer at the end. So you see that this is really the kind of what frames, uh, the narrative of hell. But to go back to your question, when Dante is going to talk about politics, he also believed for a while that he had to take sides. He did. And he did are going back now to the few remarks I made about his language, his political involvement. Uh, on the first, the first class for seminar, he was banned. He was sent into exile and then he removed himself from more partisan politics.

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       And how did he do this and what did he do this for? A while, he was a wealth being thrown out of Florence with many others. Um, uh, also as an actor of a punishment for a decision he had made to throw out the gibber leans among whom his own best friend with Okawville Kantor who died in exile. So he's thrown out and we do know this historical happenings. They spend the first few years of their exile parting and making and going on through machinations as to how to get back to Florence and dammit, really make them pay here, realizes very quickly the wickedness of this plan. He realizes that his own party is no better than that of the Gibbons. And so he removes himself from them that act to removal from the, the, the criminal violence that he and his other, uh, accomplices were for a while thinking about turns out to have been madness. And so he decides in this act of virtual, uh, absolute solitude and that is by himself. So there is a kind of judgment but very refined and how can you go and really describing that the s the act of neutrality is bad. And yet there is a way in which there are times where neutrality can become nothing less than virtuous decision is. He will make no other questions please.

Speaker 3:          01:08:22       I have a question.

Speaker 1:          01:08:26       Last. Yes please.

Speaker 3:          01:08:28       Hello. Uh, friendship and love it. There was no conversation about loss and we know from his history they're both, uh, both of them were married, he had children. And I am, I'm wondering if the physical aspect of love is irrelevant or the public,

Speaker 1:          01:08:54       the question refers to the remark, a remark I made back then was picked up by a student are also another students. The remark about love and friendship as the two are dramatized in a, in the Vita Nuova and a, it refers to a wants to know, actually wants me to explore more the role of lost since we know that Dante was married and, and, and a, ah Ha. What does last have to do with love? I take, that's really the, uh, the question. Uh, and now let me just say that it's a very complicated question and I will talk about this next time when we deal with Francesca who is of course the heroine of lust, if there's ever one. Uh, and then we'll see what Dante means. By that I mean the, it clearly is an issue related to love, fundamentally related to love, but to believe in.

Speaker 1:          01:09:50       I'm really from Froebel would confuse some of you here, but don't, don't be confused to believe that Dantas judgment of Francesca is limited to the representation of Canto five where he describes the relationship between the and love less than love, uh, would be a grand mistake. Dante understands, understands that without physicality there can be no love, uh, that there is no soul which is not connected to a body. In fact, some of the remarks that I made today are really about, can be construed. I did not make the point, but can be construed as his sense of the inevitability of the body. That the intellect in and of by itself, this whole inner itself without materiality, without some degree of being wedded to the body is really not a part of the human experience. So this is what I was saying to them about the fact that the journey is not just an intellectual journey, has to be done in the body, is part of his sense of uh, the, the inevitability of the body.

Speaker 1:          01:10:58       And after all, this is really what his Christianity is about. Uh, it's about the incarnation is about the being embodied, about, about the divinity being embodied and therefore entering our human human condition. Let me also say that Dante goes on thinking about Francesca. He condemns her and Francesca is always circling around in the state of permanent desire with bowel over those, by moving around. Yeah, they really describe me, the unquiet hearts. If you are, when you are at peace, you just stop and sit. She just goes on moving around and the round, that's their punishment. And yet he remembers her when Dante reaches the habit of metaphysics in paradise and his to talk about the kiss of creation, how creation God creates the world by imprinting a kiss on the material that he had at his disposal. And the language that he will use is going to be the language of Francesca.

Speaker 1:          01:12:01       And that to me means that the case of Francesca can also be construed as the existential, um, our counter to gods, the gods kiss on creation and say, wait, I don't think that he's redeeming her there. There's no such a thing as the redemption for the infernal souls. And yet there is an idea that is something that may have gone wrong and we have to see what it is. And it's not the last we have to see what the situation is. It's not the last, uh, I don't think it's homely lost. Uh, and that is part of, or there's something even larger at bought her. What the mistake that she seems to be making is of a different, so the, I keep you hanging until next time, so that, uh, otherwise, what's the point? It will will, uh, uh, we have total to Luca Canto five. Let's read Canto five for next Tuesday, but before you go, uh, there's, there's some time, some case they are, they have a couple of minutes. Other questions

Speaker 2:          01:13:01       please is talking to Virgil. He says you're the only one in my writing through the normal stuff, which I had been,

Speaker 1:          01:13:13       uh, it's how he says, oh,

Speaker 2:          01:13:15       so he's saying that he's, that he's taken his style from him and that stop or what she's been with for which he's gained honor. He's not honored as an epic poet. He's not, that's not what are the implications of what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          01:13:28       Okay. The, the, the question is referenced in the encounter between the pilgrim and, uh, the pilgrim and virtual in candle one over, uh, over in federal way. Dante, in what I call the Cup Tatsuo Benevolence. We, we're capturing the benevolence of virtual, the only living, he doesn't even know if it's a shade or, or a human being. It turns out that he's a human being. He says, well, you are the poet from whom I took car. The style that has honored that has made me on her. And the, the, the salt of the, the real question is, this is a little bit of a lie, isn't it? Because Dante, but this time is not really known as an epic poet. Uh, I would really say [inaudible] I say it's part of the simulation rhetorical simulation of a, of, uh, capturing the benevolence of the listener. At the same time.

Speaker 1:          01:14:20       It's really an acknowledgement, uh, of, uh, Virgil's mastery and what is virtuous mastery. Um, you know, Dante really thought that his own poetry is that Latin is not a dead language, that the vernacular is really the way Latin has become in time. So they continue with the, between Virgil and him. It's real, it's real. So there's a kind of continuity of poetic continue with it. Uh, but you're quite right that it's literally, it's not true at that point. Dante's more of a province, our port or the portal follows the still novice to the poets of the sweet new style from Bologna and Florence. Then, uh, then Virgil. Yeah. But thank you so much. We'll see you next time.
