Speaker 1:          00:00:01       We talked the last time I talked to it a little bit about, um, this, this whole issue of the imagination that Dante places, uh, along with it and definition of love and the love is the, the, the power that governs, that shapes the moral world of purgatory. Um, last time we talked about this tool for psi of canto 17 to four side of this center really makes, makes a center kind of ellipses as it were, right between imagination and love. Uh, love is attached to the, it's, it's joined to a theory of free will because it's by choice, uh, because of our choices that we can be held accountable for. Uh, the actions that we engage in loving wrong objects, loving too much or loving too little. The, the, some of the problems I think, uh, stemming from a certain misunderstanding about the imagination that Dante should place the imagination of the center of the poem should really not surprise you.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       He's a poet and he thinks that imagination is indeed the path that he has to take in order to come to any, uh, any, any form of knowledge. It's only through the imagination. It's not, that does not exclude rationality, but that's the discourse of philosophers, that discourse of theologians if you wish. And he places the imagination as his way. Uh, and then from that point of view, who can even challenge some ideas of, uh, uh, the superiority, let's say, of a, of a rational argument over the imagination. Imagination is the weapon of the port. How, with what kind of attributes does he invest? The margination it's tied to memory. The port, the canto 17 begins with an apostrophe to the readers memory. Uh, it's, it appears as in the feminine imaginative, uh, the, the, in, uh, in, uh, uh, the, the Dante silencing the term vis a vis the, it has a sort of force imagination.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       It's moved by something else. Dante does not decide whether it's the having of the stars or comes from inside us. Uh, but he has a particular power is strange power. It comes like a thief in the night. It robs us of, uh, uh, the, the any degree of, uh, of, uh, uh, consciousness about the world outside of us. Uh, uh, and, and just justice, memory, uh, this lodges, uh, you know, the, the, the, the description of memory at the beginning of canto 17, it's her mammary that it has an incredible memory as a form of the imagination. As you know, uh, memory and imagination are connected. The, the, it's a form of the imagination, but it's a memory that has the power to move up and down. The text evokes the Alpine heights and the depth of the mall, the mall. It talks about a form of blindness.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       And yet it creates vision, uh, uh, memories, a figure of time. And then the, the whole passage is described in terms of space as if it imagination had the power to dislocate us from where we think that we are. This is the point, and it's not an unusual polling for Dante to make sensitivity is this is the poetry of exile. The poetry of a man who thinks that he's a stranger. Well, living on earth, a man without a clear sense of where he's home, maybe, uh, he is, this is the poetry rooted in the consciousness of homelessness. So imagination is an extension. And internalized, internalized version of this sense of homelessness, but it has a power and that power that doesn't seem to be able to be that a power that can cannot quite big campaigns or coerced within definite, uh, parameters of a conduct.

Speaker 1:          00:04:23       In fact, this insistence on the imagination, I'm going to be recapitulating the things that maybe I thought I said the probably I didn't say last time between on the one hand, the scene of wrath, which is a form of madness. This will say, uh, he's seen that eclipses the powers of reason. That's anger. Uh, and on the other hand, uh, at this discourse on love, okay, so this is really what I was saying, Dante and the stands. And there is an imagination which cannot quite be held in check. And yet the whole point of the poem I'm talking whenever I'm talking about that poem I, I point out some seemingly insignificant details like, Oh look, this is a symmetry here between Canto six of him, fair, no canter's each of of, of purgatory or whatever. Uh, to indicate that it is a poem built with a precise principle of all the in mind.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       Not only it has all the in its, in its technical execution, it has all the also as a moral problem, it's all about ordering the appetites or during the will, but at the same time alongside with it, and this is the complexity and the beauty of dentists texts. There's another argument that almost questions makes us to, makes us, forces us into thinking that there are some, some elements that seem to be left out of this fabric of order that Dante has woven or if you like the metaphor has built the architecture that he has built. Let's see how this arguments really containers that that's the end of the, of the story. This is just a stage in his saw movement of soft knowledge and knowledge of the world. In fact, Ken to 18, we are now moving into a different, different moral realm. Uh, it's a moral wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:06:13       Actually now we are moving toward this hill called Ah, what Dante and medieval theorists of vices core Acadia. Uh, a kid is a Latin term, which in English we can describe it would describe as a soldier of despondency as they sold to in decisiveness, sluggishness, Straw. Sloth. That's it. That's this. The, the uh, uh, and they thought if you are interested in knowing more about what the Middle Ages thought about this, this, uh, scholar when's up wrote a book called Arcadia, exactly what they both in English, medieval literature, Dante, et Cetera. Another are their issues. What most precise and how can we go on understanding this question of Acadia? It's in a sense the pattern or the inversion of contemplation. It's really tied to a sense of loss of the outside world. Cadia describes the condition of the mind that has found itself indifference to the objects of desire.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       It really is a crisis of desire. One finds the objects. That's the, this laws to sluggishness. The decisiveness of the mind. It is. If the objects of desire were, um, had lost their consistency, their attractiveness, their luster, you know, you, you just don't care. It's the problem. Then the, the, the so called noon day a devil, the temptation, the temptation of the Hmong, that's why I call it her paralegal contemplation. It's the temptation of that the monks experience in their clusters when they saw to find that the whole idea of turning their minds to the divine is, is no longer or provisional reprep perhaps is not, uh, uh, appealing. It's, it's the, uh, the loss of appeal of anything outside of oneself and indicates a kind of, uh, of, of both intellectual and dreamy sort of condition. And that's really what I want to talk about now.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       10 to 18 is the most intellectual of cantors in, in, in, in, in purgatory. Dante phases, a theoretical issue. He's talking to Virgil and this theoretical reissues of Kantar 18, uh, flow out of the problems that we have had in discussing canto 17. As you know, the, we're talking about imagination and love it. There is an imagination that somehow is vagabond. It's a thief, breaks out of any particular confines in this lodges us, it picks the ground out of our own own certainties about the, the, the way we see the world. Remember that the image that would with which can two 17 starts we done to places as in a world which you said at the twilight there's no real light. It's all foggy. And then all of us haven't, we do see something and it's unclear whether we see something and because of their lights that comes from within us memories for instance, that's highlight we carry within us confused as they may be or some other kinds of consciousness or intuition.

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       So that's really that the discourse of the imagination and that this large, some of us here that made it a little difficult to, to uh, try to get hold of grasp. It can't, it has the same problem in Canto 18. Can't wait til begins with a question that he asks of Virgin. You are talking about love. We are talking about this inclination cans, the whole theory of love in canto 17. Uh, he says, master my site. This is can't wait. In the very beginning he saw quicken in thy light that has a certain clearly all that they word set forth and explain and explain. I pray therefore dear a gentle father that doubts expound love to be two which you reduce every good action and its opposite wherever you have told me in canto 17 really stone enough and that virtual goes on explaining, uh, the theory that is very philosophical theory that we have perceptions.

Speaker 1:          00:10:37       Your perception takes from our world reality and impression and unfolded within you. So it makes their mind turn to it and whatever the, the, the will is bound. That's really what we call pleasure. I'm paraphrasing. Poorly are thy words and my following, and excuse me, let me just mention another little passage now may be playing, I get landline 35 now maybe playing to the how hidden is the truth for those who maintain that every love is in itself, Praiseworthy. He's attacking. This is the view of the PQ realtors who believe that every pleasure without any particular judgment attached to the object of pleasure is praiseworthy. Dante says, no, we have to exercise some moral, uh, judgements. We have to this day. We have to create distinctions. We have to discriminate between the good and the bad love. Perhaps built it's matter always seems good, but not every stamp is good.

Speaker 1:          00:11:36       Even if it be good wax. I would even go so far as to say that he's really thinking now of his friend Kevin Cantonese Weedo epicurean. Now you, you saw, he mentioned in Canada 12 by name epicurean leanings. The idea that that's the piggery and ethics that is pleasure is really the, the, the all new object worthy of any pursuit. And uh, that's really what we are doing whenever we were in pursuit of knowledge or real experiences, then they claimed that all of our pleasure is, is, is good. Uh, that's the Hellenistic ethics that Dante really renounces or debates. And then fact Virgil goes on saying they words and my fallen with this is Dante talking answered, have revealed the nature of love to me, but are his, made me more full of perplexity for a flom is offered to us from without. And if there's whole moves with no other feet, it has no merit.

Speaker 1:          00:12:37       What it goes straight or crooked. Now you say that everything is love and the love that I have, it depends on the experience of images. I then what in what way? How am I going to deserve for choosing well or not choosing well since at that at the basis of the imagination we have perceptions and what I perceived maybe looking good to me and does not look good to you. So the issue is displaced from the point of the world of the imagination to the world of perception and a virtual Gordon explaining a scholastic theory to the point that uh, indeed, uh, we, we, we, uh, we incline to uh, to the good but then actually we have within us, uh, the Faculty of choice. He says, ah, in order this will ever, they may be conformed. There is innate in you, the faculty, which councils and which ought to hold fifth threshold of a scientist talking about once again our freewill and he will add, this is what I, this is online 60 and following a, and he led, this is all I can tell you from a philosophical point of view.

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       Uh, other issues about the freewill, uh, will be explained to you by Beatrice when she first comes to you. And so it would seem to make a distinction between the knowledge they have virtual and the knowledge of a Beatrice. And he said, uh, as far as reasons he's here can tell the beyond that wait only for Beatrice for it is a matter of faith and so on. So there seems to be two ways of understanding this issue. In fact, this, the Beatrice will never discuss this problem. But in a sense Beatrice represents the, the explanation explanation that Dante's looking for because Beatrice is that kind of love that for Dante that stands for a visionary form of now of, of love and not just a love that can be reduced to a question of mechanics of physics, of perception. Um, so, uh, uh, that's the word can't wait.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       Team seems to be doing then responds and lodges and at the same time brings us back into the very predicament that cantos of 17 had a post for us. Okay. So seems that Dante's moving and at the same time an impasse and other impasse has been reached. And now with this in mind, we turn to what he unavoidably has to do a chat to translate all of these issues of love, imagination, um, uh, choice from the theoretical into the autobiographical or existential dimension. This is done in the dream and erotic dream that Dante relates at the beginning of Canto 19. Before it turns out that cancer, I just want to tell you a but how Dante understands this. He has one line at the very end of Kantar team that I would, uh, the last line of country think that I really want to, uh, uh, underlying for you or the whole paragraph reads.

Speaker 1:          00:15:59       Then when the shades were so far apart from us that they could no longer be seen, a new thought arose within me from which others, many and diverse were born. And I rambled. So from one to the other that in my wondering, my eyes closed and I changed my music into dream and that empathy and that introduces the dream of Canton, I think. But the line in Italian is really very interesting because it presents the connection between thinking and dreaming. He says, in fact, it's installation. My music, it's correct, but it's really good to have said to make it very clear. My thought, uh, Dante says one, one line one 45, Could York, he forgets a Rico Pairs El Pensamiento in Sonia Trask Maathai. So there's a kind of link I sort of sense of the connection between thinking and dreaming it. Dante fevers dreaming at this point over thinking you shouldn't be surprised that dentists do invest the romance of the rose at grant.

Speaker 1:          00:17:10       Maybe we'll epic. He said Dream and tells the story of a dream. The book of the Dutcher's chicks of the chosen booker. The Dutcher's is the story of a dream. The Vita Nuova is full of dreams. You know, even for those who are interested in contemporary literature, fairly contemporary, uh, I'm thinking of kids, great poem, sleep in poetry. I don't know how many of you have a chance to read that poet love sleeping because sleep introduces the idea of the dream and the possibility of a dream, the possibility of a knowledge which is not weld. I finally have some revelations within me, which is not what I would normally have if I went away. Uh, so this is the, the great privilege that they give to dreams is the middle ages or the Middle Ages really conscious of this dimension. Yes, that is a text by an author called macro views. And if you want to know more, I really, which is, uh, uh, macro views who writes on the dream of Skipio Cicero's figure, uh, in the republic, uh, it's all about, it's an encyclopedia of dreams and the based on our terminal, Doris, but it's, it's, it's, uh, distinctions between Oracle's fantasies, um, insomnia, uh, uh, deliriums, uh, dreams and so on.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       So they are very conscious of the salt of, of, of power and, uh, revelations that can come through dreams. What is this dream about? It's now definitely in the world of Acadia. Ah, it's a dream. Let me just read this, uh, initial, uh, the beginning of Canto 19. Uh, I emphasize that this is now in auto biographical or the highlighting of the autobiographical dimension of all the problems we have been discussing from 17 a above all 16, 17 and 18. Dante is to translate the theories into a personal, giving them a personal shape and the, to, to investigate that kind of importance that they may have, uh, for him. Uh, the, the, uh, it starts then within the hour when the day's heat over the earth and sometimes by Saturn can no longer temper the cold of the moon. When the GM answers see the for two Nemiah rise in the east before dawn by a path which does not belong, stay dark for it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:48       There came to me in dream a woman stammering cross-eyed and crooked on her feet with maintenance and of sallow. Whew. I gazed at her and as the sand revives called limbs be numbed by the night. So my look gave her a ready tongue and then in a little time made her quite erect and Carlotta one features as love desires. When she hit her speech, the set free, she began to sing so that it would have been hard for me to turn my mind from. Ha I am she saying I am the sweet siren. Who by beguile the sailors in mid sea, so great delight it is to hear me. I turned Ulysses eager on his way to my song and he who dwells with me readily departs so holy. I contend him.

Speaker 1:          00:20:52       Her lips were not yet closed again. When a lady holy and alert appeared beside me to put her to confusion. Oh, Virgil, Virgil, who is this? She said with anger. And He came with his eyes fixed on their own rubber. One. He sees the other and let her bear in front tearing her clothes and showed me her belly. They are woke me that are woke me with a stench. The stench that came from her. I turned my eyes to the good master three times. At least I have called [inaudible]. He said, rise and calm. Let us find the opening, but which that enters. So that's the, the end of the dream. The account of the dream. And this is also the, uh, uh, the Germany, uh, will, uh, the journey will continue. That seemed to have come to a halt or here at night. Uh, as you recall, um, just to give you a sense of Dante's ordered poetic mind, this is the second of three dreams. Uh, you didn't, we didn't really read the first one about encanto canto nine.

Speaker 2:          00:22:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       It was the dream of Ganymede. The Dante's moving from the anti purgatory, purgatory proper. And then he said the third one will appear in Canto 27. So that really Dante is scanning these three dreams with also sense of numerical symbolic numerical position, nine 18 retold in, uh, in, in 19. But, uh, it takes place during the night then and uh, and, and uh, uh, 27. So this is the, it's a dream. It's a dream that I happens at dawn of just some details. And the dream at dawn has always the value they believe that being a kind of prophetic dream. I said, I said, it's a dream that, uh, really has assault of Hue, color of the truth. He says something about, so if, if you understand the dream as an allegory for say, uh, because it's, it's with about veil, it's about tearing clothes.

Speaker 1:          00:23:05       There is something hidden underneath it all. Uh, then it may he be our, this allegory has a truth value. It has, it's not some kind of a mere fable. Our aura that's, um, Dante starts evoking the planet Saturn, uh, which is, uh, we shall see that in a, you know, the Dante mentioned planets and joins them to the various liberal arts, and probably have mentioned this before. So when, when we'll be talking about, say the moon, as anthis going to discuss grammar, uh, he'll talk about Mars, the planet war, and that he'll talk about music. Jupiter injustice, Saturn is astronomy. Uh, also the, the, the planet of contemplation in the sense I think that he's hinting that Slav is, is, uh, the averse side, the paddle day of, of contemplation at different type of self absorbed from nonetheless, no, not that we've breaking out to contemplation means breaking out of oneself and, and, and reach some kind of the gates outside of time.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       Uh, here, it's a dream that seems to be a movement and an inward movement. Um, so it Saturn and then he continues with this language of astronomy and divination are no longer temporary, called to the moon. When the Geo Mansour's, uh, see the for to pneumonia. This is our processes of knowledges. Divination. That's a different type of rational knowledge dividing signs. So this is the context in which the, the, the dream is set rises in the east before dawn by path, which has not long say dark for it. There came to me in a dream, not the dream starts. And the first thing that I have to point out to you is that in this, uh, uh, in the dream, the dreamer is an object. The dream comes to him. Clearly it is not real. It's not something that he decides he wants. One is the object of some, some, uh, uh, that's exactly the dreams or a so science hemorrhages that descend into oneself without one's own self control or a dominion over them. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       seems to place himself in a condition of passivity, which is the passivity of sloth. Okay? So the idea that I am awake and therefore vigilant and therefore capable of making judgments about what's happening to me is here now for the time being bracketed. Um, what is this dream about? Oh, um, what is a dream of a woman? And, and, and the Italian text place, since this is a dream of a two women, two modes of being two choices, it's almost as if he were, he isn't, but you know, this is the [inaudible] of Hercules at the side. Vega is, they call him at the, at the, at the, at the crossing, the crossing road had to choose between vice and virtue. But Hercules is an easy time because he's always going to the right as thinking that in, in rethought graphy if you go to the right, then you really have, are going toward virtual, you know, left and right.

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       Vr, dextrous and then sinister. You know, the idea that left being a being bad, the, but here we don't have, that is two women. But the language of the poem distinguishes very carefully between them. One is a family dinner. There is in the materiality and living in a kind of animals sense of the word. And when the other woman appears, she's called a [inaudible]. Ah, the donor is the Italian word from Domina. Uh, the lady, uh, cold here, it's cold, Eh, Eh, a holy, a holy holy lady. I guess I laid the holy and the alert, et cetera. Uh, and, and she is, uh, this is this woman. Uh, she, uh, crystallizes what we could call the aesthetics of the ugly. We always talking about the beauty and the idea that beauty brings about a kind of, um, revelation of love and the pleasure that goes with beauty.

Speaker 1:          00:27:24       And in fact, uh, we can say that love, no, this is the platonic way of understanding. Love is always a hunger for beauty. Uh, so we, the conventional way of thinking about aesthetics is to imagine beautiful proportionate forms he had. Dante is giving exactly the opposite and aesthetic of the ugly, but I, Natalie, which is not static and somehow he's, uh, experiences metamorphoses. In fact, look what happens. She is stammering, cross-eyed, crooked on her feet. She's the Anti Beatrice by obviously, uh, with main hands and sallow hue. And now it changes from the dreamer is an object. The dreamer becomes a subject. I mean, you see that from came to me. And then I gazed at her and as the survivors, cold limbs Bynum by the night. So my look, my his desires transform this image and from the ugly image that it was, it becomes now instead invested with attributes of attractiveness and caught her when features as love desires as love, a prompt.

Speaker 1:          00:28:41       And then this is what we still don't understand who she is. When she had the speech, the set free, she began to sing so that it would have been hard for me to turn my mind from. So the first thing the patient or we know that they and, and the vehicle, the temptation is the song. This is also in primarily a poetic temptation, a certain way of understanding poetry. It kind of even meretricious form of poetry. And what does she say she brings her? She brings to center stage the myth of Ulysses, which has by now you always, you know, uh, is the, this steady temptation for Dante is the point of reference. To what extent is, is on my own journey that I believe is taking place under the aegis of divine providence. To what extent is it a form of transgression and way of going beyond boundaries of breaking down or limits.

Speaker 1:          00:29:39       Because after all, that's what you resisted in Canto 26 and he knows what he has placed him but he cannot get him out of his mind because you listen stands or something powerful. And what he stands for is the idea that there is no knowledge worth heaven, which is not connected with transgressions, which is not connected with, with breaking down or barriers and limitations in a way because Dante is doesn't do this thing. So, um, accidentally when it comes to Canto 26 or paradise, he will see Adam and there is another who is for him without a doubt, a poet because it's the name giver is the name, give her of the world. He is the one who brings the world into being through language. And when Dante meets Adam, there'll be some interesting details that we can talk about there, but I can anticipate this for you.

Speaker 1:          00:30:33       Adam is the one who has understood transgression are and that transcription or for Adam appears as a source of growth. It's not a fall for Dante said growth said growth and understanding other types of limitations because we cannot just say that we, we, we care down all limits. We tear down some limits in our experience. Adam test down and the, the, uh, eats of the, the, the, the fruit of the tree that had been forbidden for him. Like a good son. The father says, don't eat it, and he goes and eats it and then he eats it. He grows into a human being. He discovers that the world is not for him to be as a child, then he has to have other experiences of death, of maturity, of work, et Cetera. So there are ways in which we have to understand this idea of breaking limits in a different way from maybe the way I may have conveyed it to you is none to here is thinking of Ulysses and anticipates the story of Adam.

Speaker 1:          00:31:33       Uh, there's a great temptation for Dante is to believe that he to his journey is a journey that enact Julissa's journey. They Siren. That's when she's telling him what she, she's telling him is, I made Julissa's happy. It's a, it's a lie because we do know that you listen, it's never really stopped off the island of Capri in who's grotto. This hiring is mythological. He said to reside. We do know that she, he did listen to the song of the siren. Uh, he made sure that his companions would know and he hit himself bound bound to the mast of the ship. Okay? So that is, that is a transgression and the binding going on at the same time, as I said at anyway. Uh, she lies about, I turned Ulysses. He got on his way to my song and he who dwells with me. So the first, the other lie or the extension of the lie is that the siren is making false promises of happiness to the dream.

Speaker 1:          00:32:35       Where she's saying is, you stay here with me and I am the end of all that you desire. I am going to give you all the pleasures that you want and therefore your journey may very well be over if you are weary of the road. This is the place where you should stop. We have another figure that emerges clearly the antagonist of the siren. We don't know who she is. We'll find out very quickly in Canto 30 and 31 cause the same scene will be reenacted with the arrival of Beatrice. We imagine that here too. We have forced to imagine that here too. She is, uh, she's Beatrice, her lips were not yet close again when they lady wholly in the alert, a woman in the sense of, uh, uh, Damina, uh, appeared beside me to put her to confusion. Virgil Virgil is this, she said with anger and he came with what is the difference between them, between these two women, they are two different forms of poetry.

Speaker 1:          00:33:34       So now we understand why Dan had to been talking about the imagination all along because this is really what will introduce him to the stakes in claiming to be a poet. This is what he's been talking about. The actual faculty of himself as a poet and the Cantos that will come 2122 to 26 and 27 constitute the most important segment about ways of understanding literary history, literary tradition, uh, or the praise of originality within that particular history and so on. We are going to enter the world of poetry more directly. So they are two different women. They speak to different voices. One sweet meretricious and falls, that's sweet song. The other one very harsh who says the journey is not over. One forecloses the journey of and the quest of Dante, uh, be like, Ulysses, I know that you want to be like [inaudible] you can stay here with me and I am the end of all your journeys and your quest.

Speaker 1:          00:34:40       The other one is claiming exactly the opposite. The journey has to continue these two types of songs, song or this hiring suite, the chess, also the stench of death attached to it, the stench of the decomposition of her body. And on the other hand, a journey by this austere voice, the voice of maybe their voice of love, the voice of harshness. No, that then just the language of, uh, of sweetness, uh, is, is, uh, that have, uh, uh, uh, love as an ongoing quest. That's what she's saying. So two forms of love, two forms of poetry, two types of women, the scene in case you're interested in this. How many of you I'm sure have thought about it literally stages. The, the, the, the scene at the beginning of the consolation of philosophy of breaches, which in turn is thinking about who internally, thinking about the book 10 of the republic by Plato.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       Uh, the idea of the place, that place of love as the place of poetry and philosophy changes that tradition. This is not just poetry versus philosophy. It's two different types of poetry. Poetry can be also a philosophical poetry. Poetry can be meretricious employed. You can be also there. There's sort of a rigorous, severe form of investigation of one's self and the world to different types of poetry. Two different types of loves to different types of women. Which of the two is better? How can we go on deciding that one is better than the other? Is there an objective pattern, objective criterion by which you can say Beatrice is actually better than this hiring. That's Dante. Dante were of this idea of yes. And the reason is going to be the foreign, very simple, the avoidance of death. The Siren is the figure that stands for that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       Underneath the pleasures of her language, there is a stench that emanates from then underneath that allegory. He, Dante sees the danger of closing and the danger of making the here and now and the limitations of the here and now and the limitations. So that song, the end of his journey, it's really a choice between an open ended quest and the foreclosure of the siren. This is the only way in which you can objectively believe that there is a hierarchy between these two loves in between these two women. Um, we, we moved to Canto, Ah, 21 and 22. Um, but I'm wondering if I shouldn't take a few questions here about this cancer, um, uh, on any other problems before we move on to something a little bit more, a little bit different. Um, more classical, the encounter between stations and Virgil. So let me see if there are some questions now about this, this face, this, uh, this cantors, uh, or would you like to meet to go on and then maybe we can come back to them.

Speaker 1:          00:38:08       Very good you say that, but the question is excellent. I was supposed to draw some connection between this scene and, and, and the, and the scene of Cassela in Canto to above all of purgatory. I call it excellent because I agree you're supposed to and, and it's the reappearance and the different guises, the same computation, how the aesthetic can become a, both a way of gathering people at, on this health. Oh, that, that's the famous story of Cassela the power of the song just collects, gathers, but at the same time, it endusers assault to forgetfulness of uh, uh, whatever purposes those souls are supposed to entertain and carry out. The difference of course, is that it's the same story here. Now the differences is not between, let's say a castle, a UN and others with, with the language of a, of Cato. Here, it's more an an autobahn directly.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       We are moved into the consciousness of the pilgrim. We have entered this as deep as we can into his unconscious mind. This is the moment of what he's, he comes to an, an amazing self revelation that had the story of, because Ella had the ring of public discourse, poetry as a public act, um, gathering a number of people around it. So this is a very good, that's a thank you for mentioning that. And by the way, uh, I don't know that we never probably read it, but if you read the beginning, I think I read it in Italian for professor Brookshire's. I know she likes the province, our song, but the beginning of Canto eight, uh, also that moment of the nostalgia for the, the, the safety of home, uh, the weariness of the evening, the evening song, uh, et Cetera, that that represents another version of the same kind of a dilemma with which the pilgrim is a confronted.

Speaker 1:          00:40:25       Okay. Maybe we can come back to some of this since we move into this, literally is the segment of the poem. I said 21, uh, 22, uh, going through 20, 23, 24, a, which is really, uh, has poetry now as, uh, it's, uh, the subject matter and Nantais begins with, um, um, let's say the classical tradition, the relationship between an encounter that takes place. We are in the, in the world of avarice and product galaxy, the encounter between stations and Virgil as you know, stages views himself as a disciple or Virgil. And in many ways, he challenges Virgil's ideology. Virgil's thought was virtual can go on writing a poem, the Aeneid and EC logs, which are about the, the, the pastoral world or the Geologix. You know, this world about the cultivation of the earth where virtual appears that he's most anti or fic he distinguishes and the distances himself from the traditional fuse, the poet of mad love, who descends into the depths of hades.

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       Uh, and of course, it's a waylaid by, by the mad love for a, you read this and is the way of conquering death through the song. He believes that through by singing, he can bend, uh, the loss of a, of death and therefore gain immortality. Uh, Virgil opposes a world of, uh, of, of work. The world of, uh, of, of mature. The responsible world of, of a knee is, uh, uh, the, the, the, the hero who is so divided against himself and yet managers to always find his way around, you know, and, uh, and this kind of regularly erratic path, uh, of, uh, of his epic, uh, stages, uh, counters, Virgil, uh, stations writes the Tobias, he writes another look. We, she never finished. And another little epic called the, the, the Achillea the story about Achilles, but he'd the only a fragment he writes the turbine, which really goes against those claims of virtual, or he retrieves a Mexican junction between tragedy and the epic, uh, the world of, uh, the world of Jocasta.

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       And he depose the monstrosity of that world, the world of up Polynese, uh, and the [inaudible] the world of Antigony, uh, cast in as a kind of nightmarish world. It's literally the most psychological of these epics, the wars that happened in the mind. And, and, and this idea of a monstrosity of human, our fate and human desires. Uh, and, and so that, these are the two worlds that Dante wants to bring together in this little appeal. And I would call it a opinion, is a Greek word, meaning a literal epic. This is a transcriptional to epic, Texas gathered into one and two elliptical form. And, and he has a tough, tough task because what he wants to show is the possibility of harmonizing the two of them. And he shows how the two of them really go talk as friends, friends across time. Of course, uh, Stasia's lives around the year 17.

Speaker 1:          00:43:57       Aidy Virgil dies in the year 19. Um, um, another friends because poetry has managed their poetry, has made, made them up. The poetry of, of Virgil has made them friends and, and, and stations is, is, is a sort of a classical version of Dante himself. Dante's the disciple virgin, so was stations. So he has to bring them together. But as soon as the pressure of making them agree only is because they're two different visions. That in and of itself may not be all that difficult. Stations is very skeptical about, uh, uh, the empire. Virgil is not all that skeptical. It's possible to read the Aeneid and see that there's a lot of ambiguity in the way which he, he talks about about, uh, Augustus and the empire, but it's basically writing the epic that justifies the ideology of the empire. That is a difficulty between them, is that Dante said the real difficulty and challenge for Dante is that he has to try to understand how stages start to adjust Stasia's vision of monstrosity to some idea of the sacred.

Speaker 1:          00:45:09       This is the real challenge. This is the difference that Dante has from the classical world. How do we understand the sacred and in what way is it's impossible to use Stasia's Virgil as he already did with Cato, who is, by the way, they the hero of Lucas third poet of this epic tradition. Virgil Lucan stages. How's it possible to see in these texts of, of stages the seeds of something good? How can we build anything good out of this, um, vision of heroes and characters who just fornicating with, uh, with her own fantasies, who cannot really get out of there are of their minds who just are discover their own, um, and changing submission to a force that's nonsense to fate. It's really absolutely a different worldview from the world of virtual. So let me just go on a little bit with that. At 21, I just, uh, um, talking, first of all with a Dante begins, um, with, uh, um, an allusion to, um, this natural thirst, natural thirst, which is this world of, uh, of their actual thirst for knowledge.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       It's really much the world of the banquet. There were the virustotal. We have this incredible thirst for knowledge. And then, uh, uh, uh, uh, this figure called stations appears. Uh, um, we also being told that nature, the natural world, uh, is, uh, mysteriously shaking. There's an earthquake because every time that I sold gets liberated from the purgatorial, uh, experience or expiation, uh, the, this purification and expiation. Then the, the mountain trembles and they, and, and, and stages can go on with them up to the garden of Eden. And, uh, and then, um, uh, stages, uh, reveals himself and he will say, and unlined 60, um, uh, and I who have laid in this pain 500 years or more Statia speaking felt. But now my will free for the better threshold there for thousands feel the earthquake. And here the devout spirits to the mountain ran the praises to the Lord, sued that his erection is taking place.

Speaker 1:          00:47:50       And this is going to be the resurrection of stages. And virtual. Uh, it's a stages but also virtual in their own, their own vision. Uh, so he goes on describing himself and the time when the good titles, the emperor he's evoking at the time of the, uh, he's recalling the time that the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem at the time when the good titles by helping with the king most high avenged, uh, justice, divine mysteries of justice, the wounds from which poured the blood sold by Judas replied, the spirit, I boy Yonder, they name that most end users. And donors. Most famous indeed, but still without faith stations. A Pagan, uh, uh, really born again. Now this is a, the born again pagan, uh, that, uh, appears in this, uh, uh, in, in this camp. So sweet was my spirit of song that Rome drew me roam drum.

Speaker 1:          00:48:50       It's, they, it's an interesting, ah, images. It's really speaking of, uh, uh, roam, having a kind of power that usually we linked with love with, with desire. You know, the, the pool of desire. Rome brought him to it, to, uh, to herself, a to loosen without going into that to itself. And then I was worthy to have my brown and my brows adorned with myrtle men young still speak my name, which is stages. And I sang of Thebes and then have a great achilles, but fell by the way, with the second burden, uh, he, he could never complete. The second text, and I'll look at the way he speaks about poetry. Spoke, speaks through sparks as a kind of fire. Sparks at kindles the fire in me where from the divine, a flame, the divine flame from which more than a thousand have been lit. I mean the Aeneid.

Speaker 1:          00:49:48       So that's, that's already poetry now is invested with power, the power to light the fire in the readers and in its followers, which was important. My mother and my nurse, uh, without it, I have no, I had not weighed a dram and have lived yonder and Virgil lived. I would have contented to a sand from then more than I was due before coming forth from banishment. So the two metaphors to speak of poetry, one is that of the sparks of fire. And the second one is that of nourishing the inner hunger mother and nurse. It's, it's, it's a nursing, the nursing of, uh, of his readers. So a great acknowledgement of the master without his knowledge that, that, uh, it is Virgil to whom he's speaking and then came to 21, which is, and another image that may remind you of the story of [inaudible], um, stages reveals Dante reveal stations, identity, a virtuous identity.

Speaker 1:          00:50:57       It's Restasis and they try to, uh, the two of them tried to embrace already. He was bending to embrace lines one third and following my teacher's feet. But he said to me, brother, do not. So for that word, the shade and the shade, thou seest and he rising. Now Thou canst understand the measure of the love that Burns and me for the, when I forget her emptiness in three chains, assorted things and mistake that has been made before. And the mistake that I think, uh, is, uh, is meant to, um, to convey the, the claims of the illusions of poets to believe that there is some kind of solidity to them and not just to the poetry, to the works, but a solidity to them that then this embrace, uh, belies no solid family as a kind of emptiness is a sort of distance between the poets and their works.

Speaker 1:          00:52:02       This is not going to, I think, interfere very much because it's the works the works of art that we are going to be talking about. And we in, in Canton 22. Uh, so the, uh, the two poets now are our self, uh, in in a good note, each an acknowledgement of the other and they go on talking about line 10 and following, um, uh, Virgil asks stages to explain to him why this moral blight existed at him, why they scene of avarice. Um, why the scene of Alvarez. And he says, this is the passage love cantor 22 lions 12 and following love kindled by virtue always kindles and other. That's the salt of vitality and power of love. It's not self enclosed. It's one that goes on, uh, creating and propagating itself has a generosity of its own. Okay. Has a kind of charitable ness of it.

Speaker 1:          00:53:11       So if only it's flame appear without. So fire and love seem to be conjoined by this common, uh, element, that common, uh, element of the power of propagation or perpetuation. Um, uh, from the hour. Therefore, when juvenile descended among us in the limbo of hell and made their affection known to me, my goodwill toes, the was as great has ever held. Any one for a person not seen so that now the stairs will seem short to me, but tell me and there's a friend, forgive, give me if with too much assurance has slackened the rain and there's a friend speak with me now. How could avarice find a place in depressed along with so much wisdom is by the zeal thou was filled with um, this is a passage of some, uh, some importance. The because first of all the claim of friendship between the, from Virgil, he's moved by the show friendship on the part of stations as let's talk now as, as friends.

Speaker 1:          00:54:19       Um, friendship is an ethical virtue as you know, in uh, artists thought was ethics and for Cicero writes a treatise called on friendship, which done mentioned at the beginning of his philosophical texts in the belief that friendship is really the other language. The other term for philosophy or it's the friend and the philosopher are interchangeable. This is if there is, there is a love of in friendship and there's a level of truth that is the I, that is the idea. There is some exaggeration on the part of virtual because there is really a friendship implies to some kind of some degree of equality, right? You must have, in order to be friends, you must have some idea, we call it in fact, it's usually said that tyrants and slaves are not capable of love or friendship because both since one is the version of the other, both really have a kind of uh, uh, uh, inequality vis a VI.

Speaker 1:          00:55:18       The other, the slave is by definition inferior. They tyrant thinks he's superior. So friendship remains a kind of equality and this is a little bit of an exaggeration because there is no equality between stages instead of Toric or exaggeration stages. And Virgil Virgil is, um, uh, I acknowledge as being superior to stages stage of sees himself as a disciple and therefore views Virgil as superior from a poetic point of view, from a theological point of view. Stages is superior to Virgil was, stations is going on to paradise and virtual is going to go back to limbo. So there is a kind of, uh, uh, the, the, uh, it push in the, in the, in the direction of a wishful thinking may be on the, on the part of, on the part of Virgil. I must also add that Dante said, uh, kind of, uh, some were closer to do about him.

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       He may be aware that the friendship was never really thought of as a Christian virtue. It's a classical impaled and virtue and because it really confuses, you know, it's the idea is a friend is always part of one soul. Uh, it's really an earthbound. They said it's, it's a north bound up, uh, experience. So it was always the thought, not Augustan Augustan who has a friend, I leap years and feels responsible for our repairs. But by and large, it was this idea that the, the friendship could distract the mind from, uh, from an assent to a higher and superior ends, parodies, Yak excesses, uh, and pleasures. So not, they must be aware that there were efforts to Christianize this, this idea. Nonetheless, it, it brings the conversation between them back to the earth. Uh, and they talk as if there were two friends really meeting in the forum and the Agora and chatting about their moral failings or their own poetic crafts and visions.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       How could you find the, how could you be so avaricious when you were so enlightened in so many other ways? That's the question. STASIA's responses is not avaricious. And I think that that adds a great deal about their understandings, the misunderstandings of each other, but also their understanding. So poetry, he goes on talking about the fact that he is prodigal all the time. So then, so say, uh, that he, uh, you may remember from Kantar several of fair knew the difference between the avaricious and, and the sense of practicality that product quality was, eh, Eh, a, a violation of the economy of goods by devaluing, by getting of devaluing them, not holding on to them. The avaricious overvalues the goods and tries to, to heap amass a larger quantities of goods. So he goes on, uh, really thinking stages once to make it clear for at least 40 lines about the fact that he's, uh, he was prodigal and w we have to understand what, why he would say that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:28       And then in fact, he goes on acknowledging once again, stations focus, moral conversion. So that's the first thing about what poetry can do. She says no, then that iris was too far removed from me and this access thousands wound have punished, have punished and head. I had it not been that are corrected my ways when I understood the lines where as if in rage, human nature that it's cry to what occurs. Hunger for gold that's down or drive the appetite of mortals. I should be rolling the weight and know that this small jousts but he's saying is that he read a passage in a book, three of the Aeneid the story that we already saw or poorly Doris who had been killed because of a, they want to rob him of his gold and, uh, uh, stages reach the moral conversion. Um, I like this a lot we can say about this lines the first of all, first of all, um, I think this exemplifies how we actually read.

Speaker 1:          00:59:32       We read them with this member, the integrity of the text. We take out of a book out of a passage that which will we find, um, uh, relevant to us. Um, and he takes some blinds, uh, in, in, in, in their only, take some lines from the book, three of their need. He also alters the meaning, the original text. The virtuous says exactly the opposite. To what though, why do you not contain, uh, the, the, uh, why do you not contain the hung the appetite of mortals or sacred, sacred, a hunger for gold, which the text and says curse. It's the word sacred, which Dante is using here. Why do you know, uh, contain or sacred fame of gold or sacral assignment that loader, they wouldn't sacred. As you probably know, some of you may know. It means two things. It's symbols, some biggest term that you semantically speaking, because you can describe both that which we call the holy and that which we call the profane.

Speaker 1:          01:00:40       He joins them together. There's no clear cut distinction between the pro foundational blasting on the other hand or the sense of holiness. So I can understand why my translation, Saint Claire, I'm a translator, uh, decides to choose the cursed instead of a, call it secret. For instance, cursed, he's dismembering his taking one, one side or what is it? Much more complicated version of the meaning of the word. So that's one thing, but the poetic text of Virgil has a moral power over and against Virgil's own intentions. We can understand now retrospectively, why dentists to distinguish between poets and the works. That's, you know, we can read the works regardless of the intentions of the others. And we can, we can select or take out a of those texts, whatever we think that we were. However we think that they speak to us. And then he goes on, uh, uh, describing his poetic growth.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       Now this is lines, uh, uh, 55 now went down to sing. The crew alarms, the Double Wolf Jocasta, the double wars children, a ticklish and colonies in the tragic and that big text called the suburban said the singer of the BW colleagues. So see that's already the opposition. Virgin now appears as the author of a pastor, a poem that your colleagues were a rivalries are always going to be placated. That is the big colleagues of the pastoral are virtues are always about rivalry. Rivalry between two shepherds, which, which of us they ask is the better singer, which of us is the better poet. And that is always, there is never any tragic outcome. There's some, some, some uneasiness, some anxiety between uh, running through that kind of debate between the posts. But it's not the rivalry of joke of, of Polynesians [inaudible] so that's, that's really the difference that Dante is highlighting between them.

Speaker 1:          01:02:51       And then it continues. It does not appear by the nodes, which clear touches with the, so the college and other hand, the Cleo is the muse of history. So cleo is the muse for history is the world of Stasia's. That's a faith yet made the faithful without which we're doing is not enough. If that is so what son or what candles dispelled I darkness so that thereafter it's lift the sales, be fine, be behind the fishermen. Now we know that what he's really asking in a general way is the relationship between poetry and faith. How could stages we know how he reached this moral conversion. Now we have to be told somehow, how did he go on finding a faith? What is the relationship between the two of them? Can poetry reveal and lead us on to the world of faith or not? Uh, and stage two says already, that's really the answer that he will provide.

Speaker 1:          01:04:03       And the other ends with him. Thou first directed me to Parnassus the mountain of poetry. So that poetic experience, the poetic apprenticeship is the preamble to the experience of faith to drink in its caves. A metaphor that picks up the natural thirst of the previous canter to drink and escapes. And the first, after God enlightens me that didn't like him, that goes by night and carries the light behind him and does not help himself. But makes wise those who follow when they'll say in a moment, we'll see what he said. But the metaphor is that of really, uh, uh, virtual is a prophetic voice who speaks, but that the language he uses like the law, the, the, uh, a lamp that he carries on his back for the benefit of those who follow and himself clearly remains the dark. That's what he said. The age turns new again.

Speaker 1:          01:05:03       Justice comes back and the primal years of men and the new race descends from heaven. This is the famous fourth Eq Rog of Virgil. Virgil is a celebrating the birth of a child polio and around this birth of a child. He's also talking about the rejuvenation of the world. Uh, it's an emblem. Polios birth is an emblem for this Pythagorean vision that he has a vision whereby the world goes through a 360,000 years of, uh, the Golden Age, the silver age and so on, and then degrades itself and goes right back to where it started. Epitaph, librarian, vision of a metamorphosis and the circulation of the universe. It's the full deck log. Um, um, interestingly, this also crystallizes that which is the fundamental issue of Virgil's vision. The concern with birth, the concern with the fact of being born, that the fact of being born has within itself the potential to renew, uh, the world to affect the world and change the direction of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       And then he, we know that he'll say, and there was soap here, uh, because we are coming to the end of the period through the, I was a poet through the Christian, but thou that thou may see better where the outline, I should set my hand to color it already. The world was, uh, everywhere. Big pregnant Italian says with the true faith sown by the messengers and so on. He's going to talk how the world outside only batteries that reinforced the message of faith that he had found in the fourth Techlog. Okay. The four deck will be seen as a messianic ecolog, uh, but outline that makes it transition from poetry to face. I was a poet through Leah. I was a poet through the, uh, Christian. I think it really makes it necessary for us for linger on it for a little bit. First of all, the line has what we call an Anaphora through the, through the, I was a poet, I was poured through the Christian.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       This is the same line, uh, that says [inaudible] the Italian word line 74 [inaudible] 73 per tape. Wait a fully bestech Christiana, the Anaphora. It gives continuity to the movement of the line from poetry to faith. But nonetheless, if you read this slide carefully in Italian, you see that there is also a sub genre for a, you know what I mean by [inaudible] fallen in the middle, a break per tape with a food break, birthday, Christiana, the line gives, has a mobility that seems to a promise, that transition from poetry to face, but at the same time, technically it forces you to stop as if they were to discontinuous experiences. You cannot go from one world of poetry to the one world of faith. You can go from one world of politics, one world of faith. This, that ambiguity of poetry is exactly what they are trying to retrieve.

Speaker 2:          01:08:30       So,

Speaker 1:          01:08:30       but did I say here to the about this, this issue of stage shows and virtual stages is dealing with the tragedy of birth. Virgil deals with, with optimistically about the history making our quality of the event of birth. That is at the same time a desire to establish a sense of what is the sacred, I will try to discuss with you, um, Lolita, how poetry is now invested with the kind of sacredness, the ambiguous sense of the world has both the profane and, and, and the holy within it. Uh, it's an, it's, it's, it's a hybrid. And this, this is hybrid that would allow Dante to assimilate a stations vision to his own understanding of history and the sacred. So let me stop here and see if there are questions. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:09:43       please. It seems like it's more common for Dante to be the one to ask for their stories. I, is this the only place that Virgil was the one who asked the question or like what is this?

Speaker 1:          01:09:57       Well, the, the, the virtual is the, uh, the question is, it seems that usually it's Dante who interviews the people he meets. And, but here in Canto 21 and 22, it's Virgil. And is that the case? And if it's true, why would that be the case? The answer is that that's not really true. Bills in the candle, Ulysses, it is he who is this Virgil who speaks you remember to two years it's virtual. So it's virtual in Ulysses. It's has really more to do with the figures of the classical world that seemed to be in this case virtual system best indicated for a status as he, as he was for Virgil. Since you're interested in this kind of, uh, of, um, uh, aspect of the dramatization of the poem, I would mention to you, for instance, their candles in fair. No, we didn't have a chance to talk about them where the Virgil would completely abandon Dante's as well.

Speaker 1:          01:10:57       You go here, I don't want to be with you. Uh, you, you go and, and, and own your own, carry out this introduction without, I wait for you here. And that happens for instance, in the Canto of fraud, the, the, the, and, and usury. Um, it, this is if Dante had something to better understand on his own, uh, without Virtua's presence. But usually that is the way in which, uh, the style of a, of the presentation takes place. So who, who is most apt, uh, in the case of the classical figures, the classical poet speaking to a classical. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:11:45       Comment a little further on the significance of Contra 19. It looks like we're kind of reenactment of the fall of Adam and eve. It's, it's almost a bit this woman even in the,

Speaker 1:          01:12:03       in the dream,

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       the siren. Yes. And the dream it when she,

Speaker 2:          01:12:07       mmm.

Speaker 3:          01:12:09       She brings forth the, this promise of happiness and it's really accurate wing that the promise of Lucifer of this narrow, I will make you like God. Why is this sort of, um, why is this theme of, of sort of the atom theme coming up here in 19? Is there some sort of strand that I'm missing?

Speaker 1:          01:12:34       The Youtube, the question is that, um, uh, Susan, Ken until 19, in the dream of this hiring, there is an echo of, uh, the fall of Adam more than Lucifer. I would say the fall of Adam and Andy, why would there be, uh, that, uh, if that's true, why would that be the echo? And my answer is I haven't, I didn't catch it. I did. I never caught this, uh, uh, echo of Adam there. Um, it's an it, it's actually the story of, uh, uh, the temptation of this woman fish. That's where she is, right? They've decided marine, uh, who wants to use forgetfulness in the pill. The is really a classical figure. Um, I would say that I sort of resist the hearing here, the figure of a, in the figure of Adam, because Adam doesn't really talk about falling. Say this is a danger for the pilgrim who he's, he's a, he's a, he's a dramatizing his sense of, uh, of yielding, surrendering his will to the seduction, the seductive song of the siren. Adam I'm with, and this is stove love. Without them, a stories becomes one of knowledge. Uh, it's a little bit different. Uh, they may be echoes. I'm not, I'm not going to be so, so firm and say, no, there's no heck of that. Does that. But I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, it, I didn't feel the necessity for that action for my argument.

Speaker 3:          01:14:17       Well, maybe I'm answering my own question here, but wouldn't you say that the, the theme of knowledge and transgression runs through both the dream sequence that Dante has and the story of Adam's fall, I mean, is, is, is there, um, that theme where you list is, you know, wanted to sort of gain this knowledge is experience of hearing the siren song, right. And, um, and to gain that knowledge he had to sort of transgress. And isn't that what the siren represents? I mean, you say, you said he keeps coming back to this theme of you list.

Speaker 1:          01:14:58       He does. He doesn't mention the store down

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       connection really comes in because Adam's ultimately ate the fruit for knowledge.

Speaker 1:          01:15:08       Well, I indicated that the, the story of Adam in Kendall 26, uh, it retrospectively illuminates what's happening in Canto 26 of him fair. And that he tool, uh, experience, understands knowledge and, and, and, and, and transgression that they, that they go hand in hand and that it's difficult to impossible to separate them. And that's the story of Ulysses. Dante does feel that he is and they said dangerous. A temptation for him to believe that he's, he's, uh, he's like, you listen. Whereas he has no problem later in when he understands what the story of Adam is in thinking in acknowledging that Adam is the arch port, you know, we're all reinventing the world, et Cetera. Uh, so, uh, I will say that there are three figures here. You listen as Adam and Dante and, but the relation between them is never what was one of full of identification on the part of Dante with either, uh, you know, he comes, he approximates them, uh, and somehow also pulls away from, from both.

Speaker 1:          01:16:17       He's not really, Adam is not the arch poets who names the world and there's not really you listeners that fear that he may be like you races, which is a more dangerous, uh, uh, since sense that he has that we'll continue more openly, uh, as he goes on the story of Adam, uh, you know, it's going to be picked up in the garden of Eden, the Garden of Eden. Of course there is the idea that we lost the garden. Uh, but Dante is not one to be in that garden anyway. Uh, when he comes to the garden of Eden, he identifies it with a lot of things. Uh, the really nostalgia for the mother. Um, and, and he doesn't, he understands that his to grow up, he has to get out of that fantasy. I don't know if, uh, uh, you know, this is,

Speaker 3:          01:17:09       yeah. Um, what confuses me, I guess that, um, you know, the, the siren here, the dream secret seems to be wanting to halt Dante is west his journey for

Speaker 1:          01:17:21       yes, absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:17:22       And yet with respect to Ulysses, the siren seem to represent the opposite in the sense that his interaction with her was, um, uh, was something where he was trying to go past the balances to gain knowledge and gain experience of hearing her. Uh, so I'm trying to draw the connections in my mind for what, what is really Dante trying to tell us with this sequence. Why does he go back to this, um, this reference of the sirens, this reference to the siren. I mean, maybe you could just summarize, I guess maybe it would help clear it up. Um, what she represents to Dante here in Canton 19 versus what she represents to Ulysses.

Speaker 1:          01:18:13       Yeah. Good. What's a, what does the siren represent? Very briefly, what does this hiring represent to Dante and to Ulysses? What is the difference to Dante? This Shireen represents the, the lure of death. He understands a beneath that, that promises of yield to the here and now and to my voice that is really, uh, there's said nothing in this and he's attracted to that nothingness. That's really what it is for Ulysses. She also represents the extraordinary, uh, enchantment of the song that would lead them to death because that's, that's, that's what it happens to all those who listened to this, Irene, you listen, wants to hear it and bind himself so that, that does not yield all together to her call. That's, that's how I can put it. Thank you. We'll see you.
