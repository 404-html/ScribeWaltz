Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Last time we, uh, got into Canto 10, and they began with the heaven of the Sun. And that began with the description of a Dante begins. We went over the phases of the candle. Uh, on the one hand, the is the description of the trinity, of the inner life of the trinity is a life of love or the breadth and the father. The Spirit, um, love the son, the father abound by the breadth of love, uh, as it were, then Dante moves into, um, it's the description of the spectacle of, uh, of the whole or this heaven and of this Po, this fragment of the cosmos by turning to us readers twice, asking us to look up. Uh, it is by looking up, we can see, uh, the givenness of creation. The fact that it has been given a, it's, it's a gift to us.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Uh, it's also a way of, uh, if it's, if it's a gift, um, if there's any economy, a theory economy in the cosmos, it's a divine economy. It also means that some are somehow we cannot really claim to, to own it. That's, it seems to be a natural consequence of something being a Gif does not imply, there's not entail unnecessarily ownership of uh, this gift that has been given. And therefore we, we are invited to have an aesthetic, uh, admiration over it. Uh, so this, this kind of the scene of, uh, of, of the divine, this even a kind of field drama, divine drama, I spectacle that I'm folds and unfolds throughout the course was answer with a description of a, the encyclopedia is a, as I was describing it to you are there is to say with a Kleiner's who recounts a the names and mentions one after the other, the twelves, um, representatives of various disciplines.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       We talked a little bit about, uh, Solomon and the scandal that his inclusion here, uh, cause, cause in Dante's own times and say it, Dante's responding to a real crisis about our knowledge of the ultimate fate of Solomon, the wisest of old man. Uh, was he saved or not, uh, on account of his weaknesses in terms of his, uh, his, what he's Letteri. Um, and then, uh, the Canto focuses on ends really with a CGL broadband who was a logician philosopher. And Dante describes him, uh, really owned the way to two knowledge. He was ahead of thick. It was viewed of as, as, as a heretic. Dante dismisses that whole charge. And in many ways he represents that knowledge as, or the circle of knowledge is one of made of a contradictory voices were those that had been blaming CGIAR Oprah bands such as Aquinas himself now retract their positions.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       So the whole process of getting to know the world is one of Evers and it's one of retractions. Okay. Uh, there are some interesting details that I could up. I could even, I think that I should even mention to you, uh, as a, as we approach 11 and 12, uh, uh, seizure is described as his, uh, absorbed in his grave. Thoughts in Italian is, uh, uh, Graffy pain. Sierra, you know, the Word Been Sierra is that, uh, English bends pensive, uh, and, and I think that that is such a remarkable, uh, word because it really means to think in Latin. Uh, and the oldest exploit this residence of the verb means to be, to, to be at an impasse, to be suspended, literally to be suspended. So he suspended in thoughts as if the thoughts could not make him reach, uh, the threshold of, uh, the knowledge he, Eh, he wanted.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       At any rate, that's the way our can talk. 10, that's the economy of cancer. 10, I want to, or since the three canters that go together to really, I ask you to turn to the end of Canto 12 where our Bonaventure, who is a Franciscan, uh, you probably know what, what is meant by that. The Franciscan is one in the order of some Francis just as Aquinas is Dominican. The Franciscans are those who believe in the priority of will and love in the act of knowledge. Uh, the Dominicans or is New York is Tutelian like Aquinas believed in the priority of the intellect in the apprehension of the world. The Dominicans were founded with the explicit mandate to teach in the universities were Harrises, they thought abounded and therefore they had to exit prey, pluck off the roots of Harrison's different systems. We're going to be a witnessing in the world, uh, in both orders are, are shaped by a belief in poverty that we have to examine a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       We have to understand what it means at any rate. Uh, Bonaventure he is a Franciscan and by the end of Canto 12, after it has been, uh, uh, chronicling the life of, uh, Dominic, this is sort of another case of extraordinary openness of in Dante's view of these characters in the sense of Franciscans and Dominicans were really at odds with each other, both in terms of their theologies and their, and their premises. Uh, more intellectual premises above or here. Dante has a Franciscan tell the life of Dominic just as earlier in canned to 11. And Dominicans and Aquinas tells the life of Francis, the two candles are controlled, but what we call a cosmos, that's, that's this is a cast was from the, the Greek word Chi. Uh, he, uh, uh, cosmos, right? So you have an intersection of, uh, of voices. It's sort of a sense of the interdependence of the two perspectives.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       Um, I will say a little bit more about one adventure after I read this paragraph. This paragraph, the last paragraph in Canton 12 lines one third and following, uh, uh, sort of functions as a counterweight to the description of the encyclopedia that Aquinas had given at the end of [inaudible] 10 and ending with a seizure of broadband. So let me just see who the people are here. I'm the living soul of Bonaventure of binary area who in gray offices ever put last? The left hand care here are Luminato and Augustan were among the first bare foot a brothers in the code made themselves God's friends. Then a theorist of medieval encyclopedias, hue of some Vic victor, a Parisian, a Fryer, um, who really wrote the so called data scarlet going, which is a text about what is the, what are, what are the stages of education?

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       How does the mind come to the knowledge of God starting from the small, uh, elements in the outside life, the material world than the interior lights, etc. Before reaching the God's supreme light. Then a is here with them. Peter, the bookworm, Peter the Spaniard and other theorist of medieval logic who shines below in 12 books. Then Nathan the prophet, how come back to this name? The Prophet Nathan is known to those who know, uh, as being, uh, David's a bad conscience or good conscience, the one who is freaking him to think about himself. Nathan a profit, uh, sensor councilor of the king. A little bit more about him in a while. And Chris Os Thumb, the metropolitan meaning that God with a golden mouth language here is the, the flower of eloquence is what he processors. Um, and Anselm the another theologian who writes about the reasons for the incarnations, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       Famous Texas. But why do, why did God become a man? And then Donatos who then to set his hand to the first art grammar. So you say of the whole array, the whole wide spectrum of water. We called encyclopedia logic, eloquence. Um, uh, grandma Donatos is the, a Reuben grump Syrian and there are banners, a historian and beside me shines the Calabrian Abbott Joke Him who was endowed with a spirit of prophecy, the growing, uh, courtesy. And we'll judge it. Language or brother Thomas. I've moved me to celebrate so great. A Paladin and with me have moved this, uh, company, uh, one eventual ends with uh, uh, the tip of the hat and the direction of, uh, Aquinas, whose example he has followed. So an example of a, once again have a dialogue and openness between the two olders in the tool, the tool members of different orders and yet in somehow interdependent with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       Uh, now, uh, the presence of Abbott Joel Kim is another counterweight to seizure of broadband in Canto 10. He to joke him, uh, who you have met because I talked to have mentioned his name to you in discussing the prophecy, glossing the prophecy of the DXV improved at all. You're 33. You remember where I tried to explain it, that, uh, that seems to be a kind of apocalyptic meaning to that prophecy, the numerical enigma, a, an enigmatic prophecy about the coming of Christ at the end of time who will come and therefore, uh, the, the prophecy of the consummation of history and the consummation of time, the DXV, the 510 and five is that is called. And I said that the, the, um, the, the joke is the interpretation of that emblem of that symbol, uh, seemed to me to be accurate. They really meant really, so to introduce the idea of the end of time, however I rejected, I ask you to also reject the implications of that prophecy.

Speaker 1:          00:11:35       Uh, Joe is prophecy. It was viewed as heretical for a number of important reasons. It expresses as whole to of impatience about history. This is a really believes first of all in the, uh, imminent and closure of history. His, the, the end is close at hand. Uh, and this is a kind of, and, and the, and they ended up history in prize, the, uh, the coming into being a Va. And Utopia and utopia of the spirit. The third day, age of the spirit when finally old institutions hold barriers are shattered and torn down. And this is a kind of, this is really what, what from Dante's point of view would be wrong with a [inaudible] cause you topian impulse the idea that it always begs a foreclosure or what we can never really fathom, which is the world of, uh, uh, historical occurrences. But another reason why he was viewed as heretical by exactly the Bonaventure.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       It was Bonaventure who asked that his views be damned. And now he is Soto of, uh, writing a pilot. Nord Dante allows him to make amends for the previous condemnation. Bonaventure found objectionable, the ideas of a joke and move forward because Joe came. The factor is this solving the whole notion of the utility of the trinitarian life. He had, he, he theorizes, Eh, an idea of history, a tripartite idea of history. According to the three persons of the Trinity, the age of the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit. He believes that it is. Once that was once in biblical times, there was the age of the father, God was understood this, the father. Then we enter the age of, uh, of the sun, uh, brotherhoods of all and now the spiritual age of the Holy Spirit. It, the factory means that the three ways, the three manifestations, this kind of complex way of understanding a unity from different viewpoints is actually, um, uh, uh, dissolve.

Speaker 1:          00:13:50       This is, it becomes separate each, uh, each person of the trinity, it becomes a separate entity. And that view from four, four Bonaventure was sa, uh, heretical. He condemns him. Now he acknowledges that he actually was Abbott Joel Kim, who was endowed with a spirit of prophecy is something only prophetic. In other words, what seemed to be heresy, a, an intellectual question of, uh, of, of, um, of thoughts and opinions and our peers as some divination about, uh, uh, things to come. Uh, no, no, not, no, not specified any further. Retrospectively, it's down to himself with legitimizing drove him and therefore also legitimizing his own position. In Canto 33 a of Purgatorio Dante shares the view of the apocalyptic, the new mom of history. However, uh, he refuses. He rejects the idea that it's possible to establish a, uh, a for such a, an occurrence joke him appears now is a visionary among, among them.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       The other figure that I would like to say something about is Nathan the Prophet for a very simple reason, because Nathan, as you probably know this, it's very strange. Why would that include Nathan a prophet among, okay, there's joke him of Florida was prophetic, but why include Nathan among this? Uh, why spirits? I mean, he could have chosen so many others. He would have chosen, uh, uh, those who actually have written and whose shoes works are canonical in the Bible. He doesn't, uh, he chooses Nathan. And the idea is I think a little bit of, uh, Eh, an autobiographical or pun about Dante himself because the ne Nathan the word Nathan means he who gives, in other words, Dante Soul in the name of Nathan, his own name. And he plays him. Yeah. That's what Dante means. He who gives Nathan becomes a kind of mask for Dante of it is as if you were saying head I did, if I had I and other life or a pasta must live in, uh, the heavily apotheosis.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       That's where I probably would like, that's what I, I probably will end up certainly that's what I would like to be so innate and there is a mask for himself. Now. Why? Um, uh, what is this? So also peculiar about this encyclopedic ordering of the arts and the sciences. It doesn't really differ very much from Aquinas, but it's interesting that it's Bonaventure who, who, who, uh, articulates who voices this kind of a who celebrates all these names and all this arts because Bonaventure is himself a theorist of the encyclopedia very much as you have some victor. But he has one crucial reflection at the beginning of his encyclopedia. This is that the activity of knowing and learning, it's like going up and down a ladder. And you might say, you read that metaphor. You might say, well, that's an extraordinary metaphor, but it's the metaphor of the ladder of Jacob in the Bible, which is where he probably found that ladder of Plato.

Speaker 1:          00:17:15       And that's where this idea that, uh, we ascend the mind a sense when we learn something, when we get educated, the mind goes up and which we can go down. But the interesting thing about Bonaventure is that he goes on saying that as in a ladder, the lowest rung are always more important than the higher ones because without those, no one of us will be capable to climb up the ladder. So the lowest, the lowly, uh, forms of knowledge, grammar, uh, the, the, the external lights of the census was he distinguishes his, his, uh, it's theater of knowledges as a proliferation of lights, as a universe of lights, internal, external lights, internal lights, that light of the sensors. Uh, the lights will come to us from books and the light of God and so on. So we are always going to be enlightened in our process, but as we are enlightened, the lowest lights are first of all, self sufficient.

Speaker 1:          00:18:16       They are those who may not be capable of ascending, sending much higher, uh, in, uh, in the, in along the ladder. Uh, then the first few wrongs that is a really a self sufficient knowledge that they can acquire. So the arts have to him the art of poetry, that's the lowest rung and yet that has its home self sufficiency. And then you can go up the ladder, then literally learned more. The, the interesting thing about that ladder is that there is no sense though. It establishes a hierarchy in that hierarchy. The lower elements as crucial as the higher elements. Because without the lawyer there, the lower rungs who live with a kid, I never really, uh, can go up to the end. The, so, uh, this is, uh, another image then it the finally, let me just say with, uh, uh, with the jaw came, uh, uh, the inclusion of Joel Kim.

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       Uh, here we are getting into the, uh, the Eurasia of, uh, a strict barriers, strict boundaries between what is heretical and what is, what is canonical. I think this is the salt of, of openness, uh, Dante. So openness, uh, that somehow reverberates with, uh, the lesson of Francis and Dominic. And therefore, now let me turn to those two cancers. Keep in mind, and, uh, as we read the Canto 11. Good. Again, I, I, Eh, I repeat in the heaven of the sun and I don't know that, uh, the passage that I read to you from the pseudo ionizers last time about the divine names, where this will be the United States goes on talking about, uh, uh, uh, why is the metaphor of the sun such a, such a, such a, such a fundamental emerge for the divine divine generosity, right? This is, uh, as, as, uh, an image of, uh, uh, the sun that always gives of itself without ever asking anything, anything back.

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       So it's a, it's an activity of a purely general, pure generosity. Um, and I think that's a Franciscan image of a also of poverty to which a world, uh, but which I'll talk in a moment. The to 11, I repeat ends with the extraordinary, um, uh, encomium of seizure of broadband by a counterpoint can talk 11, uh, has an apostrophe against a logical legal forms of knowledge, the kind of knowledge that tries to define the world in formulas. And so he, Dante begins and this is Dante speaking on his own in his own voice, all intensive care of mortals. How vein or the reasonings that make the beat that wings in downward flight one was going after law and other after the aphorisms, one following the priesthood that are seeking to rule by force or craft, one set to robbery and another on affairs of state.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       We're laboring in the toils of freshly delights and another given up to either lose what I set three from all these things was high in heaven with Beatrice received, uh, received thus a glorious way. I think it's an interesting counterpoint between these icons of power, uh, that derive from the study of law and logic. And then the on the other hand, this, uh, uh, Dante's own self reference to himself as free from all of this. Uh, this concerns. I think this idea of freedom will be the dominant theme of, uh, of Canto of country 11 who, uh, it continues. And when each had come back to the point of the circle where it was before that the two wheels of dancing, old man holding their hands around the sun as well, which is a metaphorical son so that the university is not even [inaudible] is not heliocentric Dante's universe.

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       They're going to move now beyond the sun. It stopped like a candle on its stand. And then there is a little prayer here and uh, uh, the, the introduction of the two Dominick and Francis lines three and following the providence or rules the world with the council and whichever he created site is vanquished before it reaches the bottom in order that the bride of him who with loud cries whether high with his sacred blood should go to her beloved, secure in herself and faith, faith fuller to him, ordained for her, for her behoof to princess to be her guides on the side. And that the one, uh, was all seraphic in order. And that's Francis. The other for wisdom was on earth. And Splendor of Cherubic light. I shall tell over the one since two praise one, whichever we take is to speak of both for the levers where to one end.

Speaker 1:          00:23:23       That's really the, the formula that, that, uh, seals the sense of the interdependence of intellect and we'll, uh, of love knowledge and of the two the two voices. And now this is the, what we call a hagiography or a legend, the life of a saint, the saint's life of Francis, which is told by, uh, by, by Aquinas, by the Dominican Aquinas. Um, where we are told is first of all, between the two P on the water that falls from the hill chosen by the blessed to Baldo hangs at fertile slope of the lofty mountain from which Roger feels cold and heat at porter solar. And behind it not sharing, while do grieve under a heavy yoke, it's an extraordinarily localized representation of Francis origin. It's a typography. He was born as you know, in a sec, but it's almost as if he were just placing him in a specific place near the gate that leads, that are on the road to Audra.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       So season period, very precise. Uh, and it's called Puerto Solar. More about this in a moment from the slope where it most breaks. Steepness, son. Now we go from the top anemic, the name of a place, the gate of the sun, Sunday this gate of his son to a metaphor for Francis as the son. He is the son. So we are in the heaven of the Sun. And now Dante Invest Francis with all the attributes of this celerity, this continuous steady giving of oneself as the sun does and the new platonic imagery, the mystical neoplatonic imagery of, uh, of the sooner the United States is Sun rose on the world as this, that sometimes from the Ganges. Um, uh, so as soon as we, Dante has mentioned the specific place for Frances birth, then the coordinates of the geographic coordinates completely change. We go from the specific and local to literally the global, the world of the Ganges, the orient something a little faster as if the son Francis really acts between the concrete and local and, and, and the widest, uh, uh, possible, uh, reference.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       Therefore, let let him, who makes mention to that place, not say ashamed, which means I, I rise, but it's panning with a CZ four. He would say too little but orient if he would name it a rightly, uh, so it's uh, uh, it's an extraordinary emerged and to astronomical terms. The Sun and the Orient a four four Francis' was Francis' appears as like just as the sun does as one who can, and I'm, I'm playing with the texts it a little bit, but not much. One Who orients us, one who supposed to orient a re orient us. He's born in the, in in Assisi and yet it appears as if it were the east where his, what Dante is implied I think is that that for those who go on the face of the earth and lose the ways, then Francis becomes one who can tell them how to find the way back, whatever they are going.

Speaker 1:          00:27:00       For those who do not know the way I told her known never known the way they are capable of discovering it. He is providing this slide. So what is this light that he provides? What kind of light does he bring out? He was not yet far from his rising. The metaphoric of the sun continues when he began to make the earth feel, some strengthening from his mighty influence for, and now he gives the story of Francis Life. Um, and before I go there, I just want to tell you that Dante and I brought a translation of a poem Nanta that Dante knew that Francis is an extreme, is a great poet. He's actually, we consider him the first port of in Italian and Italian language. I just want to read a few stanzas from the so called Canticle of brother son so that you can see how uh, Dante zoned metaphoric derives straight her with Franciscan visions, Franciscan spirituality.

Speaker 1:          00:28:08       He begins most high. It's a prayer, a canticle of brother's son, our own powerful, good Lord. Yours or the praises, the glory, the honor and old blessing to you alone. Most high do they belong and no man is worthy to mention your name. Praise be my Lord with all your creatures, especially Brotherson who is the dean, who is the day and through whom you give us light. And his beautiful and radiant with great splendor, embarrass her likeness of view. Most high one praise be Yuma load through sister moon and the stars in heaven. You form them, clear and precious and beautiful praise bu my load through brought the wind goes through all the four elements. And part of the, the suggestiveness of this poem is that it's a song of praise to God, clearly enough. But it is also, we never know if uh, if, uh, Francis is thinking of these elements, the sun, the moon, the wind, the water death itself as the medium through whom he can praise or the cause on account of which you should praise or the or the agents.

Speaker 1:          00:29:20       And the Italian is very ambiguous boar. Uh, for those of you who may know a little French or a little Spanish, uh, four by through, uh, this is so there's a kind of extraordinary require an orchestration. The other thing that I should mention is that finally we can understand the rhetoric of praise that is running through this poem, but we also saw as a disc this, the describing the rhetoric of praise in Dante's Vita Nuova. When he finds out that the best way of writing about Beatrice is really trite, uh, uh, uh, praise poems, not actually which he distinguishes from flattery, but praise poems, the poems or praise means in many ways rejecting all sense of ownership. Realizing that, note the fact that one may know the world doesn't mean that one owns it. And also it means that not knowing Beatrice is not just a cover to wish to own her.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       So the praises as disinterested in this free and mode of a acknowledgment of Beatrice herself. Let's see how this continues. This whole, uh, uh, poetic vision of Francis continues with, uh, with canto 11. Dante goes on giving us the life of Francis and he catches fray. Frances England is in what I would call using the language of anthropology, really, Eh, liminal stage. You know what I mean by the liminal stage? There were liminal comes from the Latin a threshold or comes from the Latin for uh, limit the two words, many ways, very contradictory, but it, it has the power, uh, Lehman, uh, uh, is one thing, meaning meaning threshold but also the word or make also limit. Uh, so the threshold may be a limit and the threshold may also be an opportunity to cross a way of going over, I call it dentists use here.

Speaker 1:          00:31:26       He does use the word limit several times, not in this context. Dante places, uh, Francis in eliminate opposition. They, this would say between and between east two different orders on the one hand, the world. And on the other hand, some kind of a utopian idea that we never win, which would be the older he goes on to institute or some, uh, general vision. But what the world ought to be. He places Francis in between, uh, neither part of the world. No part of this final utopia. And let's see what he does in this liminal position. Uh, that's where he catches him. And look at this lines here. I'm still a youth. Uh, this is the biography of, of Francis are modeled on a number of biographies or where it existed at the time. Um, uh, foster youth, he ran into strife with his father for a lady to whom is to death.

Speaker 1:          00:32:27       None willingly unlocks the door, which is as extraordinarily difficult line to translate. The Italian really could be read to say, unlocks the door of pleasure, um, and before his spiritual court. And now he uses a Latin phrase, which is illegal formula and has the value of a legal formula golden pathway. They say he marries this woman. We don't know who she is yet in the presence of his own father that's giving legitimacy to his, um, his act, the act of marriage, um, uh, caught on potter. He was joined to her and then his fourth loved her better everyday. She bereft of her first husband Christ despise and obscure 1100 years and more remained without a suitor till he came. Not they did a veil when men heard that he was a, He who put all the world and fia found her a moved with a meatless at the sound of his voice.

Speaker 1:          00:33:30       No, there are very hard to have such courage and constants that were married, stayed below. She mounted the Cross with Christ, but less I proceed to darkly taking a Francis and poverty for this leverage. In all I have said, the harmony and happy looks movement who love and wonder and sweet contemplation and let them let them totally thoughts so that the venerable Bernard first went barefoot and when after the great peace, a running through himself too slow or welfare known and fruitful. Good. So, uh, there is clearly a reversal. A Francis Mayor is poverty and you're kind of that marriage to poverty. We have to understand what in a moment what that is. A lot of wealth. A lot of Richard's, uh, can be produced a clear, a clear turning of uh, uh, whatever intentions he may have had. Uh, and, and, uh, the great consequences of that act of is what is this representation of Francis?

Speaker 1:          00:34:30       Um, it's, I think in this liminal position, Frances is shown as he is turning upside down all the values that the world holds there. So, um, he wants to marry nothing, right? Poverty to marry, poverty's to Mary, nothing you, Mary to be, you want to use yoke yourself, you embrace owning nothing but that marriage or that union appears as a sacramental act. So he's making fun. He's parodying better. Just that we are a bit more is, I don't want to imply at all. And they blasted him here, but he's paddling even the sacrament of marriage he's marrying and nothing, it's not a legal person. Uh, some, some agent poverty, it's, it's just an idealization or an allegory for nothing. But that is conducted. That ceremony is conducted as if it were a sacramental act. Not only a sacramental act, he's in the law because he's marrying poverty in the presence of his father.

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       He undressed, he divests himself, all the clothes, which in the Middle Ages as much as now, oh Rustin, for some form of symbolic status, the way you, you know, you dress according to the job you want, they usually say, right, but at the se. But what I meant to say is that dresses, clothes are part of a social set of values, which Frances is flouting and patterning. We have, we are in the presence of the, of the Oba legal language, sacramental language, even the language of love. At one point, that language of sexuality, the idea of Marin poverty talk and does not, I change the, the, the, the translation of that phrase, the way Saint Clair, because it's a little bit our tortures even in Italian. Then we think clear, uh, uh, hesitant or he says, none willingly unlocks the door. That I'm willingly is the door of pleasure.

Speaker 1:          00:36:35       Even sexuality, which is certainly a value of the world. Francis will turn it around. This is a radical critique of the value system of the world. Call it a prophetic mode of a, of abandoning the, the, the idols of the world in favor of some kind of a utopia or unexpected Dora. And, uh, really, uh, not clarified, not very well described, uh, uh, uh, vision of how the world ought to be. But this is, he rejects all of us. So she bereft of her first husband caught pattern he was joined to for fourth. Loved her better everyday. She believed her first husband despise and obscure 1100 hundred years and more remain where to suitor till he came. No did a veil when men heard that he who put all the world in fear, found her a moved with a meatless at the sound of his voice.

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       No did avail ha to have such courage and constancy that well Mary stayed below. She poverty mounted on the Cross with Christ. Even she does something even better than what Mary does, but less they proceed to darkly taking a Francis and poverty for this lovers in our lives that their harmony and happy looks like. This is another pattern of the language drove of the, of the amorous discourse of medieval, medieval love poetry. Uh, uh, they go on, he just said he's dead limbs with nothing. So they have now finally an inclusion of an extraordinary known value because that's what poverty is. Something that questions whole values and it's, it's, it's a Franciscan idea of poverty. What do they mean by that? What did Francis mean by this? By this idea of poverty? What is the sport? First of all, you know, that the subject became part of an extensive, uh, uh, iconographic representation on what can think of, uh, uh, the jaw, tall frescoes, the cycles, a Franciscan cycles in a Cz, but, um, but all over Tuscany and Umbria, Umbria by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:38:48       So it's, uh, it's not a unique and a r two, Dante, Dante's understanding and Dante's insight, this sort of representation and fascination with Francis and other little detail that I should tell you is that Francis in Italian is Franchese schools, meaning that he's French. And there was the, like Francesca, ah, the other franchise and the other one who also understood a lot about love but lost her way. Uh, in, in, in Canto five, it really means free the word. In English, we have the word frank, which in many ways carries over the estimates of the Latin word Francisco's Francis true to his name is now as being poor, absolutely free. There's no bondage to anything. There's nothing that holds him to anything in the world. So this is one important, let's call it ethical extension of poverty, but what did they mean? What did the other Franciscans like Bonaventure was there listening to what appliances may say about, about the founder of his older.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       What did they understand by that? Because whenever we talk about in Dante's certainly seems to a stress, the idea of poverty being poverty in a very material bodily way called pauriol physical in the sense, I call it prophetic in the sense that as you know, what distinguishes the, the, the biblical prophets from other profits is that they usually shoes to bear on their flesh. The signs that they oughta against the world. If they want to speak about the, the, the infidelity of, uh, of Israel, they would marry a prostitute. If they want to denounce the, uh, dissidents Harris's and lacerations within the, the body politic of Israel, they would even go on cutting off an arm of their stool to dramatize own the flesh. This idea of, uh, uh, this prophetic pronouncements that were making, this is part of what Francis then is doing here and this idea that he's living poverty.

Speaker 1:          00:40:59       It's not just an allegory is an allegorical representation. It is something live in the flesh. The literal India Lego Richele are now compressed, but it's more what did, what is, but what does, for instance, uh, Bonaventure think of what poverty is. Dante, I repeat things about the material, the of poverty. So we way of opposing average a way of opposing, uh, uh, practicality, attachment or contempt for the, the, the values. We have seen that all of that before. The poverty to them also means poverty of language. Francis, the first one tool to have articulated even that poem of his repetitive, the same simple formulaic, uh, expressions, praise be omnipotent, et cetera. Road that says, ah, repeated that it's a poverty of language. The poverty of our thoughts that which Dante at the beginning of Canto 11 has been calling the defective. But that is the word that I, I, I did not stress when we were up.

Speaker 1:          00:42:06       Uh, oh, um, intensive care of maltose. How, uh, vein our reasonings. No, no, no. How defective the, the, the Italian originals is how defective. I hope some translators pickup defective and make it a and say that it's the fact defective in the idea that they are lacking, that they, they have nothing of their own so that retrospectively you can understand what I'm talking about. That we cannot own the world. That this is a, that the world is a world of gifts, uh, that, uh, that, uh, the economy is an economy of giving, a constant giving because the more you give and the less you have of yourself, the more you are free and they're more productive. Your own acts can become as well the case of Francis, that this is no role that Dante we'll do with a Francis. This is now, um, there is one, a little reference that I want to mention.

Speaker 1:          00:43:09       This is around lines 102. Um, or saw a friend's is a, we'll go on, uh, trying to have this, um, um, to receive a seal of approval from the pope's about the fraternity, the older, the confraternity, whatever that he organized when the comparable poor brothers increased behind him. Who's wondrous life where better song in Heaven's glory. The holy purpose of this. Chief Shepard was encircled with a second crown. But the eternal spirit through our Norris on Oreos agrees that pope or no worries agrees to to recognize this new order. And now listen to this. That's really the point that I, that I want to stop on for a while. And when in thirst for martyrdom, he had preached Christ and them that followed him in the proud presence of the salted and finding the people and ripe for conversion and not being willing to remain for search for no purpose.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       He had returned to the harvest of the Italian fields. They are on the rough crag between Tibor and Darren. He received from Christ the last seal, which is members both for two years. He's alluding to the famous story of the Stigmata that Francis received. The body becomes a sign. Uh, what I was, I was trying to explain with the reference to the Hebrew prophets who, uh, dramatize they are the [inaudible] and legitimize the validity of the message by an inscription of that message on the literal, um, the physicality of their own flesh. And the tied to live with that, that point though, that Dante is making this, this story of the Stigmata, but it's also the story of Francis who tries to go and preach to the salted, he fails the heaven, the theological argument, uh, and the tool, the sultan and Francis Depart, um, uh, each, uh, on, on his wife, on his way.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       Uh, and, and that's it. It's a story of that can be understood apparently is a failure of Francis' message you. But at the same time, it is an extraordinary hermeneutical term that has taken place in Dante's thinking. We have had and we will have a celebration to the Crusades. Now we have an, a story of an encounter between Christians and Muslims in terms of peaceful language, peaceful speech where the two exponents or two of the exponents of the particular beliefs can come together and encounter. And they can discuss the salt and says no. Um, for him you are not ripe and for the salt and progress as well, then you know what you're talking about. And uh, and they, and they leave. Okay. So this is an extraordinary change in, uh, the, uh, dissemination in the dissemination of violence that had been at the center of so much theological discourse and he had, Dante seems to be a opting in, following trends is on a different route.

Speaker 1:          00:46:30       This is I think, an important change in, uh, in the consciousness and the historic understanding of the relationship between Christians and Muslims and other interpretations of the Crusade. But there is a further detail that I want to mention here. Um, uh, the, the detail is this detail about our two geographic coordinates in this cancer. Now we have just read about Frances trip to Egypt and the salt, right a little earlier, Dan, to give the ref refers to the birthplace of Francis by talking about the Ganges. Okay. So, in other words, Dante has is aware that there is a European world that we talked about last time, but there are two other, two other coordinates, one a Hindu world of the Ganges and we shall see what that means for him. And the other one is the most of them world of the salt. Him. He's acknowledging in many ways that which was, it's, we probably may not be entirely familiar with this, uh, this problem.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       He's acknowledging that which, uh, the, uh, someone like Bonaventure had been discussing in 1273 Bonaventure the men that we shall see next in the next Canto traveled to Paris to give a number of lectures at the University of Paris. He will die a year later in 1274 and they're called, uh, uh, uh, conferences and number of conferences, uh, uh, in which he just debates the question of the relationship between what he calls the, these three cultures, Hindu, the Christian and the Muslim and ties to see in what way they can be harmonized. He connect, it's Bonaventure connects the Hindu religion with George [inaudible] in the sense that the joke him of the third age, not complicated at all. You remember the joke him has this paradigm of history are according to a tripartite structure, the age of the heft of the father, the son and the spirit. The third age, which is his own age, the age wouldn't burn eventual lives when Dante lives is the age of the spirit, implies the elimination of all institutions.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       The idea that the spirit now is everywhere and there is no need for any hierarchy. Any Bonaventure says, this is exactly the world of the Hindus who believe that God is everywhere. And then he goes on talking about, he Bonaventure talks about that Muslims for who, who, whose theology is a theology of uh, uh, Eh, an impassable distance between God. Transcendence that nothing could really bridge between a god who remains invisible and the world of every man here. Of course for him, the mediation between the two is given by the, by Christianity because with, with the idea of the reset transcendence and at the same time an imminence of God and the transcendence of God, Dante is I think, echoing this texts and this problems in the Canto of Francis. So he praises Francis between the Ganges and Egypt and praises him as the one who is a carving, a new space, the space that he calls that have poverty, meaning freedom, meaning the will meaning the way of love, uh, as a way of coming to the knowledge of God.

Speaker 1:          00:50:16       Um, then, uh, um, I would like to move on to, uh, very briefly to canter 12 briefly, not because I ima not, uh, uh, I'm insensitive to what, uh, what Dante we'll do with Dominic and cantor. 12. We really haven't got time, but I want to mention to you a number of things. Uh, how, uh, the encounter with the Bonaventure, uh, told, uh, we're, I'm sorry, the encounter with, uh, with the description of Dominic told by, uh, by Bonaventure, uh, really rewrites the previous Canto there in the previous can't have a friends is where the marriage, uh, periodic, uh, kind of, uh, uh, uh, an archaic idea of, uh, uh, the valueless ness of all the world that he values a here though we have a different wedding, a different marriage between, uh, Dominic and faith between knowledge and theology. If you want to put it at a very generic and general level, uh, and he, uh, to, uh, that is the, let me just go over with, um, uh, lines and 45 in that part.

Speaker 1:          00:51:40       Let's say it'd be the description of the legend of Dominic, that life of Dominic in that part, we're sweet. Zephyr rises to open the new leaves in which Europe, once again, see how dentists, there's a kind of continental, uh, imagination here, the, the Asia, Africa, and uh, in Europe, the three continents in which Europe sees herself reclad. Um, not far from the beating of the waves behind which the son after his long flights sometimes hides himself from more men lies. Favorite color. Hora uh, you love this detail. I know that I can tell by the way the, the, the, the eyes of some of you smile when I pointed this, this, uh, this thing, Dante's talking about the birthplace of, uh, of, uh, of Dominic and places, which is where it was in the, uh, western part of Spain. They are where the sunsets. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       So the Dominic becomes the counter to Francis. He was born with the sunrises and now, uh, Dominic is within with the sunsets. Okay. So between the two of them, the whole movement of the sun, the trans slash CEO, that translational faith, not the translation of empires, not the translation of cultural translation of faith seems to be encompassed between the two of them. But that which will make you smile is that Dante mentioned. Uh, and you can check Francis birth in the east where the sunrises and line 50 of Cantwell 11, and he mentions the setting sun of Dominic in line 52 of a canter 12 as emphasis. There is a kind of me, there's a, uh, the, the, this is, this is a kind of rule. I think it's, uh, it's, I've had a bit of music touch between them. So uh, uh, talk to account for the, the, the difference in proximity between the two as if this movement.

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       So here's a kind of, the movement of the sun from east to west on account of them has its own, uh, quickness. It's own rhythm. Um, okay. Um, and then in it was born the loving Leachman of the Christian faith, the holy athlete Greicius to his own and Peter is two enemies and he's in his mind as soon as it was created, was so full of living power than his mother's womb. It made her prophetic when the spousal between him and faith were completed at the holy fond. Here there is another marriage ceremony that counters the previous marriage ceremony Motivo Canto of Canto 11. But I want to draw your attention to the use of this playful images, the athletes of of faith, the Leachman. In the previous candle we had a Francis who I said, pat of this or the values of the world is cold and that that has really become a formula to describe both Francis and less Dominic though they are the so called I give it to you in Latin and translate it in English.

Speaker 1:          00:54:50       We call them the clowns of the Lord your clitoris. They are the clowns do plethora's low money, uh, uh, uh, the counsel of the Lord of this to say they're playing, they're playing at the world, the play with the world. They bring in a, or we could call a perspective of play in the world. They are making fun of the world. They are challenging the values of the world and in this sense they bring out that which becomes the most impressive aspect of their theology, which is that of a playful theology. We'll talk more about this. The notion that God plays the creation itself is a spectacle. I call it a field drama. The idea that God is not, it's, it doesn't, it doesn't deprive the divinity of its seriousness, but makes that citizens part of a world of joy. That's the, that's the whole, the aesthetics, the new aesthetics that, uh, Francis managers to release.

Speaker 1:          00:55:55       And Dominic managers also too. It's kind of playful idea of the world, a comedy I or not. I tried to explain to you from the very first day when we got together how complicated was for me at the time to explain why Dante causes texts the comedy versus saw sublime. It seems to be, it's talking about how the ordinary, a plain man of the year, around the year, 1300 managers have the most sublime of experiences. And I said, yes, of course. This is about the happy ending because comedy at all was the genre of happy ending. It is about the low level of experiences, about the vulgar language and until users, but the real and substantial reason for, uh, Dante calling his poem a comedy and for the readers using the attributes of divine was exactly. It's exactly that, a way of responding to these, uh, uh, sense of, uh, the joyful quality of creation.

Speaker 1:          00:56:55       That's, that's the point. So for all the series, for all the horror that we have been witnessing through hell and purgatory, joy seems to be that were told which Dante is moving, nor a tragic vision. Plus once you play off, once you think of play, you can no longer have the tragic vision because you understand that the tragic vision is part of something larger. It is, it is, it is part, it's a vicissitudes, you know, comedies and tragedies. Elledge allergies are all linked to the wheel of fortune in medieval iconology you keep going around, but they are all part of something really larger, which is this playful theologies [inaudible] ludicrous, uh, that, uh, that he has been incompetent, uh, that has been preparing for us. Let me just go on with, uh, a few more. Uh, uh, the, the, uh, a few more details here, a couple of minutes and then, uh, uh, this relationship now of, uh, um, the, the, the other issue that, uh, really and retrospectively, another issue that Dante is raising, let me just talk about this, uh, in the cantor of Dominic, much more than he did in the Canto of Francis.

Speaker 1:          00:58:14       This is really unique. It is Eric presentation in terms of language. It is a safe whatever orthodoxy Dominic stents for because that's why what the Dominicans, the Dominicans were the intellectual arm of the church. There were, as I said, founded with a specific purpose of entering the universities and debating the various points of view. There were the Aristotelian, so they were the poets that were traditionally the troublemakers of, of the, where the, the, the, the, the, uh, the figures, the, the philosophers and so on. Uh, and especially in Paris, that's the, the, the, the university. Uh, so those are, there is an idea of orthodoxy with Dominic and yet here, the whole representation takes place in, it takes place in terms of language and they didn't give you a couple of example examples, uh, around lines 80 many time his nurse found him silent in the week on the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:59:16       This is part of this, allow that CEO this and you'll now of a, of, of Dominic as if he said for this and my calm, oh, father of him, Felicia Felix, indeed or mother of him. Giovan indeed if interpreted it means what they say. Dante's playing with etymologist here or the father is really happy. There is a relationship between the name and his State of mind and the mother is meaning God, the one who is full of grace. Jovana the one who comes before, uh, uh, is also if you interpreted properly this to say orthodoxy or heresy.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       pink. It's, it's, it's flip side, right? Head his head north. It could've been talking about a seizure of frog broadband's head. I say, we've been talking about Joe Kim's all hell is he? He appears as a question of language, as a question of what a normal Duh that is above all a grammatical older and therefore it needs a kind of correction or has a kind of ambiguity that you always assume and your is presumed to be present within the order of language. Anything. In fact, retrospectively I can say to you that even the schisms of inferno where we saw the poet bedtime Thunderball born, you remember that horrifying picture of the poet who holds in his own hand, like a lamb, his own head and goes home talking to the, the Virgil and, and Dante. Or in that same canto there was the, the presence of Mohammad who's body seem to be completely lacerated. Even the schisms are questions of language. Our questions, Dante understands them is issues of language which doesn't vote, which only means this to talk about language and repeat. They are part of the imponderable quality of language, the ambiguities of language, the force of language and the power of language. Okay, so that's uh, that's what I can tell you about this cantors. And let me stop here and see if there are questions that I would most gladly here if not answer. But, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:01:39       wow. Please face to any threat from the church came in paradise.

Speaker 1:          01:01:57       The question is, would Dante have faced some censorship probably, uh, from, uh, from the Church authorities for placing Joel came in paradise? Actually, no, not at all. Because the formula he uses a, here comes the Calabrian Breon Abbott, Joe Kim endow that with the gift of prophecy, more or less. That's, see, that's translation. It translates their Latin formula, the spirit to profit, ethical to tattoo, which was would already used. He had been jogging, had already been exempted of, uh, the censure of his thought that are Bonaventure had voiced. And in, uh, in the mass in honor of [inaudible], they will use that formula. So he's actually using economical a formula church formula, uh, for his own, for Joe Gibbs on, uh, uh, never happened. He's not saying, never was I saying, but what Dante probably of that's what he did is he should be canonized. Ah, okay. No. But the answer is, uh, and that's the reason why, um, he could not have faced any, um, any reprimands.

Speaker 3:          01:03:18       Yes. With Saint Francis and forensics as a form of freedom when you went to freedom is Ernesto, when you went and harmony, it becomes more free. Can we make that or how can we link his own poverty and how are we supposed to be thinking about Dante having to depend on, I guess the charity of others?

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       Um, the good the question is, I was talking about poverty as being a state of freedom. Um, uh, in the Canto of France's, uh, would I, we're supposed to also, uh, associate Dante's own fate of poor exile beggar that he was during his exile in that description. That's, that's the question. And I would say yes, of course. The, uh, poverty, I hope I explained mean several things for, for Dante born, eventual going thinking about poverty of language over till philosophy, uh, et cetera. But all of them understand poverty in a very literal way. But all of them understand the one thing that this kind of poverty is really a description of the human condition to begin with. We are all poor. That's the primary sense. We are all born or defective and it need wherever needs, where some of us gone being needy or, and we are all our lives, right?

Speaker 1:          01:04:52       So this is a general understanding of the idea of poverty. But then there is a sort of, uh, the other side of this and the other side is that it's actually a blessing because it's the state of freedom. This is really very much like what you expect, the philosophical, philosophical freedom, you know, without any cares, even Horace, I don't want to have wealth and, and start worrying about having the cares about how the stock market is doing today are not doing. Um, so I want to be completely free of that. And it's a state of freedom. It's downhill. So thinking about himself, does it have a consolatory note for him to believe that after all I'm not alone? Yes, yes. I would say, uh, that's, that's the case in his own life. Dante, unlike Petrarch who really die, the poet who follows few years after Dante, he did, he died one of the wealthiest man of his time by virtue of being a poet, a writer, and so on. Dante never got to that point.

Speaker 3:          01:05:56       I mean, I'm wondering if we should take it literally it's sort of, you know, things about poverty or is it more like a, an ideal, like a sort of poetic escape into a perspective, I guess that he adopts, like adopting the perspective,

Speaker 1:          01:06:09       should we take it literally or is, or just as a poetic way of speaking? Uh, I think that I answered that by saying, but I think you're asking something else may be, and then I'll get to that. Since you are the, uh, I think I'm, as I'm saying that this is, was really the reality of his life.

Speaker 2:          01:06:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:28       A standard such as that is bound to a peer maybe. Well, you know, you need a little bit of comfort and consolation and so you say it's a poverty, but it's, it's, it really has the crisp of a Francis spirituality. But I'm not trying to diminish Dante's convictions. What I think you're really asking is, I don't know if you really ask you, I don't know. Uh, but, uh, I know what you would ask him, but I, that is another side to your question. Are you asking me whether or not he was a Franciscan for instance? Is that what you're asking? Because if you are, that would be a very good question in the sense that they were a lot of uh, ideas. We don't have any evidence, but a lot of ideas that he became a member of the third older [inaudible] Francisco's so that he practiced therefore truly, literally in his own life that which Francis himself had a practice and preached. So maybe that's what probably if you weren't asking that, maybe you should've been asking that and that would have been, I would have to say that. And the question. So I have a few minutes. So yes.

Speaker 3:          01:07:51       Is this story of the sultan, those two guys,

Speaker 2:          01:07:56       are you have Dante religion or Islam that we took away from the Freddo?

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       Ah, that's a very good question. It's the view of a friends is going to the sultan a suppose. Is it meant to revise, uh, the view that we may have, uh, uh, formed of Dante's attitude toward Islam, reading in Fat and Fennel 28? Um, I think so. I think so. I think my answer is that I, that's why I was stressing this, that there is a sort of, uh, uh, a radical turning that takes place in Francis operates a change in the way the Christians and the Muslims can go on, uh, uh, thinking of that encounter. It's no longer through armies if it's through peaceful discourse from this point of view. Francis, uh, uh, care result on a traditional had started with, uh, Peter the venerable, uh, there were a few other theologians who had a kind of view that it was not through two wars.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       That this, uh, kind of, uh, of a, of a dialogue, um, could take place if a war is a form of dialogue. I'm not sure. Of course the, uh, so Dan has acknowledges that in Francis, and I think that he dramatizes it, he justice dramatizing the sense of the, uh, the awareness, which was very central to Bonaventure of, uh, the relationship with the three to him, the three religions, the Hindus, the Christians and the Muslims. Um, and, and retrospectively, it forced me to now say things about schism that I did not say when we were reading Canto 28 that schism, we have a presence there of, you remember all forms of [inaudible]. We have a religious case, ma, uh, with, uh, Fryer, uh, who decides who is really enjoy kissed. By the way, uh, the Chino, there was a the poet who by the power of his words, a thunderbolt of the province.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       Our poet divides father from son the king, the king from the sun, and therefore breaks the unity of the body politic. The idea that, you know, the king's two bodies in the famous formula of the book of the Great Historian Canter, Oh, aerobics, right? So that he broke that kind of unity. There is then an allusion to a story from Lucan. Uh, one of the soldiers, cool real, who broke away from, uh, from Pohnpei and he had from Caesar and he had his own tongue cut. It's clear that schism is to be understood linguistically. I am, I'm, I am not revising my view, but now I can tell you what I always thought was, uh, underlying the representation of even Islam, which means that even the interpretation of Mohammed in 28, horrifying though it as, as, as, as it is, it appears if Mohammed was the one who was doubling the existing unity, that's it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:20       That's it. Through the power of speech. That's, that's the jewel. It's a horrifying representation that does not take anything away from that. But clearly you see that the damnedest understanding of these issues is a little bit more nuanced that it made for s side. A foresight appear when we come later in the heaven of justice. And before we get to heaven with justice. Dentist goes on talking about the warrior, and he begins with Joshua the, the, the, the, the, the hero who brings about the destruction of Jericho. Uh, etc. And then, but he also mentions the crusaders. Uh, so there is a kind of, uh, ambiguity that I would say that he, he still values what he thinks is the heroic life. Nonetheless, after I say this, let me just state another poet about Dante. That's true. That clearly he's talking from a Christian standpoint. There's no question about this, but the underlying spirituality of Dante is what I call the spirituality of the desert. Dante's truly the poet of the desert in the sense that in the desert you have modes of request that where everyone is really going because whatever we are going, we are always going to the absolute whatever journey we may take. Its whole is the same journey. And so the spirituality of the quest sort of, I wouldn't say overhauls, but at least tempers, this idea of Dante being so strict and firm in this universe of degrees and distinctions that he sets up. I don't know if I clarified this for you. Okay. Thank you so much.
