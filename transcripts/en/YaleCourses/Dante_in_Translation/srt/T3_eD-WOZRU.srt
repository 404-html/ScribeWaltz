1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,690
I the allies that we read from
assignment to assignment and part two,

2
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:12,270
because we read in a very selective way.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,380
I know that a lot of gaps in
the, in the, in our readings,

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,160
I never really have tried to
share with you the idea that,

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,870
that he's align and now that they've line
their conceptual line running through

6
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:32,670
the poem, the candles,
I looked discreet units,

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,610
poetic units,
uh,

8
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:38,500
without much relationship worthy.

9
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:43,630
The links are to be found symmetrically
maybe with Qantas fall apart from the

10
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:48,810
cancers that we're, we, we,
we are reading. I think that
there is a continuity, uh,

11
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:53,550
going through or through many
of them and there is no data.

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,920
For instance,
between the cantos 15,

13
00:00:55,921 --> 00:01:00,921
16 and 17 of paradise we read
last time and Kansas of 17,

14
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:03,750
18 and 19.

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,140
That is actually a thematic expansion of
some of the issues that Dante racers in

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,770
the heaven of Mars, um, to begin with.

17
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,950
Cancer 77, 18, uh,

18
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,130
Dante in Canto 18 is still in the having
of marsh and he meets and he lists,

19
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,680
I know that I did not, the number does
not appear in your, in your syllabus,

20
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:36,680
but you know, uh, just bear with me
so that I can, I can, uh, go home.

21
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,760
We decide this. And he just
lists the number of, uh,

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,240
a warrior souls who are Wa figures,

23
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,100
heroic figures, the heroic lives, uh,

24
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,260
very much like catcher Weda himself who
appears is one of the blessed from lines

25
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:57,390
forward.
In following of Canto 18,

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,530
he mentions he sees and he mentioned,

27
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,190
uh,
Joshua Biblical figures,

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,620
Joshua and Judah Maccabee years.

29
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,900
And then he goes on a
mentoring medieval figures. Uh,

30
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,820
Charlemagne. There's clearly
he's justifying retrospectively,

31
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,050
uh,

32
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,050
the whole issue of the Crusades to
which catch a weeder took part in,

33
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,750
which can really be brought
back to Charlotte mains, uh,

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,890
experience in France and in
Spain against them. Awesome.

35
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:37,080
So he mentions it lists a
Charlemagne and of course his power.

36
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:38,400
Then the great,

37
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,430
the so called the Achilles like
invulnerable Roland who however dies at

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,190
[inaudible],

39
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,270
which is a the side of the war
between Muslims and Christians.

40
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,330
And he dies because of the Hubris
that characterizes his wife,

41
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,000
uh, the Hubris of not wanting to blow, uh,

42
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,130
the bugle that it would be
heard by Charlemagne and
Charlemagne could have come

43
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:09,610
to his rescue,
as I have probably said before,

44
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,940
that became in the western imagination
and most traumatic experience,

45
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,610
a traumatic experience
because it showed the, uh,

46
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:25,510
that the myth of invincibility
of the Christian,

47
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:30,511
of Christian real Christian Europe
was simply that an illusion,

48
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,240
uh, to be turned into rubble
by the invading of Victoria Sa,

49
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,710
uh,
Christian armies.

50
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,100
And then he goes on mentioning the
figures of the second crusade, uh,

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,800
1109, the Godfrey of Bujo. Uh, and, uh,

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,630
I figure a Norman who defeated
actually that Muslims in Sicily,

53
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,180
uh,

54
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,120
the discard Robert this word and
brought about in the early 19th century,

55
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,650
in the late ninth century, has about 75
years. The Muslims were there. The, the,

56
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,730
the expulsion of the Muslims from,
from Sicily.

57
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,560
Uh,
so we,

58
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,610
we clear thematic thread
between the previous cancers.

59
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,870
And this can too is the question
of what is a heroic life.

60
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,640
And the heroic life can even involve a
defeat as in the case of Roland it in

61
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,120
price, however heroic life
clearly low that he said,

62
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:33,121
typology that runs from
Joshua's defeat of uh,

63
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,110
and, and seizure of the, of
Jericho. You know, this is
the great, the, the, the, the,

64
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:43,111
the epic Biblical story to
whiskered contemporary history,

65
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,070
almost contemporary history for,
for Dante, it implies really,

66
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,540
uh, uh, division. It
implies a heroic life,

67
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,350
which is the, they, the,

68
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:00,410
the power to establish
a and live for a cause,

69
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,310
which is going to be
for Dante to just coast.

70
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,960
But it's a cost that brings
about divisions. So it's not, uh,

71
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,210
a heroic figure is not necessarily a
figure that would unify a and cut across,

72
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,200
uh, barriers and, and
individuals on the contrary.

73
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,630
But Dante's indicating
that it's supposed to, the,

74
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,470
there is a possible
heroic life on, to, uh,

75
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,050
a giving of oneself to a cause
much larger than consults.

76
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,230
We could just leave it at that. Okay.
Uh, and we'll come back to this, uh,

77
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,670
this issue in a moment. What I would
stress and in, in, in a few minutes,

78
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,850
what would stress though
about this particular, um,

79
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,880
particular scene is that Dante
is really a way of divisions,

80
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,330
a Whir of divisions, aware of
the need even to separate, uh,

81
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:55,950
what is mine from what is not mine,
what is hours from [inaudible]. So it's,

82
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,190
it would seem, he seems,
will be perpetuating

83
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,580
a myth that's, uh, uh,

84
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:06,581
that or an idea that some might find it
objectionable that indeed the separation

85
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,880
is dangerous and it's
in itself caused by war.

86
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,120
And the cause of wars,
you know, this is the,

87
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:17,450
the objection to this, uh, this problem.

88
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,630
It's not the only time that Dante
is a establishing divisions.

89
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,060
When, when I've been talking, uh, uh,

90
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,010
over the past few weeks
about, for instance, uh,

91
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,050
divisions and boundaries that Dante
establishes even when talking about

92
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:40,160
continents, you remember that,
uh, in Canto six of paradise,

93
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,550
uh, when there's the story of
the Eagle of the Roman Empire,

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
a dentist goes on talking
about the periphery of Europe
where the Justinian and

95
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:53,640
the bird of the empire had
Nestle's, uh, the east,

96
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,140
the eastern part of the empire
that was the periphery of Europe.

97
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,520
And we have been talking about
the, the whole, uh, how in, in,

98
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,990
in Canto 12 of,
uh,

99
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,530
of paradise meeting, uh, Dominic, uh, uh,

100
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,100
Saint Dominic Dante talks
about the western part of
Europe and goes out of their

101
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:16,640
way to mention this already.
So they are always divisions.

102
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,800
There are always barriers.

103
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,300
He seems to believe that
Rome and the history of Rome,

104
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,533
uh,

105
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,570
really escapes this logic of
separation and then affect this.

106
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:34,420
I know that I mentioned to you in
a Monarchia that political tract,

107
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,210
he writes,

108
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,210
he fast stress the fact that nes
is really enrollment and not,

109
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,210
for instance, he cannot really
be thought of as a nation,

110
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,540
which he was Norgen he be
thought of as a European.

111
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,370
And he stresses the fact
that he has a kind of, some,

112
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,230
there's a sort of a
universalizing history in him,

113
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:59,231
a universalizing impulse in the measure
in which he may read three women from

114
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:03,290
three different continents
craves from Asia,

115
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,480
Dido from Africa, and Levenia from, uh,

116
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,230
from Europe. So he does distinguish
between a kind of, sort of, uh,

117
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,360
the history that transcends barriers,

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,620
but also an idea which is really
heroic here of a over history,

119
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:21,710
that manager,
what keeps barriers that this,

120
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:26,230
that these are people who fought at
the Crusades. This is the, the, the,

121
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,020
the many of them. So certainly not
Joshua and Judah Maccabee use, but, uh,

122
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,810
Charlemagne nor the Crusades, but against
them. I was on a Roland, uh, but, uh,

123
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,640
Godfrey of your and so on.

124
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:40,940
And we'll see what the
consequences of this may be.

125
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:45,350
Now another conceptual thread. I'm,
I'm really going around two or three.

126
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,250
Uh, I think I'm keeping two,
three themes in my head now,

127
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:54,290
another conceptual threads
between 17, uh, and uh,

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,980
and the,
and the remaining

129
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,760
part of a 18, 19, and, uh, 18, 19 and 20,

130
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,920
which is the heaven of Jupiter,
uh,

131
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,310
is the question of a very abstract
question. I've done tasks.

132
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,490
What is a place?

133
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,440
And that was the underlying
problem in [inaudible] 15, 16,

134
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:15,540
and 17 and 15,

135
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:20,541
90 twice to determine whether his history
could be reduced to the boundaries of

136
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:26,541
his own native town and decides that
that was no longer possible for him to

137
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,530
conceive. Uh, the famous chronicles, he,

138
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,190
he tries to figure out, uh, uh,

139
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,410
where exactly he can be in the history of,
uh,

140
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,680
in the midst of Florence himself.

141
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,890
It's a itself and decides
that he is an exile.

142
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,890
That was the final prophecy of culture.
Weeder.

143
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,030
Exile is a word that it
means it's Latin word, uh,

144
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,180
in Italian and or in English it
comes to being out of one's own soil.

145
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,880
That's what the meaning is.
So that in the Middle Ages,

146
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,600
they never really thought of.
Exilis is just a spiritual condition.

147
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,980
There's to say, I feel
this located, I am, uh, my,

148
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,720
my personal existential predicament.
Is that a feeling up,

149
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,690
I'm out of it,
that I don't belong or that kind of,

150
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,060
that was not the
conventional understanding.

151
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,270
Dante changes this meaning of exile in
making it into a spiritual condition.

152
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,290
It's the condition of,

153
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,730
it's the precondition for his
writing poetry to begin with.

154
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:34,210
So that poetry and exile
seem to be, uh, going, uh,

155
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,060
going to here in 18, the real issue
that he raises is what is it place?

156
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,560
Okay, I am an exile. I do not belong
anywhere. Uh, what is it, what, what,

157
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,910
how do we understand here? And
how do we understand their, uh,

158
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:52,500
what does it mean? What are these terms?
What, what, what? Um, at any rate,

159
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:57,501
so he starts and he enters now and two
can talk with the remaining part of the

160
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:58,920
Ken to 18.

161
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,150
He enters into the heaven of
Jupiter having a white light,

162
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,250
which he links with geometry.

163
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,000
You know what a geometry is a science,

164
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,220
very complex science.

165
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,780
It encompasses what it means is
the measurement of the earth.

166
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,590
Uh, it's the whole worth that you
want can measure with medieval,

167
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:27,540
medieval George's. It means, it implies
the presence of perspective within it.

168
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,771
Uh,

169
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,771
with the idea that a geometry is what
regulates the idea of space and the,

170
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:38,120
the, uh, arrangement of space. It,

171
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,100
it implies altimetry,

172
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,760
it implies the measurement
of the depth and so on. Uh,

173
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,310
it is,
as you know,

174
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,180
traditionally linked to ethics.

175
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,240
It's has a profound intimate linkage with
ethics because for the simple reason,

176
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,640
well, uh, when done to discuss this
justice for instance, in Cantos,

177
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,290
uh, in, in, in Fab, no, he distinguishes
between a distributive justice.

178
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,450
You remember in federal seven,
the,

179
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,670
the goddess for tuna who
manages to distribute a,

180
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,180
with some idea of him of,
of impenetrable or Colt equity,

181
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:18,730
a cold justice,
the goods of the earth,

182
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,490
or she's blind folded and uh,
uh,

183
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,550
moves the wheel around the, so that can
be some kind of a uniform. If you are up,

184
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,210
you're not going to be up all the
time, you may be down, et cetera.

185
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:35,530
And if you are down, you
eventually, if you are on the
shift, the curve of fortune,

186
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,660
you are going to be up.
It's a sort of, uh, uh,

187
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,480
other theoretical notion
of equity. You know, if you
have, sometimes you have five,

188
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:47,730
then you lose three and you get to
have to whoever has one we'll get to et

189
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,310
cetera. The other form of justice
was also geometric justice,

190
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,520
which tend to describes in the so called
rule of the counterpart counter passion

191
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,670
in the country pass. So in fair, no, 28,

192
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:04,840
when he has to establish the relationship
between crime and punishment,

193
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,170
it could not be an even
one, you know, one and one.

194
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,920
You cannot park someone's high
because someone has pluck your eye.

195
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,990
That's not necessarily justice.

196
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,170
You cannot cut someone's arm off because
you have a perpetrated that crime or

197
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:21,250
kill be killed because he
has to have been killed.

198
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,460
There should be some kind of
proportionality, uh, the arguments.

199
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:29,470
So the idea is the geometry is
always part geometry. In fact, uh,

200
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,590
uh, uh, the, the is, is, uh, is,

201
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,760
is related to ethics
simply because it's a, uh,

202
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,450
it's extension always implies a point,

203
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,640
which is the beginning of a geometric

204
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,230
reflection always implies the
existence of other points.

205
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:54,610
It establishes relations. Therefore,
that's a, that's the language. So,

206
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,410
or in this candle, Dante
discusses primarily justice. Okay?

207
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:02,680
What is justice?
That's the idea that runs through this.

208
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,350
The other thing that you have
to be as you read this cantors,

209
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:07,930
and I hope you read them with care,
um,

210
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,760
and I will not say much
about it, is that, uh, uh,

211
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,620
he deployed Dante deploys
the language of geometry.

212
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,960
Now,
you know that this is a technique of his,

213
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:23,950
if he were dealing with the arithmetic,
he, we'll do a music who will do that.

214
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,380
But I just want to give you a few,
a few words,

215
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,630
samples of, uh, of this.
Uh, uh, this, this is yours.

216
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:35,500
For instance, uh, uh, just
letting me open here in, uh, uh,

217
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:40,120
the notion of a god, the
geometer for the, uh,

218
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,980
he will go on, uh, uh, talking,
for instance, this is in, uh, uh,

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,590
can tall, uh, 19, uh,

220
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,660
uh, Canto 19, um,

221
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,960
anywhere really like [inaudible] look
at this, uh, uh, the primer will,

222
00:14:58,961 --> 00:15:02,240
which is self good from itself.
The supreme good neighbor was moved,

223
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:07,130
whatever a with it is in that measure,
just the language of measure,

224
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:12,170
no created good draws it to itself,
but rain fourth ray,

225
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,850
which in Italian is both radius.
It's the ray of sunlight,

226
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,880
but also the radius of a circle are,

227
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:24,380
creates a good as the stoke circles.
There it goes. Even the, the,

228
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,410
the various shapes,
circles over the nest.

229
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,420
And then a little bit further down
wheeling it, sank then spoke cetera.

230
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,610
Wheeling again,
circular,

231
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,910
a circular motion. And, uh, and,

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,240
and, and this continues, a literary
continues throughout the, I want to,

233
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:49,280
to find for you the image of, um, uh, the,

234
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,390
uh, the image of, uh, of, of,

235
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:58,100
of the compacts that, uh, I
thought it was in Canton 19. I,

236
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,960
it's not. So I, we'll, we'll
get to that. We'll find it.
So the number of this, uh, uh,

237
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,950
this, uh, uh, geometrical terms. However,

238
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,550
the most important thing here in Kendall
19 is that as soon as he enters the

239
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,440
heaven of geometry,

240
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,210
now we encounter in the,
I'm sorry,

241
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:24,440
in Canto 18, he, we, we,
we come across a play,

242
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,800
a divine spectacle. It's,
it's, it's all 12. Uh,

243
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,850
uh,

244
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,850
the heavens are a sacred theater where
God will go on speaking to human beings

245
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:41,630
by using to us on earth by,
uh,

246
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,260
by using the souls of the
blessed. This is, uh, um,

247
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,200
uh, this is the, the,

248
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,100
the passage I saw lion canto 18,
nine, seven and following us.

249
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,080
So in the torch of Jove,
the sparkling of love,

250
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:00,650
that was their trays out.
Our speech to my eyes.

251
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,210
And this birds reason from a river
bank is if rejoicing together over the

252
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:09,650
pasture make of themselves
now around flock.

253
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,890
That's a geometric image for you.
Now another shape.

254
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,790
So within the lightly lights,
holy creatures,

255
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,390
we're singing is the fluid
made themselves in the figure,

256
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,000
the figures they formed.

257
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,710
Now d now I know l first singing,

258
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:29,240
they moved to their own notes,

259
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:34,241
then becoming one of these shapes that
posts for a rental and were silent.

260
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,580
Um, within the, the,
the having a majority,

261
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,440
even the letters of the alphabet,
Joe Geometrical lines,

262
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:46,190
the same circle of the, uh, the two, uh,

263
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,970
the perpendicular line of the l and
the perpendicular line of the eye.

264
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,350
They'll do. We are, we are,

265
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,530
we really discover that the beauty of
geometry underlies the rigor of the

266
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,260
alphabet,
so to speak about more importantly,

267
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,270
we discovered that this souls that
disposed themselves in letters. I really,

268
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,400
uh, the way, God's way of
speaking to us that the language,

269
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,690
Dante, that God uses is the
language of human beings.

270
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,980
We are the syllabus.

271
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,570
We are the letters disposed
in order to convey this, uh,

272
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,450
this whatever God's message may be,

273
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,130
the show themselves then in five
times seven vowels and consonants.

274
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:34,020
And I noted them severely and what they
seem to me to mean, the league eater,

275
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,220
you stitch them, they spill
out, align, taken from the book.

276
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,680
A verse from, uh, the book
of Wisdom, love, justice,

277
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,840
delegating [inaudible]. You
who Josh, who judge the Earth.

278
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,280
That's another reference to the actual
ultimate measurement of geometry.

279
00:18:55,741 --> 00:19:00,630
The earth. I just, that's the meaning of a
geometry, the measuring of the earth. So,

280
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,250
uh, uh, geography in a
certain way is part of, uh,

281
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,900
the world of geometry. Then, then Dante
goes on describing a metamorphosis,

282
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:15,000
how on the m of the fifth word,
they kept the oldest of the Jupiter same,

283
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:19,650
their silver pricked up with gold and
that's what the hot lights descend on the

284
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:22,320
very summit of the M and
settle there singing,

285
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,140
I think of the good that
draws them to itself.

286
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,020
Then as with burning logs are struck,

287
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:32,370
rise in numerable sparks from which the
foolish are accustomed to make auguries.

288
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,960
So more than a thousand lights appeared
to rise again from there and to mount

289
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:39,350
some, uh, some much, some literal,

290
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,050
this hundred kindle them appointed when
each ad set on that's place, et cetera.

291
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,980
Uh, I know that some of you are
working on the aesthetics of collars.

292
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,810
I would point out the scene to you
and the complications of color,

293
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:54,990
the white of Jupiter,
the gold of the letters,

294
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,980
the red of the flames. Ah,
there is a kind of chromatic,

295
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:05,040
chromatic deployment,
dramatic elements within this,

296
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:08,100
uh, this grand spectacle, uh,

297
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,820
Dante's indicating directly and
indirectly they this chromatic, uh,

298
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,170
uh, symbolism. So this is
what we are, what, what,

299
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:21,270
what w the way the heavens
speak to us on earth and to the,

300
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,970
and those and the rulers of the earth.
Uh,

301
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,500
and then Dante goes on
in the next Canto 19,

302
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,780
uh,
wondering what is this idea of justice?

303
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:38,530
What does it mean? Um, oh,

304
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,110
he last Canto 19

305
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,710
clients 28.
I know where the doe,

306
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:51,310
the divine justice is mirrored
in another room of heaven.

307
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,390
Yours apprehends it without a veil,
you know,

308
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:59,890
with that intent has been prepared to
listen. You know, what is that doubt,

309
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,720
which is so old. If a
fast in me, he's hungry,

310
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,270
Dante's hungry to know what divine
justice is and what are we here is,

311
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:16,780
uh, uh, the faculty, etc. The, uh, the,

312
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:21,781
the bird or the ego goes on saying
he that turned his commpass.

313
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:27,580
That's God as the geometer
an image that clearly yet

314
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,870
goes to biblical texts.

315
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,970
One is of job 38,
the famous passage,

316
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:40,270
some of you may know Dante
terms with repeatedly,

317
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,690
where were you when I drew
the boundaries of the earth?

318
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,800
Oh, that's the geometrical, they,
they the, the matrix, so to speak. Uh,

319
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,300
I mean it was the age
of, of, uh, of, uh, this,

320
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,780
uh,
metaphor of a god,

321
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:03,040
the geometer and the other one
is in the book of Wisdom. Uh,

322
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,260
um, the, the, that goes
on talking about, uh, uh,

323
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,400
I was there with him and that was his
delight when he was drawing the circle

324
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,520
around.
The deep that's in the book was a two,

325
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,490
two biblical passages
that insists on this, uh,

326
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,670
both a geometric and then
aesthetic it theater.

327
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,770
The idea that to the shapes of the
world are really representations of,

328
00:22:28,771 --> 00:22:32,860
is this perfection of God's geometry.

329
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:36,000
There are two metaphors. The
dentate goes on, uh, deploying.

330
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:39,240
But let's see what the substance
of the argument now is.

331
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,830
He then turned this compass. You
know, we understand what he uses,

332
00:22:43,831 --> 00:22:46,890
the word compacts and the image
of the compass that's clear,

333
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,010
not remain in infinite access.

334
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,620
That's to me another
geometrical language though.

335
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,210
The two words are slightly
redundant because access means the,

336
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:02,100
the uh, the eight something which
is measure less. Ah, AH, the, the,

337
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:06,240
the language of measure,
the language of, uh, uh,

338
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,300
accounting and the language of
limits is set against this idea of a,

339
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,390
something, not, not finite,
something that escapes the,

340
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,460
the logic of geometry.
Okay.

341
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,420
The logic of measurements and
Infinitech access. In fact,

342
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,680
I find the phrase deliberately
redundance is also an only infinite,

343
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,630
but it's also excessive idea
of the infinite, uh, to drive,

344
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,070
drive the point home.
Um, you, uh, manifest,

345
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:38,250
could not make his power to be so
impressed on the whole universe.

346
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,310
Even the Word Universe is, uh, as a,
uh, as, as much as the poetic I, uh,

347
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,490
uh,
term we speak of verse in poetry

348
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,870
and that wonder how many of you have ever
wondered whether that's that word come

349
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:54,670
from, it comes from geometry. Cars
in price, it turning, you know,

350
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,430
you come to the end of the line and you
turn and you draw geometrical figure.

351
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,390
And so that's the universe. It's
one tourney. It's this fear.

352
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:07,760
You can have a hemispheres,
but the two hemispheres make the universe.

353
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,120
No, these are all as you see, uh, uh,

354
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:14,900
I hope you enjoy them as I enjoy
them telling you about, uh, uh,

355
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:19,880
about this and improve this.
The first proud spirits Lucifer.

356
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,560
Now that's geometry of
the soul. Oh, the first,

357
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,270
the first proud spirit who was in the,
you know,

358
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:33,620
Dante connects pride and geometry
or perspective as we said before.

359
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,700
Um,

360
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,850
the first proud spirit who was in the
highest that was highest of all creatures,

361
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,580
fair and ripe with a
great adjective. Uh, uh,

362
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Lucifer falls and ripe because
grace in price or ripeness,

363
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,920
ripeness, the idea that you are ripe
when you have been touched by grace,

364
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,230
right? And it says, all

365
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,830
one could say using another, referring
to another text, not by dance,

366
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,710
through, uh, through,
not waiting for light.

367
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,970
That's Lucifer from which of this play
that every lesson needs is to scan to a

368
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:12,450
vessel for the good,
which has no limit and measure.

369
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,780
I'm not going to indicate
that anymore itself by itself.

370
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,840
That's so vision which must needs but
be one of the rays of the mind of which

371
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,600
all things are full cannot by its nature
we have such power that it should not

372
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:28,530
perceive its origin to be far beyond
though there appears therefore,

373
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,730
and that seems to be the um,
the essence,

374
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,280
the brunt of the argument.

375
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,000
The site that is granted to your
world penetrates within the terminal.

376
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:43,200
Justice is the eye into the c four.

377
00:25:43,201 --> 00:25:47,790
Though from the shore it sees
the bottom in the open sea.

378
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,460
It does not.
And yet the bottom is there,

379
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,600
but the depth conceals it.
Uh,

380
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,920
the idea that uh,

381
00:25:56,010 --> 00:26:01,010
we can see justice only when we have a
very superficial and we see just to see

382
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:06,210
the, the, the bottom of the, of
the sea when we are near the shore.

383
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Only when we have a superficial
understanding of do we do we do we see the

384
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:13,320
bottom.
Otherwise we don't.

385
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:19,110
God's justice is imponderable
and unfathomable as the
sea floor can be out in,

386
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:27,210
uh, uh, out of, uh, away from the
shore. There is no light there,

387
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:31,040
but which comes from the clearance
on and the changes and then done

388
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,820
complicates the issue a little bit.
And he really asks,

389
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,430
where is the justice?

390
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:43,150
Is Justice Limited to
a place to a continent,

391
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,500
to the economy of Christian Europe?

392
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,560
And how is it related to other places?

393
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,150
We have an ocean of what
nowadays we call our parity.

394
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:58,500
You must have heard that term. The
other, the idea of the other, uh,

395
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,720
it's uh, in the Middle Ages, by the way,

396
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,830
it was not alien to this
thought of the other. Uh,

397
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,460
I can give you a few titles of uh, um, uh,

398
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:14,380
Aquinas writing a track against
the errors of the Greeks. That's,

399
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,450
that's the sense of
idleness establishing this,

400
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,960
you say differences or Aquinas
writing is summa against the gentiles.

401
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,730
The pagans. We usually actually where
the philosophers of the time, the, the,

402
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:31,731
those who do not have access to or exceed
the one to succeed to revelations the,

403
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:33,700
have an idea of otherness.
And the,

404
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,470
the of another nurse is always that over
acknowledging that particular defense.

405
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,650
I do not see at this point yet any
substantial deviation on the part of Dante

406
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:47,880
from the myth and the
examples of the heroic life.

407
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:53,250
The examples of the heroic life are those
who literally established boundaries,

408
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:58,490
who within those boundaries managed to
live according to the fullness of the

409
00:27:58,621 --> 00:28:00,420
virtuals.
That's a heroic life.

410
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:05,160
And that's really the boundary
that he establishes. Now, tasks.

411
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,370
What is that boundary?
Okay, I understand that,

412
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,310
that divine justice is impenetrable,

413
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,860
but then he asks this
extraordinary question,

414
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,780
what is a place where is a place?
And so this was a main,

415
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,760
it's born or the Bank
of the Indus line 72.

416
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,740
I think this is the most complex and
the most extraordinary question in the

417
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:30,360
whole of the divine comedy from,

418
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:34,520
from the point who have the awareness of,
uh,

419
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,590
let's say I'll tear it.
No,

420
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:41,690
Maine is born on the Bank of the English
Asia and none is there to speak or read

421
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,330
or write of Christ and all his desires
and doing her good so far as humor.

422
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:56,340
Regencies without sitting in
life. Who speech, he dies,

423
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,520
I'm baptized.
And without faith,

424
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,770
what is this justice that condemned him?
What is his fault?

425
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,750
If he does not believe? And then, uh,

426
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:13,790
now who are the other would sit upon the
bench and judge a thousand miles away,

427
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,990
more geometry or mode space,

428
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,010
more distance if is comes to
being not only one of depth.

429
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,190
Now one of huge distances in space
with the site short of a span and the

430
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:30,020
spending, you know, by the
way, it's a great, you know,
that it's uh, it's, it's uh,

431
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,470
a measurement, a geometric term
too. That's the, that's the span.

432
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,000
The distance that goes from the tip of
the thumb to the tip of the little finger.

433
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,020
Uh, you know, this is technically Italian

434
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,400
Spanish and the English is
span, uh, comes from it.

435
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,020
I should surely for him that
will reason it out with me.

436
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,960
The scripture were not set over you. There
will be abandoned room for questions.

437
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,650
And then he goes on talking,
uh,

438
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,820
as the stalks circle and Dante's clearly
circling over this stuff himself over

439
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:05,040
this, uh, this issues. And we have, uh,

440
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,430
it turned to Europe,
the whole of Europe and our peers,

441
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,200
the whole of Kendall's,
Nah, it's a hundred and uh,

442
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,430
uh, and, and, and till the end. And
let me just read this passage where,

443
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,460
um, uh, the eagle,

444
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:25,570
the Romans and well done to goes out of
the way to say when the shining fires of

445
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:30,080
the holy ghost had posted in
sign that made the Roman, uh,

446
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,610
rev, Romans, reverend to the
world, it began again okay.

447
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:37,420
With a illusion therefore
to the Romans as if to uh,

448
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,650
as a kind of idea Rome to
Dante's become an idea,

449
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,510
an idea of universality, you
know, uh, to this kingdom.

450
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:51,250
Never ever rose who did not believe in
Christ either before or after he was

451
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:55,480
nailed to the tree but no many Christ,
Christ,

452
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,150
Christ who shall be far less
near to him at the judgment.

453
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:02,770
Then there's 10 such as, no,
not Christ in such Christians,

454
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,970
the Ethiopians,
Africa is being mentioned.

455
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:10,780
Check on them when the two companies
are partnered, what can the Persians,

456
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,980
Asia, once again, the three
continents are going to be.

457
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,040
So that divisions of belief now and its
divisions who believe seem to lose or

458
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:25,891
consistency because you may be
a European and that is immoral.

459
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,910
Alterity within Europe,
it's altered.

460
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,890
It is not just a question of geographic,
uh,

461
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,390
disposition sort of part of the economy.

462
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,120
Someone who is a Persian is other than me.
It is,

463
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,480
but there is in terms of the moral life,

464
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,860
clearly there is an alternative
within Europe. In fact, Dante does,

465
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,040
he starts with a kingdom of Prague lines
18 Alberta by which the Carroll Shelby

466
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,460
made desolate and then to
France then shall be seen.

467
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,220
The misery brought on the second
count. All the countries, by the way,

468
00:31:57,221 --> 00:32:01,270
he seems to know the history of on the
same from the debasement of the currency.

469
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,700
By him,
the shall die from the charge of a bore.

470
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,800
There shall be seeing the pride
that makes Thurston so madness,

471
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:12,550
the Scott and the Englishman that
neither can keep within his bounds.

472
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,510
Oh,
there is a,

473
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:18,130
there's a history of violence that
transgresses also boundaries are right and

474
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:21,760
that can be a violence and I will
give you a little story about that.

475
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,420
It will show the wantonness and
soft living of him, of Spain,

476
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,800
and of people of Bohemia who never,
who never knew worth no salted.

477
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,940
It will show for the cripple of Jerusalem,
his goodness marked with an eye.

478
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,700
What an m. We'll mark the opposite. It
will show the average and cowers of women,

479
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,280
the whole to the island,
the fire,

480
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,240
Sicily, where are Kaiser's and
his long ended his long life.

481
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,580
And to make plain his insignificance,
his records should be in contractions.

482
00:32:48,581 --> 00:32:53,390
So we'll note much and little space and
manifest all should be the foul deeds of

483
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:55,070
his uncle and his brother.

484
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,630
But who my lineage so illustrious and
two crowns have been dishonored and he'll

485
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:03,650
Portugal and he over Norway
shall be there known there.

486
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,910
And he of Russia,

487
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,200
Russia meaning a real literary Russia
who to his own hurt has been the calling

488
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:13,420
of Venice or happy Hungary.
The ironies heavy. Uh,

489
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,440
if she no longer let herself be wronged
and happy Navarre, if she armors,

490
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:22,640
if with a mountain that surround her and
for earners of this or men should know

491
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:26,780
that Nicole Asia and Pharma goals that
are meant and complain of their own beast,

492
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:29,990
which keeps it's place beside the rest.
So the whole of Europe,

493
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,280
this is now the history of Europe in a
way that Dante has given the history of

494
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:37,930
the empire Roman Empire. But this
is the history of Europe, Eh,

495
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:43,060
history of distillation and moral,

496
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:46,010
bitter election.
These are the terms of,

497
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,720
so what is here and what is there?
What is,

498
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,420
what is,
what is within an economy of redemption?

499
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,970
Where is not out of the
economy of redemption?

500
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,580
This is exactly the
question that Dante asks.

501
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,630
And the answer is that we do not know.

502
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:07,080
We do not know how
this, uh, salvation, uh,

503
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,990
it's going to work hard. No one
can claim, therefore to, uh,

504
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,110
decide, uh, uh,

505
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,000
what exact moral boundaries can exist
between a place and then other, um,

506
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,840
that seems to be, uh, the
idea that a 10%, therefore,

507
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:25,910
the notion on the one hand,
the idea of boundaries.

508
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:31,090
And on the other hand there is also
this notion that boundaries can,

509
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:35,810
uh, are, are political,
but they are not. No.

510
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:40,250
Can they be thought of as being moral
boundaries? So it distinguishes the two,

511
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,420
the tool, uh, the two issues.
What, what is his, so what is,

512
00:34:44,421 --> 00:34:46,940
is trying to say before I
tried to tell you about this,

513
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:50,210
let me tell you about a little text.
Has nothing to do with the Middle Ages,

514
00:34:50,211 --> 00:34:52,190
but I'm sure you know the techs.

515
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,430
It's that little story that Geraldo
who is a great Greek historian,

516
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,790
tells this story of, uh, in, uh, uh,

517
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,990
the history's really before the beginning
of the Greeks are getting ready to

518
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,710
invade Egypt,
go into Egypt.

519
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,180
And he really writes a story
to warn them about what, uh,

520
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,260
uh,

521
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,260
the dangers that they might be
surprised by all the dangerous,

522
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:26,450
wherever you go across boundaries,
that and violate boundaries.

523
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,600
It's really an argument
in favor of boundaries.

524
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:34,130
And he tells the story of a King,
the king of Egypt,

525
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,420
a cow, the cow, the arrows.
I think his name is who, oh,

526
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:43,140
was not a very sharp man.
A very, very bright man.

527
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,330
[inaudible] was not a very bright man.

528
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,520
He also had a very beautiful wife and
he was so taken with the beauty of his

529
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:54,240
wife that he wanted
everybody to know about it,

530
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,670
but he can't tell everybody.

531
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,600
But he tells his advisor and the
advisor who is a very prudent man, says,

532
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,610
sire, Your Majesty. I don't want to, I
believe you don't tell me more about this,

533
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,610
but you got to know,
you've got to hear me because you know,

534
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:13,390
normally you got to hear me. I want
you to see the naked beauty of my wife,

535
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,910
the young belief.

536
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:20,180
And I want you to see it because human
beings tend to trust their eyes more than

537
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:23,850
what they hear more than the ears.

538
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,360
We don't really believe what we
hear is that there may be at power.

539
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,040
We see is directed. We want
to have access to it. The,

540
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,870
the counselor, a very prudent fusses and
sorry, this is really too much trouble.

541
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:39,360
I can not disobey you,
but you are forcing me to,

542
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,570
to really insist that I
believe you completely.

543
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:45,690
You can go and telling me about how
beauty, I don't want to say it. No,

544
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:49,320
I mean a range in this, uh,
he contrives a little plot.

545
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,940
The wife has to go bathing some
in the room next to the bedroom.

546
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,900
He king leaves the door ajar,

547
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,430
open for her to come in the bedroom door.

548
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,220
Um,
and so while she's away,

549
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,390
he allows the counselor to hide
in the shadows of the room.

550
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,793
The little corner.

551
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,170
The queen comes in and
addresses the counselor,

552
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,880
sees her naked and very
quickly, uh, works out,

553
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,630
hoping silently and hoping
not to have been been seen.

554
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,490
The morning after the Queen,
it was a sharp queen.

555
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,430
Calls him into her office and says,

556
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I saw you telling me what we're
doing there so the counselor has no,

557
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,230
no choice but saying,
your majesty,

558
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:49,320
the king. Your husband asked me to
come in there and the Queen says,

559
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:53,550
I imagine that that's really what
happened. But uh, at this point,

560
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:57,420
one of you two is one too much,
too many.

561
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:02,160
One of you are that you kill the
king or you kill yourself. Yeah.

562
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,190
Idea that I have been ashamed and be
seen a naked but two men is unbearable to

563
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:11,520
me and the counselor,

564
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,000
that's what I'm sure all of you would do.
He became the cake.

565
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,920
A very simple, uh, and by the way, uh,

566
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,980
her other schools only even saying that,
you know,

567
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:27,210
he lived a very undistinguished life.
It was not a big deal. I said, well,

568
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:28,750
he's wording her other visibility,

569
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:33,830
warning us to understand that there is
always a limit to that have to set up and

570
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:40,480
protect between what we say me or mine,
I,

571
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,980
and what I say you,

572
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,070
this is the land was a dentist uses the
beginning of Canto 20. They say, ah,

573
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:50,470
they say I in mind when they mean
we and our, you know, this is,

574
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,240
this is a very thin line that
has to be observed. Uh, uh,

575
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:58,980
the king of course, just to finish
that little story that king was, was,

576
00:38:58,981 --> 00:39:02,900
was a fool. He had no clue that
he had no sense of, uh, the, the,

577
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,030
the difference between the private
lives and the public needs.

578
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:10,870
It had no idea that there are things
that you keep to yourself and you don't

579
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:14,980
share with others as one can
go on complicating the problem.

580
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,370
But the issue is that
he understood limits.

581
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,070
You are going on into
another man's country.

582
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,730
You have to act a safe.
Uh,

583
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,420
you don't have to go too deep into it
and you don't have to try to violate.

584
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,110
It's uh, uh, countries, a
woman's nakedness, meaning they,

585
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,850
the essential sent the private
sense of, uh, of oneself.

586
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,800
I do not know that Dante would really
agree with her auditors in this, uh,

587
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,540
in this, in this cancers. But what he's
been doing is literally setting up,

588
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,970
uh, a needed cultural
difference. Somehow there is a,

589
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:55,250
that they exist cultural differences and
at the same time allow for the kind of

590
00:39:56,231 --> 00:40:00,130
moral circulation of ideas.
Let me put it in general,

591
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:04,590
medieval terms to tell you what I
think he has been doing because the,

592
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:07,300
the argument when he makes this argument,

593
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:12,330
a man is born on the river of the
Hindus and does not know anything about

594
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,350
Christian faith and baptism dies.
Why should he be them, et cetera.

595
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,580
He has been living, uh,
decorously and rationally.

596
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,410
Why should he be not saved? That's the
question we asked. Well, he's taking on,

597
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:29,950
there didn't seem to be what
we call in medieval terms,

598
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:34,690
Appalachian Appalachian
stance and you know,

599
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:38,860
now I think I have said before,
but let me just repeat this.

600
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:44,070
Pathogen is an adjective that comes
from the name of a British monk of the,

601
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,630
roughly the time of Santa Gastin,

602
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,660
the fifth century Bellagio's who really
maintain that by the exercise of,

603
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:55,240
by the true works, through
good works, human beings,

604
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,140
every sec living according
to principles of nature,

605
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,960
human beings can be saved.

606
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:05,440
It didn't seem almost that Dante's
taking that position to a position,

607
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:05,771
by the way,

608
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:10,180
which she probably even held in the
philosophical text called the banquet.

609
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,930
That was one of, it's one of, I
don't, I don't agree with that,

610
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:18,790
but it seems to be such an emphasis
on the ability of human beings to live

611
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:22,900
rationally that, uh, the, the, uh,

612
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:27,400
the demands of grace and
the demands of faith,

613
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,320
uh, somewhat bracketed and, and, and,
and, and a little dim and under is,

614
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:35,000
I think that they are, are only
that he's talking is a philosopher.

615
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,010
And the issue is this, that Dante here
is asking for the conversation between,

616
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,580
between philosophy and theology within
reason and faith in the sense that he

617
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:51,971
really understands that philosophy
without theology ends up in a sort of

618
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,660
labyrinth of a tone constructions
and get it may lose the way.

619
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,340
And theology without philosophy
may end up in mere opinion,

620
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,940
which has no validity at all on,

621
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:11,990
for people who believe in the power,

622
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,220
the power of reason not to connect
it with the previous scandals.

623
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,480
I think that Dante has been
literally extending, uh, this,

624
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,640
this whole, uh, uh,
problem about what, uh, uh,

625
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:28,730
exile is an exile,
which does not mean, uh,

626
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:33,770
the random movement, uh,
but always a kind of a,

627
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:38,670
uh, a sense of the proper
problematical qualities of, uh,

628
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,530
uh, a place in the world. And, uh, uh,

629
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:48,540
the relationship that we have
with ourselves and our own,

630
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:52,430
our own ideas. I know that this was such
an attorney to get a little bit that I,

631
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,580
uh, taste taking me away
from the other candles,

632
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:58,810
but let me just read 21. Uh, and, uh,

633
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:01,400
the cantors or just went
to turn very briefly.

634
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:05,870
I don't think that I'm 21 and 22,
uh,

635
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:10,160
which are candles were Dante meets.
It's the sphere of Saturn,

636
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,170
which as you know, is the heaven of, uh,

637
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,290
it's the heaven of contemplation.
Uh,

638
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:22,700
the word Saturn, them, the myth
of Saturn is the myth of time,

639
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:27,630
uh,
devouring everything that it engendered.

640
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,660
That's what you remember the time is
the first cannibal of history eating up.

641
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,890
What it producers, this is, uh, you
know, the minutes that are just taken in.

642
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,360
It's the name seems to come from
the saturation desaturation of time.

643
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,920
And Nancy's coming to,

644
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:47,510
this is the last planet and it's
also the heaven of astronomy. Uh,

645
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,340
so he's forcing on us the idea
of what contemplation is. Here.

646
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:56,350
He finds the contemplative and among them
there is the soul of a founder by the

647
00:43:57,621 --> 00:44:02,150
name of Benedict. Uh, the first, uh,
the, the from one of the contemplative,

648
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:04,610
older came to the word contemplation.

649
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,900
A really implies two things. If
you ask, what is it? Contemplation.

650
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,130
Because there's always a debate as to
where the Dante's a mistake or it's not

651
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:15,970
realistic. I think that if
there's anything that he has is,

652
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,000
he's a contemplative in
the true sense of the word.

653
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,510
The word contemplation
translates the Greek theory,

654
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,810
which is really the turning of
the mind toward the essentials,

655
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,280
uh, theory or contemplation.
The word comes from,

656
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,080
uh, 10 bloom contemplation, which is,

657
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,950
as you know,
the Latin word for pen for,

658
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,080
of a temple borrows from
the Latin word for temples.

659
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,550
They're the same words, you know, uh,

660
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,860
temple there words for
template in the words for time.

661
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,440
I have the same origin and they both
come from the Greek word called Devon

662
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,330
Minnow. Uh, the Greek word
[inaudible], which means to cut,

663
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,710
to cut Saturday time with a scythe cuts.

664
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,920
Their contemporaries are those who cut
a space of time and privilege it or a

665
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:13,371
space in place and cut it off from the
flow of history and the flow of a profane

666
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,580
place and make it the, the, the,

667
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:23,581
the sort of ground for turning their
minds to the consideration of higher

668
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,410
thinks.
This is the poet that Dante is driving.

669
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:32,070
His going to discuss the degeneracy of a,
of the older,

670
00:45:32,071 --> 00:45:36,790
but I want to really end with you and
I didn't meant to talk about this.

671
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,320
Up Sign will emerge at the end
of Canto 22. Uh, we're done.

672
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,170
Pinole is really has reached the,

673
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:48,790
the periphery of the planetary
system. Now who will go into, uh,

674
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:52,530
the stars, the, the, the, the,
the heaven of the six stars. Okay.

675
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:56,130
We have a little bit of time
so I can go slow here. Uh,

676
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,790
lines canto 22 lines.

677
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,080
Um, uh, let's say 126.

678
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,510
This is Beatrice speaking that word.

679
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:11,511
So near to the final blessedness Beatrice
began that thou must have denies clear

680
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,460
and keen. Now that's
Dante's. He will, he will,

681
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:18,210
uh,

682
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,710
deploy this language of visionary leaders
and the language of visual learners.

683
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,030
Visual learners will,

684
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:29,270
we'll start with the emphasis on clay
purifying Vance and refining one's own,

685
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,900
uh, uh, once hone nice and
once physical eyesight. Uh,

686
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:42,110
and therefore before you go farther
into it, look down be it is.

687
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:46,910
It's one of the two, uh, the two
invitations by Beatrice now to turn back,

688
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:52,010
turn the ice bag and having
a contemplation and Dante
will contemplate so to

689
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:56,940
speak, the earth not
up. The heavens turned.

690
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,590
And therefore,
uh,

691
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,880
before you go further into to look down
and see how much of the universe I have

692
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:06,750
already put been beneath my feet
so that with the fullness of joy,

693
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:11,220
that hearts may present itself to the
triumphal host that comes rejoicing

694
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,730
through this rounded ether with my site.

695
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:20,330
Dante now is engaged in this
retrospective glance down to the earth.

696
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:26,090
I returned through every one of the seven
spheres and I saw this globe such as I

697
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:31,050
smiled earth and it's paltry sum ones.

698
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,510
The perspective is that of a

699
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,380
space, I wouldn't call it infinite
space, but the vast distance of space,

700
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:45,460
I don't call it infant space because
Dante's notion of the universe is not that

701
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:49,380
it's infinite down to is the
notion of the universe is uh,

702
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:54,660
eh bounded but a vast uh,

703
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:59,290
connect, uh, Vasta a enclave.
It's really like a book.

704
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:03,790
That's the image that he uses and that
judgment which holds it for least I

705
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:08,380
approve as best and he has thought is on
the other things may rightly be called

706
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:11,980
just I saw Latona his daughter,

707
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,750
the moon growing without the shadow for
which are to believe that to be rare

708
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,460
dance. They science aspect
Hyperion, I in Europe,

709
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:26,020
there and I, so both Maya and
they own a move in the circles.

710
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,650
Many mercury near him
from thence appear to me,

711
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:33,340
the tempering of jove between
his father and his son.

712
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,070
And from thence they
changes were clear to me,

713
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,990
which they're making their positions.

714
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:43,350
And those seven showed me what is the
magnitude and what is the speed and the

715
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:48,310
distance. This Dave, so
we have an astronomy here,

716
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,650
they haven't of astronomy,
but whoever in astronomy,

717
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:55,980
which is indicated mythically and neuro
only mythically but also through a

718
00:48:56,621 --> 00:49:00,250
process of failure patients is
the daughter of black Latona,

719
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:05,430
the son of a Hyperion son,
uh, processes affiliation.

720
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,500
So it's really as if the university itself
has followed the logic of generation

721
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,710
of production has been uh,
uh,

722
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,660
producing and reproducing itself.
And then does he go, continues.

723
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:24,370
Dante goes back to looking at
the earth. Uh, um, I'm sorry.

724
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,150
Another seven showed to me what is the
magnitude and where is the speed and the

725
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,740
distance,
the stations,

726
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,430
the little threshing floor
that makes us so fierce.

727
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,780
All appeared to me from hills to river
mouth while I was willing with the

728
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:41,620
eternal twins.
Then to the fair eyes,

729
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,890
I turned my eyes again.

730
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,900
I want to draw your attention to line
one 51 where dentists is the little

731
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:54,410
threshing floor that makes us so fierce.
All appear to me like who all

732
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:01,660
she far to Pharaoh [inaudible]
chief are looking at that line,

733
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:03,130
look at it.
Uh,

734
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:08,370
to me a little hill trigger months while
I was reading with eternal twins. Uh,

735
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,570
Nantum anyways, has, uh, uh,
now that's part of his view of,

736
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:17,860
uh, of, of, of um, uh, astronomy.

737
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:22,150
He's given his horoscope
in directory here, the,

738
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:27,100
this idea of uh, uh, the
twins being the sign,

739
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,790
the which he was born. It doesn't
imply an astrological laps on his path.

740
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,800
It's now that he can be free.

741
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:38,750
And here's this determined
to the limitations of
astrological determinations.

742
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,470
He can go on alluding to his birth sign,
but I want to draw,

743
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,820
I just want to do the attention
to this whole point about the CI.

744
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:51,170
We a dentist is that will threshing
floor that makes us so fierce.

745
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,920
It was for all its distance.

746
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:59,150
And this says this and this,
it can pick and be, um,

747
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,430
this for all the distance,
which is implied by this poetic fiction.

748
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,960
His distance from the earth.

749
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,770
Is He ever wash this pronoun?

750
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:15,160
She pass us the pronoun
strains to have it both ways.

751
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:22,070
On the one hand than search distance,
uh,

752
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,870
the claim of a perspective
of eternity on the world.

753
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:31,430
And, uh, uh, but he does
not. That's the other way.

754
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,700
He does not want to surrender his place
in time and in history like he's part of

755
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:42,260
us.

756
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,760
So at the end of all this great
gyration through the universe,

757
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,960
Dante again claims every
claims for himself,

758
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:56,030
a place with us in the world of history,
in the world of time,

759
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,890
the synthesis of the tool,

760
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,160
the claim of eternity and the sense of
contingency of the self in time is the

761
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,130
ultimate goal of the poem.

762
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:12,230
And the ultimate goal of, uh,
uh, the, the, the journey,

763
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,130
uh, that for Dante will be as
we shall see maybe next week,

764
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:20,010
the very vision of the incarnation,
the to the idea where this, uh,

765
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:25,130
this to the structure, the
mutable structure of history
and the process of time.

766
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:29,690
We'll, uh, we'll come
together. Um, let me, uh,

767
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,260
stop here and see if they are, they
are questions that I would, um,

768
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,070
about some of these issues
that I raised that I would, uh,

769
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,390
I would welcome them please.

770
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:18,410
The passage by the way,
about, uh, maybe we should,

771
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:23,460
even the passage where Dante talks
about his old horoscope was given,

772
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,510
uh, a little earlier
line, one 12 of Canto 22,

773
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,210
where the anthesis Oh,
glorious stars,

774
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:36,520
all light pregnant with mighty power
from which I acknowledge all my genius,

775
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:40,930
whatever it be, uh, with you
was born and with you hidden he,

776
00:53:40,931 --> 00:53:42,610
that is the father,
which mortal life.

777
00:53:42,611 --> 00:53:45,940
When I first tasted the
Tuscan area and Nafta,

778
00:53:45,941 --> 00:53:48,880
when Greece was granted me
to enter into the high wheel,

779
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,260
that bears around your region was
assigned to me, to you, my soul.

780
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:58,261
Now size devoutly that is
may gain strength for the
hard task that draws it to,

781
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,830
uh, to itself. This is the, uh, uh,

782
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,810
Dante ballers is the differences
between astronomy and astrology.

783
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,190
But from this point of view,

784
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:13,990
he belongs fully to his time where
there is no intrinsic. The, we, we,

785
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
we think of them as a straw bridges of
superstition and astronomy is the science

786
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:23,950
that it was not the case,
uh, for, for Dante. But,

787
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:24,813
um,

788
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,463
yeah,

789
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,880
the, uh, another little details is a, I'm,

790
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,670
I'm introducing the question
of visionary nest now in um,

791
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:46,400
in cantos with the contemplation.
Uh, let me just mention this,

792
00:54:46,401 --> 00:54:51,401
a initial emerge to give you an idea of
how Dante proceeds the initial image.

793
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:57,291
I can two 21 of the very beginning of
Canto 21 Dante is in the sphere of Saturn

794
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,180
where the contemplate a contemporary of
his heart. Uh, and he says the ladder,

795
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:07,410
the ladder of ascent. Um, but
let's, before we get there, uh,

796
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,120
this is the passage already.

797
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:14,010
My eyes were fixed on the face of
my lady and with them, my mind,

798
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:17,640
which was withdrawn from every other
thought. And she did not smile.

799
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:22,170
But when I to smile,
she began to me.

800
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:27,530
You will become like similar when she
was turned to ashes for my beauty,

801
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:33,530
which thou has seen kindle more the
higher we climb by the stairs of the

802
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,860
Terminal Palace. He so shining
that if it were not tempered,

803
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:43,200
they more two powers in it and it's
blazed would be as a branch split by

804
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:44,070
thunderbolt,

805
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,520
we have risen to the seven splendor which
beneath the rest of the burning lion

806
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:53,310
race down now mingled with
its power set a mind behind,

807
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:58,320
denies and make of the mirrors to the
shape which in this metro will appear to t

808
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,280
uh, this is an extraordinary merge
the image of the myth of similar,

809
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,790
the young woman who fell in love with God

810
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,370
that would seem to be,
uh, of course, uh, Eh,

811
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,680
an extraordinary spiritual story of
it tells it has a very carnal story.

812
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:23,990
She wants to love a Jupiter and
Jupiter will agree to love Semele back

813
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,940
on one condition that she never ask God
to show himself forth for what he is.

814
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:38,920
She has to accept his,
the guards disguises if variant,

815
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,250
if you wish of what later
will appear with a players.

816
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:46,240
The idea of arrows and psyche.

817
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:51,140
You remember the love of the, the
relationship with in mind and love. Uh,

818
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:54,760
love mate.
That's not one to be seen for what it is.

819
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,450
And always once Simulacra
and a deceptive, uh, uh,

820
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:04,390
figures to cover its essence. This is
the same thing that he's asking that,

821
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,283
that,
uh,

822
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,530
Dante's recalling and of course what
happens in all of it is that seminar and

823
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:15,830
love and because of love,
love, impels curiosity. Uh,

824
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:19,390
she was Jupiter to show himself,

825
00:57:19,391 --> 00:57:24,391
fought for what he is mindless of the
danger that Jupiter had predicted this

826
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:31,320
would be for, uh, and the danger of
death that would be for her. In fact,

827
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:36,340
he shows himself and she cannot bear the
extraordinary beauty of the guard and

828
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:43,060
gets destroyed, turned into ashes.
That's the myth that antiques recalling.

829
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,360
So that the inevitable question for us
is why would Dante recall this story here

830
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,290
at the beginning of the
cantors and contemplation?

831
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,190
And the answer that I
could give you is that, uh,

832
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:01,230
Dante Dusseau because he's aware
of the dangers of visionary claims.

833
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,910
And this is, look, if you
read the Bible for instance,

834
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:11,500
you do know that there is a tradition in
the Bible among the Jews to turn their

835
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:13,240
back,
for instance,

836
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,840
to even the passing of a
what is viewed as whole.

837
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:22,860
It would be the holy ark or they
cover themselves in because of the,

838
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:27,970
the, the, the wisdom or the
tradition of not seeing,

839
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,770
never trying to,
to,

840
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:34,870
to have mix the profane and they say that
all the sense of the danger that would

841
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:39,840
be for the, the uh, those
who are in the space of the,

842
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:43,210
of, of the profane space or
what outside of the sanctuary.

843
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:48,930
Dante is making this abuse resist
telling him that he has to a newer

844
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,000
delimitations of his human nature and
that his human nature that is the trade of

845
00:58:56,411 --> 00:59:01,290
his mortality, a which is that
of seeing through images and, uh,

846
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,320
in, in, in, through obliquities
cannot yet be given up.

847
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,190
He does this as he enters the con,

848
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:13,300
the heaven of the contemplative who they
themselves were longing and desiring to

849
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:14,590
say God,

850
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:19,590
but accepted this longing as the sign
of God's presence and gift to them.

851
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,120
This is an extraordinary passage in
terms of what [inaudible] thinks of

852
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:31,010
contemplation and clearly the danger
of thinking of contemplation as the

853
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:35,900
conditions that would allow and bring
about the vision of God. Such a visual,

854
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:40,220
Dante saying is not going to be
impossible while we are here on earth.

855
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,330
So there's, this is the, the
sort of, the number of, uh, uh,

856
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:46,070
ambiguities about this problem.

857
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:50,810
And then we could also mentioned the,
uh,

858
00:59:50,811 --> 00:59:54,930
why Benedict, uh, why benedict here, the,

859
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:59,210
the figure that appears in Canto
22 as the exemplar. First of all,

860
00:59:59,211 --> 01:00:03,860
he's the founder, as I said,
of the, the, uh, of, of, uh,

861
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,420
the life of contemplation.

862
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,720
But allow for contemplation that appears
is the danger of contemplation because

863
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:16,020
Dante goes on talking
about the decadence of a,

864
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:20,330
of the contemplative all
dark, which is by the way, uh,

865
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,810
quite true. And what
that which occasion, uh,

866
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:27,020
historically the foundation
of the mendicant holders,

867
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,400
those Franciscans and Dominicans who may
already have encountered who want to be

868
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:36,090
part of the world and roam around
in the world. But the, the,

869
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,970
the danger of the contemplation though,

870
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:43,270
is that they can bypass and drive a wedge
between the contemplative life and the

871
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:47,300
active life.

872
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:52,630
The ideal of benedict has been betrayed
because what he wants is an action and

873
01:00:54,111 --> 01:00:56,840
the life of action,
the life of contemplative prayer.

874
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:02,080
So that's one of the causes of the
degeneracy that Dante Porsche's.

875
01:01:02,301 --> 01:01:05,900
And with that we enter the world of,
uh,

876
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,730
now we're done to returns.

877
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:12,380
And this is where we're going to do
next time to what I call basic words.

878
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:16,850
Uh,
somehow the whole commpass of knowledge,

879
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:21,080
the whole idea of a geography
and spiritual geography,

880
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:22,100
the whole idea of how,

881
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:27,120
of what triggers the writing of a
poem that has been taken care of, uh,

882
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:32,090
or at least it's Dante seems to have
been facing and delivering to us his

883
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:35,660
particular understanding of this problems.
Now the question is,

884
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:38,480
with all of this in mind,
what are the mean?

885
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:43,510
What is the meaning of the basic words
we use and the basic words we use?

886
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:48,650
And that's where we're going to talk about
next time are going to be love, hope,

887
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,990
and, and, and, and faith.

888
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:54,560
But we call the three theological virtues.

889
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:59,120
And there are basic words because there
is no such a thing as a life without

890
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:03,560
trust or the difficulties of
the life without trust that can,

891
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:06,050
there is no possibility
of a life without hope.

892
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,440
And certainly that which remains
the biggest mystery of all.

893
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:13,600
There's never the possibility of
thinking about a life or without love and

894
01:02:13,601 --> 01:02:17,660
becomes a mystery. It was, he can be
fine. The other two words, he never,

895
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:21,390
he escapes the responsibility
of defining glove. I see.

896
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,620
It is as if that were really
the biggest mystery, uh,

897
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,940
throughout the divine comedy
and in, uh, in his experience.

898
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,010
So let me see for some questions.
Now.

899
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:36,510
I have thrown up out of a full time
out of chestnuts on the fire as we say.

900
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:37,344
So it's a

901
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:51,993
please

902
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:57,250
earlier lectures.
It was a physical journey,

903
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,140
um,
and in how we could see that he was,

904
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:06,220
he emphasized like his weight
in the earth and you know,

905
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:10,060
smells of things. And now,
now that we're in paradise,

906
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,870
it's more vision and light and color.

907
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:19,140
And is he trying to characterize God
or God's relation to Earth Somehow by

908
01:03:20,201 --> 01:03:21,034
contracting them?

909
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,913
Uh,

910
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,500
the question is that in the previous
lectures I discussed that I would talk of

911
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:33,730
hell is the place where
the, the, ah, the smells,

912
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,370
the concrete or particulars of
the earth would be mentioned.

913
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:42,250
It would be part of Dante's warehouse of,
in,

914
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,760
in the representation of, of
how, now that we're talking,

915
01:03:45,761 --> 01:03:48,970
we're entering the world of paradise,
who been told discussing paradise.

916
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:54,190
Dante seems to, uh, separate
himself from the aesthetics.

917
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:58,630
That's the sensual I, uh,
aspects of, of Helen talk more,

918
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,070
which is still central.
They'll callers a lie, uh, uh,

919
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:06,880
callers and visionary
ness. Ah, right. So, uh,

920
01:04:06,881 --> 01:04:09,160
and then the question becomes,
uh,

921
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,220
it does this mean that Dante is clearly,

922
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:16,520
clearly finding a distinction between
Earth and heaven? That this is really the,

923
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,890
am I in rephrasing it accurately?
Yes.

924
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,200
Is He, is he tried to, I mean,

925
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:27,070
because clearly it's not that he's trying
to separate God from physical reality

926
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:31,390
because what we see and colors
are still very physical. Yes.

927
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:34,650
Descriptions.
So what is the distinction between them?

928
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:39,450
Yup. Well, I the, the, uh, the,

929
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,880
the answer would be this,
that in, in, uh, in paradise,

930
01:04:42,881 --> 01:04:47,470
you do have a lot of, uh, what
did we call earthly experiences.

931
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:48,910
That's the only way he can really,

932
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,650
he could really understand that anything
about, uh, about, uh, about paradise,

933
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:58,720
uh, their dances, their
songs. You do have,

934
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,340
there are games that they play.

935
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:05,520
You do have the language of playfulness
in the forms of India in the form of

936
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:09,400
simulations.
Simulation is a very,

937
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:14,430
it's a form of game is it's a reduction
of the world tool on seriousness,

938
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:18,840
right? The Gay, the play, um, in,
in, in, in, in the, in the, in,

939
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,380
in the form of the degradation of the
noble idea of play because play is,

940
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,010
see this things are all very ambivalent,
uh,

941
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:30,310
that we were dealing with
the same reality, only seen
from different perspective.

942
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,310
And I mentioned play because
paradise is all about play.

943
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,600
It's about playing about, uh, uh,

944
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,210
the dance of the stars, about the
spectacle, the theater, which he just,

945
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:47,250
Dante is just seeing a little
log performance put out for him.

946
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:52,000
Can you imagine that? Then
some of the stars that go
on, it's, it's like seeing a,

947
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:56,140
the spectacle of the, of the
Olympics. Uh, in China. You know,

948
01:05:56,141 --> 01:06:01,060
the goal with distribution of
shapes and forms that is play, uh,

949
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:05,960
it's a statics. So there is no
difference there between, uh, uh,

950
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:09,280
between the tool. Uh, I
don't see a difference.

951
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,110
Of course that has nothing to do.

952
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:15,100
Whatever he's seeing in
paradise has really nothing
to do with the understanding

953
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:19,000
of the divinity. I am not
even, I haven't decided yet,

954
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,050
not for any reason that because they
may not really be time and that would,

955
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,130
I could, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be a,

956
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,870
wouldn't be doing justice to
the difficulty of the problem.

957
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:32,590
I haven't decided whether
to discuss the whole,

958
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:36,240
the cosmology of paradise of the,
of the,

959
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:41,290
of the universe that appears in Canto 29
of paradise where Dante goes on talking

960
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:43,930
about tool universities for instance.

961
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:49,230
So there is the physical universe
that somehow he has traversed only to

962
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:51,060
understand that when he goes there,

963
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:54,610
there is another universe which is
completely spiritual and it's not the

964
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:57,190
platonic idea of an inverted,
you know,

965
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,700
played with this idea of an inverted
cosmos. We are in the world,

966
01:07:00,701 --> 01:07:05,230
which is really the projection. Yeah.
Projection and unreal projections.

967
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:09,780
It's projection meaning meaning
a shadow of, of the real costs.

968
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:14,590
It's not really that there are two
adjacent cosmos, both little real,

969
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,760
and that's the one where we live
in where we don't live beyond that.

970
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:22,570
Beyond that is a real, a
speck of sand. He says,

971
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,630
as a speck of sand you,

972
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:29,790
there is a light that clearly is the
right from which hole or creation,

973
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,080
uh,
emanates.

974
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:36,140
So God remains forever a transcendence.
Ah,

975
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:40,990
what Dante does see at the end, this
is his image, uh, in his own image,

976
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:45,250
in the plural our emerge,
which to me implies the idea that

977
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:51,600
we as Christians read the,
the whole notion of genesis is that in a,

978
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:56,680
since we are shaped in God's image,
there is our imaging God.

979
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:00,700
Okay. There is a human component
in God. So that's how he sees.

980
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,430
He sees maybe the incarnation,

981
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:07,600
but it's all of that is all
wrapped in a kind of extraordinary,

982
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:13,100
uh, and deliberate fogginess
of a overrepresentation.

983
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:16,630
Um, but the, the paradise
that he describes,

984
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:21,631
it is not the same that they're proud
of us of central delights of the Koran,

985
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:25,420
for instance. Uh, but there's
a lot of gay men play and,

986
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,840
and as the stars,
the arm motors,

987
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:33,860
this scores of paradise engages in
involves, even though the stars,

988
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,470
they're gone. When you, it,

989
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:40,480
this is literally the whole cosmos is
involved in this extraordinary dance of

990
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:46,340
love. The keeps it together, makes
it go here as opposed to say,

991
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:46,750
Lou Cliche,

992
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:51,750
this idea of an archaic universe
forever on the verge of,

993
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:57,790
of falling apart, that the,
this is the real models of,

994
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,000
of the cosmos.
You know,

995
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:04,190
let's call it Lucretia's and Virgil and
the way epicureans Epicurus and Plato,

996
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:08,480
you know, this is a
Danton the, and the heavy,

997
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:12,260
the heavy traditional is, it's very
heavy, traditional materialism.

998
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:17,790
The spiritual tradition is very small
in comparison to the heaviness of a,

999
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:18,750
of a,

1000
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:24,210
of the physical or the scholars of
physics who want to see the cosmos in

1001
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:29,310
physical terms but not the opposes it.

1002
01:09:29,311 --> 01:09:32,960
Then somehow he finds a kind of
that that's what the universe,

1003
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,130
that's what keeps the universe together
is really love and that's where we going

1004
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,030
to find out that uh, that we'll
read the rest. I don't know.

1005
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,550
I thought questions.

1006
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:51,780
Please be interest is warning Dante not
to look directly at her face because he

1007
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:55,510
might become like simile
and just turned to ashes.

1008
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,800
Do you think Dante is trying to allude
back to Medusa and the danger of just

1009
01:10:01,391 --> 01:10:06,391
looking directly into the
thesis of something so
powerful and being reduced to,

1010
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,560
you know, something that isn't human
like, oh no, I was, I was reading down,

1011
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:14,650
she said set that in mind behind nine
eyes and makeup and mirrors to the shape

1012
01:10:14,651 --> 01:10:17,880
in which, uh, which in this
mirror will appear to the SF.

1013
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:20,590
Like the mirror is sort of,
the mirror is less like the eyes,

1014
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:21,430
like the intermediary,

1015
01:10:21,431 --> 01:10:24,340
just like the shield was the
intermediary for looking at the Medusa.

1016
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:28,590
Very good question. I think
just record the question. Uh,

1017
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:32,910
the imager of Beatrice's Samela ah,

1018
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:37,740
whose smile could potentially
destroy the lover,

1019
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,450
the, the, the pilgrim who
were to look looker, her face.

1020
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:45,930
Uh, the question is, does, is
that supposed to be a salt of,

1021
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:51,230
let's call it poly Nordic variant
or version of the scene of Medusa?

1022
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,480
Uh, in a, in federal nine,
uh, who threatened also the,

1023
01:10:57,481 --> 01:11:00,780
in that case, the pilgrim, uh, with, uh,

1024
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:05,380
pacification with the turning
into stone intellect would, uh,

1025
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:08,920
would petrify that's really
the, the allegory. Uh,

1026
01:11:08,921 --> 01:11:13,090
and they are of course in the Canto
of Medusa, ah, there was always,

1027
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:17,700
always the shield, the shield of
poetry, right. The Shield will pursues,

1028
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:22,890
uh, uh, and the answer is yes. Absolutely.
This is exactly what is happening.

1029
01:11:22,891 --> 01:11:27,300
I think that this is a, yeah. If you're
thinking is, I think you are of writing,

1030
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:31,430
uh, about, uh, are you
thinking of writing? No.

1031
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,960
Uh, about Medusa? No,

1032
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,593
I haven't decided yet.

1033
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:38,710
Okay. Well, but if you think you'll be
right, I think a paper about the middles,

1034
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:42,730
I think that you are absolutely you would
and the two scenes you'd be absolutely

1035
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:47,710
correct. The story of Medusa
is what is interesting.

1036
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,970
This sort of Medusa is the story of a,
we could view it.

1037
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:54,910
We view that as you remember the
temptation of it looking at the past,

1038
01:11:55,640 --> 01:12:00,460
a way of or fuels a turning down
to cast himself as all fuse office.

1039
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,480
You know who is told not to look back
and yet or few stands for assault of

1040
01:12:05,681 --> 01:12:09,600
impatience. A kind of a
skepticism about the injunction.

1041
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:12,010
The fear that you read is it
may not really be following him.

1042
01:12:12,011 --> 01:12:16,840
He turns and losers. Some modern
mythology offers even see that low carb.

1043
01:12:16,841 --> 01:12:20,830
I'm thinking about a man by no brunch
roses. He really wanted to lose.

1044
01:12:20,831 --> 01:12:22,960
You read the sea and
because he saw this way,

1045
01:12:22,961 --> 01:12:27,250
he would write poetry so of Porridge
or can become the perpetual voice of

1046
01:12:27,251 --> 01:12:30,370
absence, etc. It doesn't not go that far,

1047
01:12:30,371 --> 01:12:34,390
but it's clear that it's tied to
a pointing experience of his own.

1048
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,600
The, the, the interesting thing
about what you are saying, uh,

1049
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:43,700
we could go into that may in, in
conversation, uh, laser because it's,

1050
01:12:43,701 --> 01:12:47,030
it would take me too far.
It's that this enigmatic, the,

1051
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:52,050
the double phase of Beatrice comes
to the fore here that she has,

1052
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,113
you know,
uh,

1053
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:59,380
she was confronting this Irene
and threatens against the siren.

1054
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:03,130
And now she also appears as the,
uh,

1055
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:07,900
the sorcery and in danger of beauty,
beauty.

1056
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:12,190
That is that which was the language
here is beauty. Beauty, which can,

1057
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,800
which we,
we hunger after.

1058
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:19,190
And yet it's that which can
destroy us. And, and, and, and,

1059
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:23,290
and this seems to me to be, uh,
I, I put that in the, in the,

1060
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,840
in the consciousness
of the Dantes, uh, uh,

1061
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:28,930
the contemporary thieves
that Dante represents,

1062
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:33,760
this doubleness that you wrong to
see. And yet you may not have to, you,

1063
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,970
you better, you are better off
than not seeing. But it's true.

1064
01:13:36,971 --> 01:13:41,971
That appears also with the ambiguity
of beauty and the beauty of Beatrice.

1065
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:43,300
That's, that would be true. Yes.

1066
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:49,090
So if, so, if the mirror is sort of
like intermediary, just like the shield.

1067
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:53,630
Like, what role does, um, vision
and the eyes play in, in, in,

1068
01:13:53,631 --> 01:13:55,690
in mediating between what
you see in the world and,

1069
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:57,370
and in the mind that it protects?

1070
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:01,650
Well, Dante, we'll law is no slowly, uh,

1071
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,990
slowly preparing for this final vision.

1072
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,700
And this is going to have
intermediate stages. Uh,

1073
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:12,100
when he will see at the end he will see a,
not God,

1074
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,160
he will see his own image
within the beatific vision.

1075
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:22,570
This is how far he will go.
Not only that, he will go, oh,

1076
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:27,220
also there in the clips of the,
in that I have memory, you know,

1077
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:31,460
memory is thought of as being the, in
the eye of the imagination. That's the,

1078
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,370
the classical d, uh, uh, the
script definition of a, of memory.

1079
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:39,670
And that too will be completely clips.
He will forget.

1080
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,190
So that at the end of all this experience,

1081
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:46,410
we are ending up with a
forgetfulness, uh, with,

1082
01:14:46,411 --> 01:14:48,490
with a full from that vision.

1083
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,980
I don't know that I'm answering exactly
your question, but I don't know that, uh,

1084
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:57,010
I haven't understood which really want
to know, uh, which really asking. So

1085
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:02,240
I guess I'm just asking more about the
role of vision, like it makes visualness.

1086
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:05,310
Okay. Yeah. Just like it is the,

1087
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:09,210
I suppose to be an intermediary or,
or protection of,

1088
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:10,710
of the mind and what you think

1089
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,190
the I, the, the, the,

1090
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,080
what is the eye is the intermediary
or the, Oh, an extension of the mind.

1091
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:23,890
That's really what it,
what the I is by the visual he will have,

1092
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:28,060
is not going to be a physical vision.
It can not be a physical vision.

1093
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:32,570
This could be a spiritual vision. And
so there are the limitations of the sea.

1094
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,660
That's, let me leave that, that I'm
going to get that. Okay. Thank you.

1095
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:38,350
See you next time.
