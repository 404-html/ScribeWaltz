1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,910
Last time, um, I
finished, uh, we finished,

2
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:09,610
we're not on a little note
as you recall, that, uh,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,780
the detail of the garden where the
pilgrims finds himself and meet the,

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
the other,

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,330
we have a poet and he declares in a
way that seems to be really prideful,

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,550
uh,
on his place in this trajectory,

7
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:33,960
this literary, uh, poetic
tradition. And, um,

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,340
I was emphasizing God's timing.
This is a detailed that opens, uh,

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,890
for us,
uh,

10
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:45,450
opens her eyes to the
ambiguity of gardens,

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,420
the ambiguity as Dante world go on,

12
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:52,980
dramatizing this idea of this
ambiguity of gardens throughout,

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,160
uh, purgatorio specialty and then
at a other areas in, in, in, in,

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,130
in oblique ways,

15
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:03,840
not necessarily monotonously
a bucolic language.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,220
Uh, this idea of the,
the ambiguity of gardens.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,260
What are some of these abuses
and can't have for, uh,

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,860
we are drawn naturally to gardens.
Uh,

19
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:18,290
and we are drawn to gardens
because they reflect for us, uh,

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,340
some he verge of, of the, especially
if you're traveling through hell,

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,850
then you do want this sort
of, uh, you, you explore,

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,940
you enter willfully this place that bears
the finger prints of the human hand.

23
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,550
Uh, it's something which had
been elaborated by human beings.

24
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:42,600
This is a divine place and
unless gardens mean that for us,

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,730
but at the same time they,

26
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,850
they give us a sense of security and in
its enclosure also sense of our lordship

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,470
over them. You know, it's
something we can control.

28
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,760
It's something that we see and uh,
and, and, and where we feel we belong.

29
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,970
This is exactly the temptation that
the pilgrim experiences in Canto for.

30
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,070
He relaxes. And this happens to all
heroes in epic to the epic tradition.

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,200
When they enter gardens, they
even, uh, set aside their arms.

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,830
They get these armed
in more ways than one.

33
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,750
That is to say they come to understand
that they are, this is a place of shelter,

34
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,800
a place which is so peaceful and idyllic.

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,980
That one is no longer or need
not feel that one is in danger.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,360
In effect.
That's where the danger is most powerful.

37
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,190
Dante experiences a danger,

38
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,480
the danger he experiences
that have a poetic Hubris.

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,280
He is descending into humility.
That's the trajectory of his journey.

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,000
And there he rests with
Houma, Virgil, Lucan,

41
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,950
et cetera.
And he just says he feels that he belongs,

42
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,430
that his hi genius allows him
to be right there with them.

43
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,790
I remind you of this little detail
exactly what say that it allows me to say

44
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:10,630
more precisely, uh, what,
what the problems are the
representation of gardens,

45
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,810
but especially to emphasize that can't
have five and the drama that is unfolded

46
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:21,040
in Canto Five,
a drama ostensibly of desire.

47
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,720
It's a story of, uh, the
great passion of a woman.

48
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:30,380
One of the most famous women in
literature, uh, uh, Francesca, uh,

49
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,010
has with her in brother-in-law bowel.

50
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,340
But the point is that that drama stems
directly from the crisis in the pilgrims

51
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,200
mind. In Canto four of
inferno. In what way?

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,440
It is as if the experience of Hubris
about the celebrating one's home power and

53
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:55,321
prowess is a port now his to confront
the consequences of that claim.

54
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,170
Now Dante comes literally face to face
with a reader of his poetry and the

55
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:06,400
reader reads poetry who understands
his poetry in a way that that was not

56
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,850
necessarily the one
intended by its author.

57
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,130
We have now in Canto five
the confrontation of reader
and port and we just did

58
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:20,620
for Francesca is of course,
as you remember from your
reading, just having, having,

59
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,980
having read Canto five is
a great reader of texts.

60
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,160
She goes home port in glance a lot,
not,

61
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,170
not in the version of critiquing
the Torah, but it's, it's,

62
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:33,890
it's a parallel version. Uh, the
assistance, the same bromance.

63
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,360
Uh, she goes home quoting
from the art of courtly love,

64
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,230
this text about the art of love by,
and there's Capilano's a,

65
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,690
you may remember,
I,

66
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,810
I alluded to at least in one of the
earlier talks and goes on actually quoting

67
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,803
to Dante,

68
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,490
Dante's own toy him in the Vietnam war
that we should go and root cat in a,

69
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,530
in a while. So, uh, let's start with
Canto five. Where are we in the port?

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,800
What, what, where are we located?
We are in the second circle.

71
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,830
This your notes will tell you will in the
larger area of so called incontinence.

72
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,740
And I really should emphasize
to you something about that.

73
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,860
We should look at it the more
it more detail further on,

74
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,900
but something about the topography,

75
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,340
the moral topography of hair.
What is the disposition?

76
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:24,910
So what is the distribution
of sins and sinfulness?

77
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:27,460
What is actually a sin?
But what,

78
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,980
what are we to understand
for sale for the time being?

79
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:34,660
I'll tell you that for Dante, it's
the will, which is the locals of sin.

80
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,510
You cannot really seen intellectually,

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,270
you cannot have commit
since with your mind.

82
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,590
You can have your mind which partakes
and becomes an accomplice of the wheel,

83
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,520
but it's primarily in the
will in the, the, the,

84
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:52,540
the voluntary action that you
find. Uh, you find sinfulness.

85
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,320
That's the first thing. But what are
we now in the area of incontinence? Uh,

86
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,870
what does that mean? Well, one thing,
a way of making it very simple,

87
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:03,410
you probably should know that the,
um,

88
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:06,080
that the,
the shape,

89
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,090
the diagram of the soul for Dante
is Mary classical, very ancient.

90
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:14,540
It's really, uh, Aristotelian,
it's the idea of,

91
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,930
it's more or less figured as a triangle.
Uh,

92
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,490
uh,
which with on the left side you have,

93
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,760
because it's always the left,
the wheel, the area of the wheel.

94
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,500
And then on the right side you
have the area of reason. Okay.

95
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,780
Where the tool, faculties of
the soul, there are two factors,

96
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:38,120
like two feet of the body. Uh,
the two faculties of the soul,

97
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,830
uh, where they lead. It's in the
middle ages using a classical term,

98
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,230
the call sin. They're
assessed as to say, yeah,

99
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:48,080
this is the other of free will
in order to have free will.

100
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,970
You have a conjunction
of both will a reason.

101
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:54,890
And that's the beginning of the moral
life. It's not the end of it at all.

102
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,280
It's really when, not only when
you're really free, we will is free.

103
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,360
Then you can start making decisions, are
getting engaged in the world around you.

104
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,710
Now the soul is divided into three parts,
is a tripartite structure,

105
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,530
and begins at the bottom. It's so
cold. I should put it on the side.

106
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,880
Will the [inaudible] percent appetite,

107
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,770
which is really what Francesca
experiences, you know, the, the, the, uh,

108
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:23,540
in continents, uh, lost in this
form later we'll be gluttony,

109
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,350
et cetera. Uh, average is per
the gallery in the middle area.

110
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,050
Here you would have
the sensitive appetite,

111
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,850
which is really the middle ground
of Dante's hell, uh, violence,

112
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,670
uh, uh, the kind of beastiality,
uh, that takes over the,

113
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:44,130
the, the human mind. And then the
third is the rational. Okay? So, uh,

114
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,380
the older, the geometry of hair, uh,

115
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,390
in a way,
his pattern on the older of the soul,

116
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,350
the idea of this all in, of course,
in an inverted, inverted form,

117
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,120
we begin within the area of concupiscence,
the area of lust.

118
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,710
Someone was asking me what it was last,
last drive.

119
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:07,050
I think that we're going to have,
uh,

120
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,100
some kind of understanding a partner.

121
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,640
So this is where we are in
the aid of incontinence.

122
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:16,330
The first one is it's lost over,

123
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,800
Dante would call in with a formula.

124
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:23,801
It's the area of the sinners
who have inverted the,

125
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:25,520
the older,

126
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:30,080
the hierarchical order of
the reason and the will,

127
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,750
they have made pleasure, uh, the,

128
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:37,751
they have invested pressure with Supreme
Lordship over the older of rationality.

129
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:40,070
So, uh, recently somehow them,

130
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,220
or it's going to be used as a rationale
to explain as a kind of way of,

131
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:50,210
uh, creating alibis
for the passion of, uh,

132
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,880
of, of Francesca. So this is, uh,

133
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,810
this is the way the Canto begins. Um, the,

134
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,590
uh, the second thing that I, I have
to mention as we read here is, um,

135
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,460
the particular, uh,
landscape that Dante evokes.

136
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:11,090
It's a landscape of souls go around,

137
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,390
swirling around in,
in a kind and sort of a circular,

138
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,160
circular structure.

139
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,570
And let me tell you a little detail here
that you have to be careful as you read

140
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,680
the poem, even about the directions
of the pilgrim. Uh, for instance,

141
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:30,300
if I were to ask you, which is Dante
descending into a spiral of hair,

142
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,640
uh,
and then we'll move into a spiral.

143
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,030
It's very difficult if you're really
going left or right, of course, but he's,

144
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,200
he goes out of the way to say that he's
always going left word leftward because

145
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,130
it's descending and as soon
as we get to purgatorial,

146
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,880
he goes out of their way to tell
us that he's now going right word,

147
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,450
which is to say that hell
is the inverted cosmo.

148
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:56,870
So purgatorial. So it's really, he's
always going the same way. Only that is,

149
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,230
it goes into hell. It's going
down and his, his inverted,

150
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,540
when he has to go from
health to Purgatorio,

151
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,220
the operation is going to be that of
turning upside down in order to go finally

152
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:11,070
in the straight way, the right way. Uh,

153
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,720
the other detail is that the,
the, the symbolism of the circle,

154
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,120
which is, you know, is
very ancient, very old.

155
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,580
There are a number of ways of
understanding direction in, uh,

156
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,870
in the Middle Ages.
For instance,

157
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:29,850
the linear direction implies that of
human beings who are caught in time and

158
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:34,350
they are going to some kind of
purpose of precise destination.

159
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,970
The angels are those who circled
around the throne of God,

160
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:43,140
so that the circle implies the
plenitude and perfection of movement.

161
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,220
Clearly Francesca is involved,
uh,

162
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,760
who is called in in a world of
love and the passion of love.

163
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,270
She's giving a kind of parotic version,

164
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,300
a caricature of a,

165
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,870
of the circular perfect
movements of the mind. Uh, and,

166
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,250
and of the angels around the,
around the, uh, the, the, the,

167
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,740
the divinity, uh, the spiral,

168
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:10,920
which is the movement of
the pilgrim combines line.

169
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,620
And circle implies that Dante is really,

170
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,490
the mind is going in a circular way
around the divinity, but he's also has,

171
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,690
has a purpose as an Ame, uh, to reach.

172
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,750
So here the two, uh, uh,

173
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,780
Francesco and Paolo are going around
in circles circles that we'll have and

174
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:31,480
their work experience. No
rest. I think that the,

175
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,730
the principle behind this representation
of a desire as displacement is idea is

176
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,700
always a potter's presence.
Something that valorizes greatly.

177
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,050
That's the ambiguity of Dante's
thinking. Uh, uh, desire is displacement.

178
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,990
So in this case, powdered
Francesca, they get nowhere.

179
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,950
And yet it's exactly this displacement
that makes us aware that we are never,

180
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:57,790
what do we should be,
that our hearts at all is out of place.

181
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,090
It's what our Gustin says
in the confession that the,

182
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:05,860
he begins the confessions with the
awareness stuff. His heart, he says, uh,

183
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,520
is, is, uh, I'm quiet. You know,

184
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,640
that the idea of the quietness
of the heart out of place.

185
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,090
So that's what he's enacting, not
this moving within the larger, um,

186
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,000
pattern of Guston's thinking
about, uh, about desire.

187
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,070
Uh, and there'll be a
lot of talk about, say,

188
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:27,100
you know what the word desire by the way,
which is it English as the same as,

189
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,450
as it's an Italian or, or in Latin, you
know what it means. It's, it's, it's,

190
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,910
it's linked to the stars, you know, to,

191
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:38,530
to have desire is to know that
you are not, uh, quite, uh, uh,

192
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,260
see that, uh, at the end
they see that, uh, you know,

193
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,270
we are so two very movable removed
from the, the, the, the world of, uh,

194
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,160
of stars. Uh, uh, it's, it's, uh,
it's, it's a word that is linked,

195
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,620
usually is consideration.
In other words,

196
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:56,270
that implies that the mind
moves alongside, you know,

197
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:58,570
who you consider when I consider her.

198
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,780
My light spent when you consider is,

199
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,710
is a way of moving with a along the mind
managers to move with the circularity

200
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:07,630
imperfection on the side.

201
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,960
All of this is irrelevant to the
point that it's at hand here.

202
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:18,280
Uh, [inaudible] meets a, so we are
in the world of begins is, uh, this,

203
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:22,880
this candle with a number
of, um, a number of,

204
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,850
uh, metaphors of, of birds. You,
you realize that first of all,

205
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:32,650
he starts at online's 30 about
the hellish storm. It's, no, it's,

206
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,340
it's, it's the externalizing of, of, uh,

207
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,030
the storm inside the,
the in the storm never resting,

208
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:43,300
seizes and drives the spirits before.
It's my thing,

209
00:13:43,301 --> 00:13:47,350
a world in them about et
cetera. It continues. Uh,

210
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,240
and this in the cold
season, the wings bear, uh,

211
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,660
the starlings along the broadens
flock. So does the blast, the blast,

212
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,870
that wicked spirits hitter
data downward upward.

213
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,550
It drives them no hope if a
conference and not to say of rest,

214
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,790
but have less pain. And then
the cranes and Dante asks, uh,

215
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Virgil Master,
who are these people that black hair,

216
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,030
so scorchers and now have an
enumeration and other, uh,

217
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,130
application of the epic epic,
an epic device,

218
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,220
enumerating the epic,
uh, that, that, that has,

219
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,340
it's always driven by the desire for
totality to include all things within the

220
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:35,490
commpass of its representation.
Always says, uh,

221
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,870
this enumerative style.

222
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:42,340
And now here we have a number of figures
that Dante points are that the virtual

223
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,760
points out and then all
queens at the beginning,

224
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,070
queens of founders of cities.
Keep this in mind.

225
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,620
It was a thing, a part of the
issues that Dante is raising.

226
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,260
And you can think about it,
we can talk about it if you wish,

227
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,470
is the relationship with an airbrush
and politics are pleasure and the city.

228
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,220
Where does,
where does pleasure,

229
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,490
what is the place of pleasure
in the economy of the city?

230
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:15,080
Man.
W W W W let's see who they are.

231
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:20,081
One is the empress of people
of many tongues who so
corrupted by licentious vice

232
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,040
that she made lust lawful in hello to
take away the scanned on who she was

233
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:32,210
brought and the, and the, and the,
and the emphasis of the lioness.

234
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,540
This lust becoming lawful last,

235
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,230
becoming a public and, and,
and, and, and accepted.

236
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:44,090
And she's Semiramis of Syria, uh,
whom within the success niners.

237
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,340
Uh, uh, then, uh, the
next one is dido. Who is,

238
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,780
uh,
uh,

239
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,410
both Virgil invention in many ways.
We're,

240
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:59,360
we're Virgil in the AENEID.
This is a reflection on the hernia.

241
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:03,630
There's a poem of love
to, you know, the, the uh,

242
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,800
can unknown, but think
about the, the place of, uh,

243
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,540
how Rome Rome's conquest,
uh,

244
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,730
could appear to be libido of power,

245
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:16,100
Libido Dominandi and yet,

246
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,130
and he's really playing with
the idea that the, uh, uh,

247
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,130
Rome of Roma as you know,
is the,

248
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,450
what we call the have to use this term.
It was, I can't think of an English term,

249
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,160
uh, boost referred on. You know, what
it needs that boost profit on, right?

250
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,870
It was proffered on,
it's an easy,

251
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,280
it's the Greek term meaning a reversal,
a Roma,

252
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,810
right as in a mirror
becomes arm or you know,

253
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,040
it's Venus is the mother of an years.

254
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,250
So there is this idea again of a link
in the link between love or a love and,

255
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,100
and politics in the city.
And Virgil writes there near the,

256
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,880
literally as a love poem,
Mr Say,

257
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:09,380
the ideology of Rome is
an ideology or based on,

258
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,320
on of Rome is an ideology based on desire.

259
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,090
The which Augustan will counter by saying,
yeah,

260
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:21,290
this is not really love.
This is lust for power.

261
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:25,620
And the distinction that
someone was raising here, uh,

262
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,690
the gentleman was raising last time
about how his lost related to love.

263
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,930
You already start seeing the antagonism
between the two of them are Gustin I

264
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,440
Roman, uh, an African,
but a Roman Roman thinker,

265
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,600
uh, is really writing about and belongs
and reflect on the great myths and the

266
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:48,920
mythology of Rome.
And to him this is true in the,

267
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,330
but it's especially true in the city of
God where he just does juxtaposes the

268
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:58,350
earthly state, they roam to the
heavenly city, the heavenly Jerusalem,

269
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:01,220
the two cities are opposed to each other.
They're,

270
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:06,230
he reflects or Rome as a
city based on lust for power.

271
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:07,920
And from that point of view,

272
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,100
really not different from any other
empires that are all Rome or like car,

273
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,720
say the Persian empire,

274
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:20,721
the Greek claims for empire and whatnot
are all part where long Cifo of,

275
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,330
uh, of uh, violence and uh, uh,

276
00:18:24,331 --> 00:18:27,960
imperial imperial fantasies.

277
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,090
So Dante is,
is,

278
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:34,530
is thinking along along these lines and
we shall see where that will take him in

279
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,960
a moment.
Then that is Cleopatra's Egypt.

280
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,820
Allan and the story of the
four of uh, of, of Troy.

281
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,410
And then finally, the story of
Tristan, who as you know, belongs,

282
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:51,060
is really a medieval medieval inventure
Tristan and these old we are going to

283
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:55,400
see now Lancelotta Guinevere
in a moment. So, uh,

284
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,740
the presence of Tristan shows one thing
that all the heroes and heroines of

285
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:06,021
antiquity are viewed through
the lenses of medieval romances.

286
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,890
They may belong to the grand epics
of classes, the classical world.

287
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,600
Dante will see them through that.

288
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,500
Optics of a romance is
the literature of Desire.

289
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,850
And she showed me more than a thousand
shades named them as he pointed.

290
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:25,170
This is the, the, the, the, the
catalog of the epic catalog. Welcome,

291
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,850
love parted from our life.

292
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:32,420
When I heard my teacher named the
Knights and ladies of old times,

293
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,480
pity came upon me and that
was as one big wilderness.

294
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,500
Now,

295
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,500
this is really the first time that Dante
introduces the notion of pity in the

296
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,830
poem and we shall see by the end of the,

297
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,580
of the cancer that is going
to be overwhelmed by Peter
and he's going to faint

298
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,620
after he hears the story of Francesca.
You're so overwhelmed that he fell.

299
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:03,300
He says like a dead body falls.
It's a feigned tickets. It's, it's,

300
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,580
it's sympathy. Maybe it's a little
bit of a self recognition. Maybe it's,

301
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,620
we shall see that it's a way of coming
to grips with his own responsibilities.

302
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,420
Maybe,
maybe some of his responsibilities.

303
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,710
But the point I want to make there with
this pity is that you do know that he

304
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:22,680
does not know the RPA.
The poetics of our store too,

305
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,390
or he knows whatever is
available are through Horace.

306
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,660
And he knows it's quite
a lot. Uh, the, the,

307
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,100
the point here is that Dante goes over,
reflects,

308
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,290
they commit a paper topic for
some of you enterprising spirit.

309
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:41,910
Some of you may be on the
relationship between pity and justice.

310
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,330
How throughout the poem he goes on
thinking about this two terms is that's

311
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,660
justice necessarily.

312
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,690
Need pity or is there some kind of justice
that must learn how to be ptls that

313
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,120
has no place for,

314
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:03,330
for this kind of compassion or the two
necessarily antagonistic or is there some

315
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:09,400
way of, of, of thinking
of, of uh, of a meeting,

316
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,450
a meeting point between them? This is
the first time he introduces this, uh,

317
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,570
this idea of pity kind of recognition.

318
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,740
So to have a sense that it could
be he who is in that, that,

319
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,410
that position and he begins poet.

320
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,570
I would feign speak with this tool that
go together and seem so light upon the

321
00:21:28,571 --> 00:21:29,320
wind.

322
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,320
So he doesn't talk to any of the major
classical figures he chooses to people

323
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:39,020
from his own time. Two
people from the ordinary, uh,

324
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,550
life around him to people in the dust.
By this time,

325
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,240
Dante may very well be
living in that area of Italy,

326
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:50,150
which is Ravenna, not quite
Ravenna, but in that area or oven,

327
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,050
the shall see when they are
near us and that intrigued them.

328
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:54,610
Then by the love that leads them.

329
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,270
And they will come as soon as
the wind band or weirded sold,

330
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,420
come and speak to us and speak with us.

331
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,730
If one four bids it not,

332
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,770
you realize that the name of God is
never mentioned here in hell. If not,

333
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,090
uh, as a, as a discourse that
takes place here on earth.

334
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,780
But the souls in hell,
we'll all use,

335
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:19,750
always use paraphrased
stick constructions.

336
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,810
Turns of phrases as if it would be,

337
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,610
it would be highly improper or for Dante
to allow them or driven for them to

338
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:31,120
acknowledge that which they never really
acknowledged. Now if it's one, four bids,

339
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:35,860
it not, and then as dove someone
but desire are come with wings.

340
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:40,210
Pose the motion for the sweetness
born by the wheel through the air.

341
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,800
So this lift, the trooper dido
is again the presence of Dido,

342
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,660
uh, that, that the Virgilian,
the Virgilian myth of Dido.

343
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,850
Um,
and also the other possibility of Rome,

344
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,170
uh,
virtual is writing about the,

345
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,610
the great battle between Carthage
and Rome is two ways of choosing the

346
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:07,120
civilization to ways of,
of deciding how one should organize.

347
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,750
One I should want to experiment
with, uh, with, with cities. Uh, um,

348
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,730
so coming to us through the
malignant hair, such force, uh,

349
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,490
had my loving core,
uh,

350
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,300
and now listen to how Francesca
speech or living creature,

351
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,830
gracious and friendly, who goes
through the murky air visiting us,

352
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:30,640
who stay in the world with blood. She's
killed. She was killed by the way,

353
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,940
but her husband who caught Francesca
and his brother Paolo in a trust.

354
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,410
So it's, so that's what the
illusion to the blood is.

355
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:46,100
If the king of the universe where our
friend would pray to for the piece,

356
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,510
since the has pity over
evil plight of work,

357
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,610
which are pleased to hear and
speak here and speak with you,

358
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:55,790
what the wind is quiet and here it is,

359
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,930
and how she begins the description
of her life when she was born.

360
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,570
Most of the narratives in, in, in,

361
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:06,760
in fentanyl begin with this idea of birth,
your soul,

362
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,540
that in the case of Virgil and you see her
once again here in the case of, uh, of,

363
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:15,720
uh, in the case of Francesca
and the begin with birth, uh,

364
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,150
for a number of reasons, but
because birth is for Dante, the,

365
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,420
that event that somehow could potentially
have changed and they've imparted the

366
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:30,140
different direction to the
world. All could. And, uh,

367
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:32,680
and nothing is in the case
of Francesca insights,

368
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,790
very a great piece of literature, but she
of herself, uh, did not worry, achieve,

369
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,050
achieve much.

370
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,250
And now she talks about her city in
terms of clear the contrast with this

371
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,610
movement of the souls caught in the storm.

372
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,730
There they go endlessly, uh, in the air.

373
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,410
And now she evokes the place of what
she really wants is, is, is, is rest.

374
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:59,600
The city where I was born lies emerge
of a stability of a city she has lost

375
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,410
where the pole with the streams
are jointed, descend to rest.

376
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,500
And now three tercets in Italian,

377
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,810
all beginning with the word love,

378
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,580
love made into kind of
transcendent divinity.

379
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:18,080
It is the great subject of,
uh,

380
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,170
of her experience. Look at this love, um,

381
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,490
love which quick is quickly kindled.

382
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:30,491
And the gentle heart sees this man for
the fair form that was taken from me and

383
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:33,590
the manner afflicts Mr. Love,

384
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,330
which absorbs no one beloved from loving
sees me so strongly with this charm.

385
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,460
This RCS does not leave me yet.

386
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,440
Love brought us to one
death when she saying, well,

387
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:48,590
a number of things and that will have
to give this to you. First of all,

388
00:25:48,591 --> 00:25:52,850
she's really quoting, uh, important
literature. The first line,

389
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,380
uh, love which, uh, uh, uh,

390
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,960
it's translational is love,
uh, which absorbs known love,

391
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,110
which is quickly kindled
in the gentle heart.

392
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,240
And you know that this is really a
quotation from one of Dante's Sonnets,

393
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,620
the Vita Nuova that you
read, Chapter 20. Love,

394
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,970
that's her Dante starts.

395
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,330
And the gracious heart are a single
thing is Dante quotes the poetics of the

396
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:23,330
sweet new salaries when need, certainly
he says, tells us in his poem,

397
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,340
one can more be without the other one
can no more be without the other then one

398
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,170
that then can the reasoning mind
without its reasons et cetera. So, uh,

399
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,770
it's,
it's clearly meant for Francesca to

400
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:43,390
flatter the sense of
authorship of the poet himself.

401
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,220
It's part of a seductive strategy also
that she could use the second image that

402
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:50,710
about love that uh,

403
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,890
does not allow anyone who loves from
returning reciprocating the love.

404
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,070
It really comes from the so called rules
of love that Meridian Shampine dictates

405
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,600
in book three of the art of courtly
love. And I want to read this. Uh,

406
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,760
it's, the translation is not quite
all that accurate, but I think,

407
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:16,690
uh, I'm sorry I get the wrong one.
The wrong book. The Art of culture.

408
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:21,000
He loved the book three and these are the
famous, it ends with the rules of love.

409
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:24,690
I will, I will, I'll explain what
they are. And rule nine says it,

410
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,640
I can really read some of them to use so
they have an understanding of what real

411
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:33,710
love is it this is the mind of which
applies very well to Francesca.

412
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:37,730
Francesca imagines herself
is really a quarterly, uh,

413
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,180
love heroin.
She lives in the world of a king.

414
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,400
God is the king of the universe, is in
the court of the King of love. May Be,

415
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,730
and these are some of the,
the, the concerns of the, the,

416
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:54,060
the rules of love and they are
difficult to love marriages.

417
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,340
No real excuse for not loving.

418
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,200
It's a way of saying adultery is the law.
Of course we love.

419
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,740
He who is not jealous.
Number two cannot love.

420
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,500
No one can be bound by a double
love and then they come home.

421
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,830
Boys do not love until they
arrive at the age of maturity.

422
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:16,350
It leaves that very unclear what
the age of maturity can be. Seven,

423
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:20,820
when one lover dies and we'd hold of
two years is required of the survivor.

424
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,230
Number eight, no one should be deprived
of love with at the very best of reasons.

425
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,310
Number nine,

426
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,410
no one can love a less one is
impelled by somebody else's love,

427
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,940
which is exactly the line that
Francesca mentions. Number nine,

428
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,270
why this rules of love and what are they
and what is she saying where Andre has

429
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:47,571
first of all this oil by having this rules
of love and having a reducing love to

430
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:48,420
or not,

431
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:53,420
it's a way of acknowledging that love
is the most transgressive disruptive of

432
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,990
all experiences and therefore
it needs to be formalized.

433
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,560
It needs to be contained,
made, may be part of a game,

434
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,660
isn't perhaps is the thrust of undress
Capilano's thinking or made to be part of

435
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:15,480
an acceptable ceremony, which is the other
possible reading of what is happening.

436
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,120
Francesca false s completely,
uh,

437
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,580
squarely within this
tradition of believing that
she lived in a world of love

438
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,550
where there is no other
possible resistance in effect,

439
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,350
these three persons with which, which
I read to you about love La, I love,

440
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,770
they're really meant to cast love as
a transcendent force that no one can

441
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:41,380
really, uh, she at least cannot withstand.

442
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,360
What she's doing is advocating
the power of her will tool,

443
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:51,340
the irresistible, omnipotent,
uh, presence of this love.

444
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,720
It's part of a strategy, none of
acknowledging and the responsibility,

445
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,810
it's part of its strategy to
instead find for herself an alibi.

446
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,370
I was made to do that.

447
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,550
The literature of yours and the literature
of Andrea [inaudible] work filters of

448
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:13,330
love. You understand what I mean? How in
romances you always have filters of love.

449
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,980
No one is going to take the
responsibility. It's like,
well, uh, you know, the,

450
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,150
uh, I had too much to drink or
I read a great poem or whatever.

451
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,160
And so I was doing that.

452
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,460
It's a way for Dante to show the,

453
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,480
the blindness of Francesca to the reality
of her situation and this where she is

454
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,200
a kind of willingness to give up that
which is really the quality of sin and the

455
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:45,310
trait of sin. Habit. Sin
Is sin and the measuring,

456
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:48,260
which it has become a habit,
a way of,

457
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,200
a way of clinging to it
and not acknowledging that
there may be some kind of

458
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:56,500
alternative or something
different, uh, to it.

459
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,680
So Dante goes on now enter entertaining
the arguments when answer to be an alas,

460
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,860
how many sweet thoughts, great desire
brought them to the wolf house.

461
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,560
And then Francesca that torments,

462
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:11,830
make me weep for grief and pity.

463
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,950
Pat Tell in the time we switched time,

464
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:19,720
how and what occasion did love grandchild
to know you're uncertain desires.

465
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,620
And she answered,

466
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:25,330
there is no greater pain than to recall
the hippie time and misery and this

467
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:26,860
strategic a teacher knows.

468
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,690
But if that has so great desire
to know our loves first route,

469
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,650
which is a way of almost even
that metaphor of the root of love,

470
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,180
the origin of love,
she calls it the root of love,

471
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,580
as if the passion,
her passion with the flower of,

472
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,270
of love.
Uh,

473
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,220
I shall tell as well as one
way that we've in talent.

474
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,590
We read one day for the past time of
Lancelot have constrained him where alone

475
00:31:56,591 --> 00:32:00,280
and had no misgivings many times that
reading through our eyes together and

476
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:02,800
change the color in our faces.
But one point alone,

477
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:07,801
it was that mastered us when we read
for the long for smile was kissed by so

478
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:11,290
great a lover. He who never shall
be parted from me or trembling,

479
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,620
kiss my mouth a gully Aalto was a
book and he that wrote it that day.

480
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:22,140
We read in it no farther while
the one spirit said this,

481
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,800
the other Paolo whose name
means little Latin as you know,

482
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:30,030
palace small web.
So that for PT,

483
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:34,390
as soon as if in death and
joked dropped like a dead body,

484
00:32:34,391 --> 00:32:38,830
and that's the end of the camp
where we could say it's, it's uh,

485
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,090
it's an amazing a story undoubtedly would,
we will talk about a number of things.

486
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,100
The first thing he is, uh, uh, that
this is a scene represented through,

487
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,820
um, uh, reading the
story of reading. Yeah.

488
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:58,430
You're aware of that, right? This
is clearly, uh, she reads the reads,

489
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:00,710
it says that we're one day
they were reading for delight.

490
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,940
That's probably part of, um, the, the,

491
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,770
the concerns that Dante has. How
should we read? If we read for Delight,

492
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,570
they read for delight. Uh, is there some
other way of reading? Uh, it's delight.

493
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,550
Clearly it's, it's, it's the constitutive
elements of reading literary texts.

494
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,460
But is there something else
that we could do along the way?

495
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,460
What is her problem really that's
continued with this idea of reading.

496
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,450
She's reading the story of
Lancelot Lancelot and Guinevere.

497
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,990
You do know the stories,
especially if you could re it's not,

498
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,990
it's not the story of creating the
club or you could easily go on. Uh,

499
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,930
if you want to write about creating the
Trois Lancelot and camp of five, you can,

500
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:47,060
Dante does refer to the
stories of critique that
floor often in his theoretical

501
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:49,280
works, uh, the story of a landfill,

502
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,340
the story of adulterated court Lancelot
is the secret lover of the Queen,

503
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,570
clearly out of the desire.

504
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:04,610
And that says something about the nature
of desire to really supplant the king.

505
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,510
Arthur. They said, triangle.

506
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,360
Here it stay a triangle
of desire. Uh, and, and,

507
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:17,060
and Francesca imitates his triangle.
I will talk to about it in a moment.

508
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,330
Lancelin story of Lance Hill
to the story of, uh, uh,

509
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,470
let me go a little bit a bit into that.

510
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,010
It's the story of like all the stories of,
and they try,

511
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:32,210
they begin on the great
feasts of Christianity.

512
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,260
It's, I think it's usually the
ascension, uh, Easter Pentecost,

513
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,440
one of the great feasts,

514
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,510
and the heroes are sitting
around boasting about themselves.

515
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,530
No one of them, uh, is
doing anything heroic,

516
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,780
but they will talk about
how great they were.

517
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,250
It's a little bit like the periodic
version that you have of the battle of the

518
00:34:55,251 --> 00:34:59,000
argument between Ulysses and a,

519
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:04,001
and Ajax in the last is the last book of
the metamorphosis where they talk about

520
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,490
who is the, the, the, the,

521
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,790
the hero worthy of inheriting
the arms of the Great Achilles.

522
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,970
And they talk about not
the present prowess now,

523
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,990
but what they were in the
story of, in criterion. Uh,

524
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:22,250
clearly the idea is that the
heroic age is over and done with,

525
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,630
and the whole romance goes on exploring,
pondering about that,

526
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,950
which the reasons why the heroic age
may have come to an end. And what it is,

527
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:32,180
is that,
uh,

528
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,040
the secret love affair between
Lancelot and Guinevere,

529
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,150
the stories, thoughts,
it goes on, what are,

530
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:42,300
they are sitting around
drinking and talking.

531
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,920
A mysterious figure comes from
the outside and kidnaps the queen.

532
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,020
Then the knights who were sitting around
don't move and everybody's expecting

533
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,010
Lancelot to get up and
go and rescue the queen.

534
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,160
But he won't out of fear that if you
were to impetuous, it would be this, the,

535
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:05,880
the secret affair that he has with the
Queen would probably be be discovered.

536
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,410
That hesitation,

537
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,590
that moral hesitation of Lancelot is
really the cause of it is it's the emblem

538
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:19,340
of the falling from any store cratic
virtues that is now the intrusion of it at

539
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:23,640
time. A temporal wedge between
the thought and the action.

540
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,160
And then of course lance would have to
go and their famous cart of shame exposed

541
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:33,161
to the ridicule of the whole town before
he can go on really trying to rescue,

542
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:38,160
uh, the, the, the queen. So this
is that. If you think about it,

543
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:43,161
then the PTN is already reflecting
on the crisis of the city.

544
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,200
In terms of the private passions.

545
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:49,650
Something is really knowing at the heart.
Is it the end?

546
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:51,270
It's really the question of desire,

547
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,480
the inability to distinguish between the
public and the private Nina ability to

548
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:01,540
separate somehow the two or find
some sort of a harm threading the,

549
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,640
the, the, the line between
those two concerns. He can five.

550
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:09,510
This is really what Francesca does.
Dante's exploring reading.

551
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,720
So she is reading the texts of Lancelot
and lapses into an imitative strategy of

552
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:20,730
reading. She wants to be like
the heroin that she reads about.

553
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:26,040
She refuses to take an interpretive
distance from whatever specular emerge.

554
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,540
She wants to feel like a queen.

555
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,970
And she thinks that Paolo can be like
Lancelot. And this is exactly what,

556
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,770
what we call the mimetic quality. It's
not my term, it's the term of uh, uh,

557
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,660
uh, [inaudible] who has written about this
question of the imitative structure of

558
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,960
desire between us and
the object of desire.

559
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,940
There is always the presence of a
mediator. And this time. In this case,

560
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:53,940
the mediator is Lancelot for,
uh,

561
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,870
for Paolo entities
Guinevere for Francesca.

562
00:37:57,871 --> 00:38:00,100
But there's is more to this story.
For instance,

563
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:05,150
you can not read this story without
thinking about how don t frames the

564
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:10,530
experience of Francesca
with the language of time.

565
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:15,030
Can you see how many references
there are two time, uh,

566
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,150
there is no greater grieve
that remembering happiness,

567
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:25,170
the past happiness.
And this your doctor meaning meaning,

568
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,290
uh,
Virgil knows very well.

569
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,580
And then she starts talking about her
adventure. We were reading one day.

570
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,310
You remember that day we read no further.

571
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,990
It's soul about time.

572
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,600
About the question of
time as if an experience.

573
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,860
So what is the problem with this idea
of time? Why is Francesca understood?

574
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,550
Why is has story represented
in terms of time? In effect,

575
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,680
I think Francesca want,

576
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:56,100
there's one great passion though she
has and her passion is to do away with

577
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,830
time.
She's expressing the desire,

578
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,730
the happiness that lasts year.
Very briefly.

579
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:08,230
Brief instance may really
last an eternity, or maybe,

580
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,270
or maybe just maybe she
makes pressing the wish that,

581
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,890
or the idea,

582
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:19,490
the insight more than the wish that one
moment of happiness is well worth an

583
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:20,500
eternity of pain.

584
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,900
Or maybe she's just saying
that it's not too bad.

585
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:31,590
That the love story I had only
lasted the briefest possible time.

586
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:37,650
At any rate or all this shows is that
primarily Francesca nor only up dedicated

587
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,630
choice and not only thought that
her own wheel was powerless,

588
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,640
visa vi the resistible force of this
transcendent idea of love, but above all,

589
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,370
she's betrayed.
The less,

590
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,380
the older of necessity end time that
her passion violates the order of time.

591
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,650
And the Bravo from this point of view,

592
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Dante goes all reflecting
about his responsibilities
of an author as an author,

593
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,390
uh, when he's confronted with
the reader, what have I done?

594
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,950
What have I written?

595
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,160
That what I write has been understood
in a way that is not necessarily the one

596
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,380
that he meant.
Uh,

597
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:26,080
the meaning that he meant
to assign to the Vita Nuova.

598
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,380
So these are some of the concerns
and we can find some others.

599
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:31,360
Let me just pass on to Canto six,

600
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,480
which is really not a completely unlike
what we have been describing here.

601
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,940
Now we go into Kent Dante goals.

602
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,660
That's another part of
this other strategy.

603
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,280
Whatever Dante's found out about passion,
about desire,

604
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:56,910
about this in the world of appetites
are and whatever he has decided about

605
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:06,090
himself and the meaning of this may
have for him as a port in that scene of

606
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:09,040
fainting at the end who will go on.

607
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,020
This will become the premise for
other concerns raised in Canto six,

608
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,460
which is, you know, is a
political candidate. But this
is the strategy of Dante.

609
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,020
Let me see. I found out certain
things about me, my responsibility.

610
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,780
I found some things about the,

611
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,840
the disruptive quality of a desire
visa vi the political order.

612
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,540
Now let me find out. Let
me see. Uh, if, if, uh,

613
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,300
let me find out how our
authentic this finding may be.

614
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,610
Let me move into a public room.
So we go from the world of the court,

615
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,170
the private world of Francesca now
to literally the world of the city,

616
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,640
the world of Florence,

617
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,820
where we are still talking about
incontinence in a different form.

618
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,450
The question of Gluttony,
gluttony and uh,

619
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,100
politics and let's see.

620
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,440
So he takes elements that he has
already anticipated here in Canto five,

621
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,010
the political and goes on thinking
about politics in, in Canto,

622
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,540
in Canto six. Ah, here we
go. Then with Canto six,

623
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:16,310
the third circle, uh, the gluttonous
with the return of my mind,

624
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,200
with the return of my mind,

625
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:22,760
that was shut off when the Pto
state of the two kings fork,

626
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:27,350
which was quite confounded me with grief,
new torments and new soul's in torment.

627
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:28,940
I see about me,

628
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:32,390
whatever I move and turn and set my gaze.

629
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,580
I find first of all,
the,

630
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,820
the presence of the word mind in
Italian is maintain a Lineman,

631
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,210
a very, very, very suggestive.

632
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,010
We are dealing here now with bodies.
Canto six is all about bodies.

633
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,280
It's all about gluttonous souls where
bodies who took care of the bodies.

634
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,450
But Dante uses as a counterpoint
the question of mind as if,

635
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:00,523
uh,

636
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,760
the scene of this body's the scene of
this gluttonous has also been the scene of

637
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:07,190
not thinking in terms of mind.

638
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,280
Their mind is unnecessary counter and
necessary compliment to the presence of

639
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:14,780
bodies. They weren't mine
of course, as you know,

640
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:19,160
or an Italian in English where
mentor in Italian is meant a lot.

641
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:22,500
It meant really comes from
the Latin for measure. Uh,

642
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,570
the mind is that which measures things
that nine is that which gives a sense of

643
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:31,190
the measure of our, even our own, our
own desires and the, and the, and the,

644
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,450
and the metaphor of mind appears
throughout Canto six. Uh,

645
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:40,451
we are asked to think of that which is
missing in this biological or reflection

646
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:44,810
or reflection about the,
what I called the biology of politics.

647
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:49,240
Politics now reduced to the
question of appetites of bodies.

648
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:54,270
And it's not normally we have the pride
of minds when we think about, you know,

649
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:57,720
all the people who have whatever
fantasies, whatever Megalomania is,

650
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,850
whatever desires. But mental above
all where we talk about politics.

651
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:02,570
But here it's,

652
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,570
it's really a question of politics in
terms of the inexhaustible appetites of

653
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:09,590
bodies are.

654
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:14,710
And so we are going to talk about
politics and a and gluttony politics and

655
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:19,580
borders. Dante here meets
the figure that is presiding.

656
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:23,870
The mythological figure that is presiding
over cantos of this area of gluttony

657
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:28,480
is a, um, the classical figure
of the three headed, uh,

658
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,100
servers at way of hinting about the,
uh,

659
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,390
the voraciousness Ah, uh, the
many miles of this, uh, this, uh,

660
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:41,130
monsters animal servers, a beast,
fierce and hideous and so on.

661
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,293
Um,

662
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,800
and we do know that the landscape
is stinking and that the,

663
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:53,370
an endless rain, uh, there
are hints that this is really,

664
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,440
uh, uh, one of, uh,

665
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,750
some kind of repulsive a
form of a waste and food. Uh,

666
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:05,810
it's at the rain makes him how like
dogs and the Profane wretches, uh,

667
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,780
uh, often turned themselves a one
side making a shelter for the other.

668
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,900
When servers,
the Greek warm perceived us.

669
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,110
He opened his mouth and
showed us the fangs,

670
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:21,350
not one of his limbs keeping steel in
my leader and so on as the dog that Yelp

671
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,330
to greed and becomes quiet when it bites.

672
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:28,470
It's food being all absorbed
and struggling to devour
and such became this fall

673
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:31,590
vintages of the demon servers.
Uh,

674
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,740
we passed up the shades that were beaten
down by the heavy rain setting of feet

675
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,940
on the emptiness, which seemed
real bodies. Uh, this is,

676
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:42,840
uh,
the,

677
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,980
the great description and
figuration of Gluttony, uh,

678
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:52,350
bodies that are always
empty and the, the, the, uh,

679
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:53,610
and the are empty now,

680
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:58,620
punished to be empty as empty forms
and that they seem they're not bodies.

681
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:03,240
They seem real bodies that were all lying
on the ground except one who set up as

682
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:07,770
soon as he saw us passing before him
or thou who are led through this hell.

683
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:08,401
He said to me,

684
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:13,401
recall if thou canst thou was begun
before I was ended and other little

685
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,320
reference to birth,

686
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:21,600
the birth of Dante and the death
of that is part of a cycle.

687
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:26,080
No, there's no necessary
connection between the two
events. That death of a, uh,

688
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,020
the name is Jack,
come in and get pig.

689
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,620
That's the way he was sort of named
in the streets of Florence and a,

690
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,760
the death and the birth of the
pilgrim. I said to him, the anguish,

691
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:38,100
the anguish style perhaps takes the,

692
00:46:38,101 --> 00:46:41,880
from my memory and when the
word is mentor the mind,

693
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
so I'll not seem ever to have seen the
Tommy who you are put in a place of such

694
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:51,540
misery and the such a penalty that
fan is greater nannies, wholesome.

695
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,190
And he said to me,
thy city talking about Florence,

696
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,600
this is the politics of the city.
They city and doesn't say,

697
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:04,140
I city your city.
So He's already,

698
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,590
he chuck who views
himself as outside of it,

699
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,140
not really occupying a
place within the city,

700
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,990
which is so full of envy there already.

701
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:17,991
The sac around solver helped me within
it in the bright light when you citizens,

702
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:22,890
once again a distance of
chuck of from the the,

703
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:27,891
the city of Florence called me Chaco
for the damning full to gluttony is now

704
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:31,510
ceased.
I helpless in the rain and then my misery.

705
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:35,260
I'm not alone for all these are under
the same penalty for the same fold.

706
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:40,540
And he said no more. Okay. Here
I have to stop a little bit,

707
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,920
uh, the, to tell you what, something
that you already caught. Of course,

708
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:47,440
what the basic metaphor,

709
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,530
what the basic conceit is in this camp.

710
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,910
And it's the conceit of
the city and the body.

711
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,380
You in classical the classical world,
you are abused to the conceit between,

712
00:47:59,381 --> 00:48:03,700
of their core relationship between the
soul and the city. Uh, but for Dante,

713
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:08,310
this is a soulless city. The only way to
talk about it is through this imagery.

714
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:13,150
She's very ancient, very Roman
actually. Uh, the story of, uh, uh,

715
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,200
the city as a corporate, as a
body, as a corporate structure,

716
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,500
the image.
Some of you readers of Shakespeare,

717
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,150
you may remember your collaborators
where Coriolanus makes the same speech

718
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:28,300
about, uh, the city and the body.

719
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,190
But it really goes back to a historian
of the classical world that Dante

720
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:36,340
absolutely loves. He's
not the only one. Uh,

721
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:39,490
all the way a Dustin is
using their name is Livy,

722
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:44,530
who wrote this famous book about from
about the, from the foundation of Rome,

723
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,630
Roman historian who tells
the history of Roman.

724
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,840
One of the stories he tells
is that, uh, of, uh, uh,

725
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,660
the famous civil war in Rome,

726
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:00,460
the civil war between patricians
and Plebeians, the Plebeians,

727
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:05,410
the workers were so tired of
what was happening in the city.

728
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,470
They were doing all the work.
That's the way they complain.

729
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:13,710
But they had few of the pleasures
coming from living in the city that they

730
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:16,120
decided to cc'd.

731
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:21,020
It is a famous session whereby
they go as a kind of schism.

732
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,860
They go on the retreat
on the Aventine hills,

733
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:28,250
one of the seven hills of Rome and
the patricians, the city's paralyzed.

734
00:49:28,251 --> 00:49:32,650
And you can imagine it's a strike the
patrician send one of the enemy, sorry.

735
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:37,870
And man by the name of miniatures to
convince the Plebeians to return to the

736
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:42,871
city and my name use managers to do
this by telling the Plebeians if famous

737
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,490
fable,
which is called,

738
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:50,650
it's still known as the
stable of miniatures. What
does he tell them? He said,

739
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:55,090
look, this is really like a
body. When you have a body,

740
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:59,530
the hence work. Yeah. It seems that
the mouth and joy is, and the savers,

741
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:04,330
the great pleasures of foods and so on,
it seems that the stomach, it can be full,

742
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,930
but actually whatever they produce
and take in and they ingest,

743
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:12,570
they redistribute to the bodies, to the
rest of the, about the hands, the feet,

744
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,640
et cetera.
Because the city is like a body.

745
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:18,940
That's the analogy between the
corporate structure of the city,

746
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:23,830
the idea that the city is a
corporation and a, which by the way,

747
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:28,760
we carry on the reminder of this, the how
vital. This is what carried on a dime.

748
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:33,490
I don't have a dime with me. Uh, but if
you have a dime, you can read. Uh, a blue.

749
00:50:33,491 --> 00:50:37,730
The ooh means says one body out of
many limbs, out of many members,

750
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,960
still an image that we care. It's
still a conceit that we have. Right?

751
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,210
So the idea is,
uh,

752
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:49,540
that the city is like a body and the
plebeians are convinced and they go back

753
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,750
to,
to back to order.

754
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,570
And then recompose the order of the city.

755
00:50:56,571 --> 00:51:01,370
This is the fundamental structure here,
but I said something else,

756
00:51:01,371 --> 00:51:02,390
which is really is going to,

757
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,010
that's that believe in the
corporate structure of the city. Uh,

758
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,480
can it really hold together
and, Aye. Aye. Aye.

759
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,470
I go on submitting to you that he
no longer believes in this. If you,

760
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:17,230
when you read the Canto,
uh,

761
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,240
you will see that all the body parts are
literally littering the city there are

762
00:51:22,741 --> 00:51:27,140
mentioned the, the, the
nails, the hands, the heart,

763
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,990
the, the, the beer, the hair, et Cetera,

764
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,280
the mouth and sort of spread all over.
And,

765
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:38,310
and as if to to imply the impossibilities
of constituting this body parts into

766
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:43,580
an organic unified, uh, uh, totality. So,

767
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:44,810
um,
uh,

768
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,320
there's another little issue here that
is being raised and I want to talk about

769
00:51:48,321 --> 00:51:50,720
before the end of, uh, of the hour,

770
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:53,830
the question of civil war and
whatnot understands by civil war.

771
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:56,120
It was Dante's political thought.

772
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:01,520
The reality of his political
thinking is always the civil war.

773
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:05,090
I come to, let me just give you some
textual evidence and then we'll go on.

774
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,640
I answered him,
chuck that distressed,

775
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:12,080
so weighs on me that he beats me weep.
But Tommy,

776
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,770
if their cans,
what the citizens of the divided city,

777
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:21,260
this is not Florence shall come to
and whether any is there is just,

778
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:26,261
and tell me the cost of such discord
sailing it if an amazing image discord

779
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:31,490
because it's a musical metaphor.
Our cord, this discord,

780
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,970
but it comes from,
it makes the heart,

781
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,920
that's where the word comes from.
This scored makes the heart,

782
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:44,300
the place,
the receptacle where all the MVR,

783
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:48,200
all this jealousness that
destroyed the city, uh, are,

784
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,500
are placed, are located.
And he said to me,

785
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:55,910
after long strides there shall come to
blood and the party of the rustic shall

786
00:52:55,911 --> 00:53:00,560
drive out the other with much offense.
Then by force of one who is [inaudible],

787
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,890
meaning the pope,
that part is destined to fall.

788
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,460
This is the world's Gibbons

789
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:13,430
within which the city is divided to
four within three years and the other to

790
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:17,750
prevail long holding his head high and
keeping the fat first and the grievers

791
00:53:17,751 --> 00:53:22,010
burdens for all the tears and shame
to men are just, they're not heated.

792
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:26,010
Their pride,
envy and Alvarez,

793
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:28,530
these are the courses are the sparks.
He calls them.

794
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,160
These are the causes that have
set this hearts on fire here.

795
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,500
He made an end of his grievers, uh, uh,

796
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,070
words and then Dante goes on, uh, uh,

797
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,720
literally evoking a
street scene in Florence.

798
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,990
He goes on asking about some
other characters with the city.

799
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,240
I would still learn from the,

800
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:56,241
and I begged the to grant me further
speech Farinata he mentioned about whom we

801
00:53:56,371 --> 00:54:01,371
shall see next Thursday in Canto turn
of and the guy your main of such worth

802
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,460
Yacko boosty culture, Rigo Mosca
and the rest whose minds will say,

803
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,343
Tom will doing,

804
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:13,710
tell me where they are and giving me
knowledge of them for impressed with a

805
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:15,870
great desire to know where
they share in heaven,

806
00:54:15,871 --> 00:54:18,300
sweetness or the bitterness of hair.

807
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,310
I would like to point out to
you the presence of this, uh,

808
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:27,900
of the language of gluttony
throughout sweetness, bitterness,

809
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,270
pleasantness, unpleasantness, uh,

810
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,040
this really runs through the candles
that Canto it gives it an end links

811
00:54:35,041 --> 00:54:37,770
together,
gluttony and the politics.

812
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:42,420
It's the body can the body metaphor,
but also these other experiences.

813
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:47,460
But what is happening here is he asks
as Dante ass about this other famous for

814
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:52,310
it, his main of such worth, he says,
what are they? They achieved so much,

815
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:57,350
were so set on well doing in the city
and the the English cannot quite render

816
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,010
the ambiguity of the Italian and
beautiful Italian is Ben Factory,

817
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:05,250
which is really very difficult to
translate those you don't know if it means

818
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:08,550
doing well or doing good and that,

819
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,620
that impossibilities of deciding what
the sentence really means is exactly.

820
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:18,510
Uh, what Dante is traumatizing here is
dramatizing is the distance between human

821
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:20,260
perspective humor,

822
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:25,270
the judgments that we make as human
beings and the divine judgment on their

823
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:30,831
dealings and doings of these famous
people that the discrepancy between them

824
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:34,170
here on earth who may judge one way,
then the real,

825
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:37,700
the reality of the worth and
value of this other people. Uh,

826
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,370
that can be different. So we
are are, we are talking about,

827
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,060
he's talking about their mom. The black
soul. Say they're further down in, in,

828
00:55:46,061 --> 00:55:50,150
in the fire and different faults
weigh them down to the depth where

829
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,430
extraordinary metaphor,
that weight, weight,

830
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,530
that burden of sin,

831
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,610
but it's really an image
that goes back the gravity.

832
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,420
The question of gravity,
this is we speak of civic gravity,

833
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,970
but here it's a different kind of gravity.

834
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:08,860
It's an idea of um,

835
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,360
it's an old idea when you want to talk
about the weight that we carry within us,

836
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:21,270
the gravity we have within
us that gravity is love.

837
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,050
The way of deciding what's the
way of understanding this line?

838
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:31,051
There's a passage in the confessional
from Augusta where Augustine says that he

839
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:36,880
wants to exemplify what some people go up.
Other people go down and he says,

840
00:56:36,881 --> 00:56:41,350
it's like the gravity
of objects around us.

841
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:48,070
Stone. You drop a stone and the stone
goes down out of its own gravity.

842
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,690
I told specific weight and fire he says,

843
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:57,250
goes up out of its own specific weight.
We are carried.

844
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,160
Whatever I love carries us.
We are.

845
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,420
Our love is our own gravity in the
gravity and whether we go up or down,

846
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,710
it depends according to the
direction of our desires.

847
00:57:09,711 --> 00:57:12,410
Whether we just go back to this is uh,
uh,

848
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,190
it's to give you a sense of all
the residences of this cancer,

849
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,940
but at the heart of it all,
that is the question of civil war two,

850
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,670
wealth and gibberellins between
patricians and Peruvians.

851
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,730
Dentist is the whole of history.
Roman history,

852
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:30,120
whether he's going to read Virgil or we
read Lucan or he will read the stages,

853
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,530
they're all actually deals not
with Roman history. This great,

854
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,490
great epic [inaudible] reads is
really reading Greek history,

855
00:57:39,491 --> 00:57:42,460
the story of we depose and
the Tok Gleason Polynese.

856
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,410
They view history at from the point
of view of the civil war. Now.

857
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,630
So let me just formulate the question
of a part of the political understanding

858
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:56,460
Dante has. For those of you who may
have read a little bit of monarch here,

859
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:59,830
for instance,
which is this treatise about the,

860
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:05,310
the desirable form of a
Universal Confederation of
states and the one emperor.

861
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:09,560
That's the grand vision
that Dante has in monarch.

862
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,690
He thinks about that they need that unity
of all states. I kind of the sort of,

863
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,720
we could call it today,
a confederation of States,

864
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,850
very much patterns are all on,
on the Roman,

865
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,130
the Roman Empire, the
idea of there, in fact,

866
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:29,030
the Roman empire becomes the model
for this kind of unification. Uh,

867
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,000
so that's really what most of us think,

868
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:33,670
that Dante's political
vision is in effect.

869
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,550
Dante sees history especially as,

870
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,800
and it's kind of inevitable
satanic form of civil war. So,

871
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,690
so harsh can, is he going to be
about the realities of the cities?

872
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,840
You really wonder how can he
go on elaborating a theory
of a constructive theory

873
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,430
of politics?
You see what I'm saying?

874
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,100
Once you are so harsh about
the reality of politics,

875
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:02,140
then you really wonder how that can one
go around really thinking that politics

876
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:05,260
can be in necessarily cause unnecessary.

877
00:59:05,261 --> 00:59:09,970
You can explain that it's somehow
useful, that it's feasible. Uh,

878
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,770
where does this idea, what is this
is this understanding of Rome? Um,

879
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,030
come to him.

880
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:21,470
Dante is not really agree with Virgil
and Dante is not agreed with Virgil's

881
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,220
greatest critic who is
Augustan in the city of God.

882
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:30,650
For Virgil Rome is the
providential empire,

883
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:36,220
an empire that can really bring about
unify the whole world are gusted rights

884
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,130
against Virgil and says
no because even Rome,

885
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,090
as I just indicated to
you and the learner,

886
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,290
even Rome is part of
the history of violence.

887
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,800
Dante comes along and puts together
within the divine comedy that question of

888
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:58,850
Rome and the needed empire and
the question of the civil war,

889
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,980
what do they have in common?
What is that connects them.

890
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:09,520
Dante's argument is the following you
Virgil are right in believing in the unity

891
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,350
of all mankind,

892
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,430
stoic idea we all live in that
costs more police in the city,

893
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:24,431
which is the city of the world where we
all find the place and you Augustan or

894
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:29,471
right in claiming that the
empire is all built and based on

895
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,630
Libido and lust.
You're right,

896
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,660
you're both right and yet you
are both wrong besides me.

897
01:00:38,661 --> 01:00:43,550
Cause you contradict each other and
what Dante says Augustan if there is no

898
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,540
empire,

899
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:50,020
then we are living in a world
of disorder and lawlessness.

900
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:55,750
The empire becomes the necessary
remedy to the evils of the civil war.

901
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:01,010
The civil war is the condition
where my own brother,

902
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:03,800
my own neighbor can be,
can become my own enemy.

903
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:08,120
Gaston does not acknowledge
the realities of war to him.

904
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:13,480
It's just empire and the empire is evil
and will finish with the famous line.

905
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:16,970
What do I care who governs me,

906
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:20,060
provided that they don't make me sin.

907
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:24,920
It's the famous Christian
response to the idea of the evil,

908
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,140
the historical evil of empires.

909
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:32,380
Let me retreat into myself and
find within myself some kind of of,

910
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:33,740
uh,
of uh,

911
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,480
comfort and some kite of shelter
and Dante will respond to him.

912
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:40,310
No,
that's not enough.

913
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:43,250
Because once you think that you
have retreated into yourself,

914
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,000
then there is the reality of the
civil war that we're reaching to you.

915
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,500
What have been explaining
to you that we stop? Uh,

916
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,750
because I want to talk about something
else before we go 10 to seven.

917
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:57,560
What I've been trying to explain to you
is that that the movement from 10 to

918
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:00,490
five to Canto six of inferno,

919
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:05,740
it's a movement from the internal world
of desires that seemed to be so private

920
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:08,390
and so personal.
Then I said,

921
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:13,540
Dan has to go outside of himself to test
to find out what the authenticity is of

922
01:02:14,451 --> 01:02:18,740
what he has found out in Canto five
and 10, two, six, the political canter.

923
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,520
We'll tell them that there is no such
a comfort zone of one's home in a world

924
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:28,790
that in the world is necessary necessarily
part of the outside world and outside

925
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:33,660
world will encroach upon. It, will
end once own in the, in the world.

926
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:38,730
Uh, the terms will this kind of movement
between the inner and the outer, uh,

927
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:39,610
really,
uh,

928
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:44,660
Virgil and the Guston virtual with the
idea of the fence of the empire Augustan

929
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:50,330
with his undermining of the notion
of the necessity of the empire.

930
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:56,490
Dante,
we'll go on a harmonizing the two visions.

931
01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:01,140
So he will endorse the idea of the
empire and aware that that's the only

932
01:03:01,141 --> 01:03:05,240
possible best response to
the tragedy of civil wars.

933
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:10,500
Let me say just a few things
about canto seven. Uh,

934
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,130
the, the, and then I'll give you a chance
to ask. Sometimes they'll should be two,

935
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:18,260
three minutes for questions
or came to seven. Um, uh,

936
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:23,640
also is a candle that can
be read symmetrically with
the other Canto seven of

937
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:28,330
the divine comedy purgatorial
seven but Justice Canto six, I,

938
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,680
I neglected to mention it but uh,

939
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:35,360
Canto six of impairment is about the
city and politics can two six approval

940
01:03:35,361 --> 01:03:39,090
story about the nation can two,
six of paradise about the empire.

941
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,540
So they're really connected in the same
thing with Qantas ever. This is the only,

942
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:45,990
can't wear that to the smoke.
Individualize sinners.

943
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,910
He meets avaricious.

944
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,510
There are issues and the protocols and
there are sort of taken in a kind of,

945
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:55,320
they have no,
there's no individual figuration for them.

946
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:59,190
It is as if this became
a kind of an anonymous,

947
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:03,300
therefore more collective kind of problem.
Other issues and probiotics,

948
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:08,510
which he represents in terms of the
counter movement of Sealer and Caribbean.

949
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:13,090
This. And here we have the great
figuration of fortune. You remember, Eh,

950
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,460
as I call her,

951
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:19,730
the Vanna white of the time that
the lady who is a wheel of fortune,

952
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:25,590
uh, turning back blindfolded. And,
and, and let me say something about,

953
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:30,500
about this figuration as is
Dante describes it as a, uh, uh,

954
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:35,370
you know, what, what is it a,
it's a great an idea that I,

955
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,620
um,
uh,

956
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:41,490
what is it about the avaricious and
the prodigals who could turn around?

957
01:04:41,730 --> 01:04:45,840
So a one against the
other, uh, how can this be?

958
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,950
How can this be possible? Uh, uh, what is,

959
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,890
why are we so attached to,

960
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:57,630
to the things of the world?
And then Dante goes on explaining a,

961
01:04:57,631 --> 01:05:02,130
on a canto seven lines eight
and following, uh, he will say,

962
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:02,690
ah,

963
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:07,620
he ordained for he meaning God or
then for worldly splendors a general

964
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:12,300
ministered and guide who shouldn't do
time change vein well from race to race

965
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:16,050
and from one to another blood beyond
the prevention of human, which,

966
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:20,510
so that one race rules. And another
language is accord the best sentence. Ah,

967
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:25,120
she foresees judges and maintains a
kingdom as the other heavily powers do

968
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:25,930
theirs.

969
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:30,190
How changes have no respite
necessity makes a swift so fast.

970
01:05:30,191 --> 01:05:33,070
Men come to take the turn,
et cetera are,

971
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:35,530
this is he who is so reviled,

972
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:38,500
meaning fortune by the very main
that should give her praise,

973
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,550
laying on her wrong who blame and
ill repute. But she's blessed.

974
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:47,320
It does not hear it happy with the other
primal creatures. She turns us fear.

975
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:51,550
Every Joyce's in her, bless.
It's fortunate that wheel,

976
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,480
but it's a figuration that in
many ways it needs some, uh,

977
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,420
some explaining.

978
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,960
How can Nantais believe
in goddess for tuna?

979
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,170
How can he go on talking
about this Pagan Deity,

980
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:13,410
which is a roamer deity lady
luck or how is he doing this?

981
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,080
How can that, do you see how, how he,

982
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:21,180
he lives in a world of a providential
reality, whether it's an ink well, uh,

983
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:25,060
and he does say that fortunate is an
intelligence of God. So they are not,

984
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:29,570
the Dosha is blindfolded.
That is also kind of, uh, um,

985
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:32,350
there are some criteria.
There is an intelligence,

986
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:36,620
there is a will and the meditation
behind it. What it means is that a,

987
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:40,630
what is up with inevitably
turned down to go down.

988
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:45,980
This is an endless rotation or fortune
and certain way when you are down,

989
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:49,600
uh,
you only the only it's the head,

990
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:54,010
best time to be at because you
don't have to, you can only go up.

991
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:59,280
We are always though on these
precarious repost on this, uh,

992
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:04,360
on the curve. We are never quite
a stable in our own achievements.

993
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:09,280
How can that relate this a try id or
fortune to the providential scheme,

994
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:11,980
uh, that he, he uh,

995
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:14,800
he regulates and shapes his own vision.

996
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,700
And what I would have to tell you
is that the, uh, the two things,

997
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,600
the first thing is that
there's UC canter's haven't
begins with an illusion to

998
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:27,460
the great war in heaven.
The angels,

999
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,990
the primal struggle that that
disrupted the order of the cosmos.

1000
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:32,883
In other words,

1001
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:38,100
fortune is for him the divinity
that rules over the world,

1002
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:41,000
the sub lunar,
a world of generation and corruption.

1003
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,440
This to say she is a minister within the,
the,

1004
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:48,250
the world of the fall for steak.
Uh,

1005
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:52,360
so there there's still a foreign world
and that's how perception of all the

1006
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,010
changes that take place.

1007
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:59,340
And the other thing is that Dante is
intimating that the only way to conquer

1008
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:02,530
fortune is to really give up a,

1009
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,810
it says kind of mystical idea. Uh,
Mr [inaudible] has a spiritual idea,

1010
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:11,680
give up the attachment to the things
of this world. So let's stop here,

1011
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:13,570
uh,
with uh,

1012
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:17,380
with a brief summary of Canto seven items.

1013
01:08:17,381 --> 01:08:19,010
See if there are questions
about some of the,

1014
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:23,720
a weighty issues that I
raised in Canto five and six.

1015
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:27,740
And there isn't much more that we can say,
but let me see if you want to

1016
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:33,950
cost ask questions and maybe I can
clarify things that were left in the

1017
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,940
background.
Please.

1018
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:39,400
I'm going to cancel five.
The narrative of Francesco Palo.

1019
01:08:39,401 --> 01:08:42,520
What is the significance that
Francesca is doing all the talking?

1020
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:45,230
What is the question
is very good question.

1021
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:49,980
What is the significance of Francesca
is doing all the talking and uh,

1022
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:53,960
and not Paolo. I guess I take the, the,

1023
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
the significance is that this is to me
is that this is a canto or where Dante

1024
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:05,750
understands some of the elements that
he had put forth in the Vita Nuova.

1025
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:10,250
You remember where we discuss the Viton
Nuova and there I indicated that the

1026
01:09:10,251 --> 01:09:15,210
great poem, women who have
intellect of love, where the, uh,

1027
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:19,520
he discovers that they are
the interlocutors about love,

1028
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:24,530
not only the interlocutors about love
there also those are the privileges

1029
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:29,180
interlocutors because they know how
to combine because they understand the

1030
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:32,390
unnecessary interdependence
of intellect and love.

1031
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,050
They are not two separate entities.
They are not two separate, uh,

1032
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:39,890
aspects. And therefore, uh,

1033
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:44,950
now he has Francesca as a woman who
can become indeed his own interlocutor.

1034
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,300
That's one aspect.

1035
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:52,330
The other one is that medieval romances
had made this extraordinary discovery

1036
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:56,750
and I think is the most revolutionary
change that has taken place in the,

1037
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:01,520
in the consciousness of, in the, in the
imagination of the, in the Western world,

1038
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,470
in modern times. That is to say
before it became a sociological issue,

1039
01:10:06,471 --> 01:10:09,380
before it becomes a philosophical problem,

1040
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:14,650
the dignity and worth of the woman was
already retrieved and vindicated by

1041
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:18,100
romances.
It's there,

1042
01:10:18,101 --> 01:10:23,101
but the woman becomes either the figure
in charge or the partner or friend of a,

1043
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,260
of the man.
Does that answer your question

1044
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:31,990
by the way?
The answer was yes.

1045
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,610
That could not be picked
up by the the video. Ah,

1046
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,420
other questions?

1047
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,370
I'm okay.
Thank you.

1048
01:10:57,371 --> 01:11:02,371
We'll see you next time with
Kantar nine 10 and 11 I guess.
