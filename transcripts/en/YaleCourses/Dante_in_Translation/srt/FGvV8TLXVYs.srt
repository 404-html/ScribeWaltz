1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,970
Last time we, uh, got into Canto 10,

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,790
and they began with the heaven of the Sun.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,570
And that began with the
description of a Dante begins.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:20,100
We went over the phases of the candle.
Uh,

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,110
on the one hand,
the is the description of the trinity,

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,260
of the inner life of the trinity is
a life of love or the breadth and the

7
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,620
father. The Spirit, um, love the son,

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
the father abound by the breadth of love,
uh,

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,610
as it were, then Dante moves into, um,

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,630
it's the description of the spectacle of,
uh,

11
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,880
of the whole or this
heaven and of this Po,

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,920
this fragment of the cosmos by
turning to us readers twice,

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,240
asking us to look up.
Uh,

14
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:07,500
it is by looking up, we can see, uh,

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,170
the givenness of creation. The fact
that it has been given a, it's,

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,740
it's a gift to us. Uh, it's
also a way of, uh, if it's,

17
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,070
if it's a gift,
um,

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,180
if there's any economy,
a theory economy in the cosmos,

19
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,190
it's a divine economy.

20
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,590
It also means that some are
somehow we cannot really claim to,

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,330
to own it.
That's,

22
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,670
it seems to be a natural consequence of
something being a Gif does not imply,

23
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:44,640
there's not entail
unnecessarily ownership of uh,

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,870
this gift that has been given.
And therefore we,

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,600
we are invited to have an aesthetic,
uh,

26
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,040
admiration over it. Uh, so this,

27
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,790
this kind of the scene
of, uh, of, of the divine,

28
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,300
this even a kind of field drama,
divine drama,

29
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,330
I spectacle that I'm folds and unfolds
throughout the course was answer with a

30
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:13,430
description of a,
the encyclopedia is a,

31
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,890
as I was describing it to you are there
is to say with a Kleiner's who recounts

32
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,410
a the names and mentions one
after the other, the twelves,

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,970
um,
representatives of various disciplines.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
We talked a little bit about,
uh,

35
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,750
Solomon and the scandal
that his inclusion here,

36
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,990
uh, cause, cause in Dante's
own times and say it,

37
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,150
Dante's responding to a real crisis about
our knowledge of the ultimate fate of

38
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,830
Solomon, the wisest of old man. Uh,

39
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,090
was he saved or not,
uh,

40
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,960
on account of his weaknesses
in terms of his, uh, his,

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,060
what he's Letteri. Um, and then, uh,

42
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,070
the Canto focuses on ends really with
a CGL broadband who was a logician

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,460
philosopher. And Dante describes him, uh,

44
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,460
really owned the way to two knowledge. He
was ahead of thick. It was viewed of as,

45
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,780
as,
as a heretic.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,230
Dante dismisses that whole charge.

47
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,800
And in many ways he
represents that knowledge as,

48
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:34,801
or the circle of knowledge is one of
made of a contradictory voices were those

49
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:39,901
that had been blaming CGIAR Oprah bands
such as Aquinas himself now retract

50
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,620
their positions.

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
So the whole process of getting to know
the world is one of Evers and it's one

52
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,710
of retractions. Okay. Uh,

53
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,610
there are some interesting details
that I could up. I could even,

54
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:58,740
I think that I should even
mention to you, uh, as a,

55
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,990
as we approach 11 and 12, uh, uh,

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,060
seizure is described as his,
uh, absorbed in his grave.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,670
Thoughts in Italian is,
uh, uh, Graffy pain.

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,740
Sierra, you know, the Word
Been Sierra is that, uh,

59
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,980
English bends pensive, uh, and,

60
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,040
and I think that that is
such a remarkable, uh,

61
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,240
word because it really
means to think in Latin.

62
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,350
Uh,

63
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,350
and the oldest exploit this
residence of the verb means to be,

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,490
to, to be at an impasse, to be
suspended, literally to be suspended.

65
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,440
So he suspended in thoughts as if the
thoughts could not make him reach,

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,720
uh, the threshold of,
uh, the knowledge he,

67
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,250
Eh, he wanted. At any rate,
that's the way our can talk. 10,

68
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,310
that's the economy of
cancer. 10, I want to,

69
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,000
or since the three canters
that go together to really,

70
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,030
I ask you to turn to the end of
Canto 12 where our Bonaventure,

71
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:09,040
who is a Franciscan, uh, you probably
know what, what is meant by that.

72
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:14,041
The Franciscan is one in the order of
some Francis just as Aquinas is Dominican.

73
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,480
The Franciscans are those who believe
in the priority of will and love in the

74
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,700
act of knowledge.
Uh,

75
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,730
the Dominicans or is New York is Tutelian
like Aquinas believed in the priority

76
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,690
of the intellect in the
apprehension of the world.

77
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,720
The Dominicans were founded with
the explicit mandate to teach in the

78
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:41,050
universities were Harrises,

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,710
they thought abounded and
therefore they had to exit prey,

80
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,370
pluck off the roots of
Harrison's different systems.

81
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:53,080
We're going to be a
witnessing in the world, uh,

82
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,740
in both orders are,

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,390
are shaped by a belief in poverty
that we have to examine a little bit.

84
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,140
We have to understand what
it means at any rate. Uh,

85
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,140
Bonaventure he is a Franciscan
and by the end of Canto 12,

86
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,300
after it has been, uh, uh,
chronicling the life of, uh,

87
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,163
Dominic,

88
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:17,650
this is sort of another case
of extraordinary openness
of in Dante's view of

89
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:25,751
these characters in the
sense of Franciscans and
Dominicans were really at odds

90
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,570
with each other, both in terms
of their theologies and their,

91
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,360
and their premises.
Uh,

92
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,210
more intellectual premises above or here.

93
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,570
Dante has a Franciscan tell the life of
Dominic just as earlier in canned to 11.

94
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,780
And Dominicans and Aquinas
tells the life of Francis,

95
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,760
the two candles are controlled,
but what we call a cosmos, that's,

96
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,950
that's this is a cast was from the,
the Greek word Chi. Uh, he, uh,

97
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,420
uh, cosmos, right?

98
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,880
So you have an intersection
of, uh, of voices.

99
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:06,881
It's sort of a sense of the
interdependence of the two perspectives.

100
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,960
Um, I will say a little bit more about
one adventure after I read this paragraph.

101
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:17,120
This paragraph, the last
paragraph in Canton 12 lines
one third and following, uh,

102
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,020
uh,

103
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,020
sort of functions as a counterweight to
the description of the encyclopedia that

104
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:28,061
Aquinas had given at the
end of [inaudible] 10 and
ending with a seizure of

105
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:31,640
broadband. So let me just
see who the people are here.

106
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,940
I'm the living soul of Bonaventure of
binary area who in gray offices ever put

107
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:38,684
last?

108
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,840
The left hand care here are Luminato and
Augustan were among the first bare foot

109
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,180
a brothers in the code made
themselves God's friends.

110
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,600
Then a theorist of medieval encyclopedias,

111
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,590
hue of some Vic victor,
a Parisian,

112
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,720
a Fryer,
um,

113
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,980
who really wrote the so
called data scarlet going,

114
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:08,600
which is a text about what is the, what
are, what are the stages of education?

115
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,840
How does the mind come to the knowledge
of God starting from the small,

116
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,110
uh,
elements in the outside life,

117
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,050
the material world than
the interior lights,

118
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,710
etc. Before reaching
the God's supreme light.

119
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,560
Then a is here with them.
Peter, the bookworm,

120
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Peter the Spaniard and other theorist
of medieval logic who shines below in 12

121
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:38,720
books. Then Nathan the prophet,
how come back to this name?

122
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:43,721
The Prophet Nathan is
known to those who know,

123
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,140
uh, as being, uh,

124
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,190
David's a bad conscience
or good conscience,

125
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:54,530
the one who is freaking
him to think about himself.

126
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,970
Nathan a profit,
uh,

127
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,020
sensor councilor of the king.

128
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:04,860
A little bit more about him in a while.
And Chris Os Thumb,

129
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,920
the metropolitan meaning that God with
a golden mouth language here is the,

130
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:15,180
the flower of eloquence
is what he processors. Um,

131
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,230
and Anselm the another theologian
who writes about the reasons for the

132
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:25,980
incarnations, right?
Famous Texas. But why do,

133
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,870
why did God become a man?

134
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,070
And then Donatos who then to set
his hand to the first art grammar.

135
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,150
So you say of the whole array,
the whole wide spectrum of water.

136
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:40,880
We called encyclopedia
logic, eloquence. Um, uh,

137
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,090
grandma Donatos is the, a Reuben
grump Syrian and there are banners,

138
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,120
a historian and beside me shines the
Calabrian Abbott Joke Him who was endowed

139
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,220
with a spirit of
prophecy, the growing, uh,

140
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,190
courtesy. And we'll judge it.
Language or brother Thomas.

141
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,350
I've moved me to celebrate so great.

142
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:06,240
A Paladin and with me have
moved this, uh, company,

143
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,010
uh, one eventual ends with uh, uh,

144
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,500
the tip of the hat and the
direction of, uh, Aquinas,

145
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,040
whose example he has followed.
So an example of a,

146
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,930
once again have a dialogue and openness
between the two olders in the tool,

147
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,740
the tool members of different orders and
yet in somehow interdependent with each

148
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,810
other. Uh, now, uh,

149
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,500
the presence of Abbott Joel Kim is another
counterweight to seizure of broadband

150
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,070
in Canto 10. He to joke him, uh,

151
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,090
who you have met because I talked
to have mentioned his name to you in

152
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:46,660
discussing the prophecy, glossing the
prophecy of the DXV improved at all.

153
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:50,710
You're 33. You remember where I
tried to explain it, that, uh,

154
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,780
that seems to be a kind of
apocalyptic meaning to that prophecy,

155
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:56,830
the numerical enigma,
a,

156
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:01,930
an enigmatic prophecy about the coming
of Christ at the end of time who will

157
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:05,350
come and therefore, uh, the,

158
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,240
the prophecy of the consummation of
history and the consummation of time,

159
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,500
the DXV,
the 510 and five is that is called.

160
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:17,250
And I said that the, the, um, the,

161
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,760
the joke is the interpretation of
that emblem of that symbol, uh,

162
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,480
seemed to me to be accurate.
They really meant really,

163
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,080
so to introduce the
idea of the end of time,

164
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,540
however I rejected,

165
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,970
I ask you to also reject the
implications of that prophecy.

166
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,650
Uh,
Joe is prophecy.

167
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,490
It was viewed as heretical for
a number of important reasons.

168
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,970
It expresses as whole to of
impatience about history.

169
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,070
This is a really believes
first of all in the, uh,

170
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,270
imminent and closure of history. His, the,

171
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,930
the end is close at hand. Uh, and
this is a kind of, and, and the,

172
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:04,190
and they ended up history
in prize, the, uh,

173
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,120
the coming into being a Va. And Utopia
and utopia of the spirit. The third day,

174
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:15,121
age of the spirit when
finally old institutions hold
barriers are shattered and

175
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,880
torn down. And this is a
kind of, this is really what,

176
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:23,650
what from Dante's point of view would
be wrong with a [inaudible] cause you

177
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:28,651
topian impulse the idea that it always
begs a foreclosure or what we can never

178
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:35,050
really fathom, which is the world
of, uh, uh, historical occurrences.

179
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,320
But another reason why he was viewed as
heretical by exactly the Bonaventure.

180
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,290
It was Bonaventure who asked
that his views be damned.

181
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,100
And now he is Soto of,
uh, writing a pilot.

182
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:53,080
Nord Dante allows him to make amends
for the previous condemnation.

183
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,690
Bonaventure found objectionable,

184
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,200
the ideas of a joke and move
forward because Joe came.

185
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,290
The factor is this solving the whole
notion of the utility of the trinitarian

186
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:10,300
life. He had, he, he theorizes, Eh,

187
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,810
an idea of history,
a tripartite idea of history.

188
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,730
According to the three persons of
the Trinity, the age of the father,

189
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,220
the son, and the Holy Spirit.
He believes that it is.

190
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:26,050
Once that was once in biblical times,
there was the age of the father,

191
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,460
God was understood this, the father.
Then we enter the age of, uh,

192
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,560
of the sun,
uh,

193
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,120
brotherhoods of all and now the
spiritual age of the Holy Spirit. It,

194
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,440
the factory means that the three ways,
the three manifestations,

195
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:46,441
this kind of complex way of understanding
a unity from different viewpoints is

196
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,070
actually, um, uh, uh, dissolve. This is,

197
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,640
it becomes separate each, uh,
each person of the trinity,

198
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:58,090
it becomes a separate entity.
And that view from four,

199
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,770
four Bonaventure was sa, uh,
heretical. He condemns him.

200
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,310
Now he acknowledges that he
actually was Abbott Joel Kim,

201
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,320
who was endowed with a spirit of
prophecy is something only prophetic.

202
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:14,350
In other words, what
seemed to be heresy, a,

203
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,350
an intellectual question
of, uh, of, of, um,

204
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,600
of thoughts and opinions and our
peers as some divination about,

205
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,230
uh, uh, things to come.
Uh, no, no, not, no,

206
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,890
not specified any further.
Retrospectively,

207
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:34,840
it's down to himself with legitimizing
drove him and therefore also legitimizing

208
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:35,740
his own position.

209
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,950
In Canto 33 a of Purgatorio Dante
shares the view of the apocalyptic,

210
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,160
the new mom of history.
However, uh, he refuses.

211
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:50,150
He rejects the idea that it's
possible to establish a, uh,

212
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,480
a for such a,

213
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,040
an occurrence joke him appears now
is a visionary among, among them.

214
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,840
The other figure that I would like to
say something about is Nathan the Prophet

215
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:07,220
for a very simple reason, because
Nathan, as you probably know this,

216
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:11,570
it's very strange. Why would that
include Nathan a prophet among, okay,

217
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:16,190
there's joke him of Florida was prophetic,
but why include Nathan among this? Uh,

218
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,780
why spirits? I mean, he could have chosen
so many others. He would have chosen, uh,

219
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,530
uh,

220
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,530
those who actually have written and
whose shoes works are canonical in the

221
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:29,780
Bible. He doesn't, uh, he chooses Nathan.

222
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,730
And the idea is I think
a little bit of, uh, Eh,

223
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:39,731
an autobiographical or pun about Dante
himself because the ne Nathan the word

224
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:45,410
Nathan means he who gives,
in other words,

225
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,610
Dante Soul in the name of Nathan,
his own name.

226
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,430
And he plays him. Yeah.
That's what Dante means.

227
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,580
He who gives Nathan becomes a kind of
mask for Dante of it is as if you were

228
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,600
saying head I did,

229
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,620
if I had I and other life
or a pasta must live in,

230
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,150
uh, the heavily apotheosis. That's
where I probably would like,

231
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,750
that's what I,

232
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,490
I probably will end up certainly that's
what I would like to be so innate and

233
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:21,290
there is a mask for
himself. Now. Why? Um, uh,

234
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,071
what is this?

235
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:27,071
So also peculiar about this encyclopedic
ordering of the arts and the sciences.

236
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,680
It doesn't really differ
very much from Aquinas,

237
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,000
but it's interesting that it's
Bonaventure who, who, who,

238
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,410
uh,

239
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,210
articulates who voices this kind of a
who celebrates all these names and all

240
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:49,211
this arts because Bonaventure is himself
a theorist of the encyclopedia very

241
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,890
much as you have some victor.

242
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,250
But he has one crucial reflection at
the beginning of his encyclopedia.

243
00:16:57,521 --> 00:17:00,620
This is that the activity
of knowing and learning,

244
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,120
it's like going up and down a ladder.
And you might say,

245
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:08,870
you read that metaphor. You might say,
well, that's an extraordinary metaphor,

246
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:12,680
but it's the metaphor of the
ladder of Jacob in the Bible,

247
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,620
which is where he probably
found that ladder of Plato.

248
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,320
And that's where this idea that,
uh,

249
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:21,920
we ascend the mind a sense
when we learn something,

250
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:26,390
when we get educated,
the mind goes up and which we can go down.

251
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,460
But the interesting thing
about Bonaventure is that
he goes on saying that as in

252
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:32,294
a ladder,

253
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,600
the lowest rung are always more important
than the higher ones because without

254
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:43,760
those, no one of us will be
capable to climb up the ladder.

255
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,500
So the lowest, the lowly, uh,
forms of knowledge, grammar,

256
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,010
uh, the, the,

257
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:54,700
the external lights of the census
was he distinguishes his, his, uh,

258
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,350
it's theater of knowledges
as a proliferation of lights,

259
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,240
as a universe of lights, internal,
external lights, internal lights,

260
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,040
that light of the sensors.
Uh,

261
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,700
the lights will come to us from
books and the light of God and so on.

262
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,640
So we are always going to be
enlightened in our process,

263
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,420
but as we are enlightened, the lowest
lights are first of all, self sufficient.

264
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,750
They are those who may not be capable of
ascending, sending much higher, uh, in,

265
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:24,130
uh, in the, in along the ladder. Uh,

266
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,280
then the first few wrongs that is a really
a self sufficient knowledge that they

267
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,114
can acquire.

268
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,350
So the arts have to him the art of poetry,

269
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,920
that's the lowest rung and yet
that has its home self sufficiency.

270
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,720
And then you can go up the ladder,
then literally learned more. The,

271
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,430
the interesting thing about that ladder
is that there is no sense though.

272
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:50,790
It establishes a hierarchy
in that hierarchy.

273
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,140
The lower elements as crucial
as the higher elements.

274
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,630
Because without the lawyer there,
the lower rungs who live with a kid,

275
00:18:58,631 --> 00:19:03,030
I never really, uh, can
go up to the end. The,

276
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,650
so, uh, this is, uh, another
image then it the finally,

277
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,440
let me just say with, uh, uh,
with the jaw came, uh, uh,

278
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,440
the inclusion of Joel Kim. Uh,
here we are getting into the,

279
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,000
uh, the Eurasia of, uh,

280
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,960
a strict barriers,

281
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:26,961
strict boundaries between
what is heretical and what is,

282
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,680
what is canonical. I think this is
the salt of, of openness, uh, Dante.

283
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:36,060
So openness, uh, that somehow
reverberates with, uh,

284
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,720
the lesson of Francis and Dominic.
And therefore,

285
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:44,400
now let me turn to those two
cancers. Keep in mind, and,

286
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:49,340
uh, as we read the Canto
11. Good. Again, I, I,

287
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,160
Eh, I repeat in the heaven of the
sun and I don't know that, uh,

288
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,090
the passage that I read to you from
the pseudo ionizers last time about the

289
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:01,560
divine names, where this will be the
United States goes on talking about, uh,

290
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,770
uh, uh, why is the
metaphor of the sun such a,

291
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,783
such a,
such a,

292
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,950
such a fundamental emerge for
the divine divine generosity,

293
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,060
right? This is, uh, as, as,
uh, an image of, uh, uh,

294
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,650
the sun that always gives of itself
without ever asking anything,

295
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,880
anything back. So it's a, it's
an activity of a purely general,

296
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,730
pure generosity.
Um,

297
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,540
and I think that's a Franciscan image
of a also of poverty to which a world,

298
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,750
uh, but which I'll talk
in a moment. The to 11,

299
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:41,760
I repeat ends with the
extraordinary, um, uh,

300
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:46,790
encomium of seizure of broadband
by a counterpoint can talk 11,

301
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,250
uh,

302
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:53,250
has an apostrophe against a
logical legal forms of knowledge,

303
00:20:55,271 --> 00:21:00,271
the kind of knowledge that tries
to define the world in formulas.

304
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:04,900
And so he, Dante begins and this is Dante
speaking on his own in his own voice,

305
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,240
all intensive care of mortals.

306
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,450
How vein or the reasonings that make the
beat that wings in downward flight one

307
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,970
was going after law and
other after the aphorisms,

308
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,410
one following the priesthood that are
seeking to rule by force or craft,

309
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,440
one set to robbery and
another on affairs of state.

310
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,920
We're laboring in the toils of freshly
delights and another given up to either

311
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,930
lose what I set three from all these
things was high in heaven with Beatrice

312
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
received,
uh,

313
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,030
received thus a glorious way.

314
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,010
I think it's an interesting counterpoint
between these icons of power,

315
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,510
uh, that derive from the
study of law and logic.

316
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,900
And then the on the
other hand, this, uh, uh,

317
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,880
Dante's own self reference to
himself as free from all of this.

318
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,080
Uh,
this concerns.

319
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,980
I think this idea of freedom will
be the dominant theme of, uh,

320
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,560
of Canto of country 11
who, uh, it continues.

321
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:13,110
And when each had come back to the point
of the circle where it was before that

322
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,060
the two wheels of dancing,

323
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,630
old man holding their hands
around the sun as well,

324
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,810
which is a metaphorical son so that the
university is not even [inaudible] is

325
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,320
not heliocentric Dante's universe.
They're going to move now beyond the sun.

326
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,540
It stopped like a candle on its stand.

327
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,430
And then there is a little
prayer here and uh, uh, the,

328
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,520
the introduction of the two Dominick and
Francis lines three and following the

329
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:47,230
providence or rules the world with the
council and whichever he created site is

330
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:51,880
vanquished before it reaches the bottom
in order that the bride of him who with

331
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:56,800
loud cries whether high with his
sacred blood should go to her beloved,

332
00:22:56,801 --> 00:23:01,330
secure in herself and faith, faith
fuller to him, ordained for her,

333
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,760
for her behoof to princess
to be her guides on the side.

334
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:09,910
And that the one, uh, was
all seraphic in order.

335
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:13,990
And that's Francis.
The other for wisdom was on earth.

336
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:18,520
And Splendor of Cherubic light. I shall
tell over the one since two praise one,

337
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:23,230
whichever we take is to speak of
both for the levers where to one end.

338
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,470
That's really the, the
formula that, that, uh,

339
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,560
seals the sense of the interdependence
of intellect and we'll,

340
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,910
uh, of love knowledge and
of the two the two voices.

341
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,590
And now this is the,
what we call a hagiography or a legend,

342
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,550
the life of a saint, the saint's
life of Francis, which is told by,

343
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,980
uh, by, by Aquinas, by
the Dominican Aquinas. Um,

344
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,390
where we are told is first of all,

345
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,950
between the two P on the water that falls
from the hill chosen by the blessed to

346
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:02,951
Baldo hangs at fertile slope of the lofty
mountain from which Roger feels cold

347
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:07,610
and heat at porter solar.
And behind it not sharing,

348
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,010
while do grieve under a heavy yoke,

349
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,340
it's an extraordinarily localized
representation of Francis origin.

350
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,610
It's a typography. He was
born as you know, in a sec,

351
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:24,611
but it's almost as if he were just placing
him in a specific place near the gate

352
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,220
that leads, that are on the
road to Audra. So season period,

353
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:34,340
very precise. Uh, and
it's called Puerto Solar.

354
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,090
More about this in a moment from
the slope where it most breaks.

355
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,610
Steepness, son. Now we
go from the top anemic,

356
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,280
the name of a place,
the gate of the sun,

357
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,610
Sunday this gate of his son to a
metaphor for Francis as the son.

358
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,030
He is the son.
So we are in the heaven of the Sun.

359
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,420
And now Dante Invest Francis with
all the attributes of this celerity,

360
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,760
this continuous steady giving of oneself
as the sun does and the new platonic

361
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,970
imagery, the mystical
neoplatonic imagery of, uh,

362
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,350
of the sooner the United States
is Sun rose on the world as this,

363
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:20,180
that sometimes from the Ganges. Um, uh,

364
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,570
so as soon as we,

365
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,710
Dante has mentioned the specific
place for Frances birth,

366
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,870
then the coordinates of the geographic
coordinates completely change.

367
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,200
We go from the specific and
local to literally the global,

368
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,520
the world of the Ganges,

369
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,760
the orient something a little faster as
if the son Francis really acts between

370
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:50,960
the concrete and local and,
and, and the widest, uh, uh,

371
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,430
possible, uh, reference.
Therefore, let let him,

372
00:25:55,431 --> 00:26:00,140
who makes mention to that place,
not say ashamed, which means I,

373
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,910
I rise,
but it's panning with a CZ four.

374
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,550
He would say too little but orient
if he would name it a rightly, uh,

375
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,610
so it's uh,
uh,

376
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,150
it's an extraordinary emerged
and to astronomical terms.

377
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:19,151
The Sun and the Orient a four
four Francis' was Francis'
appears as like just as

378
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:26,060
the sun does as one who can,
and I'm,

379
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:29,300
I'm playing with the texts it
a little bit, but not much.

380
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,940
One Who orients us,

381
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,200
one who supposed to orient a re orient us.

382
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,480
He's born in the,

383
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,630
in in Assisi and yet it appears
as if it were the east where his,

384
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,690
what Dante is implied I think is that
that for those who go on the face of the

385
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:52,470
earth and lose the ways,

386
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,130
then Francis becomes one who can
tell them how to find the way back,

387
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,120
whatever they are going.

388
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,430
For those who do not know the way I told
her known never known the way they are

389
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:08,820
capable of discovering it.
He is providing this slide.

390
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:11,640
So what is this light that he provides?

391
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:14,820
What kind of light does he bring out?

392
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,250
He was not yet far from his rising.

393
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,210
The metaphoric of the sun continues
when he began to make the earth feel,

394
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:26,790
some strengthening from
his mighty influence for,

395
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,720
and now he gives the
story of Francis Life.

396
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,480
Um,
and before I go there,

397
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,550
I just want to tell you that Dante and
I brought a translation of a poem Nanta

398
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,300
that Dante knew that Francis
is an extreme, is a great poet.

399
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,373
He's actually,

400
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:51,520
we consider him the first port of
in Italian and Italian language.

401
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,960
I just want to read a few stanzas from
the so called Canticle of brother son so

402
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:01,700
that you can see how uh,

403
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,500
Dante zoned metaphoric derives
straight her with Franciscan visions,

404
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,290
Franciscan spirituality.
He begins most high.

405
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,870
It's a prayer, a canticle of
brother's son, our own powerful,

406
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:18,990
good Lord. Yours or
the praises, the glory,

407
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,100
the honor and old blessing to you alone.

408
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:27,360
Most high do they belong and no
man is worthy to mention your name.

409
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,480
Praise be my Lord with all your creatures,

410
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,590
especially Brotherson who is the dean,

411
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,390
who is the day and through
whom you give us light.

412
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,300
And his beautiful and
radiant with great splendor,

413
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,430
embarrass her likeness of view.

414
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,640
Most high one praise be Yuma load through
sister moon and the stars in heaven.

415
00:28:47,281 --> 00:28:48,091
You form them,

416
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:52,680
clear and precious and beautiful praise
bu my load through brought the wind goes

417
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:55,890
through all the four elements.
And part of the,

418
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,870
the suggestiveness of this poem is
that it's a song of praise to God,

419
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,860
clearly enough. But it is also,
we never know if uh, if, uh,

420
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:09,100
Francis is thinking of these
elements, the sun, the moon, the wind,

421
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,120
the water death itself as the medium
through whom he can praise or the cause on

422
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:20,130
account of which you should
praise or the or the agents.

423
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,580
And the Italian is very ambiguous boar.
Uh,

424
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,600
for those of you who may know a
little French or a little Spanish, uh,

425
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,080
four by through,
uh,

426
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:33,780
this is so there's a kind of
extraordinary require an orchestration.

427
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,710
The other thing that I should mention
is that finally we can understand the

428
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:40,740
rhetoric of praise that is
running through this poem,

429
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,290
but we also saw as a disc this,

430
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,180
the describing the rhetoric of
praise in Dante's Vita Nuova.

431
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:53,720
When he finds out that the best way of
writing about Beatrice is really trite,

432
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,590
uh, uh, uh, praise poems,

433
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:01,150
not actually which he distinguishes
from flattery, but praise poems,

434
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,390
the poems or praise means in many
ways rejecting all sense of ownership.

435
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,140
Realizing that,

436
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,920
note the fact that one may know the
world doesn't mean that one owns it.

437
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:20,130
And also it means that not
knowing Beatrice is not
just a cover to wish to own

438
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:22,660
her.

439
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,660
So the praises as disinterested in this
free and mode of a acknowledgment of

440
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:33,910
Beatrice herself. Let's see how
this continues. This whole, uh, uh,

441
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,420
poetic vision of Francis continues with,
uh,

442
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,700
with canto 11.

443
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,690
Dante goes on giving us the life
of Francis and he catches fray.

444
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Frances England is in what I would call
using the language of anthropology,

445
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:54,970
really, Eh, liminal stage. You know
what I mean by the liminal stage?

446
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,240
There were liminal comes from the Latin
a threshold or comes from the Latin for

447
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,380
uh, limit the two words, many
ways, very contradictory, but it,

448
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:11,440
it has the power, uh,
Lehman, uh, uh, is one thing,

449
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:16,090
meaning meaning threshold but
also the word or make also limit.

450
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,020
Uh,

451
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:22,020
so the threshold may be a limit and the
threshold may also be an opportunity to

452
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:26,590
cross a way of going over,
I call it dentists use here.

453
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:30,280
He does use the word limit several times,
not in this context.

454
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:34,270
Dante places, uh, Francis in
eliminate opposition. They,

455
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:39,670
this would say between and between east
two different orders on the one hand,

456
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:42,430
the world.
And on the other hand,

457
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:46,760
some kind of a utopian
idea that we never win,

458
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:50,800
which would be the older he goes
on to institute or some, uh,

459
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,140
general vision.
But what the world ought to be.

460
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,810
He places Francis in between,
uh,

461
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,540
neither part of the world.
No part of this final utopia.

462
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,410
And let's see what he does
in this liminal position. Uh,

463
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,740
that's where he catches him.
And look at this lines here.

464
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,510
I'm still a youth. Uh,
this is the biography of,

465
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:17,511
of Francis are modeled on a number of
biographies or where it existed at the

466
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:21,990
time. Um, uh, foster youth,

467
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,980
he ran into strife with his father
for a lady to whom is to death.

468
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,760
None willingly unlocks the door,

469
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,720
which is as extraordinarily
difficult line to translate.

470
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,420
The Italian really could be read to say,

471
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,300
unlocks the door of pleasure,
um,

472
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,690
and before his spiritual court.
And now he uses

473
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,020
a Latin phrase,

474
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,920
which is illegal formula and has the
value of a legal formula golden pathway.

475
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,950
They say he marries this woman.

476
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,940
We don't know who she is yet in the
presence of his own father that's giving

477
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:03,410
legitimacy to his, um, his act,

478
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:07,090
the act of marriage, um,
uh, caught on potter.

479
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,190
He was joined to her and then his
fourth loved her better everyday.

480
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,370
She bereft of her first husband Christ
despise and obscure 1100 years and more

481
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:20,030
remained without a suitor till he came.

482
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,990
Not they did a veil when
men heard that he was a,

483
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:28,991
He who put all the world and fia found
her a moved with a meatless at the sound

484
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:30,591
of his voice.
No,

485
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,000
there are very hard to have such
courage and constants that were married,

486
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,800
stayed below.
She mounted the Cross with Christ,

487
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,100
but less I proceed to darkly taking a
Francis and poverty for this leverage.

488
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,180
In all I have said,

489
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,450
the harmony and happy looks movement who
love and wonder and sweet contemplation

490
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,490
and let them let them totally thoughts
so that the venerable Bernard first went

491
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,500
barefoot and when after the great peace,

492
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,420
a running through himself too slow
or welfare known and fruitful.

493
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:05,090
Good. So, uh, there is clearly a reversal.

494
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,260
A Francis Mayor is poverty and you're
kind of that marriage to poverty.

495
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:12,860
We have to understand what in a
moment what that is. A lot of wealth.

496
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:16,250
A lot of Richard's, uh,
can be produced a clear,

497
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,220
a clear turning of uh, uh, whatever
intentions he may have had.

498
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,290
Uh, and, and, uh,

499
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,530
the great consequences of that act of is
what is this representation of Francis?

500
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,310
Um, it's, I think in
this liminal position,

501
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Frances is shown as he is turning upside
down all the values that the world

502
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:47,810
holds there. So, um,

503
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:53,000
he wants to marry nothing,
right? Poverty to marry,

504
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:57,770
poverty's to Mary, nothing you, Mary
to be, you want to use yoke yourself,

505
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:02,771
you embrace owning nothing but that
marriage or that union appears as a

506
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:07,610
sacramental act. So he's making
fun. He's parodying better.

507
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:11,030
Just that we are a bit more is,
I don't want to imply at all.

508
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,200
And they blasted him here,

509
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:17,201
but he's paddling even the sacrament
of marriage he's marrying and nothing,

510
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,220
it's not a legal person. Uh,
some, some agent poverty, it's,

511
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,870
it's just an idealization or an allegory
for nothing. But that is conducted.

512
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,410
That ceremony is conducted as
if it were a sacramental act.

513
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,860
Not only a sacramental act,

514
00:35:31,861 --> 00:35:36,861
he's in the law because he's marrying
poverty in the presence of his father.

515
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,460
He undressed, he divests
himself, all the clothes,

516
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,810
which in the Middle Ages as much as now,
oh Rustin,

517
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,610
for some form of symbolic status,
the way you,

518
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,820
you know, you dress according to the
job you want, they usually say, right,

519
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,360
but at the se.
But what I meant to say is that dresses,

520
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,070
clothes are part of a
social set of values,

521
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:07,200
which Frances is flouting and patterning.
We have,

522
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:11,370
we are in the presence of the, of the
Oba legal language, sacramental language,

523
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,660
even the language of love. At one
point, that language of sexuality,

524
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,790
the idea of Marin poverty talk
and does not, I change the,

525
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,280
the, the, the translation of
that phrase, the way Saint Clair,

526
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,700
because it's a little bit our tortures
even in Italian. Then we think clear, uh,

527
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,910
uh, hesitant or he says, none
willingly unlocks the door.

528
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,150
That I'm willingly is the door
of pleasure. Even sexuality,

529
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:40,200
which is certainly a value of the world.
Francis will turn it around.

530
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,610
This is a radical critique of
the value system of the world.

531
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,210
Call it a prophetic mode of a,

532
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:50,510
of abandoning the,
the,

533
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,560
the idols of the world in favor of some
kind of a utopia or unexpected Dora.

534
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,290
And, uh, really, uh, not clarified,
not very well described, uh,

535
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,640
uh, uh, vision of how the
world ought to be. But this is,

536
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,170
he rejects all of us.

537
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,350
So she bereft of her first husband caught
pattern he was joined to for fourth.

538
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:12,600
Loved her better everyday.

539
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,720
She believed her first husband despise
and obscure 1100 hundred years and more

540
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,720
remain where to suitor till he came.

541
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,370
No did a veil when men heard that
he who put all the world in fear,

542
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,160
found her a moved with a meatless
at the sound of his voice.

543
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,050
No did avail ha to have such courage and
constancy that well Mary stayed below.

544
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,880
She poverty mounted on
the Cross with Christ.

545
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,870
Even she does something even
better than what Mary does,

546
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,970
but less they proceed to darkly taking
a Francis and poverty for this lovers in

547
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:51,370
our lives that their harmony
and happy looks like.

548
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,800
This is another pattern of
the language drove of the,

549
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,890
of the amorous discourse of medieval,

550
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,570
medieval love poetry. Uh, uh, they go on,

551
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:07,680
he just said he's dead limbs with nothing.

552
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,920
So they have now finally an inclusion
of an extraordinary known value because

553
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:19,410
that's what poverty is. Something
that questions whole values and it's,

554
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,880
it's, it's a Franciscan idea of
poverty. What do they mean by that?

555
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,500
What did Francis mean by this? By this
idea of poverty? What is the sport?

556
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,320
First of all,
you know,

557
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:36,400
that the subject became part
of an extensive, uh, uh,

558
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,260
iconographic representation on what can
think of, uh, uh, the jaw, tall frescoes,

559
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:44,650
the cycles, a Franciscan
cycles in a Cz, but, um,

560
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,480
but all over Tuscany and Umbria,
Umbria by the way. So it's, uh,

561
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,380
it's not a unique and a r two,
Dante,

562
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,890
Dante's understanding and Dante's insight,

563
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,250
this sort of representation
and fascination with Francis
and other little detail

564
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:04,210
that I should tell you is that Francis
in Italian is Franchese schools,

565
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:09,140
meaning that he's French. And
there was the, like Francesca, ah,

566
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,700
the other franchise and the other one
who also understood a lot about love but

567
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,940
lost her way. Uh, in, in, in Canto five,

568
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,620
it really means free the word. In
English, we have the word frank,

569
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,600
which in many ways carries over the
estimates of the Latin word Francisco's

570
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,460
Francis true to his name
is now as being poor,

571
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,090
absolutely free.
There's no bondage to anything.

572
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:37,030
There's nothing that holds
him to anything in the world.

573
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,580
So this is one important,

574
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,570
let's call it ethical
extension of poverty,

575
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,280
but what did they mean?

576
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,390
What did the other Franciscans like
Bonaventure was there listening to what

577
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:53,200
appliances may say about,
about the founder of his older.

578
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,910
What did they understand by that?

579
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:58,330
Because whenever we talk about in
Dante's certainly seems to a stress,

580
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,600
the idea of poverty being poverty in a
very material bodily way called pauriol

581
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,700
physical in the sense, I call it
prophetic in the sense that as you know,

582
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,590
what distinguishes the,
the,

583
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,620
the biblical prophets from other profits
is that they usually shoes to bear on

584
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:18,310
their flesh.

585
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,780
The signs that they
oughta against the world.

586
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,850
If they want to speak about the,
the,

587
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,030
the infidelity of, uh, of Israel,

588
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,550
they would marry a prostitute.

589
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,070
If they want to denounce the,
uh,

590
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,160
dissidents Harris's and lacerations
within the, the body politic of Israel,

591
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:47,340
they would even go on cutting off an
arm of their stool to dramatize own the

592
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:50,680
flesh. This idea of, uh, uh,

593
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,440
this prophetic pronouncements
that were making,

594
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:58,650
this is part of what Francis then is
doing here and this idea that he's living

595
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:03,370
poverty. It's not just an allegory
is an allegorical representation.

596
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,680
It is something live in the flesh.

597
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,880
The literal India Lego Richele are now
compressed, but it's more what did,

598
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:13,850
what is, but what does, for instance, uh,

599
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,440
Bonaventure think of what poverty is.
Dante,

600
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,930
I repeat things about the material,
the of poverty.

601
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:24,670
So we way of opposing average
a way of opposing, uh, uh,

602
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,590
practicality, attachment or
contempt for the, the, the values.

603
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:31,030
We have seen that all of that before.

604
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,210
The poverty to them also
means poverty of language.

605
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,381
Francis,

606
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:41,381
the first one tool to have articulated
even that poem of his repetitive,

607
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,070
the same simple formulaic,
uh, expressions,

608
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:50,030
praise be omnipotent, et
cetera. Road that says, ah,

609
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,940
repeated that it's a poverty of language.

610
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,330
The poverty of our thoughts that which
Dante at the beginning of Canto 11 has

611
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:04,330
been calling the defective.
But that is the word that I, I,

612
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:08,390
I did not stress when
we were up. Uh, oh, um,

613
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,500
intensive care of maltose. How, uh,

614
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,910
vein our reasonings. No, no,
no. How defective the, the,

615
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,180
the Italian originals is how defective.

616
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:24,980
I hope some translators pickup defective
and make it a and say that it's the

617
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:29,300
fact defective in the idea that
they are lacking, that they,

618
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,710
they have nothing of their own so that
retrospectively you can understand what

619
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:37,670
I'm talking about. That we cannot
own the world. That this is a,

620
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:42,710
that the world is a world of
gifts, uh, that, uh, that, uh,

621
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,990
the economy is an economy of giving,

622
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,700
a constant giving because the more you
give and the less you have of yourself,

623
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,030
the more you are free and
they're more productive.

624
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:58,220
Your own acts can become as
well the case of Francis,

625
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:02,700
that this is no role that Dante we'll
do with a Francis. This is now, um,

626
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,020
there is one,
a little reference that I want to mention.

627
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,320
This is around lines 102.

628
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,490
Um, or saw a friend's is a, we'll go on,

629
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,640
uh, trying to have this, um, um,

630
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:28,090
to receive a seal of approval from
the pope's about the fraternity,

631
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,280
the older,
the confraternity,

632
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:36,260
whatever that he organized when the
comparable poor brothers increased behind

633
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:39,620
him. Who's wondrous life where
better song in Heaven's glory.

634
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:44,330
The holy purpose of this. Chief Shepard
was encircled with a second crown.

635
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,500
But the eternal spirit through our
Norris on Oreos agrees that pope or no

636
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:52,400
worries agrees to to
recognize this new order.

637
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,730
And now listen to this.
That's really the point that I,

638
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,980
that I want to stop on for a while.
And when in thirst for martyrdom,

639
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,840
he had preached Christ and them that
followed him in the proud presence of the

640
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:10,490
salted and finding the people and ripe
for conversion and not being willing to

641
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:12,320
remain for search for no purpose.

642
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,280
He had returned to the
harvest of the Italian fields.

643
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,910
They are on the rough crag
between Tibor and Darren.

644
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:25,040
He received from Christ the last seal,
which is members both for two years.

645
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,810
He's alluding to the famous story of
the Stigmata that Francis received.

646
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,110
The body becomes a sign. Uh, what I was,

647
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:39,140
I was trying to explain with the
reference to the Hebrew prophets who,

648
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:40,920
uh,

649
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,920
dramatize they are the [inaudible] and
legitimize the validity of the message by

650
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:51,720
an inscription of that
message on the literal, um,

651
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,340
the physicality of their own flesh.
And the tied to live with that,

652
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,910
that point though, that Dante is making
this, this story of the Stigmata,

653
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:04,470
but it's also the story of Francis who
tries to go and preach to the salted,

654
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,330
he fails the heaven, the
theological argument, uh,

655
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,160
and the tool, the sultan
and Francis Depart, um,

656
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:19,080
uh, each, uh, on, on his
wife, on his way. Uh, and,

657
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:19,710
and that's it.

658
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,710
It's a story of that can be understood
apparently is a failure of Francis'

659
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,300
message you.
But at the same time,

660
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:35,570
it is an extraordinary hermeneutical
term that has taken place in Dante's

661
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,583
thinking.

662
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:42,090
We have had and we will have
a celebration to the Crusades.

663
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,540
Now we have an,

664
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:48,541
a story of an encounter between Christians
and Muslims in terms of peaceful

665
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,150
language,

666
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:56,150
peaceful speech where the two exponents
or two of the exponents of the

667
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:59,070
particular beliefs can come
together and encounter.

668
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,430
And they can discuss the salt and says no.
Um,

669
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,750
for him you are not ripe and for
the salt and progress as well,

670
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:11,700
then you know what you're talking about.
And uh, and they, and they leave. Okay.

671
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:16,020
So this is an extraordinary
change in, uh, the,

672
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,123
uh,

673
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:22,610
dissemination in the dissemination of
violence that had been at the center of so

674
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:27,960
much theological discourse and he had,
Dante seems to be a opting in,

675
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:31,590
following trends is on a different route.
This is I think,

676
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,290
an important change in,
uh,

677
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:37,920
in the consciousness and the historic
understanding of the relationship between

678
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:41,520
Christians and Muslims and other
interpretations of the Crusade.

679
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,870
But there is a further detail
that I want to mention here. Um,

680
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,490
uh,
the,

681
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:53,580
the detail is this detail about our two
geographic coordinates in this cancer.

682
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:00,410
Now we have just read about
Frances trip to Egypt and the salt,

683
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,590
right a little earlier,
Dan,

684
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,600
to give the ref refers to the birthplace
of Francis by talking about the Ganges.

685
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,800
Okay. So, in other words,

686
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:22,340
Dante has is aware that there is a
European world that we talked about last

687
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:28,620
time, but there are two
other, two other coordinates,

688
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:32,800
one a Hindu world of the Ganges and
we shall see what that means for him.

689
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:36,110
And the other one is the most
of them world of the salt. Him.

690
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,760
He's acknowledging in many
ways that which was, it's,

691
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:43,600
we probably may not be entirely
familiar with this, uh, this problem.

692
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,370
He's acknowledging that
which, uh, the, uh,

693
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:52,410
someone like Bonaventure
had been discussing in 1273
Bonaventure the men that we

694
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:58,590
shall see next in the next Canto traveled
to Paris to give a number of lectures

695
00:47:58,591 --> 00:47:59,740
at the University of Paris.

696
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,510
He will die a year later in
1274 and they're called, uh,

697
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,730
uh, uh, conferences and
number of conferences, uh, uh,

698
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:14,100
in which he just debates the question of
the relationship between what he calls

699
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:16,510
the, these three cultures, Hindu,

700
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:22,290
the Christian and the Muslim and ties to
see in what way they can be harmonized.

701
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,040
He connect,

702
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:32,070
it's Bonaventure connects the Hindu
religion with George [inaudible] in the

703
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:37,630
sense that the joke him of the third age,
not complicated at all.

704
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:41,890
You remember the joke him has this
paradigm of history are according to a

705
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:46,390
tripartite structure, the age of the heft
of the father, the son and the spirit.

706
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,580
The third age,
which is his own age,

707
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,750
the age wouldn't burn eventual lives when
Dante lives is the age of the spirit,

708
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:57,751
implies the elimination
of all institutions.

709
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:04,180
The idea that the spirit now is
everywhere and there is no need for any

710
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:07,570
hierarchy.
Any Bonaventure says,

711
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,600
this is exactly the world of the Hindus
who believe that God is everywhere.

712
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,440
And then he goes on talking about,

713
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,020
he Bonaventure talks about
that Muslims for who, who,

714
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:25,090
whose theology is a
theology of uh, uh, Eh,

715
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,850
an impassable distance between God.

716
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:32,920
Transcendence that nothing could
really bridge between a god who remains

717
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:37,630
invisible and the world of every man here.
Of course for him,

718
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:41,110
the mediation between
the two is given by the,

719
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,000
by Christianity because with,

720
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:46,990
with the idea of the reset transcendence
and at the same time an imminence of

721
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:51,190
God and the transcendence of God,
Dante is I think,

722
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,880
echoing this texts and this
problems in the Canto of Francis.

723
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:02,730
So he praises Francis between the Ganges
and Egypt and praises him as the one

724
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:09,130
who is a carving, a new space, the
space that he calls that have poverty,

725
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:13,510
meaning freedom, meaning the
will meaning the way of love, uh,

726
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:18,520
as a way of coming to the
knowledge of God. Um, then, uh, um,

727
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,790
I would like to move on to,
uh,

728
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,510
very briefly to canter 12 briefly,

729
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:29,960
not because I ima not, uh, uh,

730
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:32,840
I'm insensitive to what,
uh,

731
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,910
what Dante we'll do with Dominic and
cantor. 12. We really haven't got time,

732
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,470
but I want to mention to you
a number of things. Uh, how,

733
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:47,360
uh, the encounter with the Bonaventure,
uh, told, uh, we're, I'm sorry,

734
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:48,440
the encounter with,
uh,

735
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,460
with the description of Dominic told by,

736
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,610
uh, by Bonaventure, uh,

737
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,640
really rewrites the previous Canto there
in the previous can't have a friends is

738
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:07,240
where the marriage, uh,
periodic, uh, kind of, uh, uh,

739
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,680
uh, an archaic idea of, uh, uh,

740
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:16,780
the valueless ness of all the world
that he values a here though we have a

741
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:21,400
different wedding, a different
marriage between, uh,

742
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,620
Dominic and faith between
knowledge and theology.

743
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,730
If you want to put it at a
very generic and general level,

744
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:36,950
uh, and he, uh, to, uh, that is
the, let me just go over with, um,

745
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:40,370
uh,
lines and 45 in that part.

746
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,180
Let's say it'd be the description
of the legend of Dominic,

747
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:46,730
that life of Dominic in that part,
we're sweet.

748
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:51,530
Zephyr rises to open the
new leaves in which Europe,

749
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,060
once again, see how dentists,
there's a kind of continental,

750
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,410
uh, imagination here,
the, the Asia, Africa,

751
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,270
and uh,
in Europe,

752
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,860
the three continents in which
Europe sees herself reclad. Um,

753
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,590
not far from the beating of the waves
behind which the son after his long

754
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:16,820
flights sometimes hides himself
from more men lies. Favorite color.

755
00:52:16,821 --> 00:52:19,400
Hora uh,
you love this detail.

756
00:52:19,401 --> 00:52:22,680
I know that I can tell
by the way the, the, the,

757
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:26,420
the eyes of some of you smile when I
pointed this, this, uh, this thing,

758
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:31,010
Dante's talking about the
birthplace of, uh, of, uh,

759
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,370
of Dominic and places, which
is where it was in the, uh,

760
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:40,370
western part of Spain. They
are where the sunsets. Okay.

761
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,490
So the Dominic becomes
the counter to Francis.

762
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:46,760
He was born with the sunrises and now,
uh,

763
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:51,080
Dominic is within with the sunsets.
Okay. So between the two of them,

764
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:55,820
the whole movement of the sun, the trans
slash CEO, that translational faith,

765
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:57,500
not the translation of empires,

766
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,480
not the translation of
cultural translation of
faith seems to be encompassed

767
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:03,560
between the two of them.

768
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,810
But that which will make you
smile is that Dante mentioned. Uh,

769
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:12,811
and you can check Francis birth in the
east where the sunrises and line 50 of

770
00:53:14,871 --> 00:53:15,704
Cantwell 11,

771
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:20,860
and he mentions the setting sun of
Dominic in line 52 of a canter 12 as

772
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:27,840
emphasis. There is a kind of me,
there's a, uh, the, the, this is,

773
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,570
this is a kind of rule.
I think it's, uh, it's,

774
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:34,050
I've had a bit of music touch
between them. So uh, uh,

775
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,920
talk to account for the,
the,

776
00:53:36,921 --> 00:53:39,960
the difference in proximity between
the two as if this movement.

777
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,620
So here's a kind of,

778
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,700
the movement of the sun from east to
west on account of them has its own, uh,

779
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,950
quickness. It's own rhythm. Um, okay. Um,

780
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,330
and then in it was born the loving
Leachman of the Christian faith,

781
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:59,360
the holy athlete Greicius to his own
and Peter is two enemies and he's in his

782
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,980
mind as soon as it was created,

783
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:04,530
was so full of living power
than his mother's womb.

784
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:09,531
It made her prophetic when the spousal
between him and faith were completed at

785
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:10,404
the holy fond.

786
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,610
Here there is another marriage ceremony
that counters the previous marriage

787
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:17,370
ceremony Motivo Canto of Canto 11.

788
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:22,850
But I want to draw your attention
to the use of this playful images,

789
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:28,440
the athletes of of faith,
the Leachman.

790
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,450
In the previous candle we
had a Francis who I said,

791
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,960
pat of this or the values of the world
is cold and that that has really become a

792
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:47,270
formula to describe both Francis and less
Dominic though they are the so called

793
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:50,750
I give it to you in Latin
and translate it in English.

794
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,740
We call them the clowns
of the Lord your clitoris.

795
00:54:56,090 --> 00:55:00,740
They are the clowns do
plethora's low money, uh, uh,

796
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:06,390
uh, the counsel of the Lord of
this to say they're playing,

797
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:11,790
they're playing at the world, the
play with the world. They bring in a,

798
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:16,530
or we could call a perspective
of play in the world.

799
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,750
They are making fun of the world.

800
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:23,340
They are challenging the values of the
world and in this sense they bring out

801
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:27,300
that which becomes the most
impressive aspect of their theology,

802
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:31,080
which is that of a playful theology.
We'll talk more about this.

803
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,440
The notion that God plays the
creation itself is a spectacle.

804
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:41,700
I call it a field drama. The idea
that God is not, it's, it doesn't,

805
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,810
it doesn't deprive the
divinity of its seriousness,

806
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,610
but makes that citizens part of a world
of joy. That's the, that's the whole,

807
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,380
the aesthetics, the new aesthetics
that, uh, Francis managers to release.

808
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,180
And Dominic managers also too.
It's kind of playful idea of the world,

809
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,370
a comedy I or not.

810
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,510
I tried to explain to you from the
very first day when we got together how

811
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:11,511
complicated was for me at the time to
explain why Dante causes texts the comedy

812
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:15,870
versus saw sublime. It seems to be,
it's talking about how the ordinary,

813
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:18,450
a plain man of the year,
around the year,

814
00:56:18,451 --> 00:56:23,200
1300 managers have the most sublime of
experiences. And I said, yes, of course.

815
00:56:23,201 --> 00:56:28,201
This is about the happy ending because
comedy at all was the genre of happy

816
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,700
ending.
It is about the low level of experiences,

817
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,880
about the vulgar language and until users,

818
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,430
but the real and substantial reason for,
uh,

819
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,480
Dante calling his poem a comedy and
for the readers using the attributes of

820
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,540
divine was exactly.
It's exactly that,

821
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,430
a way of responding to these, uh, uh,

822
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,690
sense of, uh, the joyful
quality of creation. That's,

823
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,490
that's the point.
So for all the series,

824
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:01,570
for all the horror that we have been
witnessing through hell and purgatory,

825
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:06,790
joy seems to be that were
told which Dante is moving,

826
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:10,450
nor a tragic vision. Plus once you
play off, once you think of play,

827
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:14,260
you can no longer have the tragic vision
because you understand that the tragic

828
00:57:14,261 --> 00:57:18,550
vision is part of something
larger. It is, it is, it is part,

829
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:22,750
it's a vicissitudes, you
know, comedies and tragedies.

830
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:26,860
Elledge allergies are all linked to the
wheel of fortune in medieval iconology

831
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,400
you keep going around, but they are
all part of something really larger,

832
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:35,200
which is this playful theologies
[inaudible] ludicrous,

833
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,900
uh, that, uh, that he
has been incompetent, uh,

834
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:43,870
that has been preparing for us. Let
me just go on with, uh, a few more.

835
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:48,360
Uh, uh, the, the, uh,

836
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:53,280
a few more details here, a
couple of minutes and then, uh,

837
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,530
uh, this relationship
now of, uh, um, the, the,

838
00:57:58,531 --> 00:58:02,560
the other issue that, uh,
really and retrospectively,

839
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:07,870
another issue that Dante is raising,
let me just talk about this, uh,

840
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,310
in the cantor of Dominic,

841
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:13,990
much more than he did
in the Canto of Francis.

842
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,250
This is really unique.

843
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,750
It is Eric presentation
in terms of language.

844
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:25,380
It is a safe whatever orthodoxy Dominic
stents for because that's why what the

845
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:32,890
Dominicans, the Dominicans were
the intellectual arm of the church.

846
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:34,480
There were,
as I said,

847
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:39,481
founded with a specific purpose of
entering the universities and debating the

848
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:43,660
various points of view.
There were the Aristotelian,

849
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:48,490
so they were the poets that were
traditionally the troublemakers of,

850
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:52,380
of the, where the, the, the,
the, the, uh, the figures, the,

851
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:57,250
the philosophers and so on. Uh, and
especially in Paris, that's the, the,

852
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:59,800
the, the university. Uh, so those are,

853
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:03,370
there is an idea of orthodoxy
with Dominic and yet here,

854
00:59:03,371 --> 00:59:05,830
the whole representation takes place in,

855
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:09,400
it takes place in terms of language and
they didn't give you a couple of example

856
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,880
examples,
uh,

857
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:15,890
around lines 80 many time his nurse found
him silent in the week on the ground.

858
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:21,710
This is part of this, allow that
CEO this and you'll now of a, of,

859
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:26,110
of Dominic as if he said
for this and my calm, oh,

860
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:30,080
father of him,
Felicia Felix,

861
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:32,840
indeed or mother of him.

862
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,910
Giovan indeed if interpreted
it means what they say.

863
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,470
Dante's playing with etymologist
here or the father is really happy.

864
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:48,730
There is a relationship between the name
and his State of mind and the mother is

865
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:53,480
meaning God, the one who is full of
grace. Jovana the one who comes before,

866
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,280
uh,
uh,

867
00:59:55,310 --> 01:00:00,310
is also if you interpreted properly
this to say orthodoxy or heresy.

868
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:03,840
Yeah,

869
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,520
pink. It's, it's, it's flip
side, right? Head his head north.

870
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:11,960
It could've been talking about a
seizure of frog broadband's head. I say,

871
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,090
we've been talking about
Joe Kim's all hell is he?

872
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:17,700
He appears as a question of language,

873
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:23,090
as a question of what a normal Duh that
is above all a grammatical older and

874
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:28,311
therefore it needs a kind of correction
or has a kind of ambiguity that you

875
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:33,801
always assume and your is presumed to
be present within the order of language.

876
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,670
Anything.
In fact,

877
01:00:35,671 --> 01:00:40,671
retrospectively I can say to you that
even the schisms of inferno where we saw

878
01:00:41,551 --> 01:00:42,860
the poet bedtime Thunderball born,

879
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:47,640
you remember that horrifying picture
of the poet who holds in his own hand,

880
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:52,010
like a lamb,
his own head and goes home talking to the,

881
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,660
the Virgil and,
and Dante.

882
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,200
Or in that same canto there was the,

883
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:02,040
the presence of Mohammad who's body
seem to be completely lacerated.

884
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:07,020
Even the schisms are questions
of language. Our questions,

885
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:10,230
Dante understands them is issues
of language which doesn't vote,

886
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,260
which only means this to talk
about language and repeat.

887
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:17,430
They are part of the
imponderable quality of language,

888
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:19,020
the ambiguities of language,

889
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:23,520
the force of language and
the power of language. Okay,

890
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:27,810
so that's uh, that's what I can
tell you about this cantors.

891
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,780
And let me stop here and see if

892
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,800
there are questions that I would
most gladly here if not answer.

893
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:39,174
But,
uh,

894
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,083
wow.

895
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:47,223
Please

896
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:53,540
face to any threat from the
church came in paradise.

897
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,320
The question is,

898
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,800
would Dante have faced
some censorship probably,

899
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:06,520
uh, from, uh,

900
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:11,560
from the Church authorities for
placing Joel came in paradise?

901
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,660
Actually, no, not at all.

902
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:17,720
Because the formula he uses a,

903
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:20,640
here comes the Calabrian Breon Abbott,

904
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:26,170
Joe Kim endow that with the gift of
prophecy, more or less. That's, see,

905
01:02:26,171 --> 01:02:31,120
that's translation. It translates their
Latin formula, the spirit to profit,

906
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:34,560
ethical to tattoo,
which was would already used.

907
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:39,490
He had been jogging, had
already been exempted of, uh,

908
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:44,630
the censure of his thought that
are Bonaventure had voiced.

909
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,550
And in, uh, in the mass
in honor of [inaudible],

910
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,400
they will use that formula.

911
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:55,550
So he's actually using economical
a formula church formula,

912
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,240
uh, for his own, for Joe Gibbs
on, uh, uh, never happened.

913
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:01,560
He's not saying,
never was I saying,

914
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:06,700
but what Dante probably of that's what he
did is he should be canonized. Ah, okay.

915
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:10,970
No. But the answer is, uh,
and that's the reason why, um,

916
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:16,200
he could not have faced
any, um, any reprimands.

917
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:23,710
Yes.
With Saint Francis and

918
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,130
forensics as a form of freedom when
you went to freedom is Ernesto,

919
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:33,810
when you went and harmony,
it becomes more free.

920
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,800
Can we make that or how can we link

921
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,290
his own poverty and how

922
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,370
are we supposed to be thinking about Dante
having to depend on,

923
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:48,570
I guess the charity of others?

924
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,610
Um,
the good the question is,

925
01:03:51,611 --> 01:03:56,220
I was talking about poverty as
being a state of freedom. Um,

926
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:01,240
uh, in the Canto of France's, uh, would I,

927
01:04:01,241 --> 01:04:03,120
we're supposed to also,
uh,

928
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:08,121
associate Dante's own fate of poor exile
beggar that he was during his exile in

929
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:16,150
that description. That's, that's the
question. And I would say yes, of course.

930
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,880
The, uh, poverty,

931
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:23,130
I hope I explained mean several
things for, for Dante born,

932
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:27,390
eventual going thinking about poverty
of language over till philosophy, uh,

933
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:31,330
et cetera. But all of them understand
poverty in a very literal way.

934
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,710
But all of them understand the one thing
that this kind of poverty is really a

935
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:39,820
description of the human condition
to begin with. We are all poor.

936
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:42,010
That's the primary sense.

937
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:47,120
We are all born or defective
and it need wherever needs,

938
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:52,150
where some of us gone being needy or,
and we are all our lives,

939
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:56,350
right? So this is a general
understanding of the idea of poverty.

940
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,820
But then there is a sort of,
uh,

941
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,250
the other side of this and the other
side is that it's actually a blessing

942
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:08,280
because it's the state of freedom. This
is really very much like what you expect,

943
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:12,220
the philosophical, philosophical
freedom, you know, without any cares,

944
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:15,270
even Horace,
I don't want to have wealth and,

945
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,360
and start worrying about having the
cares about how the stock market is doing

946
01:05:20,831 --> 01:05:24,520
today are not doing. Um, so I want
to be completely free of that.

947
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:29,080
And it's a state of freedom. It's
downhill. So thinking about himself,

948
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:34,410
does it have a consolatory note for him
to believe that after all I'm not alone?

949
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:40,060
Yes, yes. I would say, uh, that's,
that's the case in his own life.

950
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:43,990
Dante,
unlike Petrarch who really die,

951
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:47,320
the poet who follows few
years after Dante, he did,

952
01:05:47,321 --> 01:05:52,321
he died one of the wealthiest man of
his time by virtue of being a poet,

953
01:05:52,941 --> 01:05:56,290
a writer, and so on. Dante
never got to that point.

954
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:59,800
I mean, I'm wondering if we should take
it literally it's sort of, you know,

955
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,910
things about poverty or is it more like a,
an ideal,

956
01:06:02,911 --> 01:06:07,700
like a sort of poetic escape into a
perspective, I guess that he adopts,

957
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:08,880
like adopting the perspective,

958
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,120
should we take it literally or is,

959
01:06:12,121 --> 01:06:16,010
or just as a poetic way of speaking?
Uh,

960
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:17,700
I think that I answered that by saying,

961
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:20,610
but I think you're asking something
else may be, and then I'll get to that.

962
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:24,360
Since you are the, uh, I think
I'm, as I'm saying that this is,

963
01:06:24,361 --> 01:06:26,520
was really the reality of his life.

964
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,380
Okay.

965
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,940
A standard such as that is bound
to a peer maybe. Well, you know,

966
01:06:32,941 --> 01:06:37,110
you need a little bit of comfort and
consolation and so you say it's a poverty,

967
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:37,990
but it's,
it's,

968
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,750
it really has the crisp
of a Francis spirituality.

969
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:46,050
But I'm not trying to
diminish Dante's convictions.

970
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,440
What I think you're really asking is,
I don't know if you really ask you,

971
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:52,770
I don't know. Uh, but, uh, I know
what you would ask him, but I,

972
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,510
that is another side to your question.

973
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,960
Are you asking me whether or not
he was a Franciscan for instance?

974
01:06:57,961 --> 01:07:00,900
Is that what you're asking?
Because if you are,

975
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:05,260
that would be a very good question in
the sense that they were a lot of uh,

976
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:07,620
ideas.
We don't have any evidence,

977
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:12,770
but a lot of ideas that he became a
member of the third older [inaudible]

978
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:17,670
Francisco's so that he
practiced therefore truly,

979
01:07:17,671 --> 01:07:22,671
literally in his own life that which
Francis himself had a practice and

980
01:07:23,341 --> 01:07:27,090
preached. So maybe that's what
probably if you weren't asking that,

981
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,850
maybe you should've been asking
that and that would have been,

982
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:30,720
I would have to say that.

983
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,510
And the question.
So

984
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,530
I have a few minutes.
So yes.

985
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:55,790
Is this story of the sultan,
those two guys,

986
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,090
are you have Dante religion or

987
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,900
Islam that we took away from the Freddo?

988
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,440
Ah,
that's a very good question.

989
01:08:09,441 --> 01:08:14,441
It's the view of a friends is
going to the sultan a suppose.

990
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:20,240
Is it meant to revise, uh,
the view that we may have,

991
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:24,350
uh, uh, formed of Dante's
attitude toward Islam,

992
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,290
reading in Fat and Fennel 28?
Um,

993
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:33,790
I think so. I think so. I
think my answer is that I,

994
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,680
that's why I was stressing this,
that there is a sort of, uh, uh,

995
01:08:37,710 --> 01:08:42,710
a radical turning that takes place in
Francis operates a change in the way the

996
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:50,280
Christians and the
Muslims can go on, uh, uh,

997
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,160
thinking of that encounter.

998
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:57,220
It's no longer through armies if it's
through peaceful discourse from this point

999
01:08:57,321 --> 01:08:59,820
of view. Francis, uh, uh,

1000
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:04,880
care result on a traditional had started
with, uh, Peter the venerable, uh,

1001
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:08,990
there were a few other theologians
who had a kind of view that it was not

1002
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:13,790
through two wars. That
this, uh, kind of, uh, of a,

1003
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:17,060
of a dialogue,
um,

1004
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,770
could take place if a war is a form of
dialogue. I'm not sure. Of course the,

1005
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:24,890
uh,
so Dan has acknowledges that in Francis,

1006
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,320
and I think that he dramatizes it,

1007
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:32,720
he justice dramatizing the
sense of the, uh, the awareness,

1008
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:36,410
which was very central to Bonaventure of,
uh,

1009
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,980
the relationship with the three to him,
the three religions,

1010
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:42,200
the Hindus,

1011
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:46,940
the Christians and the Muslims. Um, and,

1012
01:09:46,941 --> 01:09:48,890
and retrospectively,

1013
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,040
it forced me to now say things about
schism that I did not say when we were

1014
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:59,670
reading Canto 28 that schism,
we have a presence there of,

1015
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:04,910
you remember all forms of [inaudible].
We have a religious case, ma, uh,

1016
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:09,680
with, uh, Fryer, uh, who decides
who is really enjoy kissed.

1017
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,840
By the way, uh, the Chino,

1018
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:15,320
there was a the poet who
by the power of his words,

1019
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:20,150
a thunderbolt of the province.
Our poet divides father from son the king,

1020
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:24,350
the king from the sun, and therefore
breaks the unity of the body politic.

1021
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:25,870
The idea that,
you know,

1022
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:30,880
the king's two bodies in the famous
formula of the book of the Great Historian

1023
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,760
Canter, Oh, aerobics, right? So
that he broke that kind of unity.

1024
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:39,290
There is then an allusion
to a story from Lucan. Uh,

1025
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:41,120
one of the soldiers,
cool real,

1026
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:44,590
who broke away from,
uh,

1027
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:49,170
from Pohnpei and he had from Caesar
and he had his own tongue cut.

1028
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,960
It's clear that schism is to be
understood linguistically. I am,

1029
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:59,300
I'm, I am not revising my view, but now
I can tell you what I always thought was,

1030
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:04,460
uh, underlying the
representation of even Islam,

1031
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:08,300
which means that even the
interpretation of Mohammed in 28,

1032
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:11,540
horrifying though it as, as, as, as it is,

1033
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:17,060
it appears if Mohammed was the one
who was doubling the existing unity,

1034
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:23,840
that's it. That's it. Through
the power of speech. That's,

1035
01:11:23,841 --> 01:11:24,501
that's the jewel.

1036
01:11:24,501 --> 01:11:28,350
It's a horrifying representation that
does not take anything away from that.

1037
01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:33,180
But clearly you see that the damnedest
understanding of these issues is a little

1038
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:36,960
bit more nuanced that it made for s side.

1039
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:41,850
A foresight appear when we come
later in the heaven of justice.

1040
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,640
And before we get to heaven with justice.

1041
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:46,750
Dentist goes on talking about the warrior,

1042
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,940
and he begins with Joshua
the, the, the, the, the,

1043
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:55,440
the hero who brings about
the destruction of Jericho.

1044
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,910
Uh, etc. And then, but he
also mentions the crusaders.

1045
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:05,150
Uh, so there is a kind of, uh,
ambiguity that I would say that he,

1046
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:09,060
he still values what he
thinks is the heroic life.

1047
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:14,460
Nonetheless, after I say this, let me
just state another poet about Dante.

1048
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:19,050
That's true. That clearly he's
talking from a Christian standpoint.

1049
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,180
There's no question about this,

1050
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:26,720
but the underlying spirituality of Dante
is what I call the spirituality of the

1051
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,014
desert.

1052
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:33,230
Dante's truly the poet of the desert in
the sense that in the desert you have

1053
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:38,960
modes of request that where everyone
is really going because whatever we are

1054
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:43,410
going, we are always going to the
absolute whatever journey we may take.

1055
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:48,060
Its whole is the same journey. And so
the spirituality of the quest sort of,

1056
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:52,710
I wouldn't say overhauls,
but at least tempers,

1057
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:57,980
this idea of Dante being so strict and
firm in this universe of degrees and

1058
01:13:01,341 --> 01:13:05,580
distinctions that he sets up.
I don't know if I

1059
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,380
clarified this for you.
Okay. Thank you so much.
