1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,020
We talked the last time I
talked to it a little bit about,

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,400
um,
this,

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,170
this whole issue of the
imagination that Dante places, uh,

4
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:20,171
along with it and definition
of love and the love is the,

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,470
the,
the power that governs,

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,310
that shapes the moral world of purgatory.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,653
Um,

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,740
last time we talked about this tool for
psi of canto 17 to four side of this

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,680
center really makes, makes a
center kind of ellipses as it were,

10
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:40,680
right between imagination and love.
Uh,

11
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,920
love is attached to the,
it's,

12
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:48,840
it's joined to a theory of free
will because it's by choice,

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,180
uh, because of our choices that we
can be held accountable for. Uh,

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,010
the actions that we engage
in loving wrong objects,

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,270
loving too much or loving
too little. The, the,

16
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,160
some of the problems I think,
uh,

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,700
stemming from a certain misunderstanding
about the imagination that Dante should

18
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:15,450
place the imagination of the center of
the poem should really not surprise you.

19
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,540
He's a poet and he thinks that imagination
is indeed the path that he has to

20
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:25,020
take in order to come to any, uh, any,

21
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,290
any form of knowledge. It's only
through the imagination. It's not,

22
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,610
that does not exclude rationality,
but that's the discourse of philosophers,

23
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,010
that discourse of theologians if you wish.

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,080
And he places the imagination as his way.
Uh, and then from that point of view,

25
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,940
who can even challenge some ideas of,
uh,

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,190
uh, the superiority, let's say, of a,

27
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,180
of a rational argument
over the imagination.

28
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,930
Imagination is the weapon of the port.
How,

29
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:58,260
with what kind of
attributes does he invest?

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,860
The margination it's tied to memory.
The port,

31
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,300
the canto 17 begins with an
apostrophe to the readers memory.

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,310
Uh,
it's,

33
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:12,840
it appears as in the feminine imaginative,

34
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,970
uh, the, the, in, uh, in, uh, uh, the,

35
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,450
the Dante silencing
the term vis a vis the,

36
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,650
it has a sort of force imagination.
It's moved by something else.

37
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:30,651
Dante does not decide whether it's the
having of the stars or comes from inside

38
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:34,680
us. Uh, but he has a particular
power is strange power.

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,070
It comes like a thief in the night.

40
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,380
It robs us of, uh, uh,
the, the any degree of, uh,

41
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,290
of, uh, uh,

42
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,090
consciousness about the world
outside of us. Uh, uh, and,

43
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,380
and just justice, memory, uh, this
lodges, uh, you know, the, the, the,

44
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:59,040
the description of memory at
the beginning of canto 17,

45
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,650
it's her mammary that it has an incredible
memory as a form of the imagination.

46
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:07,360
As you know, uh, memory and
imagination are connected. The,

47
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,580
the,
it's a form of the imagination,

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,150
but it's a memory that has
the power to move up and down.

49
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,650
The text evokes the Alpine
heights and the depth of the mall,

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,280
the mall.
It talks about a form of blindness.

51
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,530
And yet it creates
vision, uh, uh, memories,

52
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,350
a figure of time.
And then the,

53
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:32,410
the whole passage is described in terms
of space as if it imagination had the

54
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:37,690
power to dislocate us from
where we think that we are.

55
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,823
This is the point,

56
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,120
and it's not an unusual polling for
Dante to make sensitivity is this is the

57
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,160
poetry of exile.

58
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,140
The poetry of a man who thinks
that he's a stranger. Well,

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,490
living on earth,

60
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,560
a man without a clear sense
of where he's home, maybe,

61
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,970
uh,
he is,

62
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,010
this is the poetry rooted in the
consciousness of homelessness.

63
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,250
So imagination is an extension.
And internalized,

64
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,640
internalized version of
this sense of homelessness,

65
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,760
but it has a power and that power that
doesn't seem to be able to be that a

66
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:20,020
power that can cannot quite big
campaigns or coerced within definite,

67
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,280
uh, parameters of a conduct. In fact,

68
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,530
this insistence on the imagination,

69
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,980
I'm going to be recapitulating the
things that maybe I thought I said the

70
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:33,340
probably I didn't say last
time between on the one hand,

71
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,930
the scene of wrath, which is a
form of madness. This will say,

72
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,580
uh, he's seen that eclipses the
powers of reason. That's anger. Uh,

73
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:46,660
and on the other hand, uh, at
this discourse on love, okay,

74
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,300
so this is really what I was saying,
Dante and the stands.

75
00:04:50,301 --> 00:04:53,980
And there is an imagination which
cannot quite be held in check.

76
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,470
And yet the whole point of the poem I'm
talking whenever I'm talking about that

77
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:04,330
poem I, I point out some seemingly
insignificant details like, Oh look,

78
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:09,040
this is a symmetry here between Canto
six of him, fair, no canter's each of of,

79
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,140
of purgatory or whatever.
Uh,

80
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:16,170
to indicate that it is a poem built with
a precise principle of all the in mind.

81
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,190
Not only it has all the in its,
in its technical execution,

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,490
it has all the also as a moral problem,

83
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,000
it's all about ordering the
appetites or during the will,

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,940
but at the same time alongside with it,

85
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,660
and this is the complexity and
the beauty of dentists texts.

86
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:39,220
There's another argument that almost
questions makes us to, makes us,

87
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,300
forces us into thinking
that there are some,

88
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,540
some elements that seem to be left out
of this fabric of order that Dante has

89
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,160
woven or if you like the metaphor has
built the architecture that he has built.

90
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,040
Let's see how this arguments really
containers that that's the end of the,

91
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,150
of the story.

92
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,510
This is just a stage in his saw movement
of soft knowledge and knowledge of the

93
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:09,170
world. In fact, Ken to 18, we
are now moving into a different,

94
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,570
different moral realm.
Uh, it's a moral wrong.

95
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,030
Actually now we are moving
toward this hill called Ah,

96
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:22,031
what Dante and medieval
theorists of vices core Acadia.

97
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,950
Uh,
a kid is a Latin term,

98
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,420
which in English we can describe it would
describe as a soldier of despondency

99
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,030
as they sold to in decisiveness,
sluggishness, Straw. Sloth.

100
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,180
That's it. That's this. The, the uh, uh,

101
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:45,270
and they thought if you are interested
in knowing more about what the Middle

102
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,840
Ages thought about this, this, uh,

103
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,320
scholar when's up wrote
a book called Arcadia,

104
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:56,000
exactly what they both in English,
medieval literature, Dante, et Cetera.

105
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,380
Another are their issues.

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,760
What most precise and how can we go on
understanding this question of Acadia?

107
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,860
It's in a sense the pattern or
the inversion of contemplation.

108
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,480
It's really tied to a sense
of loss of the outside world.

109
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Cadia describes the condition of the mind
that has found itself indifference to

110
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:24,410
the objects of desire.
It really is a crisis of desire.

111
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,400
One finds the objects. That's
the, this laws to sluggishness.

112
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,620
The decisiveness of the mind. It is.
If the objects of desire were, um,

113
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,900
had lost their consistency,
their attractiveness,

114
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,300
their luster, you know, you,
you just don't care. It's
the problem. Then the, the,

115
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,840
the so called noon day a devil,
the temptation,

116
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,820
the temptation of the Hmong, that's why
I call it her paralegal contemplation.

117
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:58,030
It's the temptation of that the monks
experience in their clusters when they saw

118
00:07:58,741 --> 00:08:03,710
to find that the whole idea of
turning their minds to the divine is,

119
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,480
is no longer or provisional
reprep perhaps is not, uh,

120
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,790
uh, appealing. It's, it's the, uh,

121
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,720
the loss of appeal of anything outside of
oneself and indicates a kind of, uh, of,

122
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,450
of both intellectual and
dreamy sort of condition.

123
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:24,230
And that's really what I want
to talk about now. 10 to 18

124
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,670
is the most intellectual of cantors
in, in, in, in, in purgatory.

125
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,640
Dante phases,
a theoretical issue.

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,310
He's talking to Virgil and this
theoretical reissues of Kantar 18,

127
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,120
uh,

128
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,120
flow out of the problems that we
have had in discussing canto 17.

129
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,090
As you know, the, we're talking
about imagination and love it.

130
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:54,410
There is an imagination that
somehow is vagabond. It's a thief,

131
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,590
breaks out of any particular
confines in this lodges us,

132
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,300
it picks the ground out of our own
own certainties about the, the,

133
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,740
the way we see the world.

134
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,830
Remember that the image that would
with which can two 17 starts we done to

135
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:14,520
places as in a world which you said
at the twilight there's no real light.

136
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,250
It's all foggy.
And then all of us haven't,

137
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,880
we do see something and it's unclear
whether we see something and because of

138
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:24,300
their lights that comes from
within us memories for instance,

139
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:29,130
that's highlight we carry
within us confused as they
may be or some other kinds

140
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,540
of consciousness or intuition.

141
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,650
So that's really that the discourse of
the imagination and that this large,

142
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,260
some of us here that made it
a little difficult to, to uh,

143
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,830
try to get hold of grasp. It can't,
it has the same problem in Canto 18.

144
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,750
Can't wait til begins with a
question that he asks of Virgin.

145
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,050
You are talking about love. We are
talking about this inclination cans,

146
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,650
the whole theory of love in canto 17.
Uh,

147
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,830
he says,
master

148
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,120
my site.
This is can't wait.

149
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,110
In the very beginning he saw quicken in
thy light that has a certain clearly all

150
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,640
that they word set forth
and explain and explain.

151
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,680
I pray therefore dear a gentle father
that doubts expound love to be two which

152
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:24,971
you reduce every good action
and its opposite wherever
you have told me in canto

153
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:31,131
17 really stone enough and that
virtual goes on explaining,

154
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:32,940
uh,

155
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,410
the theory that is very philosophical
theory that we have perceptions.

156
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,660
Your perception takes from our world
reality and impression and unfolded within

157
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:47,430
you. So it makes their mind
turn to it and whatever the,

158
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,660
the, the will is bound. That's
really what we call pleasure.

159
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm paraphrasing.

160
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:57,690
Poorly are thy words and my following,
and excuse me,

161
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:01,290
let me just mention another
little passage now may be playing,

162
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:06,180
I get landline 35 now maybe playing to
the how hidden is the truth for those who

163
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:10,500
maintain that every love is in
itself, Praiseworthy. He's attacking.

164
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:15,501
This is the view of the PQ realtors who
believe that every pleasure without any

165
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:20,220
particular judgment attached to the
object of pleasure is praiseworthy.

166
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:25,140
Dante says, no, we have to exercise
some moral, uh, judgements.

167
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,890
We have to this day.
We have to create distinctions.

168
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,910
We have to discriminate between
the good and the bad love.

169
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,720
Perhaps built it's matter always seems
good, but not every stamp is good.

170
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,270
Even if it be good wax.

171
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,890
I would even go so far as to say that
he's really thinking now of his friend

172
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,510
Kevin Cantonese Weedo
epicurean. Now you, you saw,

173
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:52,830
he mentioned in Canada 12
by name epicurean leanings.

174
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:57,831
The idea that that's the piggery and
ethics that is pleasure is really the,

175
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,430
the,
the all new object worthy of any pursuit.

176
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,293
And uh,

177
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,190
that's really what we are doing whenever
we were in pursuit of knowledge or real

178
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,780
experiences, then they claimed
that all of our pleasure is, is,

179
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,370
is good.
Uh,

180
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,920
that's the Hellenistic ethics that
Dante really renounces or debates.

181
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,730
And then fact Virgil goes on saying they
words and my fallen with this is Dante

182
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,670
talking answered, have revealed the
nature of love to me, but are his,

183
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:32,671
made me more full of perplexity for
a flom is offered to us from without.

184
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,000
And if there's whole moves with
no other feet, it has no merit.

185
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,710
What it goes straight or crooked.

186
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,690
Now you say that everything is
love and the love that I have,

187
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:47,580
it depends on the experience of images.
I then what in what way?

188
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:52,650
How am I going to deserve for choosing
well or not choosing well since at that

189
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,980
at the basis of the imagination we have
perceptions and what I perceived maybe

190
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,010
looking good to me and
does not look good to you.

191
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,930
So the issue is displaced from the point
of the world of the imagination to the

192
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:12,931
world of perception and a virtual Gordon
explaining a scholastic theory to the

193
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:19,960
point that uh, indeed, uh, we, we, we, uh,

194
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,070
we incline to uh,

195
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,940
to the good but then actually we have
within us, uh, the Faculty of choice.

196
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,010
He says, ah, in order this will ever, they
may be conformed. There is innate in you,

197
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,881
the faculty,

198
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:38,080
which councils and which ought to hold
fifth threshold of a scientist talking

199
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:41,800
about once again our
freewill and he will add,

200
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,240
this is what I, this is online
60 and following a, and he led,

201
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,820
this is all I can tell you from a
philosophical point of view. Uh,

202
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,770
other issues about the freewill,
uh,

203
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,490
will be explained to you by Beatrice
when she first comes to you.

204
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,580
And so it would seem to make a distinction
between the knowledge they have

205
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,950
virtual and the knowledge of
a Beatrice. And he said, uh,

206
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,200
as far as reasons he's here can tell the
beyond that wait only for Beatrice for

207
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,060
it is a matter of faith and so on.

208
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,740
So there seems to be two ways of
understanding this issue. In fact, this,

209
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:20,470
the Beatrice will never
discuss this problem.

210
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,370
But in a sense Beatrice represents the,

211
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:29,020
the explanation explanation that Dante's
looking for because Beatrice is that

212
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:34,021
kind of love that for Dante that
stands for a visionary form of now of,

213
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:39,631
of love and not just a love that can be
reduced to a question of mechanics of

214
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:45,280
physics, of perception. Um, so, uh, uh,

215
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,530
that's the word can't wait.

216
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,530
Team seems to be doing then responds and
lodges and at the same time brings us

217
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:57,941
back into the very predicament that
cantos of 17 had a post for us.

218
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,150
Okay.

219
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,770
So seems that Dante's moving and at the
same time an impasse and other impasse

220
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,210
has been reached.
And now with this in mind,

221
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,330
we turn to what he unavoidably has to do
a chat to translate all of these issues

222
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,130
of love, imagination, um, uh,

223
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,290
choice from the theoretical into the
autobiographical or existential dimension.

224
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,030
This is done in the dream and erotic
dream that Dante relates at the beginning

225
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,140
of Canto 19.
Before it turns out that cancer,

226
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,350
I just want to tell you a but
how Dante understands this.

227
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,590
He has one line at the very end
of Kantar team that I would,

228
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,150
uh, the last line of country think
that I really want to, uh, uh,

229
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,510
underlying for you or the
whole paragraph reads.

230
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,610
Then when the shades were so far apart
from us that they could no longer be seen,

231
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,530
a new thought arose within
me from which others,

232
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:13,100
many and diverse were born.
And I rambled.

233
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,070
So from one to the other
that in my wondering,

234
00:16:16,071 --> 00:16:21,071
my eyes closed and I changed my music
into dream and that empathy and that

235
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,240
introduces the dream of Canton,
I think.

236
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:30,890
But the line in Italian is really very
interesting because it presents the

237
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:35,850
connection between thinking and dreaming.
He says, in fact, it's installation.

238
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:39,560
My music, it's correct, but it's really
good to have said to make it very clear.

239
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,690
My thought, uh, Dante says one,
one line one 45, Could York,

240
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:49,691
he forgets a Rico Pairs El
Pensamiento in Sonia Trask Maathai.

241
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,830
So there's a kind of link I sort of sense
of the connection between thinking and

242
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:00,320
dreaming it.

243
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:05,321
Dante fevers dreaming at this point
over thinking you shouldn't be surprised

244
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,630
that dentists do invest the romance of
the rose at grant. Maybe we'll epic.

245
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,210
He said Dream and tells
the story of a dream.

246
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,310
The book of the Dutcher's
chicks of the chosen booker.

247
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,550
The Dutcher's is the story of a dream.
The Vita Nuova is full of dreams.

248
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,270
You know, even for those who are
interested in contemporary literature,

249
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,770
fairly contemporary, uh, I'm
thinking of kids, great poem,

250
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,240
sleep in poetry.

251
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:37,241
I don't know how many of you have a
chance to read that poet love sleeping

252
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,970
because sleep introduces the idea of the
dream and the possibility of a dream,

253
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,100
the possibility of a
knowledge which is not weld.

254
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,380
I finally have some revelations within me,

255
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,820
which is not what I would normally have
if I went away. Uh, so this is the,

256
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,840
the great privilege that they give to
dreams is the middle ages or the Middle

257
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,330
Ages really conscious of this dimension.
Yes,

258
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,280
that is a text by an author called macro
views. And if you want to know more,

259
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,350
I really, which is, uh,
uh, macro views who writes

260
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,650
on the dream of Skipio Cicero's
figure, uh, in the republic,

261
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,880
uh,
it's all about,

262
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,430
it's an encyclopedia of dreams and
the based on our terminal, Doris,

263
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,210
but it's, it's, it's, uh,

264
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,160
distinctions between Oracle's fantasies,
um,

265
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,140
insomnia, uh, uh, deliriums,
uh, dreams and so on.

266
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,590
So they are very conscious of the salt of,
of,

267
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,910
of power and, uh, revelations
that can come through dreams.

268
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,980
What is this dream about? It's now
definitely in the world of Acadia. Ah,

269
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,180
it's a dream. Let me just
read this, uh, initial, uh,

270
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:56,830
the beginning of Canto 19.
Uh,

271
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,970
I emphasize that this is now in auto
biographical or the highlighting of the

272
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:07,911
autobiographical dimension of all the
problems we have been discussing from 17 a

273
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,340
above all 16,
17 and 18.

274
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,890
Dante is to translate the
theories into a personal,

275
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:19,780
giving them a personal shape and the,
to,

276
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,270
to investigate that kind of importance
that they may have, uh, for him.

277
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,120
Uh, the, the, uh,

278
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,150
it starts then within the hour when the
day's heat over the earth and sometimes

279
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:37,800
by Saturn can no longer
temper the cold of the moon.

280
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,220
When the GM answers see the for two
Nemiah rise in the east before dawn by a

281
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,570
path which does not belong,
stay dark for it.

282
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,900
There came to me in dream a
woman stammering cross-eyed
and crooked on her feet

283
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,860
with maintenance and of sallow.
Whew.

284
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I gazed at her and as the sand revives
called limbs be numbed by the night.

285
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,850
So my look gave her a ready tongue and
then in a little time made her quite

286
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:20,040
erect and Carlotta one
features as love desires.

287
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,440
When she hit her speech,
the set free,

288
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,650
she began to sing so that it would have
been hard for me to turn my mind from.

289
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:33,321
Ha I am she saying I am the sweet siren.

290
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,020
Who by beguile the sailors in mid sea,

291
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,570
so great delight it is to hear me.

292
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,230
I turned Ulysses eager on his way to my
song and he who dwells with me readily

293
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:51,130
departs so holy.
I contend him.

294
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,710
Her lips were not yet closed again.

295
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:01,250
When a lady holy and alert appeared
beside me to put her to confusion.

296
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,670
Oh, Virgil, Virgil, who is
this? She said with anger.

297
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,390
And He came with his eyes
fixed on their own rubber. One.

298
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,660
He sees the other and let her bear in
front tearing her clothes and showed me

299
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:22,620
her belly. They are woke me
that are woke me with a stench.

300
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:24,580
The stench that came from her.

301
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,530
I turned my eyes to the
good master three times.

302
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:31,960
At least I have called [inaudible].
He said, rise and calm.

303
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,910
Let us find the opening, but
which that enters. So that's the,

304
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,010
the end of the dream. The account of
the dream. And this is also the, uh,

305
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,820
uh, the Germany, uh, will,
uh, the journey will continue.

306
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,420
That seemed to have come to
a halt or here at night. Uh,

307
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,360
as you recall,
um,

308
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,380
just to give you a sense of
Dante's ordered poetic mind,

309
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,160
this is the second of three
dreams. Uh, you didn't,

310
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:02,370
we didn't really read the first
one about encanto canto nine.

311
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,123
Okay.

312
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,960
It was the dream of Ganymede.

313
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,010
The Dante's moving from the anti
purgatory, purgatory proper.

314
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,010
And then he said the third
one will appear in Canto 27.

315
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,730
So that really Dante is scanning these
three dreams with also sense of numerical

316
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,990
symbolic numerical position,
nine 18 retold in, uh,

317
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,940
in, in 19. But, uh, it takes place
during the night then and uh,

318
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,800
and, and uh, uh, 27. So
this is the, it's a dream.

319
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,250
It's a dream that I happens
at dawn of just some details.

320
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,160
And the dream at dawn has always the
value they believe that being a kind of

321
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:52,670
prophetic dream. I said, I
said, it's a dream that, uh,

322
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,900
really has assault of Hue, color of
the truth. He says something about,

323
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,280
so if, if you understand the
dream as an allegory for say,

324
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,270
uh, because it's, it's with about
veil, it's about tearing clothes.

325
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,870
There is something hidden underneath
it all. Uh, then it may he be our,

326
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,220
this allegory has a truth value.
It has,

327
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:17,540
it's not some kind of a mere fable.
Our aura that's,

328
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,760
um, Dante starts evoking
the planet Saturn, uh,

329
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,690
which is, uh, we shall
see that in a, you know,

330
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:31,691
the Dante mentioned planets and joins
them to the various liberal arts,

331
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,100
and probably have mentioned this before.
So when, when we'll be talking about,

332
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,900
say the moon, as anthis
going to discuss grammar, uh,

333
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,340
he'll talk about Mars,
the planet war,

334
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,520
and that he'll talk about music.
Jupiter injustice,

335
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,510
Saturn is astronomy. Uh, also the, the,

336
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:58,511
the planet of contemplation in the sense
I think that he's hinting that Slav is,

337
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,820
is, uh, the averse
side, the paddle day of,

338
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,500
of contemplation at different type of
self absorbed from nonetheless, no,

339
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,840
not that we've breaking
out to contemplation means
breaking out of oneself and,

340
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:15,950
and, and reach some kind of the
gates outside of time. Uh, here,

341
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,630
it's a dream that seems to be a
movement and an inward movement. Um,

342
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,190
so it Saturn and then he continues
with this language of astronomy and

343
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:30,140
divination are no longer temporary, called
to the moon. When the Geo Mansour's, uh,

344
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,730
see the for to pneumonia. This is our
processes of knowledges. Divination.

345
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,230
That's a different type of
rational knowledge dividing signs.

346
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,530
So this is the context in which the,
the,

347
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,220
the dream is set rises in
the east before dawn by path,

348
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:50,180
which has not long say dark for it.
There came to me in a dream,

349
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,440
not the dream starts.

350
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,840
And the first thing that I have to point
out to you is that in this, uh, uh,

351
00:24:56,841 --> 00:24:57,674
in the dream,

352
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,420
the dreamer is an object.

353
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,160
The dream comes to him.
Clearly it is not real.

354
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,280
It's not something that
he decides he wants.

355
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,870
One is the object of some, some, uh, uh,

356
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,310
that's exactly the dreams or a so science
hemorrhages that descend into oneself

357
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,720
without one's own self control
or a dominion over them.

358
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,250
[inaudible] seems to place himself
in a condition of passivity,

359
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,490
which is the passivity of sloth.
Okay?

360
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,940
So the idea that I am awake and therefore
vigilant and therefore capable of

361
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:42,131
making judgments about what's happening
to me is here now for the time being

362
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,330
bracketed. Um, what is
this dream about? Oh, um,

363
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,580
what is a dream of a woman? And,
and, and the Italian text place,

364
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,290
since this is a dream of a two women,

365
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,840
two modes of being two choices,
it's almost as if he were, he isn't,

366
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,250
but you know, this is the [inaudible]
of Hercules at the side. Vega is,

367
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:06,830
they call him at the, at
the, at the, at the crossing,

368
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,370
the crossing road had to
choose between vice and virtue.

369
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,410
But Hercules is an easy time because he's
always going to the right as thinking

370
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,940
that in, in rethought graphy if you
go to the right, then you really have,

371
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:22,790
are going toward virtual,
you know, left and right. Vr,

372
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,680
dextrous and then sinister. You know,
the idea that left being a being bad,

373
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,940
the, but here we don't
have, that is two women.

374
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,930
But the language of the poem
distinguishes very carefully between them.

375
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,790
One is a family dinner.

376
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:43,040
There is in the materiality and living
in a kind of animals sense of the word.

377
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,700
And when the other woman appears,
she's called a [inaudible]. Ah,

378
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,410
the donor is the Italian word
from Domina. Uh, the lady,

379
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,850
uh, cold here, it's cold, Eh, Eh,

380
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,930
a holy,
a holy holy lady.

381
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,760
I guess I laid the holy and
the alert, et cetera. Uh, and,

382
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:09,830
and she is, uh, this is
this woman. Uh, she, uh,

383
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,680
crystallizes what we could call
the aesthetics of the ugly.

384
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:18,890
We always talking about the beauty and
the idea that beauty brings about a kind

385
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:20,380
of,
um,

386
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,300
revelation of love and the
pleasure that goes with beauty.

387
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,040
And in fact, uh, we can say that love,

388
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,670
no,
this is the platonic way of understanding.

389
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,720
Love is always a hunger
for beauty. Uh, so we,

390
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,940
the conventional way of thinking about
aesthetics is to imagine beautiful

391
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:43,200
proportionate forms he had.

392
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:47,610
Dante is giving exactly the opposite and
aesthetic of the ugly, but I, Natalie,

393
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:52,530
which is not static and somehow he's,
uh, experiences metamorphoses. In fact,

394
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:56,490
look what happens. She is
stammering, cross-eyed,

395
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,020
crooked on her feet.

396
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:02,550
She's the Anti Beatrice by obviously,
uh,

397
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:04,710
with main hands and sallow hue.

398
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,600
And now it changes from
the dreamer is an object.

399
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:14,610
The dreamer becomes a subject. I
mean, you see that from came to me.

400
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,920
And then I gazed at her
and as the survivors,

401
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,320
cold limbs Bynum by the night.
So my look,

402
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,890
my his desires transform this image
and from the ugly image that it was,

403
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:34,340
it becomes now instead
invested with attributes of
attractiveness and caught her

404
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,480
when features as love desires as love,

405
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,550
a prompt. And then this is what we
still don't understand who she is.

406
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,680
When she had the speech,
the set free,

407
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,460
she began to sing so that it would have
been hard for me to turn my mind from.

408
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,240
So the first thing the patient or we
know that they and, and the vehicle,

409
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,810
the temptation is the song.

410
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,380
This is also in primarily
a poetic temptation,

411
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,500
a certain way of understanding poetry.

412
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,650
It kind of even
meretricious form of poetry.

413
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,660
And what does she say she brings her?

414
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,160
She brings to center
stage the myth of Ulysses,

415
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,240
which has by now you always,
you know, uh, is the,

416
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,600
this steady temptation for
Dante is the point of reference.

417
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:25,980
To what extent is,

418
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,380
is on my own journey that I believe is
taking place under the aegis of divine

419
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:32,244
providence.

420
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:37,250
To what extent is it a form
of transgression and way
of going beyond boundaries

421
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,080
of breaking down or limits.
Because after all,

422
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:45,081
that's what you resisted in Canto 26 and
he knows what he has placed him but he

423
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:50,311
cannot get him out of his mind because
you listen stands or something powerful.

424
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:56,070
And what he stands for is the idea that
there is no knowledge worth heaven,

425
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:02,080
which is not connected
with transgressions, which
is not connected with,

426
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,500
with breaking down or barriers
and limitations in a way
because Dante is doesn't

427
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:09,470
do this thing. So, um,

428
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,270
accidentally when it comes
to Canto 26 or paradise,

429
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,950
he will see Adam and there is another
who is for him without a doubt,

430
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:22,090
a poet because it's the name giver
is the name, give her of the world.

431
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,660
He is the one who brings the
world into being through language.

432
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,520
And when Dante meets Adam,

433
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,150
there'll be some interesting details
that we can talk about there,

434
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:32,920
but I can anticipate this for you.

435
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Adam is the one who has
understood transgression are
and that transcription or

436
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,800
for Adam appears as a source of growth.

437
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,780
It's not a fall for Dante said growth
said growth and understanding other types

438
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:51,490
of limitations because we cannot just
say that we, we, we care down all limits.

439
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:53,950
We tear down some limits
in our experience.

440
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:59,230
Adam test down and the, the,
uh, eats of the, the, the,

441
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:04,150
the fruit of the tree that had been
forbidden for him. Like a good son.

442
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,440
The father says, don't eat it, and he
goes and eats it and then he eats it.

443
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,810
He grows into a human being.

444
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,830
He discovers that the world is
not for him to be as a child,

445
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,720
then he has to have other experiences
of death, of maturity, of work,

446
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:20,470
et Cetera.

447
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,400
So there are ways in which we have to
understand this idea of breaking limits in

448
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:29,401
a different way from maybe the way I may
have conveyed it to you is none to here

449
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:34,180
is thinking of Ulysses and
anticipates the story of Adam. Uh,

450
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:39,190
there's a great temptation for Dante is
to believe that he to his journey is a

451
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:42,370
journey that enact Julissa's journey.
They Siren.

452
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,160
That's when she's telling him what she,
she's telling him is,

453
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,190
I made Julissa's happy. It's a, it's a
lie because we do know that you listen,

454
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:54,730
it's never really stopped off the
island of Capri in who's grotto.

455
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:59,350
This hiring is mythological.
He said to reside.

456
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,320
We do know that she, he did listen
to the song of the siren. Uh,

457
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,970
he made sure that his companions
would know and he hit himself bound

458
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,220
bound to the mast of the
ship. Okay? So that is,

459
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,570
that is a transgression and the
binding going on at the same time,

460
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:21,070
as I said at anyway. Uh, she
lies about, I turned Ulysses.

461
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:25,810
He got on his way to my song
and he who dwells with me.

462
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,740
So the first,

463
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,740
the other lie or the extension of the
lie is that the siren is making false

464
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:36,910
promises of happiness to the dream.
Where she's saying is,

465
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,940
you stay here with me and I am
the end of all that you desire.

466
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,460
I am going to give you all the pleasures
that you want and therefore your

467
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,460
journey may very well be over
if you are weary of the road.

468
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,680
This is the place where you should stop.

469
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,980
We have another figure that emerges
clearly the antagonist of the siren.

470
00:32:57,171 --> 00:32:58,130
We don't know who she is.

471
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:02,810
We'll find out very quickly in Canto
30 and 31 cause the same scene will be

472
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:07,610
reenacted with the arrival of Beatrice.
We imagine that here too.

473
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,530
We have forced to imagine
that here too. She is, uh,

474
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,820
she's Beatrice,

475
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:17,450
her lips were not yet close again
when they lady wholly in the alert,

476
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,370
a woman in the sense
of, uh, uh, Damina, uh,

477
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,180
appeared beside me to put her to
confusion. Virgil Virgil is this,

478
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:30,230
she said with anger and he came with
what is the difference between them,

479
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:33,950
between these two women,
they are two different forms of poetry.

480
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:39,430
So now we understand why Dan had to been
talking about the imagination all along

481
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,890
because this is really what will introduce
him to the stakes in claiming to be a

482
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:50,270
poet.
This is what he's been talking about.

483
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:55,271
The actual faculty of himself as a poet
and the Cantos that will come 2122 to 26

484
00:33:56,931 --> 00:34:01,931
and 27 constitute the most important
segment about ways of understanding

485
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,880
literary history, literary tradition, uh,

486
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,520
or the praise of originality within
that particular history and so on.

487
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,240
We are going to enter the
world of poetry more directly.

488
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:18,230
So they are two different women.
They speak to different voices.

489
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,700
One sweet meretricious and falls,
that's sweet song.

490
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,200
The other one very harsh who
says the journey is not over.

491
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,060
One forecloses the journey
of and the quest of Dante,

492
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,280
uh, be like, Ulysses,

493
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:38,390
I know that you want to be
like [inaudible] you can
stay here with me and I am

494
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,280
the end of all your
journeys and your quest.

495
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,460
The other one is claiming
exactly the opposite.

496
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,660
The journey has to continue
these two types of songs,

497
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,870
song or this hiring suite,
the chess,

498
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:53,870
also the stench of death attached to it,

499
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,470
the stench of the decomposition of
her body. And on the other hand,

500
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,270
a journey by this austere voice,
the voice of maybe their voice of love,

501
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,100
the voice of harshness. No, that then
just the language of, uh, of sweetness,

502
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,460
uh, is, is, uh, that have, uh, uh, uh,

503
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,520
love as an ongoing quest. That's what
she's saying. So two forms of love,

504
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,730
two forms of poetry,
two types of women,

505
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,400
the scene in case you're
interested in this.

506
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:27,230
How many of you I'm sure have
thought about it literally stages.

507
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,080
The, the, the,

508
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,090
the scene at the beginning of the
consolation of philosophy of breaches,

509
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,020
which in turn is thinking
about who internally,

510
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,570
thinking about the book 10
of the republic by Plato. Uh,

511
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,740
the idea of the place,

512
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,920
that place of love as the place of poetry
and philosophy changes that tradition.

513
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:53,340
This is not just poetry versus philosophy.

514
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,740
It's two different types of poetry.

515
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,030
Poetry can be also a philosophical poetry.

516
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,710
Poetry can be meretricious employed.
You can be also there.

517
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,670
There's sort of a rigorous,

518
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,760
severe form of investigation of one's
self and the world to different types of

519
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:14,430
poetry. Two different types of
loves to different types of women.

520
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,470
Which of the two is better?

521
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,670
How can we go on deciding that
one is better than the other?

522
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,590
Is there an objective pattern,

523
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,700
objective criterion by which you can say
Beatrice is actually better than this

524
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:31,380
hiring.
That's Dante.

525
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,260
Dante were of this idea of yes.

526
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,370
And the reason is going to be the foreign,
very simple,

527
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,440
the avoidance of death.

528
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,430
The Siren is the figure
that stands for that.

529
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,850
Underneath the pleasures of her language,

530
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,990
there is a stench that emanates from
then underneath that allegory. He,

531
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:59,991
Dante sees the danger of closing and the
danger of making the here and now and

532
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:05,730
the limitations of the here and now
and the limitations. So that song,

533
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,800
the end of his journey,

534
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,040
it's really a choice between an open
ended quest and the foreclosure of the

535
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:14,520
siren.

536
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,520
This is the only way in which you can
objectively believe that there is a

537
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,200
hierarchy between these two
loves in between these two women.

538
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,430
Um, we, we moved to Canto, Ah,

539
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,910
21 and 22.
Um,

540
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,300
but I'm wondering if I shouldn't take a
few questions here about this cancer, um,

541
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,990
uh, on any other problems before we
move on to something a little bit more,

542
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,710
a little bit different.
Um, more classical,

543
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,500
the encounter between stations and Virgil.

544
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,540
So let me see if there are some questions
now about this, this face, this, uh,

545
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,570
this cantors,
uh,

546
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,040
or would you like to meet to go on and
then maybe we can come back to them.

547
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,750
Very good you say that,
but

548
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,800
the question is excellent.

549
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,570
I was supposed to draw some
connection between this scene and,

550
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,680
and,
and the,

551
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,710
and the scene of Cassela in
Canto to above all of purgatory.

552
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,560
I call it excellent because I
agree you're supposed to and,

553
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:36,610
and it's the reappearance and the
different guises, the same computation,

554
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,740
how the aesthetic can become a,

555
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:42,880
both a way of gathering people
at, on this health. Oh, that,

556
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,900
that's the famous story of Cassela
the power of the song just collects,

557
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,910
gathers,
but at the same time,

558
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,840
it endusers assault to
forgetfulness of uh, uh,

559
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:00,930
whatever purposes those souls are
supposed to entertain and carry out.

560
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,630
The difference of course,
is that it's the same story here.

561
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:06,940
Now the differences is not between,

562
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,360
let's say a castle,

563
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:15,100
a UN and others with, with
the language of a, of Cato.

564
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,760
Here,
it's more an an autobahn directly.

565
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,550
We are moved into the
consciousness of the pilgrim.

566
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,990
We have entered this as deep as
we can into his unconscious mind.

567
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,940
This is the moment of what he's,
he comes to an,

568
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,820
an amazing self revelation
that had the story of,

569
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:36,100
because Ella had the
ring of public discourse,

570
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,090
poetry as a public act,
um,

571
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,890
gathering a number of people around it.
So this is a very good,

572
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,210
that's a thank you for mentioning
that. And by the way, uh,

573
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:51,730
I don't know that we never probably
read it, but if you read the beginning,

574
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,010
I think I read it in Italian
for professor Brookshire's.

575
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:59,470
I know she likes the province, our
song, but the beginning of Canto eight,

576
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,750
uh, also that moment of
the nostalgia for the, the,

577
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:08,320
the safety of home, uh, the
weariness of the evening,

578
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,960
the evening song, uh, et Cetera,

579
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:16,260
that that represents another version of
the same kind of a dilemma with which

580
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:19,170
the pilgrim is a confronted.

581
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,540
Okay.

582
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:31,540
Maybe we can come back to some
of this since we move into this,

583
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:36,490
literally is the segment
of the poem. I said 21, uh,

584
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,920
22, uh, going through 20, 23, 24,

585
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,990
a, which is really, uh,
has poetry now as, uh,

586
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:51,720
it's, uh, the subject matter
and Nantais begins with, um,

587
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,910
um,
let's say the classical tradition,

588
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,710
the relationship between an encounter
that takes place. We are in the,

589
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,940
in the world of avarice
and product galaxy,

590
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:07,180
the encounter between stations
and Virgil as you know,

591
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:12,181
stages views himself as
a disciple or Virgil.

592
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,301
And in many ways,

593
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:17,680
he challenges Virgil's ideology.

594
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:22,060
Virgil's thought was virtual
can go on writing a poem,

595
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:26,570
the Aeneid and EC logs,
which are about the,

596
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,270
the, the pastoral world
or the Geologix. You know,

597
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:35,020
this world about the cultivation of the
earth where virtual appears that he's

598
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:40,030
most anti or fic he distinguishes and the
distances himself from the traditional

599
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,460
fuse,
the poet of mad love,

600
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:48,170
who descends into the depths of hades.

601
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,110
Uh, and of course, it's a waylaid by,

602
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,040
by the mad love for a,

603
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:57,710
you read this and is the way of
conquering death through the song.

604
00:41:57,711 --> 00:42:02,590
He believes that through by singing,
he can bend, uh, the loss of a,

605
00:42:02,591 --> 00:42:06,160
of death and therefore gain immortality.
Uh,

606
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,900
Virgil opposes a world of, uh,
of, of work. The world of, uh,

607
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,530
of, of mature. The responsible
world of, of a knee is, uh,

608
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,880
uh, the, the, the,

609
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:21,881
the hero who is so divided against himself
and yet managers to always find his

610
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:24,830
way around, you know, and, uh,

611
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,380
and this kind of regularly
erratic path, uh, of, uh,

612
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:34,320
of his epic, uh, stages,
uh, counters, Virgil,

613
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,720
uh, stations writes the Tobias, he writes
another look. We, she never finished.

614
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:42,260
And another little epic called the, the,
the Achillea the story about Achilles,

615
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,230
but he'd the only a fragment
he writes the turbine,

616
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,770
which really goes against
those claims of virtual,

617
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:53,830
or he retrieves a Mexican junction
between tragedy and the epic,

618
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,730
uh, the world of, uh,
the world of Jocasta.

619
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,040
And he depose the monstrosity of
that world, the world of up Polynese,

620
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,170
uh, and the [inaudible]
the world of Antigony, uh,

621
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,730
cast in as a kind of nightmarish world.

622
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,240
It's literally the most
psychological of these epics,

623
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:17,120
the wars that happened
in the mind. And, and,

624
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:21,410
and this idea of a monstrosity of human,

625
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,270
our fate and human desires.
Uh, and, and so that,

626
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,170
these are the two worlds that Dante
wants to bring together in this little

627
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:33,500
appeal. And I would call it a opinion,
is a Greek word, meaning a literal epic.

628
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,210
This is a transcriptional to epic,

629
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,940
Texas gathered into one and
two elliptical form. And,

630
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,250
and he has a tough,

631
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,280
tough task because what he wants to show
is the possibility of harmonizing the

632
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:46,334
two of them.

633
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,690
And he shows how the two of
them really go talk as friends,

634
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,360
friends across time. Of course, uh,

635
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,260
Stasia's lives around the year 17.

636
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:02,240
Aidy Virgil dies in the year 19. Um, um,

637
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,070
another friends because poetry has managed
their poetry, has made, made them up.

638
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:12,130
The poetry of, of Virgil has made them
friends and, and, and stations is,

639
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:16,520
is, is a sort of a classical
version of Dante himself.

640
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:20,960
Dante's the disciple virgin,
so was stations. So he has
to bring them together.

641
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,220
But as soon as the pressure of making
them agree only is because they're two

642
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:29,360
different visions. That in and of
itself may not be all that difficult.

643
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,010
Stations is very skeptical
about, uh, uh, the empire.

644
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,530
Virgil is not all that skeptical.

645
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:41,160
It's possible to read the Aeneid and see
that there's a lot of ambiguity in the

646
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:45,750
way which he, he talks about
about, uh, Augustus and the empire,

647
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,780
but it's basically writing the epic that
justifies the ideology of the empire.

648
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,560
That is a difficulty between them,

649
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,540
is that Dante said the real difficulty
and challenge for Dante is that he has to

650
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:02,541
try to understand how stages start to
adjust Stasia's vision of monstrosity to

651
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:10,830
some idea of the sacred.
This is the real challenge.

652
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,740
This is the difference that Dante
has from the classical world.

653
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:22,100
How do we understand the sacred and
in what way is it's impossible to use

654
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:26,580
Stasia's Virgil as he already did
with Cato, who is, by the way,

655
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:30,810
they the hero of Lucas third
poet of this epic tradition.

656
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,000
Virgil Lucan stages.

657
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,540
How's it possible to
see in these texts of,

658
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,630
of stages the seeds of something good?

659
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,800
How can we build anything
good out of this, um,

660
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:48,210
vision of heroes and characters

661
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,420
who just fornicating with, uh,

662
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,530
with her own fantasies,

663
00:45:55,531 --> 00:46:00,531
who cannot really get out of there are
of their minds who just are discover

664
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,740
their own,
um,

665
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,490
and changing submission to a
force that's nonsense to fate.

666
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,960
It's really absolutely a different
worldview from the world of virtual.

667
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:17,640
So let me just go on a
little bit with that. At 21,

668
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,780
I just, uh, um, talking,

669
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:26,430
first of all with a
Dante begins, um, with,

670
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,850
uh, um, an allusion to, um,

671
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:35,550
this natural thirst, natural
thirst, which is this world of, uh,

672
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:40,200
of their actual thirst for knowledge.
It's really much the world of the banquet.

673
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,420
There were the virustotal. We have this
incredible thirst for knowledge. And then,

674
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:48,920
uh, uh, uh, uh,

675
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:54,160
this figure called
stations appears. Uh, um,

676
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:59,200
we also being told that
nature, the natural world, uh,

677
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,070
is, uh, mysteriously shaking.

678
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:05,970
There's an earthquake because every
time that I sold gets liberated from the

679
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:10,380
purgatorial, uh, experience
or expiation, uh, the,

680
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:13,110
this purification and expiation.
Then the,

681
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,650
the mountain trembles and they, and, and,

682
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:21,630
and stages can go on with them up
to the garden of Eden. And, uh,

683
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,830
and then, um, uh, stages, uh,

684
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,040
reveals himself and he will
say, and unlined 60, um,

685
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:31,663
uh,

686
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:37,110
and I who have laid in this pain 500
years or more Statia speaking felt.

687
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:42,460
But now my will free for the better
threshold there for thousands feel the

688
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:43,294
earthquake.

689
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:47,050
And here the devout spirits to the
mountain ran the praises to the Lord,

690
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,900
sued that his erection is taking place.

691
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:55,260
And this is going to be the
resurrection of stages. And virtual. Uh,

692
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:59,890
it's a stages but also virtual in
their own, their own vision. Uh,

693
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,100
so he goes on describing himself
and the time when the good titles,

694
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:08,380
the emperor he's evoking
at the time of the, uh,

695
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,880
he's recalling the time
that the destruction of the
temple in Jerusalem at the

696
00:48:12,881 --> 00:48:16,990
time when the good titles by helping
with the king most high avenged, uh,

697
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,500
justice,
divine mysteries of justice,

698
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:24,550
the wounds from which poured the blood
sold by Judas replied, the spirit,

699
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,450
I boy Yonder, they name that
most end users. And donors.

700
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:32,720
Most famous indeed,
but still without faith stations.

701
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,520
A Pagan, uh, uh, really
born again. Now this is a,

702
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,330
the born again pagan, uh,
that, uh, appears in this, uh,

703
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,230
uh, in, in this camp.

704
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:49,470
So sweet was my spirit of song
that Rome drew me roam drum.

705
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:55,440
It's, they, it's an interesting, ah,
images. It's really speaking of, uh, uh,

706
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:00,250
roam, having a kind of power that usually
we linked with love with, with desire.

707
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:05,230
You know, the, the pool of desire.
Rome brought him to it, to, uh,

708
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:09,010
to herself, a to loosen without
going into that to itself.

709
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:14,011
And then I was worthy to have my brown
and my brows adorned with myrtle men

710
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,350
young still speak my name,
which is stages.

711
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,360
And I sang of Thebes and then have a
great achilles, but fell by the way,

712
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,530
with the second burden, uh,
he, he could never complete.

713
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:31,270
The second text, and I'll look at the
way he speaks about poetry. Spoke,

714
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:34,780
speaks through sparks as a kind of fire.

715
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,030
Sparks at kindles the fire
in me where from the divine,

716
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,740
a flame,

717
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,910
the divine flame from which more
than a thousand have been lit.

718
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,940
I mean the Aeneid.
So that's,

719
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,870
that's already poetry now
is invested with power,

720
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,270
the power to

721
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:01,480
light the fire in the
readers and in its followers,

722
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,640
which was important. My mother and
my nurse, uh, without it, I have no,

723
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,780
I had not weighed a dram and have
lived yonder and Virgil lived.

724
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,370
I would have contented to a sand from
then more than I was due before coming

725
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:19,600
forth from banishment.
So the two metaphors to speak of poetry,

726
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:22,000
one is that of the sparks of fire.

727
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,600
And the second one is that of nourishing
the inner hunger mother and nurse.

728
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,130
It's, it's, it's a nursing,
the nursing of, uh,

729
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:35,390
of his readers.

730
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:40,630
So a great acknowledgement of the
master without his knowledge that,

731
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:46,160
that, uh, it is Virgil to whom
he's speaking and then came to 21,

732
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,110
which is,

733
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:51,450
and another image that may remind
you of the story of [inaudible],

734
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:56,240
um, stages reveals Dante
reveal stations, identity,

735
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,710
a virtuous identity.
It's Restasis and they try to,

736
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,880
uh,
the two of them tried to embrace already.

737
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:08,390
He was bending to embrace lines one
third and following my teacher's feet.

738
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,200
But he said to me, brother,
do not. So for that word,

739
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:14,360
the shade and the shade,

740
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,420
thou seest and he rising.

741
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:22,130
Now Thou canst understand the measure
of the love that Burns and me for the,

742
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,610
when I forget her
emptiness in three chains,

743
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:31,060
assorted things and mistake
that has been made before.

744
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,470
And the mistake that I think,
uh, is, uh, is meant to, um,

745
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,510
to convey the,

746
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,900
the claims of the illusions of poets
to believe that there is some kind of

747
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:49,820
solidity to them and not just
to the poetry, to the works,

748
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:54,250
but a solidity to them
that then this embrace, uh,

749
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:59,430
belies no solid family as
a kind of emptiness is a
sort of distance between the

750
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:04,340
poets and their works. This
is not going to, I think,

751
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:09,370
interfere very much because it's the works
the works of art that we are going to

752
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,450
be talking about. And
we in, in Canton 22. Uh,

753
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,940
so the,
uh,

754
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:21,830
the two poets now are our
self, uh, in in a good note,

755
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:26,890
each an acknowledgement of the other
and they go on talking about line 10 and

756
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:30,320
following, um, uh,

757
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,380
Virgil asks stages to explain to him
why this moral blight existed at him,

758
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,740
why they scene of avarice. Um, why
the scene of Alvarez. And he says,

759
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:50,950
this is the passage love cantor 22 lions
12 and following love kindled by virtue

760
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,020
always kindles and other.

761
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:59,480
That's the salt of
vitality and power of love.

762
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,370
It's not self enclosed.
It's one that goes on, uh,

763
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,870
creating and propagating itself
has a generosity of its own.

764
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:14,000
Okay. Has a kind of charitable ness of
it. So if only it's flame appear without.

765
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:19,130
So fire and love seem to be
conjoined by this common,

766
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,590
uh, element, that common, uh,

767
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:26,550
element of the power of
propagation or perpetuation.

768
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,070
Um, uh, from the hour. Therefore,

769
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:32,940
when juvenile descended among us in the
limbo of hell and made their affection

770
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:37,020
known to me, my goodwill toes,
the was as great has ever held.

771
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:41,460
Any one for a person not seen so that
now the stairs will seem short to me,

772
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,500
but tell me and there's a friend,
forgive,

773
00:53:44,501 --> 00:53:49,501
give me if with too much assurance has
slackened the rain and there's a friend

774
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,600
speak with me now.

775
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:56,990
How could avarice find a
place in depressed along
with so much wisdom is by the

776
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:02,370
zeal thou was filled with um,

777
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,210
this is a passage of
some, uh, some importance.

778
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:11,360
The because first of all the
claim of friendship between the,

779
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,240
from Virgil,

780
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:17,520
he's moved by the show friendship on the
part of stations as let's talk now as,

781
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,290
as friends.
Um,

782
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,020
friendship is an ethical
virtue as you know, in uh,

783
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,300
artists thought was ethics and for
Cicero writes a treatise called on

784
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:31,980
friendship,

785
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:36,420
which done mentioned at the beginning
of his philosophical texts in the belief

786
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:38,340
that friendship is really
the other language.

787
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,560
The other term for philosophy or it's
the friend and the philosopher are

788
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:45,540
interchangeable.
This is if there is,

789
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,550
there is a love of in friendship and
there's a level of truth that is the I,

790
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:50,910
that is the idea.

791
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:56,640
There is some exaggeration on the part
of virtual because there is really a

792
00:54:56,641 --> 00:55:01,200
friendship implies to some kind of some
degree of equality, right? You must have,

793
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:04,320
in order to be friends, you must
have some idea, we call it in fact,

794
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:09,321
it's usually said that tyrants and slaves
are not capable of love or friendship

795
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:13,650
because both since one is
the version of the other,

796
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,490
both really have a kind of uh,
uh, uh, inequality vis a VI.

797
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:23,490
The other, the slave is by
definition inferior. They
tyrant thinks he's superior.

798
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:27,120
So friendship remains a kind of
equality and this is a little bit of an

799
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:32,040
exaggeration because there is no equality
between stages instead of Toric or

800
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:36,860
exaggeration stages. And
Virgil Virgil is, um, uh,

801
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:41,890
I acknowledge as being superior to stages
stage of sees himself as a disciple

802
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:46,590
and therefore views Virgil as
superior from a poetic point of view,

803
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,600
from a theological point of view.
Stages is superior to Virgil was,

804
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:55,350
stations is going on to paradise and
virtual is going to go back to limbo.

805
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,270
So there is a kind of, uh, uh, the,
the, uh, it push in the, in the,

806
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:04,380
in the direction of a wishful thinking
may be on the, on the part of,

807
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:09,510
on the part of Virgil. I must also
add that Dante said, uh, kind of, uh,

808
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:11,620
some were closer to do about him.

809
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,140
He may be aware that the friendship was
never really thought of as a Christian

810
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:16,974
virtue.

811
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,530
It's a classical impaled and virtue and
because it really confuses, you know,

812
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:26,800
it's the idea is a friend is
always part of one soul. Uh,

813
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,650
it's really an earthbound. They said
it's, it's a north bound up, uh,

814
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,310
experience.
So it was always the thought,

815
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,310
not Augustan Augustan who has a friend,

816
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:42,400
I leap years and feels responsible
for our repairs. But by and large,

817
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:43,930
it was this idea that the,

818
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:48,370
the friendship could
distract the mind from, uh,

819
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:53,340
from an assent to a
higher and superior ends,

820
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:57,550
parodies, Yak excesses, uh, and pleasures.

821
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,840
So not, they must be aware that there
were efforts to Christianize this,

822
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:03,760
this idea. Nonetheless, it,

823
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:07,840
it brings the conversation
between them back to the earth.

824
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,973
Uh,

825
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:14,010
and they talk as if there were two friends
really meeting in the forum and the

826
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:19,231
Agora and chatting about their moral
failings or their own poetic crafts and

827
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,790
visions.
How could you find the,

828
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,120
how could you be so avaricious when you
were so enlightened in so many other

829
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:32,650
ways? That's the question. STASIA's
responses is not avaricious.

830
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:37,480
And I think that that adds a great
deal about their understandings,

831
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,380
the misunderstandings of each other,
but also their understanding. So poetry,

832
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:46,240
he goes on talking about the fact
that he is prodigal all the time.

833
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,540
So then, so say, uh, that he, uh,

834
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,720
you may remember from Kantar several
of fair knew the difference between the

835
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:57,410
avaricious and, and the sense of
practicality that product quality was, eh,

836
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:58,080
Eh,
a,

837
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:03,070
a violation of the economy
of goods by devaluing,

838
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:07,330
by getting of devaluing them,
not holding on to them.

839
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,960
The avaricious overvalues
the goods and tries to,

840
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,920
to heap amass a larger
quantities of goods.

841
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,360
So he goes on,
uh,

842
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:21,490
really thinking stages once to make it
clear for at least 40 lines about the

843
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:26,020
fact that he's, uh, he was prodigal
and w we have to understand what,

844
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,840
why he would say that.
And then in fact,

845
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:33,400
he goes on acknowledging once again,
stations focus, moral conversion.

846
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:37,150
So that's the first thing about
what poetry can do. She says no,

847
00:58:37,151 --> 00:58:42,151
then that iris was too far removed from
me and this access thousands wound have

848
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,260
punished,
have punished and head.

849
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:49,140
I had it not been that are corrected my
ways when I understood the lines where

850
00:58:49,141 --> 00:58:54,040
as if in rage,
human nature that it's cry to what occurs.

851
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:59,220
Hunger for gold that's down or
drive the appetite of mortals.

852
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:04,470
I should be rolling the weight and know
that this small jousts but he's saying

853
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,480
is that he read a passage in a book,

854
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:12,481
three of the Aeneid the story that we
already saw or poorly Doris who had been

855
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:14,790
killed because of a,

856
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,830
they want to rob him of
his gold and, uh, uh,

857
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,160
stages reach the moral conversion.
Um,

858
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,900
I like this a lot we can say about this
lines the first of all, first of all, um,

859
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:31,160
I think this exemplifies
how we actually read.

860
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,050
We read them with this member,
the integrity of the text.

861
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:40,490
We take out of a book out of a
passage that which will we find,

862
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,710
um, uh, relevant to us. Um,

863
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,930
and he takes some blinds, uh,
in, in, in, in their only,

864
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:50,720
take some lines from the book,
three of their need.

865
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:55,490
He also alters the meaning,
the original text.

866
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:58,970
The virtuous says exactly the opposite.
To what though,

867
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:03,800
why do you not contain, uh, the, the, uh,

868
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:08,540
why do you not contain the hung
the appetite of mortals or sacred,

869
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,440
sacred,
a hunger for gold,

870
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:17,420
which the text and says curse. It's the
word sacred, which Dante is using here.

871
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,790
Why do you know,
uh,

872
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,420
contain or sacred fame of gold
or sacral assignment that loader,

873
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:28,430
they wouldn't sacred. As you
probably know, some of you may know.

874
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,300
It means two things.
It's symbols,

875
01:00:30,301 --> 01:00:34,340
some biggest term that
you semantically speaking,

876
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:39,420
because you can describe both that which
we call the holy and that which we call

877
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:42,290
the profane.
He joins them together.

878
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:46,760
There's no clear cut distinction between
the pro foundational blasting on the

879
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:48,920
other hand or the sense of holiness.

880
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,510
So I can understand why my translation,
Saint Claire,

881
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:58,280
I'm a translator, uh, decides to
choose the cursed instead of a,

882
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,100
call it secret. For instance, cursed,

883
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:05,720
he's dismembering his taking one,
one side or what is it?

884
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:10,370
Much more complicated version of the
meaning of the word. So that's one thing,

885
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:15,490
but the poetic text of Virgil has a
moral power over and against Virgil's own

886
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:19,730
intentions.
We can understand now retrospectively,

887
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,550
why dentists to distinguish between
poets and the works. That's,

888
01:01:24,551 --> 01:01:28,910
you know, we can read the works regardless
of the intentions of the others.

889
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:33,170
And we can, we can select or
take out a of those texts,

890
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:35,180
whatever we think that we were.

891
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:39,980
However we think that they speak to us.
And then he goes on,

892
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:42,710
uh, uh, describing

893
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:48,650
his poetic growth. Now
this is lines, uh, uh,

894
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,510
55 now went down to sing. The crew
alarms, the Double Wolf Jocasta,

895
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,210
the double wars children,

896
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:01,260
a ticklish and colonies in the tragic and
that big text called the suburban said

897
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:06,860
the singer of the BW colleagues.
So see that's already the opposition.

898
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:10,250
Virgin now appears as
the author of a pastor,

899
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:15,251
a poem that your colleagues were a
rivalries are always going to be placated.

900
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:21,060
That is the big colleagues of the pastoral
are virtues are always about rivalry.

901
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,810
Rivalry between two shepherds,
which,

902
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:29,070
which of us they ask is the better singer,

903
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,130
which of us is the better poet.
And that is always,

904
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:36,870
there is never any tragic outcome.
There's some, some, some uneasiness,

905
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:39,030
some anxiety between uh,

906
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,100
running through that kind
of debate between the posts.

907
01:02:42,101 --> 01:02:46,770
But it's not the rivalry of joke of,
of Polynesians [inaudible] so that's,

908
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,450
that's really the difference that
Dante is highlighting between them.

909
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,690
And then it continues.
It does not appear by the nodes,

910
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:57,690
which clear touches with the,

911
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:03,480
so the college and other hand,
the Cleo is the muse of history.

912
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:09,260
So cleo is the muse for history
is the world of Stasia's.

913
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:16,140
That's a faith yet made the faithful
without which we're doing is not enough.

914
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:21,350
If that is so what son or what candles
dispelled I darkness so that thereafter

915
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,840
it's lift the sales,
be fine,

916
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:27,690
be behind the fishermen.

917
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:30,060
Now we know that what he's really asking

918
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,280
in a general way is the relationship
between poetry and faith.

919
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:40,770
How could stages we know how he
reached this moral conversion.

920
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,740
Now we have to be told somehow,

921
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,090
how did he go on finding a faith?

922
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,340
What is the relationship
between the two of them?

923
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:55,370
Can poetry reveal and lead us
on to the world of faith or not?

924
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,700
Uh,
and stage two says already,

925
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:04,230
that's really the answer that he will
provide. And the other ends with him.

926
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,440
Thou first directed me to
Parnassus the mountain of poetry.

927
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,430
So that poetic experience,

928
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:16,640
the poetic apprenticeship is the preamble
to the experience of faith to drink in

929
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:19,674
its caves.

930
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:25,330
A metaphor that picks up the natural
thirst of the previous canter to drink and

931
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,780
escapes.
And the first,

932
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,590
after God enlightens me
that didn't like him,

933
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:37,010
that goes by night and carries the light
behind him and does not help himself.

934
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,710
But makes wise those who follow
when they'll say in a moment,

935
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:44,960
we'll see what he said. But the
metaphor is that of really, uh, uh,

936
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,390
virtual is a prophetic voice who speaks,

937
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:52,770
but that the language he uses
like the law, the, the, uh,

938
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:57,450
a lamp that he carries on his back for
the benefit of those who follow and

939
01:04:57,451 --> 01:05:00,300
himself clearly remains the dark.
That's what he said.

940
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,880
The age turns new again.

941
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:08,210
Justice comes back and the primal years
of men and the new race descends from

942
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:13,530
heaven. This is the famous
fourth Eq Rog of Virgil.

943
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:19,570
Virgil is a celebrating the birth of a
child polio and around this birth of a

944
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:25,540
child. He's also talking about
the rejuvenation of the world.

945
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:27,160
Uh,
it's an emblem.

946
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:32,370
Polios birth is an emblem for this
Pythagorean vision that he has a vision

947
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:37,801
whereby the world goes
through a 360,000 years of,

948
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:41,890
uh, the Golden Age, the
silver age and so on,

949
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:46,190
and then degrades itself and goes right
back to where it started. Epitaph,

950
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:46,600
librarian,

951
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,600
vision of a metamorphosis and
the circulation of the universe.

952
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:57,140
It's the full deck log.
Um, um, interestingly,

953
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:02,560
this also crystallizes that which is the
fundamental issue of Virgil's vision.

954
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,520
The concern with birth,

955
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:10,690
the concern with the fact of being born,

956
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:15,890
that the fact of being born has
within itself the potential to renew,

957
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:21,610
uh, the world to affect the world and
change the direction of the world.

958
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:25,100
And then he, we know that he'll
say, and there was soap here, uh,

959
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,120
because we are coming to the
end of the period through the,

960
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:31,240
I was a poet through the Christian,

961
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,600
but thou that thou may see
better where the outline,

962
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:38,830
I should set my hand to color it
already. The world was, uh, everywhere.

963
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:43,660
Big pregnant Italian says with the true
faith sown by the messengers and so on.

964
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:48,810
He's going to talk how the world outside
only batteries that reinforced the

965
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:53,980
message of faith that he had
found in the fourth Techlog. Okay.

966
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:58,180
The four deck will be seen
as a messianic ecolog, uh,

967
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,650
but outline that makes it
transition from poetry to face.

968
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:06,640
I was a poet through Leah. I was
a poet through the, uh, Christian.

969
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:11,850
I think it really makes it necessary for
us for linger on it for a little bit.

970
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:17,410
First of all, the line has what
we call an Anaphora through the,

971
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:22,480
through the, I was a poet, I was
poured through the Christian.

972
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,280
This is the same line,
uh,

973
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:30,480
that says [inaudible] the Italian
word line 74 [inaudible] 73 per tape.

974
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:36,490
Wait a fully bestech Christiana,
the Anaphora.

975
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:41,750
It gives continuity to the movement
of the line from poetry to faith.

976
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:49,630
But nonetheless, if you read
this slide carefully in Italian,

977
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,820
you see that there is
also a sub genre for a,

978
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:54,430
you know what I mean by
[inaudible] fallen in the middle,

979
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,820
a break per tape with a food break,
birthday,

980
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,910
Christiana,
the line gives,

981
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:04,300
has a mobility that seems to a promise,

982
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:08,170
that transition from poetry to face,
but at the same time,

983
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:13,350
technically it forces you to stop as if
they were to discontinuous experiences.

984
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:19,220
You cannot go from one world of
poetry to the one world of faith.

985
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,700
You can go from one world of
politics, one world of faith. This,

986
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:27,770
that ambiguity of poetry is exactly
what they are trying to retrieve.

987
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:30,930
So,

988
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,550
but did I say here to the about this,

989
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:37,580
this issue of stage shows and virtual
stages is dealing with the tragedy of

990
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:43,200
birth.
Virgil deals with,

991
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:48,590
with optimistically about the history
making our quality of the event of birth.

992
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:56,690
That is at the same time a desire to
establish a sense of what is the sacred,

993
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,960
I will try to discuss with you,
um,

994
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,473
Lolita,

995
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:08,630
how poetry is now invested
with the kind of sacredness,

996
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:14,100
the ambiguous sense of the
world has both the profane and,

997
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:19,200
and, and the holy within it. Uh,
it's an, it's, it's, it's a hybrid.

998
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:19,801
And this,

999
01:09:19,801 --> 01:09:24,801
this is hybrid that would allow Dante to
assimilate a stations vision to his own

1000
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,090
understanding of history and the sacred.

1001
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:34,180
So let me stop here and see
if there are questions. Um,

1002
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,943
please.

1003
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:49,320
It seems like it's more common for Dante
to be the one to ask for their stories.

1004
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:54,870
I, is this the only place that Virgil was
the one who asked the question or like

1005
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:55,704
what is this?

1006
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,610
Well, the, the, the virtual is the, uh,

1007
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:02,710
the question is,

1008
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:07,870
it seems that usually it's Dante
who interviews the people he meets.

1009
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,950
And, but here in Canto
21 and 22, it's Virgil.

1010
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:16,450
And is that the case? And if it's
true, why would that be the case?

1011
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:20,530
The answer is that that's not really
true. Bills in the candle, Ulysses,

1012
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:25,890
it is he who is this Virgil who speaks
you remember to two years it's virtual.

1013
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,390
So it's virtual in Ulysses.

1014
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:33,210
It's has really more to do with the
figures of the classical world that seemed

1015
01:10:33,211 --> 01:10:38,140
to be in this case virtual system
best indicated for a status as he,

1016
01:10:38,141 --> 01:10:42,860
as he was for Virgil. Since you're
interested in this kind of, uh, of, um,

1017
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:47,800
uh, aspect of the dramatization of
the poem, I would mention to you,

1018
01:10:47,801 --> 01:10:49,990
for instance, their candles in fair. No,

1019
01:10:49,991 --> 01:10:54,991
we didn't have a chance to talk about
them where the Virgil would completely

1020
01:10:55,571 --> 01:11:00,320
abandon Dante's as well. You go here,
I don't want to be with you. Uh,

1021
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,780
you, you go and, and, and own your own,
carry out this introduction without,

1022
01:11:04,781 --> 01:11:07,180
I wait for you here.
And that happens for instance,

1023
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:11,980
in the Canto of fraud, the,
the, the, and, and usury.

1024
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:13,380
Um,
it,

1025
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:18,180
this is if Dante had something to
better understand on his own, uh,

1026
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:23,030
without Virtua's presence. But
usually that is the way in which, uh,

1027
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:27,320
the style of a, of the
presentation takes place. So who,

1028
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:31,320
who is most apt, uh, in the
case of the classical figures,

1029
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:34,340
the classical poet speaking
to a classical. Okay.

1030
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:42,803
Yeah.

1031
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,030
Comment a little further on
the significance of Contra 19.

1032
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:53,480
It looks like we're kind of reenactment of

1033
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,260
the fall of Adam and eve.
It's,

1034
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:02,740
it's almost a bit this woman even in the,

1035
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:04,493
in the dream,

1036
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:07,070
the siren. Yes. And the dream it when she,

1037
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:08,543
mmm.

1038
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,380
She brings forth the,

1039
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,160
this promise of happiness and it's
really accurate wing that the promise of

1040
01:12:14,161 --> 01:12:17,370
Lucifer of this narrow,
I will make you like God.

1041
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,980
Why is this sort of,
um,

1042
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:26,140
why is this theme of,

1043
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:30,310
of sort of the atom theme
coming up here in 19?

1044
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:32,680
Is there some sort of
strand that I'm missing?

1045
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:38,980
The Youtube, the question
is that, um, uh, Susan,

1046
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:41,080
Ken until 19,
in the dream of this hiring,

1047
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,740
there is an echo of,
uh,

1048
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:48,310
the fall of Adam more than Lucifer.

1049
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:53,170
I would say the fall of Adam and Andy,
why would there be,

1050
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:57,970
uh, that, uh, if that's true,
why would that be the echo?

1051
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:02,890
And my answer is I haven't, I didn't
catch it. I did. I never caught this,

1052
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:07,650
uh, uh, echo of Adam
there. Um, it's an it,

1053
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:11,110
it's actually the story of, uh, uh,

1054
01:13:11,111 --> 01:13:15,190
the temptation of this woman
fish. That's where she is, right?

1055
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,500
They've decided marine,
uh,

1056
01:13:17,501 --> 01:13:21,200
who wants to use
forgetfulness in the pill.

1057
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:24,640
The is really a classical figure.
Um,

1058
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:30,090
I would say that I sort of
resist the hearing here,

1059
01:13:31,091 --> 01:13:33,100
the figure of a,
in the figure of Adam,

1060
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:36,610
because Adam doesn't
really talk about falling.

1061
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:42,310
Say this is a danger for the
pilgrim who he's, he's a, he's a,

1062
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,820
he's a dramatizing his sense of,
uh,

1063
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:51,010
of yielding,
surrendering his will to the seduction,

1064
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:55,810
the seductive song of the siren.
Adam I'm with,

1065
01:13:55,870 --> 01:14:00,580
and this is stove love. Without them,
a stories becomes one of knowledge. Uh,

1066
01:14:00,581 --> 01:14:04,000
it's a little bit different.
Uh, they may be echoes. I'm not,

1067
01:14:04,001 --> 01:14:08,650
I'm not going to be so,
so firm and say, no,

1068
01:14:08,651 --> 01:14:11,530
there's no heck of that. Does that.
But I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, it,

1069
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:16,840
I didn't feel the necessity for
that action for my argument.

1070
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:20,560
Well, maybe I'm answering my own question
here, but wouldn't you say that the,

1071
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:25,620
the theme of knowledge and transgression
runs through both the dream sequence

1072
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:31,720
that Dante has
and the story of Adam's fall,

1073
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,830
I mean, is, is, is there, um,

1074
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:39,080
that theme where you list is,
you know,

1075
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:44,090
wanted to sort of gain this knowledge
is experience of hearing the siren song,

1076
01:14:44,831 --> 01:14:46,840
right. And, um,

1077
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:51,340
and to gain that knowledge
he had to sort of transgress.

1078
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:55,900
And isn't that what the siren
represents? I mean, you say,

1079
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,340
you said he keeps coming back
to this theme of you list.

1080
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:02,310
He does.
He doesn't mention the store down

1081
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:07,710
connection really comes in because Adam's
ultimately ate the fruit for knowledge.

1082
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:10,140
Well,
I indicated that the,

1083
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:14,040
the story of Adam in Kendall 26,
uh,

1084
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:19,060
it retrospectively illuminates what's
happening in Canto 26 of him fair.

1085
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:23,190
And that he tool, uh, experience,

1086
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,680
understands knowledge and, and, and,
and, and transgression that they,

1087
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:32,310
that they go hand in hand and that it's
difficult to impossible to separate them.

1088
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:33,990
And that's the story of Ulysses.

1089
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:39,120
Dante does feel that he is
and they said dangerous.

1090
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:44,090
A temptation for him to believe that
he's, he's, uh, he's like, you listen.

1091
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:49,530
Whereas he has no problem later in when
he understands what the story of Adam is

1092
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:54,180
in thinking in acknowledging that
Adam is the arch port, you know,

1093
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:58,990
we're all reinventing the
world, et Cetera. Uh, so,

1094
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,920
uh, I will say that there
are three figures here.

1095
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:04,500
You listen as Adam and Dante and,

1096
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:08,910
but the relation between them is never
what was one of full of identification on

1097
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:13,610
the part of Dante with either, uh, you
know, he comes, he approximates them, uh,

1098
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:18,450
and somehow also pulls away
from, from both. He's not really,

1099
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:23,451
Adam is not the arch poets who names
the world and there's not really you

1100
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,720
listeners that fear that
he may be like you races,

1101
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,960
which is a more dangerous, uh, uh,

1102
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,680
since sense that he has that
we'll continue more openly, uh,

1103
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,790
as he goes on the story
of Adam, uh, you know,

1104
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,110
it's going to be picked up in the
garden of Eden, the Garden of Eden.

1105
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:47,210
Of course there is the idea
that we lost the garden. Uh,

1106
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,940
but Dante is not one to be
in that garden anyway. Uh,

1107
01:16:50,941 --> 01:16:52,470
when he comes to the garden of Eden,

1108
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:56,280
he identifies it with a lot of things.
Uh,

1109
01:16:56,730 --> 01:17:01,200
the really nostalgia for the
mother. Um, and, and he doesn't,

1110
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:04,830
he understands that his to grow up,
he has to get out of that fantasy.

1111
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:09,150
I don't know if, uh,
uh, you know, this is,

1112
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,870
yeah. Um, what confuses
me, I guess that, um,

1113
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:16,820
you know, the, the siren here,

1114
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:20,780
the dream secret seems to be wanting
to halt Dante is west his journey for

1115
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,030
yes,
absolutely.

1116
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:26,460
And yet with respect to Ulysses,

1117
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:31,080
the siren seem to represent the opposite
in the sense that his interaction with

1118
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:33,550
her was, um, uh,

1119
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:40,580
was something where he was trying to go
past the balances to gain knowledge and

1120
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:44,420
gain experience of hearing her.
Uh,

1121
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:47,720
so I'm trying to draw the
connections in my mind for what,

1122
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:51,390
what is really Dante trying
to tell us with this sequence.

1123
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:55,980
Why does he go back to this,
um,

1124
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,870
this reference of the sirens, this
reference to the siren. I mean,

1125
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,040
maybe you could just summarize, I guess
maybe it would help clear it up. Um,

1126
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:10,400
what she represents to Dante here in
Canton 19 versus what she represents to

1127
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:13,090
Ulysses.

1128
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:16,730
Yeah. Good. What's a, what does
the siren represent? Very briefly,

1129
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,740
what does this hiring represent
to Dante and to Ulysses?

1130
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:24,160
What is the difference to Dante?
This Shireen represents the,

1131
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,700
the lure of death.
He understands a beneath that,

1132
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:33,790
that promises of yield to the here and
now and to my voice that is really,

1133
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:39,020
uh, there's said nothing in this and
he's attracted to that nothingness.

1134
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,540
That's really what it is for Ulysses.

1135
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,220
She also represents the extraordinary,
uh,

1136
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:50,060
enchantment of the song that would lead
them to death because that's, that's,

1137
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:53,880
that's what it happens to all those who
listened to this, Irene, you listen,

1138
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,630
wants to hear it and bind himself so that,

1139
01:18:56,631 --> 01:19:01,340
that does not yield all
together to her call. That's,

1140
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,380
that's how I can put it.
Thank you. We'll see you.
