1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,583
All right.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,740
So I'm professor David Lummis and a
professor Mazzotta asked me to come in and

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,560
substitute for him today since
he's traveling and can't be here.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,340
So I guess we'll get started and I
just wanted to write since there was a

5
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:20,200
midterm last time and remind
you more or less of what

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,110
he was talking about
whenever you left off. Um,

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,683
okay.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,350
The last lecture I suppose was about
the relationship between spacious and

9
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:35,764
Virgil,

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:41,130
the specifically poetic relationship and
the ambiguity that arises in the father

11
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:48,580
son relationship,
that stage between stations and virtual.

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,930
So Stacy has recognizes the Centralia
virtual for his own poetic career and his

13
00:00:56,411 --> 00:01:00,100
own moral development
by saying through you,

14
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:04,630
I was a poet and through you I was
a Christian, but at the same time,

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,650
um,

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:10,650
his poetry challenges that have a virtual
professional mounts up that concluded,

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,630
you know, stating that,
um, stages, stages.

18
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:18,550
His poem is about a tragedy about
the tragedy of birth. All right.

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,310
While Virgil's is about the,
um,

20
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,750
the history making quality
of the event of birth,

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,510
that this would be,
it challenged Virgil's account of,

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,540
of the foundation of the foundation.
And of history,

23
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:40,290
but he grew as a poet and converted to
Christianity by engaging with virtual

24
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:45,270
zone ideas of history,
specifically with the uh,

25
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,310
fourth log.
And there there's a misreading.

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,660
So the generative quality of,
of Virgil's poetry did it,

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,970
was it intrinsic in the poetry itself,

28
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:59,290
but was based on stations to this
particular reading of the text.

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,073
Um,

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,020
and today we're going to be talking
about condos 24 and 26 specifically,

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,080
but I'll be saying a few words also
about is 23 and 25 as a kind of frame to

32
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:16,370
those two con d.
Um,

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,000
and in these two condo is 24 and 26.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,710
Um, they can tease
Canthi, continue the, um,

35
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,590
the meditation on political
relationships that

36
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,790
were going on in 21 and 22 with stations.

37
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,250
Now the restaurant mounts out
there in his book, the Dante,

38
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:44,760
the poet of the desert,
has pointed out that Dante utilizes the,

39
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,540
figured out a method of reading history,
uh,

40
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,880
whereby the past prefigures
the president in the future

41
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,880
in a poetic fashion in
order to understand, um,

42
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,210
the genealogy of poetry of poets and in
order to place himself in a typological

43
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,480
genealogy of poets.
Um,

44
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,590
and then these Conti Dante
is engaged in a kind of,

45
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,550
in a sustained reflection,
not sought,

46
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:18,150
that says on literary history and the
powers of literature to engender moral

47
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,160
conversion and in probing the
inevitable limits of poetic fictions.

48
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:27,640
And there I quoted from his book,
um, Dante poet of the desert

49
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,660
now since 24,
which you read for today,

50
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,010
follows directly on [inaudible] 23
with a conversation between photos,

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,970
it Donati and the pilgrim.
I want to say a few words about 23.

52
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,740
Um, especially regarding the relationship
between, between poetry and gluttony.

53
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,083
Okay.

54
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,620
And although a number of Penitence are
mentioned at the beginning of this Condo,

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,580
Dante only speaks to two of them.
Four days.

56
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:57,490
It doe not the born on June to that Luca.
And both of them are poets.

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,540
And the first one is specifically
a friend of Dante. Okay.

58
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,910
Um, now for is it or not?
They do not for [inaudible].

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,830
Donati was and in Dante
is youth. Um, like I said,

60
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:15,820
a friend and they exchanged a series
of recuperative sonnets in which they

61
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,270
insulted each other back and
forth. And it was filled with, um,

62
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,500
with language of bodily sensation.
And um,

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,850
uh,
I suppose in this Condo,

64
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,910
the language of the conversation
between four days there and the pilgrim,

65
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,630
um,
sheds a new light.

66
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,890
The memory of it causes a bitterness
in both full days and in the pilgrim.

67
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,830
And the difference between
the rhetoric of the two texts,

68
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,350
uh, Mark's a new moral
vision in the pilgrim. Okay.

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,290
So blood before in these,
in these sonnets,

70
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,640
they berated each other's wives and um,

71
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,700
and their, their vices and this
condo, they recognize each other,

72
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:10,360
they treat each other like
brothers. So it's really a, um,

73
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,490
[inaudible] formation of a
poetic community that was
in some sense distorted by

74
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:19,210
these two songs. Maybe these analogies.
Six A son. It's three for each poet,

75
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,190
um, in, in the, in this Condo,

76
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:29,191
the glutinous are finished and disfigured
by hunger and their pin hints right?

77
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,740
And do not,
these wife wears it on.

78
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,760
His wife is recalled and she was treated
with obscenity in the sonnets and she's

79
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:43,060
remembered as it's steel
and vista kind of woman, um,

80
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,940
whose prayers ironically have helped
four days.

81
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:53,560
It arrive at the terrorist so
quickly. Right? So in a, in a way,

82
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,561
it really converts that kind of letting
this bodily poetry into a different kind

83
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,960
of moralized moralizing
poetry, I suppose. All right.

84
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,860
It corrects it.
Now I guess the connection,

85
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:11,360
another connection with gluttony is that,

86
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,170
what is it along with a number of other
Italian poets such as Jak one jeweled

87
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:16,580
Yeti,
um,

88
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,210
it was probably the most famous was a
burlesque poet and this is also known as

89
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,500
Goldie odic poetry.

90
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,390
So from Gulag Latin for
wrote or for gluttony.

91
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,613
Um,

92
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,980
and so this oblique connection allows
Dante to speak about poetry in this condo

93
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,170
of gluttony.
All right.

94
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,930
Is the real connection is
that it's a world, the whites,

95
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,270
they're worldly type of poetry that
doesn't look beyond itself beyond the

96
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,990
concerns of the flesh, I
suppose. All right. Um,

97
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,030
I would like to point out at
the end of this console, um,

98
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,220
Dante remembers their ribald
literary exchange with,

99
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,650
with bitterness at lines
one 15 at the very end.

100
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,760
Um, he connects the, the period
of his friendship with the Nazi,

101
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,300
with a dilemma back in the dark
forest and come to one. Okay.

102
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,700
Um,
let's see if we got the right place.

103
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,490
If that bring back to mind without ha
without west with me and I with the,

104
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,710
the president memory will
be grievous still. So yeah,

105
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,110
he's pointing out that he has a different
perspective on that time of his life.

106
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,060
Okay.
He,

107
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:37,061
that goes before me turned me from that
life some days ago when the sister of

108
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:41,840
him and I pointed to the son,
showed herself around to you.

109
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,161
It is,

110
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:47,870
he that has led me through the profound
night of the truly dead with this true

111
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:52,640
flesh that follows him.
His suckers have drawn me up,

112
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,940
events, climbing and circling the
mountain, which straightens you,

113
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,930
whom the world made crooked.
So

114
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,940
the motor,
I guess if it's of his,

115
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,070
of this change that Dante experiences
are both virtual and Beatrice.

116
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,580
So he's pointing towards
what's making him, what's,

117
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,900
what makes him different from
what he was a few days ago. So,

118
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,930
and they actually,
the exchange with four days,

119
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:25,931
there was probably not that long before
the composition of the divine comedy.

120
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,330
Okay. Or at least not that long
before the, um, the fictional date of,

121
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,540
of the divine comedy.
Um,

122
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,970
and this,
in reality,

123
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:42,430
I guess it was a prelude to how he
dramatizes the differences between the,

124
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,410
his poetry and that of
his fathers and brothers,

125
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,160
the ones that he meets in 24 and 26.
Okay.

126
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,230
That's just as a preface I suppose
to what happens in 24 were junk.

127
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:57,750
They really just juxtaposes
his own style of poetry.

128
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,270
Would that of his predecessors
specifically embodied by
born on June 3rd, I Luca.

129
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,070
And it's interesting that the
June who notices that Dante,

130
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,310
um, is different, right?

131
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,670
Because when I drink that Luca wrote
a poem to we know we need to leave,

132
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:22,601
we will meet in 26 criticizing how
he had brought the terminology of the

133
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:28,731
university and the terminology
of epistemology and
metaphysics and theology into

134
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,820
the lyric of love. Okay. So it's,

135
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,280
that's probably one of the reasons
why boardrooms that comes out here,

136
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,790
not necessarily that he was important
for some specific reason to Dante,

137
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:43,590
but probably because of that the fact
that he, he came out and notice this,

138
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,760
um, in public of weeding
suddenly, okay. This change.

139
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,473
Hmm.

140
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,520
So I'd like to have a look at in the text

141
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,300
when born on June comes
out and addresses Dante.

142
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,943
Okay.

143
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,320
He says in versus 49 through 51.
Um,

144
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,150
but tell me if I see,

145
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:17,151
hear him that brought forth the new
rhymes beginning with ladies that have

146
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:18,264
intelligence

147
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,223
love.

148
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,220
So it's born on June two who,

149
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,580
who recognizes Dante and specifically
by the first line in Kip it to the point

150
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:34,480
that that basically makes
the center of the VTN.

151
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,930
Moreover the turning point and they'd be
tenable. Eventual. Remember [inaudible].

152
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,723
MMM.

153
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,540
And cause in this,
in this poem,

154
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,280
it really marks the transition from
a self centered poetry of love,

155
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:54,180
where the poet praises himself
obliquely by service to the woman,

156
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,190
to the lady who he loves,

157
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,710
and his transition to a poetry of
praise that is mingled with metaphysical

158
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,750
claims for the ladies to value.
So it's,

159
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,550
it's Dante is transition from
a courtly lyric to a more

160
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,330
philosophical lyric.
Okay.

161
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:18,850
Now Dante responds to two going on
Juanita with a really beautiful,

162
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,720
beautiful phrase, and he
says, and I said to him,

163
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,430
I am one who when loves, love,
breathes in me, take note,

164
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:34,200
and in that manner, which he dictates
within, go on to set it forth.

165
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,420
Okay, so this Dante is
claiming his novelty, right?

166
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,583
Um,

167
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,670
and at the same time he's saying he's
linking his own writing of poetry to the

168
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:56,170
activity of a scribe. Write. He says,
I take note twin someone out when,

169
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,140
when love dictates. Right? So He's,

170
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,760
he's explaining his inspiration
right in the Italian,

171
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,080
um, the word for breathe
in his speeder. Okay.

172
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,010
And he takes, he dictates
within Dante. Okay.

173
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,453
Now

174
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,480
this inspiration, I think it
should, it needs to be understood.

175
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,320
It needs to be understood
in a theological man.

176
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,750
It needs to be understood theologically.
And as we'll go on,

177
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:31,180
I'm gonna go on to talk
about condo 25 and this,

178
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,620
which explains this
retrospectively, um, in a moment.

179
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,840
But let me just say for now that it,

180
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,180
that the words noto and like
take notes and Italian and,

181
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,020
um,
deep data to dictate an Italian,

182
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,880
um, point towards, uh,

183
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:57,340
the, um, the inspiration as this
breathing in as the Holy Spirit.

184
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,160
Okay.
As a movement of love within the Trinity.

185
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,360
And that Dante is explaining how,
um,

186
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,830
how poetic inspiration is really a
parallel to the unity of the trinity.

187
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:16,210
Okay. Um, this inspiration
comes from within.

188
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,300
Um, but it's like someone who
dictates from without. Okay.

189
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,220
Now in the monarch, and then
we're not ikea. And Dante is, um,

190
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,510
political treatise on empire.

191
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,230
He describes God as the only dicks dot.

192
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:38,050
Or the only person who dictates.
Okay. So we have to understand this,

193
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,570
um, description of poetic
inspiration as one coming from,

194
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,303
um,

195
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,380
and internal instantiation of the divine.
Okay.

196
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:54,190
So there's a connection between this
inspiration and the divine. Okay.

197
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,673
Um,

198
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,800
now one on junto follows up on this by
professing to understand the not right,

199
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,850
the not that kept him, um, and his
like the, we tone it down, right?

200
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:10,130
So Jack or Medallian teeny
who is the notary, um,

201
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,680
from arriving at that style at the
tourist that begins at line 55,

202
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,500
he says, oh brother, he said,
now I see the not that held me,

203
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:25,501
held back the notary and we tone it and
me short of the sweet new style that I

204
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,880
hear,
I see.

205
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,480
Well how you were pins followed
close behind the dictator,

206
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,750
which is surely did not happen with ours.

207
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,380
And he that sets himself to examine
further sees nothing else between the one

208
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:46,120
style and the other.
And as if satisfied he went,

209
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,983
he was silent.

210
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,680
So we're not doing the things he has
this perspective that purgatory gives him

211
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,250
on his past life and he
understands that not.

212
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:00,020
And then the no though is also describe
use to describe the sin of gluttony.

213
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,410
And at the beginning of Canto 23.
So here again,

214
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:06,500
we have this lack of moral understanding.

215
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:11,501
It's like a moral
perspective in life being,

216
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,060
um, paid for in the
afterlife in purgatory. Um,

217
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,210
okay. Um, but then

218
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,380
so the poetry that Bono winter represents,
um,

219
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,820
it was the one that concentrated
on worldly beauties and qualities.

220
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:29,654
Like I said before,

221
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,190
it feigned a service to the lady only to
concentrate on the self of the poet and

222
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:38,840
it never really went beyond,
um, wouldn't beyond itself.

223
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,470
It was a self reflexive kind of poetry.
Um,

224
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,820
and in that sense I guess it could
be assimilated with gluttony. Um,

225
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,080
and I absorbed an imitative,
what came with from without,
without offering fourth,

226
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:55,850
anything without being generous, such
as the poetry of Virgil was in it. Um,

227
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,320
it's interesting, interesting enough. Um,

228
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,060
but not Giunta says him
that brought forth the new,

229
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,920
the new rhymes. So he brought the new
rhymes. Fourth, he offered them out. Okay.

230
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:15,520
So one on June is able to
see the difference between
the two styles of poetry at

231
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:20,810
this point. But I think
he doesn't recognize, um,

232
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,820
the kind of uniqueness that Dante is,

233
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,590
is claiming for himself here because he,
he says,

234
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,810
um, that your pins follow
close behind the dictator.

235
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,640
Right? So he's pluralizing what
Dante says only about himself.

236
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:41,090
He says in Italian II me
sewing the wound care. Okay.

237
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,060
And people have pointed out that this,
um,

238
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,420
I am one who is both humble and
that it's like I'm one of other,

239
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:55,840
among others who do this,
but it's also a, um,

240
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,220
it's also pointing out it's
his uniqueness. Others have
pointed out that it, um,

241
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,340
it echoes line three 14 of Exodus Eggo.

242
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,780
Um, some queen soon. There's
what God says to Moses,

243
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,490
I am who I am.

244
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:18,491
Who Am okay at this self reflexive
[inaudible] me sewing the wound care is an

245
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:23,840
expression of uniqueness. Okay.
Couched in humble language. Okay.

246
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:27,480
So Dante is really pointing
out that he is, he is

247
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,770
doing something unique with his poetry,
um,

248
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,290
that perhaps Bono junto doesn't really
recognize the full extent. Okay.

249
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,010
So if there is a school of the
dogist steel normal, right?

250
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:43,610
If there's this sweet new style,
who composes the school right?

251
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:45,380
Like the Sicilian school
that proceeded it,

252
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,900
which I'm sure Professor Maths
Sophia talked about in relation to,

253
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,040
they'd be tenable Alpha.
Um,

254
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,030
then Dante is creating something new
within that school. Okay. That's,

255
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,260
I think what's going on here
in those lines. Um, okay.

256
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,830
All right. Um, so I suppose what,

257
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:08,831
what Dante is doing in this condo is
marking a extreme contrast between his own

258
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,550
poetry and that of the people
who came before him. Okay. Um,

259
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,370
there is a line that divides
these two schools. You know,

260
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:22,371
the [inaudible] who was a Tuscan
poet who imitated Sicilian poetry.

261
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,950
This is [inaudible] who
imitated a problem, sell poetry.

262
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,610
He's detaching himself from them because
of their lack of immoral purpose,

263
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:38,220
I suppose, in their poetry. Which one I
drink that recognizes retrospectively.

264
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,020
All right. Now I wanna just
wanted to point out as the, um,

265
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,750
this sort of, as this comes, as
this conversation comes to an end,

266
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,560
Dante describes that,
um,

267
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,810
the [inaudible] 64 through 69,

268
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,120
how the penitents depart,

269
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,510
he says as birds that
winter along the Nile,

270
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,790
sometimes Nica troop in the air,

271
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,540
then fly with more speed and go and file.

272
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,250
So all the people that were there
facing round quicken their steps,

273
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,380
being light with both leanness and desire.
Okay.

274
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,630
And as one tired with the running,

275
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:25,610
let's his companions go on and then
walks till the heaving of his justice.

276
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,473
So relieved,

277
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,700
so foot as it let the holy flock
pass and come on with me behind.

278
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,030
Okay. So I just wanted to
point out the contrast here.

279
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:41,031
The image of birds probably reminds
us of the image of birds in Condo.

280
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:43,620
Five of the inferno,
right? With, they're just,

281
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,640
the sinners were described as cranes who
were being buffeted about by a tempest,

282
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,130
right? And they kept returning
to the same spot in a circle,

283
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,480
like an internal return. Okay. Um, here,

284
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,440
the same kinds of birds,
right? This leads love.

285
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,450
Poets are coming together in a
troop and moving along together.

286
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:09,480
And not only are they moving
along together, they're
moving forward. All right?

287
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:10,620
So there's a progress.

288
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,540
That's a count that opposes
the circularity of the,

289
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,620
of the storm of birds in,
in federal five.

290
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:24,520
And this will come up
again also in Canto 26. Um,

291
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,030
now I know we didn't, didn't read it for
today, um, council of 25 of purgatory,

292
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,250
but I think it shed some light.

293
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:35,010
I'm going to say a few words about it
because I think it sheds some light on

294
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,470
what Dante was talking about in
relation to inspiration. Okay.

295
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:45,030
We talked about that
earlier. Um, now what,

296
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,210
what happens here is Dante ass Dunkin's
perplexed about how the centers can be

297
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:55,650
punished with their bodies if they don't
have bodies. So he asks this of status,

298
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,830
right? So th the whole Condo,
basically he has this of, of a virtual,

299
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:04,510
I guess in Virgil says it's better
stages, explains it to you. Okay. And,

300
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,210
um, so the pretext of it
all is how can this happen?

301
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,830
What is the physics of what does the
biology of the soul basically in the

302
00:21:14,831 --> 00:21:15,664
afterlife,

303
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,340
but what stations does in
explaining this explains

304
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,850
how God and genders the saw, how
he, how he creates. So, okay.

305
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,663
Um,

306
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,600
now is it placing this discourse
of the generation of the,

307
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,720
of the soul and the body between two
condos that are basically all about poetic

308
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:44,660
inspiration? Dante think is
drawing a parallel between, um,

309
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,900
divine inspiration and divine creation
and poetic generation and poetic creation.

310
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,800
Okay. Um, okay.

311
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,080
He's been using it as a parent.
He's making a parallel between, um,

312
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,200
poetic generation
inspiration from, um, input,

313
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,470
inspiration and the divine
creation of the, of the soul,

314
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,290
the inspiration of the divine
in the creation of this.

315
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,470
So I'm going to go on and explain what
I mean. I'm just wanting to get that.

316
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:17,080
Does that make sense? Okay. All right. Um,

317
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,770
I'll slow down a second.
Um,

318
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,573
all right.

319
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,010
So basically he's staging here,
um,

320
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,150
the relationship between the
predecessors and new poets,

321
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,460
so himself and his past basically.

322
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,500
So he's explaining how he is born out
of the past but is not imitative and is

323
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:43,830
not, can't be a merely
reducible to that past. Okay.

324
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,200
Um, I can read a little
bit of this. It's, um,

325
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,330
it's a bit scholastic I suppose,
but that's okay. Um, now

326
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,410
I can read it all if you want.
It may explain it better for you.

327
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,700
He says at lines 40
Anthony at 38 I believe,

328
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,570
37 38 perfect blood,

329
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,880
which has never drunk by the thirsty veins
and his left like food that remove is

330
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:14,720
from the table,

331
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,060
takes in the takes in the
heart in informing power
for all the bottling members

332
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,111
like that,

333
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:26,111
which takes its course through the
veins to become these further digested.

334
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:28,320
It does since where silence is,

335
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:33,321
is fitter than speech and then drops
afterwards on another's blood in the

336
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:34,964
natural vessel.

337
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,370
They're the one mingles with the other
and the one fitted to be the passive and

338
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:44,280
the other on the account of the
perfect place from which it springs.

339
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,630
That is the [inaudible] active and this,

340
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,090
so United begins to operate first.

341
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:54,410
Coagulating then quickening that tube,
which forest material it has been,

342
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,210
it has given consistency here. I think
it gets a little bit more interesting.

343
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:03,710
He says, the active force having
become a soul, like a plants,

344
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,140
but so far different than it is on the
way and the other already on the shore

345
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,040
then operates to the point that it
moves in, feels like a sea fungus.

346
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,360
And from that goes onto produce Oregon's
for the faculties of which it is the

347
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:19,430
seed.
Now my son

348
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,540
develops and spreads the force that is
from the heart of the beginner within her

349
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,620
nature makes provision
for all the members.

350
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,720
But how from animal it becomes
a child that they'll see us.

351
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,500
Not yet. I'm going to skip a little
bit more to the top of the next page.

352
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,780
Open I breast to the truth that
follows and know that as soon as the

353
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:44,810
articulation of the brain
is perfected in the embryo,

354
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,840
the first mover turns to it rejoicing
over such handiwork of nature and breathes

355
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:51,880
it into it.
A new spirit.

356
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,440
He breathes into it just like the
inspiration that Dante claim for his own

357
00:24:56,441 --> 00:25:00,730
poetry before. Um, it's
spirit full of power,

358
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:02,590
which draws into its own substance,

359
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:06,910
that which it finds active there and
it becomes a single soul that lives and

360
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:11,620
feels and is itself revolves upon itself.
So what I think is,

361
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,560
is going on here is that

362
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,723
[inaudible]

363
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:17,843
ostensibly,
basically,

364
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,633
mmm

365
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,040
Stacy has describes the creation of the
body or the biological creation of a

366
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,410
body which comes from the
mingling of bloods, right?

367
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,330
MMM [inaudible]

368
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,620
and then after that,

369
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:38,621
how the animal that is created
basically is given a soul,

370
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:42,590
by God becomes a rational. It becomes
a human being. And the human being,

371
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:46,490
the human here is described, he
said, just translates it as a child.

372
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,730
But the word that's actually used as a
fun thing now fanta would be basically

373
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,120
just derived from the Greek
word for speech. So fun.

374
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,020
There would be a PR one who speaks.
So how an animal becomes one who speaks.

375
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,430
So humanity is,

376
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:05,960
is defined in a sense by the fact that
we can speak and reason basically.

377
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,990
Okay. Okay. Um,

378
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,970
and what happens here I suppose is
that even though the father is the j,

379
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,840
it generates the, um, the body,

380
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,260
the soul is directly
created by God. Okay. That,

381
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,490
so that there's two kinds of
individualities I suppose.

382
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:32,550
You have the body and the
soul and the soul is a,

383
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:35,430
is a uniqueness that is directly created,
inspired by God.

384
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,620
So if we consider this poetically,

385
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,090
even though Dante may have
been influenced, right,

386
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,320
in a sense created by the poets that
came before him and the less he has some

387
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,510
kind of direct inspiration that separates
him from the poets that came before

388
00:26:56,341 --> 00:27:00,930
him, at least that's how I understand it.
Okay. And they, I think it's connected.

389
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,660
I'd done it points out the connections,

390
00:27:02,661 --> 00:27:05,130
especially by the word speed
or he uses the word speed,

391
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:09,240
our inspiration twice right there,
they admit they imitate each other,

392
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:13,870
they parallel each other. Okay. And
the connection between fun thing, this,

393
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,390
the child who speaks is a direct
connection to language. Okay.

394
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,800
The language of poetry. All
right. All right. So that's,

395
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,903
I think

396
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,850
it explains rec retrospectively,

397
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,900
what Dante is claiming in Condo 24.
Okay.

398
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,900
About his poetic inspiration.

399
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,380
There's difference between

400
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,520
his own poetry and that of
that of his predecessors.

401
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,460
Now Canto 26 and can pass on to come 26

402
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:59,450
he passes in to the terrorists
of the last full. All right.

403
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,440
And here he meets his own self.

404
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,720
He's on the stage to poetic father.
Um, we don't, we need suddenly,

405
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,100
and he has his father wrecking.
He recognizes his father and his,

406
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,110
he is a debt to his father and at the
same time he was recognized as a brother

407
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,590
by his father. Okay. So his,

408
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,530
his individuality as
opposed as recognized.

409
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,380
The recognition is staged
here. Okay. The mineral ratio,

410
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,480
they paternal relationship
becomes a fraternal one.

411
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,623
MMM.

412
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,770
So I guess what I'm trying to point out
with this, the biological embryology,

413
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,410
um, is that he can be seen as derivative
and different at the same time.

414
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:52,380
So he's the same and it's
distinguishable at the same time. Okay.

415
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,810
Now this condo is in sharp contrast to 24,

416
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,840
I think because Dante wanted to distance
himself from those pellets in 24 and

417
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:05,610
here he wants to show,
um,

418
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,671
and similarity.

419
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:13,350
He's trying to sit and assimilate himself
in a certain kind of poetry. That was,

420
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,850
uh, four, four,

421
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:19,380
which metaphysics epistemology and
theology where all central, okay.

422
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:21,720
So it's a philosophical kind
of love poetry. All right.

423
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,373
MMM.

424
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,360
And I think he also redeems
this love tradition,

425
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,270
which is in a certain sense was
condemned and in fed no five. Okay.

426
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,980
With Francesca.
So this courtly love that was,

427
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,690
that caused in a way,

428
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:48,280
I suppose at least that and
Francesca claimed cause her downfall,

429
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,830
um, in saying that the gala halt was, um,

430
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,050
was the book. Right. And in fact,
no five here, he redeems it and he,

431
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,770
he purges it ink. Is it okay. Um,

432
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,750
we can start off by reading

433
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:12,220
the Theresa that begins at line
94. Whenever he, whenever we'd up,

434
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:15,700
we need,
sadly identifies himself to the pilgrim,

435
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,960
says such as in the grief of lice circus,

436
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:23,860
the two sons became unseeing
their mother again, I became,

437
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,940
but with more restraint when
I heard speak his own name,

438
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:30,730
the father of me and the others,
my betters,

439
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,200
whoever have used the suite and graceful
rhymes of love and without hearing or

440
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:38,194
speech,

441
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:43,290
I went on a long way in thought gazing
at him and did not where the fire go near

442
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,030
him. Okay. So Dante [inaudible], he,

443
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,450
he loses his faculty of
speech here because he's,

444
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,270
he's an almost like a child
before his father. Okay.

445
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:59,920
So his behaviors or imitates
his relationship to,

446
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,440
um, to we need suddenly. Okay.

447
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:04,783
MMM.

448
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,360
All right. And I'll point out
here as well that the, one of the,

449
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,250
one of the main differences
I suppose is between the,

450
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:22,270
the two poets is symbolized by the
casting of a shadow on the fire,

451
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,600
right.
So his act,

452
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,350
that reality of his presence there
and his body is what's really,

453
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:32,380
it was with the physical aspect
that separates him from the others.

454
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,990
And it's stands in for the,
um,

455
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,760
the aspect of his poetry that separates
him from the rest of it that rest of

456
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:43,594
these poets as well.

457
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,800
Um, let's see, and

458
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,580
since we're talking about poetic
genealogies, it's interesting that

459
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:01,910
Dante is, um, he refers
to him as a father,

460
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,920
but then we need sadly responds
by saying, Oh, brother,

461
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,370
he there whom I point out to the,

462
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,320
was a better craftsman of
the mother tongue versus of
love and tales of romance.

463
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:20,200
He surpassed them all. Okay. So in these,

464
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,060
in these, what, 15, 20 lines?

465
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,900
Dante as a child before his father and
his den acquainted with his father by

466
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:30,110
being a brother.

467
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:34,220
So they're put on the same level and
they're assigned another father. Okay?

468
00:32:34,221 --> 00:32:37,460
So the grandfather of the mall
becomes the father and his father,

469
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:41,370
I guess who's not named
is note Daniela. Okay. Um,

470
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,550
an important poet for Dante and remit,
remit, throw us in the stony rhymes,

471
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,360
which professor Metsul dimensioned.
Um, Dante imitated him,

472
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,690
irritated him in those, in
those runs, he was a poet,

473
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:58,250
famous for his difficulty in reading
and, and underneath, it's very,

474
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:02,330
very hard to understand. An example
of the thrombotic loose. Okay.

475
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,710
Um,
so

476
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,770
and in the same paragraph in
this and these same series of,

477
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:14,900
of tercets paragraph in the English,
again,

478
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:19,500
we had the differentiation of
um,

479
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,790
the kind of school I
suppose that Dante is, um,

480
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,450
associating himself with and
the other school which would,

481
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:27,710
she wants to differentiate,

482
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,720
differentiate himself because he says
like out of note is different from

483
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,160
the one from Limo Jay.

484
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,560
So he is different from we
Tony, we turn it on, right?

485
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:45,980
So who was named alongside when on
June and Jack and Woody Allen Teenie.

486
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,760
So he's separating himself from um,

487
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,770
and sort of aligning himself with a
different kind of poetry. All right. Um,

488
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,010
so let me gather my thoughts. He, um,

489
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,403
I,

490
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,820
so I suppose he reinforces the kind of
genealogy that he wants to create for

491
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:08,654
himself.
All right.

492
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,060
Now this genealogy to I guess has its own
consequences in the modern age because

493
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:20,360
the word, the words in Italian for
the better craftsman in New York.

494
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:25,370
Fabro where the words with which ts Elliot
dedicated the wasteland as her pound,

495
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:26,840
as you probably know.
All right.

496
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:32,350
So this conversation here
really becomes an emblem for

497
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,930
happy political relationships, I suppose,
which you can recognize your betters,

498
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,280
recognize your forefathers,

499
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:48,320
and at the same time come out with
something that you recognize as new. Okay.

500
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,500
All right.
Um,

501
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:57,190
and some scholars have pointed
out that we didn't really,

502
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:02,210
I don't think if we had concentrated
on in federal 24 and 25 where Dante

503
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,510
utilizes a number of metaphors
from avid in Lucan and he has this,

504
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:16,280
there's just, Topo is called the Tucky
at noon quick be silent now, Luke,

505
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,810
and be silent now. All of it, he says,

506
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,400
and he basically steals from their lines
without recognizing I'm okay saying

507
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,850
that he is surpassing them, but at
the same time as he surpassing them,

508
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,500
he's using their own poetry
to surpass them. Okay.

509
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,280
People have pointed out in these con d
of the feeds that Dante is participating

510
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:37,260
in the sin by stealing from orbit and
Lucan and that this kind of poetic

511
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,900
relationship, it was
a negative one, right?

512
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:42,000
That he's stealing the
identity of the other.

513
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,720
Well here we have a different kind of
understanding of I'd poetic identity,

514
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,480
right? We have one that, that
recognizes the paternity of the,

515
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,383
of the father,

516
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,740
while at the same time allows
the sun to come into his own.

517
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,640
And this is coming into his own,
um,

518
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,390
is I think pointed out by,
um,

519
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,350
by Dante,
the poet.

520
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,940
Whenever you says then at line
between Lens, uh, one 30, one 40,

521
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,160
then perhaps to give place
to others who were near him.

522
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:21,320
He disappeared through the
fire as though the water, as,

523
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,920
as through the water, a fish goes
to the bottom. Okay. So here the,

524
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:30,120
the father moves out of his way
so that Dante can go on. Okay. Um,

525
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,433
and

526
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:38,120
I guess he can progress okay. That
he doesn't get in his way. Right.

527
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,630
Um,
so

528
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:53,320
if Dante recognizes these people,
these poets as his predecessors,

529
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,930
um,
how does he differentiate himself?

530
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:00,760
Like how in this content and does he
differentiate himself from them? Um,

531
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,800
I think we can look at it
through the Lens of contract 25.

532
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,100
Um, we're the paternal virtue. Um,

533
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,870
the cell or the generation
of the slow granted,

534
00:37:13,871 --> 00:37:15,520
the paternal virtue,

535
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:20,521
it's place while simultaneously claiming
claimed a direct creation of the soul

536
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:25,180
by, um, the spy ration of the Holy Spirit.

537
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,520
I think Dante isn't poetic individuality,
um, rose out of the artifice,

538
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,610
the style that they concentrate on here,
this sweet deck deed mortar,

539
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,540
this sweet sayings of love that he
attributes to it we need to sell.

540
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,030
So it grows out of the stylistic artifice
that these two poets represent our

541
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:44,910
note and um,

542
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,400
and Guido to form something new,

543
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:53,200
a new kind of speech and new kind of
poetic speech that's imbibed with the

544
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:56,950
divine,
that's guided by theological

545
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,750
Gordon moral meaning.
Um,

546
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,070
and I think we can see this

547
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,350
and how the,
um,

548
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,380
how these pair of poets are our cleanse
and how they're represented in this come

549
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:14,820
to him. All right. For
example, we need, sadly,

550
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,060
when he first calls out to Dante,
before we know who he is,

551
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,910
before he's even identified himself,
I think it's around line 17

552
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,240
following,
um,

553
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,280
he's, he's uh, he says, oh, thou
that ghost behind the others,

554
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,760
not from tardiness,
but perhaps from reverence.

555
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,890
Answer me who burned with
thirst and with fire. Okay.

556
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:44,270
Now the line in an Italian
is and focal the door.

557
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:49,240
All right? Now this is a direct quotation
of we need Sally's on poetry. Okay.

558
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,700
I'm in a sign it which he says in
grand piano and Foco out of town. Okay.

559
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:58,270
So I'm in great pain
and fire. I burn. Okay.

560
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,580
So in Foco outta those
basically repeated verbatim.

561
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,190
So the love poet who's burning for his,
for his lady metaphorically,

562
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,430
and his sonnet is now burning literally,

563
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,940
and the penitentiary in the
like the penitent fire, um,

564
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,740
that's purging is sin. Okay. Um,

565
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,740
so I think this punishment shows how
the perspective of purgatory is really

566
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:24,610
modifying,

567
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,720
giving us her moral sense to the love
poetry that gradient sadly belong in this

568
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,580
school of led poetry. Think
when you say belong to, okay.

569
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,313
MMM.

570
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:42,750
Another thing that differentiates them,
like I said before,

571
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,630
with Dante shadow showing that he's
actually there and that they're

572
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:53,100
in his body in flash
points to something else.

573
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:53,963
And that is that

574
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,090
his lady is actually the beginning of it.

575
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,030
It started a chain of grace, right?
So that there is a connection to his,

576
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:08,330
not just a metaphysical connection or
epistemological connection and value to

577
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:12,510
his lady, but a theological value
as well. Okay. Since he's like,

578
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:16,650
he says at line 58, I go up hints,
no, uh, no, not to be longer.

579
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:20,130
Blind lady is above
who gains grace for me,

580
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,070
by which I bring my mortal
part through your world.

581
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:28,440
So what these poets couldn't recognize
in their own lifetime, Dante is able to,

582
00:40:28,441 --> 00:40:30,840
because of his poetry,
this

583
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,840
bringing together that he does,

584
00:40:33,841 --> 00:40:38,430
which is actually hit the newness in
the new sweet, new style, I think, um,

585
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,240
which isn't just a metaphysical,
but it's the illogical. Okay.

586
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,003
MMM.

587
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,690
Did it put it in another way
if for greening? Sadly are, no.

588
00:40:54,691 --> 00:40:58,590
Danielle, we don't have on candy who's
not mentioned here. All right. Um, again,

589
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,130
um,
if for these poets,

590
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:08,040
the lady was a philosophical or
intellectual phantasm, I suppose,

591
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,050
um,
we're Dante,

592
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,080
she's a real woman who enacted
a real change in his life.

593
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,030
Okay.
Who did that?

594
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,500
And that caused a chain of grace to
descend into his own personal story.

595
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,470
And his poetry, I think seems seeks to
close the gap between the metaphysical,

596
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,400
theological reality of God
and the historical contingent
of history and Dante,

597
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:37,220
his own personal story and that history.
Okay.

598
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,410
So love poetry for Dante takes on
an entirely new meaning here. Okay.

599
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:49,040
And I think we need to at least shows
that he understands this difference with a

600
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:52,580
perspective that purgatory gives him
towards the end of the contract when he

601
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:57,290
asks Dante to say a paternoster for him
to Christ whenever he enters heaven.

602
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,420
Okay. So it's really a coup, a
conversion, I think of, of love,

603
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:06,500
poetry, a purgation of the
worldliness of love poetry. Okay.

604
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,163
Um,

605
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,600
and finally I want to say we're going
to end a little bit early because I

606
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:18,230
actually have to run to another
building to teach right after this, um,

607
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:23,010
my own class. But I want to conclude
by saying a few words about our note.

608
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,480
All right. It's, it's
very peculiar that Don,

609
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,300
this is the only place I believe
in the divine comedy where, um,

610
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:35,600
and other modern romance
languages quote is that quoted.

611
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,950
Um, it's not Italian.
Basically. I could be mistaken,

612
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:43,130
but I'm pretty sure
it's the only place I'm

613
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,010
now out was, was famous, like
I said, for is obscurity.

614
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,250
The extreme difficulty of his ex,

615
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,790
his poetic expression and hear what
has done they do to him even though he,

616
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,330
he quotes him and the original right,
and he didn't really write these lines.

617
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,680
These lines are done things,

618
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,100
but what he does is he
makes this difficult hidden
poet come out in the open,

619
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,390
right to quote him.
Um,

620
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,330
he says so much, I don't
know. Note Seth so much.

621
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:21,140
Does your courteous question
please me that I neither can,

622
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,590
nor would conceal myself from you.
I am,

623
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:27,950
are not who weep and seeing as I go,

624
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,580
I see with grief past,

625
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,110
past follies and see rejoicing
the day I hope for before me.

626
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,020
Now I beg of you,
buy that goodness,

627
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,700
which guides you to the summit of the
stairway to take thought and do time for

628
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:48,560
my pain. And then he hit himself
in the fire. That refines it. Okay.

629
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,430
So there's a little bit of a,
Dante's playing here with,

630
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,050
with our notes on language,
if he was a difficult poet and

631
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,480
poet of love,
um,

632
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,540
besides Dante makes them really come
out into the open and say, what are you,

633
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,950
what are you saying? So, um,

634
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:12,130
and here also typical words
from the problem Saul, um,

635
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,790
traditions such as the value
and now the follower, Schwab,

636
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,820
um,
Cortez and shutdown,

637
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,070
they all take on different kinds
of meanings that before the,

638
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,210
the valor of value of the,
um,

639
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,420
of the love poet was not what it is here,
right?

640
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:37,710
It takes on a completely different
meaning in purgatory. Okay.

641
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,370
So he really stages in our notes on words,

642
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,520
the purification,
cleansing,

643
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:47,270
and bringing out into openness of

644
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,670
what loved poetry should really be,
where it should really lead you.

645
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,760
Okay.
Um,

646
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,640
and I guess to conclude,

647
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,683
mmm.

648
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:12,550
I want him to say that in the next condo
you'll see Dante submitting himself to

649
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:17,420
the same kind of purgation as these poets.

650
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,120
If these poets are cleansed by this
wallet, by this fire that refines them,

651
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:29,590
he ended up passing through a wall of
flame in order to get to where you can

652
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:35,790
enter into the, um, the, uh,
the terrestrial paradise. Um,

653
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:42,080
so that he's in reality cleansing
himself of the same kind of

654
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,740
issue I suppose.
All right.

655
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:47,823
MMM.

656
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,870
And I guess now I can
take a few questions if,

657
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,020
um, you have any, hopefully

658
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,700
it wasn't too disjointed the lecture,

659
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,420
but I'm happy to answer any
questions you might have or try to,

660
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,083
yeah.

661
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,290
And
to

662
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,280
bring critical eyes at
the patients that line.

663
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,890
I'm wondering sort of looking at later
to cancer and then you have the proper

664
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,320
relationship, I mean, station sort of

665
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,240
slowing,
turning started

666
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:55,323
going again.

667
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:03,410
I think you can reconcile them. I
mean, whenever Dante, whenever he,

668
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,750
he meets me and sadly he's silent, right?
He doesn't automatically make himself,

669
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,450
he doesn't move his father
out of the way stages.

670
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
And Dante both know if I'd done that,

671
00:47:14,481 --> 00:47:16,160
Virgil is not going to be
able to go the whole way.

672
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:20,750
They know that he's only going to be able
to lead them a certain amount of the,

673
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,250
of the, of the trip, of the
journey of the journey. Right. So,

674
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,993
mmm.

675
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,070
So I guess I would interpret
it as an act of reverence,

676
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,600
just like Dante is silence
whenever he meets. Um,

677
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,170
whenever you give me squeezing sadly is
an act of reverence that he doesn't push

678
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:45,640
them out of the way he does it,
trample them. He's not in a hurry,

679
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:50,030
I suppose. So does that make, does
that make any sense? But I think it,

680
00:47:50,031 --> 00:47:50,770
I think it's,

681
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:55,770
well you can interpret station says if
you want to see him interpret that as him

682
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,020
slowing his way on the way to God,
basically,

683
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,320
then you could interpret it as an act of
reverence to the person who allowed him

684
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,800
to actually be there and not
in limbo. Right. So that,

685
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:14,150
that's how I would, how I would
interpret it. I suppose, um,

686
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,400
that Dante in this and
26 is referenced to his,

687
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,050
to his father's at the same
time as he's showing him,

688
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:30,080
that he's showing how he's moving beyond
them by giving a theological meaning to

689
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:34,360
two. They're questionable.
Worldly love poetry.

690
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,850
So to answer your question,

691
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:43,110
hmm. When Dante talks about the
inspiration which you've identified as the

692
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,490
inspiration of the Holy Spirit,

693
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,530
is he making love synonymous
with the Holy Spirit?

694
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,550
And if so, um, don't,

695
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:58,020
looking back at the beach in new and when
he personifies love in the masculine,

696
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,550
um, I've always sort of
thought of in literature,

697
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:08,190
you read religious poetry and stuff, the
Holy Spirit's often sort of a feminized.

698
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,750
Now are those things,
um,

699
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:14,940
one in the same to him
love and the Holy Spirit,

700
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:17,960
I think there that

701
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,560
he's thinking of. Let's see. I think,

702
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:29,020
I think in that, at that point
he's thinking of love. Um,

703
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:33,080
I think Thomas and Saint Thomas
Aquinas mentions love as the purse,

704
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,950
like a procession of love as the movement
of the Holy Spirit within the trinity

705
00:49:37,951 --> 00:49:42,420
between the father and the son.
So that both really

706
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,420
are within,
I participate in the same spirit.

707
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:49,470
So yes,

708
00:49:49,471 --> 00:49:54,471
I think in that spot he is really talking
about love as the Holy Spirit as this

709
00:49:55,621 --> 00:50:00,210
kind of inspiration or at least as,
as parallel to it.

710
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,740
It's ambiguous,
right?

711
00:50:01,741 --> 00:50:06,600
He says he doesn't really say that
love is the Holy Spirit. Does he? He,

712
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,493
he's

713
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,320
purposefully ambiguous I think
because love poetry always has that,

714
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,900
the possibility of leading you astray
because it's an aesthetic practice, right?

715
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:23,400
It's, it's dolce, right. Sweet.
So I think that, that, that, uh,

716
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,683
um,

717
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:30,860
that yes is talking about love as the Holy
Spirit, you know, as this divine love.

718
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:35,660
But he's also talking about,
so I guess in reality that,

719
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,050
that there is a connection between,
you know,

720
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:43,430
the contingent historical world and
the metaphysical world of God. Um,

721
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,870
but then he leaves it ambiguous because
it can always be misinterpreted it and

722
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:52,580
the aesthetic can always lead you back
down to the terrestrial realm. Okay.

723
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,380
So does that, does that make sense? Okay.

724
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,730
Oh
Griffin.

725
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,810
Why do you think, or what do you think
is the significance of the fact that, uh,

726
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,630
the biological discussion
of guide reading this goal,

727
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,170
the fact that that's handled
by stages and that not,

728
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:21,530
they really highlight that by saying yes,

729
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,650
they just say if it's very good as well,
that he explained

730
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,760
that that one was
[inaudible]

731
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:38,360
not permitted to know God. It's a good
editor if they'll speak about the vinyl.

732
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,270
So I don't want to get
out of that, but, uh,

733
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,190
I just couldn't understand
why. Yeah. Species.

734
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:49,740
Okay. Well, I guess if, if,

735
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,740
if the question really had been about
what is the nature of the soul, right?

736
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,660
Like what, like what, what is Aristotle
saying? And the Dyneema about the,

737
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,760
maybe a virtual could
have told them about that.

738
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:04,210
But the actual question
is what does the nature,

739
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:09,070
how does the soul live in the afterlife?
And that is entirely Christian question.

740
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,840
That's based on a Christian theology.
So I think the fact that, um,

741
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,500
that Virgil defers to Stacey,

742
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:20,340
thus there is showing that is
connected with the fact that,

743
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,120
that the question is the actually about,
you know,

744
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,350
the afterlife and the afterlife is
specifically a Christian context.

745
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:31,000
That station is permitted to know and
not virtual. Right. Does that make sense?

746
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,280
Yeah.
Okay.

747
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,220
Yeah.
Capacity

748
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,930
technically. But I think the fact that
he asked her, they asked virtual first.

749
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,600
I don't know, maybe he's, he's saying
that that's, it's actually in Aristotle,

750
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,650
you know, this idea of the
immortality of the soul when,

751
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:52,310
after that it's actually there and,
um, perhaps virtual could answer it,

752
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,340
but then Virgil differs to stations
because it's because it's a theological

753
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:01,190
question that he's not privy to.
Is that okay?

754
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,800
All right. Well, we're going
to end a little bit early.
I hope that's okay. Second,

755
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,420
go change gears here. Alright. Um,

756
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,810
thank you for your attention and
for putting up with me. All right.

757
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:16,890
Yeah.
