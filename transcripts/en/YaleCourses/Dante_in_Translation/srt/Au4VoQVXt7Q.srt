1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:05,820
With Ken told 12,
from 10 to 12,

2
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:07,020
who can to 16.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,950
We are still in what is
known the middle ground,

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,260
which is a moral ground.
The middle ground of, uh,

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,250
uh, in hell. Uh,

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,290
we are between the area of
incontinence that we saw,

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,810
uh,

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:31,380
in the last few weeks and the area
of malice when this middle ground,

9
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:36,120
which is the ground of violence
or beastiality as it, uh,

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,610
as it is also called a,

11
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:43,611
what I want to draw your attention to
first of all is the fact that Dante is a

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,710
presiding symbols.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,910
The presiding figures in this area,
uh,

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,920
all figures hybrid figures,
figures of Doubleness,

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,050
uh, the minor tor and the
centaurs and Canto 12.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,040
You have the Harpies, uh, you know,

17
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,800
this filthy file figures,

18
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:12,330
monsters with the face
of, uh, of, of, uh, women,

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,900
uh, devouring, uh, all
the foliage in the trees,

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,810
the trees, cantor 13, uh,
and then, uh, uh, Chris,

21
00:01:21,811 --> 00:01:26,130
we'll go on with, uh, uh,
other emblems of again,

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,870
monsters and the figure of, uh, uh,

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,570
but that's the figure of fraud.
I don't want to get into that.

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,700
Figures of also again, monitors
and centers in, uh, 15.

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,280
What is the, what is the importance
of this figures in, they are,

26
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,540
they are neoplatonic images,

27
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,120
figures of centaurs minor tours,
uh,

28
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,130
understood to signify the
doubleness of human beings,

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,900
the capacity of human beings
to join within themselves,

30
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,580
both the human and the beast,
steel or animal,

31
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,780
the animal, uh, experiences,

32
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,050
possibilities of being,
uh,

33
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,080
in neoplatonic thinking,

34
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:21,000
especially in the 12th century says to
give her a historical ring to what we are

35
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:22,080
saying that 12th century,

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,320
the so called shark fins and more so
in the 15th century Florence with Pico,

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,450
uh, the figures, the, the, the
whole idea is that human beings are,

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,290
uh,

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,270
really kind of copular or
neutral entities capable of,

40
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,260
we have the potential of
this doubleness within them.

41
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:48,261
They're capable of becoming fully
rational or descending into beastiality.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,320
And their position in the
ladder of being is one of, uh,

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,300
Arthur indeterminacy in the 12th century.
This is not the case.

44
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,370
They still believe in this.
Images are fixed,

45
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:05,371
images of Ed pities creatures capable of
being at the same time expressing this

46
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,880
dual impulses are the beast
deal and the human impulse.

47
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:17,350
This is Dante,
seems to be quite aware that somehow,

48
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,090
uh, the, the symbols do not
completely characterize,

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,610
uh,
what human beings really are.

50
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,611
That the ability of human beings to redeem
themselves to free themselves are of

51
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:35,611
a certain state or a four
plunge into the opposite state.

52
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:42,370
So there's a difference between the
symbols and what human beings are going to

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,970
be able to do. This is the,
this is really the, the, the,

54
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:49,971
the reason why I focused on Canto on
Canto ask you to read Canto to 12 where

55
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,740
Dante places tyrants. It's an an,
it's really an anonymous can't, well,

56
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:57,790
there are no great figures, no
great personalities. And we do know,

57
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,190
and Dante give us a list of all the
tyrants of his time and the chirons that

58
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:06,720
ionizers of Syracuse
Alexander, uh, the, the SLA,

59
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:11,200
no of his own, his own time
in Padua, uh, et cetera.

60
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,740
Uh, they are the features of a
tyranny, but at the same time,

61
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:19,060
he places next to them,
figures of educators,

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,100
figures of teachers, uh, such
as, for instance, Kyron. Uh,

63
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,360
and, and, and this is a little
bit ironic because he says,

64
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,370
come straight after Dante's exemplary
representation of Virgil's own teaching in

65
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,880
canned to 11. You remember when, uh,

66
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,930
virtual goes on explaining in
great detail the shape of, uh, of,

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
of inferno, he here. Now, once again,

68
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,920
Dante takes the other perspective
that which it takes to be the tyranny.

69
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,810
The tyranny of teaching,

70
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,860
they say as sort of teaching
does not allow that freedom.

71
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,640
That the very symbols,
the very presiding, uh,

72
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,850
figures of this canto also seem to,

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,420
to deny they are there forever,
man and beast.

74
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,220
And Dante claims clearly that there is a
teaching that has to allow the soul to,

75
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,240
of have the freedom to move either in
the direction of rationality or the

76
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,640
freedom of the choice to move in it's
opposite direction. So, uh, this is, uh,

77
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:24,550
the substance I think of Canto are 12.
We come though to kind to 13,

78
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:29,340
which is, uh, one of the most
remarkable cantos of in fairness,

79
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:34,030
it's the cant of the suicides and
Danton counters here. A figure,

80
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:36,410
a poet,
very well known poet,

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,780
very well known figure
of maybe, uh, the late,

82
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,590
um,

83
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,210
the middle part with the 13th
century called Pierre the Levenia.

84
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,550
And as you can,
as you read through the Kanto,

85
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:53,551
you will see that he punts on both
terms of the name Pierre Peter and he,

86
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,020
he thinks of himself as a figure of Peta.

87
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,840
One Who holds the keys, the two keys
of the kingdom, the keys of power,

88
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,140
but also the last name peer,
the Levenia meaning of the vineyard.

89
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,310
And this is verse,
this is,

90
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:10,850
we are going to witness now and
metamorphosis of a human being.

91
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,090
Then metamorphosis is a human being from
being human to becoming a vegetable at

92
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:20,630
plant. Uh, this is, uh, the
story of suicides and we shall,

93
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,290
we shall see what Dante things
about suicides. One, he,
why does he thinks is such,

94
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:30,291
such an evil as to become them in this
area of violence against the self.

95
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,500
You do know her, Dante, I
don't have to go over this,

96
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:38,060
but you do know that Dante distinguishes
violence against self violence against

97
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,370
others as in Canto 12,
uh,

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,400
violence against nature and violence
even against the divinity and can talk in

99
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,400
Canto 14. Let's look at canto
13, a little bit of a, some,

100
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,480
some textual details and then,
uh, and then we'll, we'll,

101
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:57,560
we'll discuss, uh, some of
the issues of the Canto. Um,

102
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,240
Nessus had not yet reached the other side.
Again,

103
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:07,570
when we set out through a wood which
was not marked by any path here,

104
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:12,110
there seems to be no directions at all.

105
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,990
Almost as if Dante we're revisiting,
came to one of inferno,

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,970
the same idea of, uh, uh,

107
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,120
a sense of loss of self and adumbrating
what suicide may also be at some,

108
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,890
at, at, at, at some level,

109
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,520
a loss of a loss of some
idea of one's own being,

110
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:35,450
some idea of what one is or should be.
We are not told anything more.

111
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,550
But then rather than shifts to the
description of the natural landscape,

112
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,100
the world of nature, the
landscape, and you, uh, uh,

113
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,190
if as you read,

114
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,490
you must be struck by how he's
highlighting a peculiar style.

115
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,100
And I want to emphasize this style,

116
00:07:55,101 --> 00:08:00,101
this figurations of style and no green
leaves but of Dusky Hugh series of

117
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:05,840
antithesis, first of all, a series
of antithesis but also an APP for us.

118
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,703
Negatives,

119
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,630
no smooth bowels but not
that and worked antithetical,

120
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,580
but at the same time, repetition of
this. No. And therefore foric no, no,

121
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,090
no fruits where there,
but most of the storms,

122
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,800
no breaks or harsh.

123
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:26,801
And then that the savage beast hate
the tilde lands between the Cessna and

124
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:29,900
called NATO. We are in what? In in a,

125
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:34,310
in a place in the landscape where
this is the style called, uh, uh,

126
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,400
there's a technical term
for the Dan to deploy.

127
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,860
It's called [inaudible], which
simply means a privation emphasizing.

128
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,570
There's nothing positive here,

129
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,490
but it's a way of subtracting from what
is missing rather than what is there

130
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,590
that is really a negation, the style of
integration. Uh, but at the same time,

131
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:59,591
so the antithesis making us think about
how the world might be no green leaves

132
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,640
but of Dusky Hue say
this is a style of uh,

133
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,650
taking away and they gave taking
it away from any substantial, uh,

134
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,660
description of the landscape,

135
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:17,661
no breaks or harsh and then
etc. Here make their nests.

136
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,740
The loathsome harpies again,
a hybrid figures just as we had the,

137
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,250
the same tour in the previous Canto,
um,

138
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,060
from the strawberries with this
more presage of future eels,

139
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,090
they have white wings and human next and
phases feed Claude and the great valis

140
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:39,990
feathered and they make lamentations
on the strange trees. Uh,

141
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,490
so we are in the world.

142
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:45,990
Are we really at world of
negation a world of, uh, uh,

143
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,580
monstrosities and a
world of, uh, probation,

144
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,080
um, what is happening to human beings
here? That's, that's really the, the,

145
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,960
the question that he seems to be racing,

146
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:01,000
but let me just proceed
even more care here.

147
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,260
The whole scene recasts an important
scene in book three of the Aeneid.

148
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,820
This is indeed also a major confrontation
between Dante whole can't dramatizes a

149
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:18,810
major confrontation
between Dante and Virgil,

150
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:23,520
the author of the Aeneid about some of
these issues. Where is the metamorphosis?

151
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,720
Where is nature? What is the place
of human beings within nature?

152
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Because Dante and Virgil things
in a sharply different ways for,

153
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,740
um, the metamorphosis versus the
scene that Nancy here is recalling,

154
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,850
um,

155
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,850
is the scene of book three of the Aeneid
where Pori Doris at causing the veneers

156
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,380
has been killed.
And he's,

157
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:51,200
you remember that is the speaking trees
in there to nes arrives in Trisha,

158
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,650
which is Asia Minor.

159
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,040
He thinks that his dad is the place
which the gods of assigned to him and he

160
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,040
does that which she feels has that which
he knows has to be done wherever and

161
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,810
whenever you want to build a city,
consecrate the ground,

162
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,190
how the ground by building an altar and
by purifying the ground through fire as

163
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,660
he tries to do this.

164
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,770
The altars horror is at the center in
the Aeneid at the center of the human

165
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:26,270
community.
He's pulling his plucking Eh,

166
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,440
a a bow and he hears a voice
and we still his, his, his, uh,

167
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,550
his shutters is scared and the
voice comes, it's poly Doris,

168
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,860
his cousin who,

169
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,950
who tells the story that has been
killed because of the sacrilegious,

170
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:41,370
I mean combated wherever.

171
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:46,371
Consecration virtual once one has to
believe to think of cannot be really

172
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:50,140
carried out because of the sacrilege has
been that of the killing of Pomodoros

173
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,130
on account of the, the, the,
the goal that he carried,

174
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:59,131
that they wanted to prompt him
or they want to rob him off.

175
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,210
Um, so, and, and, and knee
as he is a voice. Why do you,

176
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,350
uh,

177
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,410
whether do you pull me out of this and
put a daughter simply asks that a proper

178
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:16,171
burial be given to him so that he can
descend peacefully into hades and he has

179
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:22,030
complies and leaves that place in the
knowledge that is not the place I signed

180
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:22,740
to him.

181
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Sacrilege was such that he cannot really
quite found the city on the place of a

182
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:30,100
crime,
such an atrocious crime.

183
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,910
Dante's revisiting that particular scene.
In fact,

184
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:35,770
I repeat 10 to 13,

185
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,880
the recast that scene and it's a major
encounter with Virgil and Virgil's hole

186
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,570
pattern, whole system of values. And
let's see how this is going to continue.

187
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:50,620
So we have the background
with uh, uh, some, some, uh,

188
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,140
stylistics of negativity,

189
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,930
the styles of an allegation as if suicide,

190
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,920
where this fundamental
sacrilege, uh, that denies the,

191
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,870
the, the, some, some, some, some
reality that we don't know yet.

192
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,570
And the good master began to speak to me.

193
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,920
So Virgil intervene,
um,

194
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,100
minding us, reminding us that this
is in the book, three of the Aeneid,

195
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,920
which by the way,
and other little detail book,

196
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:25,921
three of their need is the book of the
veneer that Dante Joe's from the most.

197
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:31,590
And if some of you want to write a paper
on how many scenes and why you should

198
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:36,400
go and, uh, go ahead and write that
kind of paper. One reason is the book,

199
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:40,450
three of their need is the,
is the book of Nes Exile,

200
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,720
the homelessness of Nes. Nes. We
still nowhere, he's just uh, uh,

201
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,350
has just left the, the uh,
Troy he's going to, about to,

202
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:55,351
about to leave Carthage Dido's
home and about to get to into,

203
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,310
into Sicily but never really quite
been able to say this is really where I

204
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:02,890
belong.
This is really the praise one.

205
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:06,520
One can call home whatever
that may be for him.

206
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:11,410
The good master began to speak to me
virtual interrupts before the go further,

207
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,390
farther,
no,

208
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,890
that we're in the second round and
she'll be until they come to the horrible

209
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:18,551
sand look,

210
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:23,551
well therefore and Asha see things that
would discredit my telling of them.

211
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,210
This is a hyperbole on
the part of virtual.

212
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:34,780
You're going to see what I have
been describing in a sense.

213
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:38,680
This is the reason why I'm the all the
the and authority and why I'm guiding

214
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:43,510
through you through this because I have
seen imaginatively at least I have seen

215
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:47,560
some of the things that you are
experiencing and what you will see.

216
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:51,380
The reality of it all will exceed my,
uh,

217
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,170
my own abilities to tell of it.

218
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,990
It stands of humility on
the part of the teacher.

219
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,210
Then afforded a mild correction of the
claims about teaching and cantor 12,

220
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:06,670
he said, this is one theme that seems
to be running through. And then, uh, uh,

221
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,360
Dante continuous are heard from
every side wheelings poured forth.

222
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,370
And so none that made them
so that, Oh, bewildered,

223
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,290
I stopped. And now another conceit
that we should come back to.

224
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,290
I think he thought, I thought, oh,

225
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,300
it's clearly,
um,

226
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,600
we call it an amplification one
at a way of playing with one verb,

227
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,670
but also inferring what the
thought of the other would be.

228
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,800
Uh,
it's a descent into a kind of,

229
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:46,940
into the boundaries of one's own mind,

230
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,390
a way in which Dante dramatizes the fact
that there is no real conversation now

231
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,150
going on between him and Virgil.
It's,

232
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:02,150
it's a way of descending into
the, uh, what I call exactly the,

233
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,900
the, the, the loneliness of, uh,
of Dante's own thoughts, I think.

234
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:10,220
And then reiterated once again and
a, for Rick, I think he thought,

235
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:11,540
I thought more of this later,

236
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,230
that all divorces among the trucks
came from people were hiding from us.

237
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,880
So the master said,

238
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,620
if the break of annual branch
from one of these trees,

239
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,760
all the present tolls will prove mistaken.

240
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,800
Then I put up my hand a little and proctor
twig from a great stone and its trunk

241
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:35,801
cried and this is in year
three lines 39 and following.

242
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,620
That's the way book through third
of three of the knee begins.

243
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,700
Why the start telling me and
we had turned dark with blood.

244
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,410
It began again. Why mangles
Tommy has done no spirit of pity.

245
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,380
We were men and now our turn to stocks,

246
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,580
the hand might well have been more
pitiful. We've been souls of serpents.

247
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,190
It's a green brand.
There is burning at one end,

248
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:01,460
drips from the other and
hisses with escaping wind.

249
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,610
So from the broken splinter came forth
words and blood together at which I left

250
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:10,460
for the tip and still this one
afraid and virtual intervenes.

251
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,210
If he could have believed
before wounded soul,

252
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,830
what it had never seen,
but in my lines in my need,

253
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,980
he would not have stretched forth his
hand against him. My sage replied,

254
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,850
but they think being incredible
made me prompt him to the deed,

255
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,350
which grieves myself.

256
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,530
But tell me who that was so that for some
amens he may revive their fame in the

257
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:35,220
world above what he is
permitted to return.

258
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,450
The irony of reviving the fame in a
place where there is no possibility of

259
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,140
revival,
a,

260
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:46,610
there is no possibility of coming back
to life and they wear their natural world

261
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,840
is not capable of behaving naturally.
Where,

262
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,230
where there is no real growth, no real
change here. It's always going to be,

263
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,820
it's the most unnatural of
places. Uh, saw the shadow of,

264
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,220
of this unnatural ness is
going to be cast over the, uh,

265
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:09,420
the scene with the encounter with Brunetto
Latini. What is this, this idea here?

266
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,370
Uh, in a sense, this is already the
confrontational between Virgil and Dante.

267
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,370
If he could have believed that
which had described it is this,

268
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:22,371
Dante wants to test the truth value
of what he had read in the Aeneid.

269
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,400
He had read the scene at the end.
[inaudible],

270
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,290
let me see how this is and finds out
that that which he sees is entirely

271
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:35,880
different from Virgil's account.
Uh, in a way we are really,

272
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,470
really drawing our attention to
what we call the act of reading.

273
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:43,080
How do we read or what do we believe?

274
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,420
When we read the story and we read
a story, we yield in many ways too.

275
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,080
So it's part,
we want the,

276
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,250
the story that we read to read
us as much as we want to read it,

277
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,950
we want the story to,
to explain us to ourselves,

278
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,800
to hold a mirror up to
us to see the who we are.

279
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,040
But Dante is literally also
implying the need to violate the,

280
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,140
the,
the letter of the Aeneid is I,

281
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,860
he had to do because whatever he had,
any virtual had described,

282
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,950
exceeded a believability.

283
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,880
It was just an incredible account
and he has to test the reality of,

284
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,080
of that scene.
So that's,

285
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:25,920
that's really the part of the
confrontation between the two.

286
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,190
And now let's see what he hears.
And the trunk said,

287
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,460
thou swear Lewis me with a gentle
speeches where we call Cup Tatsuo.

288
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,870
I won't have to write it on the, on
the, on here, on the board, the cap tax,

289
00:19:39,871 --> 00:19:41,340
your benevolence.
Yeah.

290
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:45,920
You know that whenever a
great rhetorical trick,

291
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,100
uh,
whenever you give a speech or whatever,

292
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:55,100
people speak to you in public,
especially of our privately, they, uh,

293
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,640
willing engage in this way of
capturing your benevolence,

294
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:04,290
about telling a story, playing with
something about their modesty or whatever.

295
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,980
Now you saw Louis May
so fascinated. So I, uh,

296
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,310
the lower of your rhetorical
language or your rhetorical powers,

297
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,450
we are dealing with rhetoric first of
all with style and now then with the

298
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:20,850
language of the text and now with the
language of the exchange. So this is it.

299
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,020
It is as if, uh, uh, the,

300
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,090
the suicide has a lot to do with this
trait of language is characteristic of

301
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:33,510
language that so Louis me with a gentle
speech that I cannot be silent and let

302
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:37,230
it not burden youth from
beguiled into talk for a little.

303
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,330
I am he that help both.
The keys here is the pun on Peter.

304
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,720
It's as if he were Saint Peter holds the
two keys of the Kingdom of Fredrick's

305
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:50,800
heart. Uh, and now the,

306
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,050
you can see that all the language of
believing faith that has been going around

307
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:01,290
in the previous lines of the candle seem
to be gravitating around the figure of

308
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:04,030
Frederick.
They cane who is a kind of,

309
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,770
let's call them the god of the
city, right? Uh, because his name,

310
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:10,690
that's what it means in Italian.
The specialists,

311
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,470
it's not an English who say Frederick,
it has a feather Ricoh,

312
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,150
which really repeats the idea
of, uh, of, of faith within it,

313
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:24,151
as if all faith all believes really
have to converge and go toward this.

314
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,620
Uh, this, this, uh,
emperor of Sicily, the,

315
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:33,070
he's a hunch fun.
He's a famous German king,

316
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,620
a ruling over Sicily and,
and,

317
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:40,090
and living there was the chancellor
of the empire and also the founder,

318
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,330
by the way, let me say something
more about him. He's the founder.

319
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,210
He's the one who conceived
the first university,

320
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,960
the first State University in Europe,
the University of Naples,

321
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,060
because Frederick wanted a university
that would prepare lawyers,

322
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,770
diplomats, uh, people would go
on state missions who can write,

323
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,700
uh, uh, uh, papers for the state,

324
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,560
and they would not be at all,

325
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,780
or one of the schools that they
were universities where, uh,

326
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,810
under the aegis of, for instance,
the canon lawyers that theologians,

327
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,610
so this was, say the first La Secular
School in Europe was an imperial.

328
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,340
CNN are like, for instance,
the University of Paris, uh,

329
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,380
which was under the symbol painters in
the domain of both the bishop of Paris

330
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,400
and the King of France. And hence a
lot of, uh, conflicts between, uh,

331
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,360
between the two. Uh, uh,
so he's a chancellor,

332
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,780
he's the founder and of of the university.
He was a poet.

333
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,930
And he also compiled the so
called institutes of justice
for the kingdom where,

334
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,120
which is all, uh, inspire. The
institutes are all inspired by, uh,

335
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:54,140
the language of moderation, the
language of, uh, of, of, uh, uh,

336
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,830
idealistic language of older,
uh,

337
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,720
and the natural law that could follow,
could they could organize the state.

338
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:05,860
And clearly, uh, the
reality is that by his act,

339
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,320
uh,
uh,

340
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,270
peer delivery in your shows that there's
no such a thing called that he doesn't

341
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:15,271
really believe in what he claims to be
the principal of the legal organization

342
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:19,500
of, of the state, which is, uh,
uh, natural law. I have been.

343
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,830
So I have bought the keys of Fredericks
heart and turn them locking and

344
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:28,600
unlocking so softly that I kept nearly
every other main from his secrets.

345
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,800
He is the secretary of the
emperor word as you know,

346
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,710
secretary.
Uh,

347
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,390
which becomes very crucial throughout
the renaissance is a counselor,

348
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,080
but the secretary means comes,
it's a word that comes from the Latin,

349
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,380
from to secrete it. This is a fake.
It's a, here's the figure who distills.

350
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,300
That's the creating distills, the, the,

351
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,680
that which the emperor keeps
hidden in his heart. Oh, he's,

352
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,240
he has this power of distillation
and knowing us and through this,

353
00:24:00,241 --> 00:24:01,074
this selection,

354
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,780
what has to be shared and what
has to be kept concealed from all,

355
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,400
all others. Okay. So pipe,
the figure of a prestige.

356
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:13,910
He views himself as a,
as a strict,

357
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:18,911
and he was collaborator of the emperor
and that brought again such faithfulness.

358
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,920
Now that question of fidelity in the way
we read the text in the way we believe,

359
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,140
what we read is brought into,

360
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,290
it's sort of rephrase refracted into
the language of Fidel Loyalty as

361
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:33,620
faithfulness to the emperor,

362
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:36,890
to the growers office that are
lost for its sleep and strength.

363
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,980
The causes of the suicide,
the causes of his tragic of appeared.

364
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,520
The Levinas tragic downfall.
I want to be at the Harlot,

365
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,590
personification for envy. Envy. Uh,

366
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,113
the,

367
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,500
the sin there is product
that Aquinas for instance,

368
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:02,010
views as the worst possible sin. Yeah. Uh,

369
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,210
because it is really very close to hatred
and close to hatred in the sense that

370
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,760
it has nothing.
All sins have some positivity to it,

371
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,650
and all you are, you're a glutton
is because that piece of cake,

372
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,980
there's something about it that
no lures show to you are you have,

373
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,880
have this jar proud.

374
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,070
It's because you really have some sense
of your excellence or some which is the

375
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,950
real sin.
Contempt for others.

376
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,000
Believe that others are not as good
as you as you would think you are.

377
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:43,030
So it's not so much that you look at
yourself stretching the hand toward the

378
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:47,090
divinity, the pride of Lucifer,
right? They're real sin is that you,

379
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,720
you kick around those who
you perceive are below.

380
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:54,410
You all since have some kind of
positive they except for one.

381
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,300
And that's envy.
Envy only likes nothing.

382
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,280
It's not jealousy. You know, you do
have the kind of story, all of you,

383
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,190
I'm sure our readers of Othello,
right?

384
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:10,280
Because that's really a confrontation
with an envy and jealousy.

385
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,240
That is the envy. Uh, how
Jen Othello, maybe jealous,

386
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,450
but the one who is really envious is Jago
one once he doesn't want this demo of

387
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,600
himself, he can't stand the idea that
the other guy's happy. That's envy.

388
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,140
Jealousy is the fear of
losing jealous is almost, uh,

389
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,020
an ingredient of love. Andreas
Capilano says she really are in love.

390
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,210
It must be some rational
aspect too of jealousy in it.

391
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,320
But here, uh, the, the cause
of, of uh, uh, the court,

392
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,510
the court, which is always
that little microcosm, right?

393
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:49,290
Uh,

394
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,290
even for Dante writes a treatise on
language or the theorists of law about,

395
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,640
about the function of language in the
court because the court is the place of

396
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:04,540
laws is the praise of poetry
is the place of a, uh,

397
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,310
political persuasion.
These are the,

398
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,010
the various dimensions of
the powers of language.

399
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,220
And then you do know about the
court from Andreas Capilano's.

400
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:19,250
That's another topic for you to explore
Dante's figuration of the court and from

401
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:24,060
all possible, uh, uh, points
of view here. Dante views.

402
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Now the court is micro
cause of a political oda and
idealism as being literally

403
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,390
poisoned by the presence of a
contaminated by the presence of envy,

404
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,430
the Harlot.
And that never turned a shameless eyes.

405
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,120
And You understand that metaphor. It's
not so much that it belongs to the Harlot.

406
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,310
The fact is that the
word envy as you know,

407
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,590
is a word that are in Italian
or in English, in videos.

408
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,260
It's Nvidia,

409
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,380
which is at the monetized as non video.
So it's whole,

410
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,110
it's an idea. It's a kind of
blindness to the world outside.

411
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:11,760
And here Dante's panelists turn the
shameless eyes. We seem to be, uh,

412
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,400
in a sort of representation of the harlot,

413
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,050
this and the seduction of the holiday.
But it's also also plays on this, uh,

414
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:24,290
on this notion of what MV really means
and common bane and the vice of codes and

415
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:28,890
now inflamed all mines against me.

416
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,850
Look how the language
now sort of takes over.

417
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,970
It takes over and Dante
is just playing with and,

418
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:38,490
and multiplying these terms,

419
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:42,930
the same terms repeated over and
over again and those inflamed.

420
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,180
So inflame the dusters.

421
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:50,210
The name for the Emperor Caesar that
happy owners turn to this bull was,

422
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,870
this is the formula for the, the, the,

423
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,880
the formulaic definition of tragedy that
he's giving happy owners turn to this

424
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:03,414
more walls.

425
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,790
We have the Lavigna is aware
of his own tragic Destinee,

426
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:11,100
his own tragic downfall and,

427
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,730
and seals his fate as a tragic fate.

428
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,150
And now my mind in scornful
temper thinking by dying
to escape from score made

429
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:26,250
me just unjust to myself at once again,

430
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,610
the style of repetitions and a foric peer.

431
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:35,630
The lavigna constitutes himself
into a closed circuit and,

432
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,800
and the doubling of
language reflect the self.

433
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:46,660
And let me just go on and tell you
what I think is, is going on here.

434
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,870
When you read the sentence and I'm
dying to skip from sort of made me just

435
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,920
unjust to myself.

436
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,510
And the obvious question that I think
you should really ask and if I gave you a

437
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:03,100
chance to ask, you would ask
how many cells are there in him?

438
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,390
Made me just unjust to myself.
How many,

439
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,570
how many persons are there, how many
fingers are there in one, in, in,

440
00:30:12,571 --> 00:30:13,750
in pure the Livy?
Yeah.

441
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,740
The text that best glosses the scene.

442
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,750
It's tragic occurrence here.

443
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,470
Appears in the city of
God of the Augustan book,

444
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:33,931
one where Augustan is telling the
story of Rome and the death of,

445
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,190
and the end of the period of the
monarchy, you know, the seven kings,

446
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,580
right? Their stores. And with the
s the story of the seven, the, the,

447
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,650
the expulsion of the tar. Quinn's, the,

448
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,710
the last king is attributed to the
fact that the famous matron of Rome,

449
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,080
but the name of Lucretia come down too,
by the way,

450
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,550
mentions in limbo though he's,

451
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,300
he has a lot of ideas about who or what,
what,

452
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,610
what is the guilt of a suicide.

453
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,070
We shall see that a great figure
from an antiquity, Cato, uh,

454
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,140
as suicide will appear and will inaugurate
the proctorial canticle in can't hold

455
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:18,850
one. So that is always making some crucial
discriminations, crucial distinctions.

456
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,420
At any rate. They are the story
that Lucre that Augustine, uh,

457
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,940
tells in book. One of the, of the
city of God is that of uh, uh,

458
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,020
the rape of Lucretia,

459
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,620
the rape of Lucretia and Augustan is
fierce about the fact that she commits

460
00:31:35,431 --> 00:31:36,264
suicide.

461
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:41,850
How that she then she commit suicide
are of the guilt and shame that she had

462
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,520
been violated.
It rape by the,

463
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,610
by, by, by realtors. And she says,

464
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,470
how the shit there to take her own life.

465
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Because here is the chase through Cretia
who is embarrassed of the unchaste

466
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,900
Lucretia.
This is a sin of false transcendence.

467
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,050
The belief that I can
be not completely cold.

468
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,930
I do not coincide fully with who I
am so that I have to double myself,

469
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:20,320
have to see myself as different
from what, uh, what I am.

470
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,100
I can do justice against
myself by doing this.

471
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,000
For Dante are going to dentist texts.
This doubling of peer,

472
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:31,390
the Ravinia is a saint
of false transcendence.

473
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,750
The way the suicide is praying God to
oneself and this punishing oneself for

474
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:44,180
wrongs that he,
the suicide perceives Lucretia.

475
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:49,181
She that perceived as have fouling
how reality and see what I mean?

476
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:54,810
This is the kind of, uh, uh,
there's a kind of, um, some, uh,

477
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,820
kind of doubleness that seems to be
running through and Dante's rendering

478
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:03,370
through this idea of a start by the new
roads. So the street, I swear to you,

479
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,820
never did I break faith with my Lord who
is so worthy of honor and the father of

480
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,550
your return to the world.
Let him establish my memory.

481
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:16,130
Still lies under the blow
that, uh, Envi, uh, gave it.

482
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:21,310
So, uh, the story of appear. The
Livinia exemplifies the story of,

483
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,850
of dramatizes, the story
of the tragic, uh, uh,

484
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,590
experience of suicide.

485
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:32,890
And Dante here gives of suicide in
exactly theological and Augustinian,

486
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,760
uh, account. He views it,

487
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,830
looks at it from an Augustinian our
point of view. We skipped Canto,

488
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,080
uh,
14,

489
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:50,080
and we go now to another memorable
candidate and memorable or can't 15,

490
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,900
uh, memorable, um, uh,

491
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,820
encounter with a dentist,

492
00:33:57,821 --> 00:34:01,800
teacher Brunetto Latini,
um,

493
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,130
who was probably 50 years.

494
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,660
He senior who was a translator at,

495
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,970
who adapted in the vernacular,

496
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,230
a Cicero's rhetorical works, who was, uh,

497
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,190
also who's a teacher of the
Florentines, a teacher of Dante. Um,

498
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,680
and who,
uh,

499
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:26,890
who really stands for the great values
of the rhetorical humanistic or she's

500
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:32,410
Heronian tradition. Uh, the idea of a,

501
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,890
he opposed the idea of the
Republic of Florence. Uh,

502
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,800
he said wealth because he does not want
you do know that they give billions are

503
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:45,290
those who are in favor of the
imperial control of the state.

504
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:50,590
And for him to be a wealth is really
to claim that he's on the side of the

505
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:54,050
republic, that he wants the
throat and the republic. Um,

506
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,010
he was sent to an embassy, uh,
he went to Toledo by the way,

507
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:01,940
which at the time was the
center of a great translations.

508
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,920
And He may have brought from Toledo
translations or of Dante new,

509
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:07,820
uh,

510
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,820
such as perhaps the account of the
Mohammed's vision and be assent to,

511
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,180
to, uh, to paradise.

512
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,950
That's really a very doubtful a question,
but it's,

513
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,840
it circulates increasingly
within a Dante Dante studies,

514
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:29,880
the perimeter of Dante
Studies. Uh, and, and,

515
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:34,310
and Burrito what he was going
on an embassy to friends,

516
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,450
um, was banned from, he
eventually returned to Florence.

517
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,563
Uh,

518
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,630
but he said figure that that Dante
really tries to pattern himself after

519
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,120
effectively. It's, it's uh, uh,

520
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:53,121
the teaching of Brunetto is what guides
him at least in the initial phase of his

521
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:58,500
political concerns that other experiences,

522
00:35:58,501 --> 00:36:03,240
intellectual experiences that
we'll intervene and we'll
change radically Dante's

523
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:04,510
thinking.
Uh,

524
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,120
what I'm trying to do in these classes
is also to give you a sense of the shifts

525
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,660
in, in his perceptions and his
understanding of the world.

526
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,380
I will be telling you at some point
that, uh, there were, there were, uh,

527
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,560
extraordinary encounters
that he had with uh,

528
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,580
some theologians in some,

529
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:27,581
some philosophers within Florence that
gave him a completely different view from

530
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:31,140
the one that [inaudible] instilled in him.

531
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,800
So let's see what happens between the
toilet. We are in the area. Once again,

532
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,480
violence, this time, violence,

533
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:40,470
it is nature and that is
[inaudible] is damned,

534
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,240
is condemned for a sin of Sodom.

535
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,070
There is no evidence at all from
any other sources that that's what,

536
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,860
that's where he was. And, and,

537
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,880
and I have to tell you that Dante also
has a different understanding of Solomon

538
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,430
when he comes to pull gatory.
Um, for instance, Canto 26,

539
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,900
uh, where the, the sodomites are in,

540
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:05,340
in the process of redeeming,

541
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:09,090
of seeking some kind of redemption
and cleansing. But Anyway,

542
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:12,300
this is the candle here. Let's
see how he proceeds. Now,

543
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,600
one of the hard margins bears us on and
the vapor from the stream makes a shade

544
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:23,520
above such shelters,
the water and the banks from the fire.

545
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,620
Uh, uh, the, the, the focus
of the cantos once again,

546
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:33,510
the natural world,
the natural world and natural world,

547
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:38,130
which is one of sheer
chaos in the natural world,

548
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,930
which is one of violence.

549
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:44,320
And look at this image as the
Fleming between Vincent and Bruce.

550
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,981
You know,
the,

551
00:37:45,981 --> 00:37:50,340
the Netherlands is describing literally
the Netherland calling called such

552
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,540
because there are lower,

553
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,920
the surface of the land is lower than
that of the water and they have to to

554
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:59,940
protect the, the, the
land from the violence of,

555
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,470
of the water and the floods.

556
00:38:01,471 --> 00:38:06,150
So they build this diet around as the
Fleming's between Vincent and Bruce

557
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:10,980
fearing the flood Rushanian on them,
make the bulwark to drive back the sea.

558
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,731
And this,

559
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:16,731
the pageants do along the brand to
protect their towns and castles before the

560
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:21,420
kid. And Tana feels the heat this were
made of the same fashion except that the

561
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:26,000
builder, whether he was met them
neither, so high, no, so broad.

562
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,090
So the natural world that
can hardly be contained.

563
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,350
That's the idea.

564
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:36,370
The natural world that is always
going to overwhelm all efforts to,

565
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,330
uh, barriers trying to impede
its violence. By the way,

566
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:43,450
this is an image for those of you
who are readers of literature,

567
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,270
even beyond the Middle Ages.
Uh,

568
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,880
it's a famous image that
Machiavelli was use in, uh,

569
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,960
uh, in, in chapter 20, uh, five of the,

570
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,040
of the prints.

571
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,720
You remember when he talks about virtual
and fortunate and that the virtue of

572
00:39:01,721 --> 00:39:05,770
human beings virtual the word
cat, actor at a tear, you know,

573
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,110
the virtual human beings
is to build, you know, uh,

574
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,560
shelters we talk to whenever
we expect the front,

575
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,420
but in the full knowledge that we
are never really going to succeed.

576
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,690
And yet we need the shelters
just in case we might succeed.

577
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Virtual is always a little bit less
powerful than fortunate in his,

578
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:29,420
uh, in, in that world. It's a, it's an
image that in one of, uh, the history, uh,

579
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,260
plays Shakespeare also also uses,

580
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,510
I'm not saying that he
takes it from Dante said,

581
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,830
we don't know whether he actually
read down to or not already.

582
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,010
So this is the background
of this account already.

583
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:46,330
We had got to so far from the woods that
I should not have seen what it was if I

584
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:49,450
had turned backward when
we met a troop of souls.

585
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,310
We're coming alongside the bank and
each looked at us as men look at one

586
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,030
another.

587
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,030
And the new moon at dusk seems to create
this kind of a strange world of uh,

588
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,360
of the night worlds,
the night world and the packer,

589
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:11,550
the browse on us like an old
Taylor on the eye of his leader.

590
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,640
What an extraordinary,

591
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,130
extraordinary emerge that
will use something like this.
Not Quite the same image.

592
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,220
The paler, uh, when he's arriving,

593
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,350
when his to describe his own
vision of Paradise. It is a safe,

594
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:31,150
the most, the humbleness, the
humble, his experience in the city.

595
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,120
Uh, in Florence, you
know, the Artism, the,

596
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,850
the Taylor can only help him.

597
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,520
That was the only thing you can
think about as he's approaching.

598
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,340
There was sublime of experiences.
That's about it. These are 33,

599
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,210
and here this most are extraordinary.

600
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,790
A story has also the ring of familiarity
or that's really the image of a,

601
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,260
the way I think this image works,

602
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,270
the sense of a familiarity and that with
a familiar image of the tailor and the

603
00:40:58,271 --> 00:40:58,691
tailor.

604
00:40:58,691 --> 00:41:03,691
Also figure that picture measure
the Taylor is a figure of a,

605
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:09,310
of the Artism who in order to fit you
properly has really to have your measure.

606
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,710
Your idea of who you are.
Now I does. By that company,

607
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:17,440
I was recognized by one
who took by the help me,

608
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,620
but the hammock ride
her marvelous and die.

609
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:25,450
When he reached out his arm to me
fixed my eye on his vacant looks.

610
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,490
So the scorched features did not keep
my mind from recognizing him and bending

611
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:31,390
my face to his.

612
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:35,760
I answered are you here seven or eight?

613
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,290
Are you here sir?
Brunetto oh,

614
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,120
so this is the scene of the
recognition in in fair? No,

615
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:45,620
that's what you have seen.

616
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:49,730
So recognitions more
than first encounters.

617
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:55,180
It is as if literally recognizing means
knowing people that you thought you knew

618
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:01,820
and you knowing them. I knew all
the fingers that you thought you

619
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,160
knew something about red
of the recognition it means
also are giving a kind of

620
00:42:10,621 --> 00:42:13,250
uh, understand and give me
a kind of the deal to them.

621
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,270
Recognizing in that sense
too. And He, oh my son,

622
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,680
but not explicitly.

623
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:23,681
If Retro Latini return back with the
little and let the train go on twice.

624
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,990
Brunetto refer to Dante's,

625
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:30,680
oh my son are the sorts
of acknowledging this,

626
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,330
this Felician acknowledging,
ah,

627
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,490
a kind of familiarity that goes beyond
even every, any form of discipleship.

628
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,790
And Dante will resist that,

629
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,010
that solicitation, that affectionate.
So recitation, that familiarity,

630
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,600
he will always refer to him as
they emerge of a father, but twice.

631
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,970
And then he says,
and I said to him with all my heart,

632
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,400
I beg of you and if you
wish me to sit with you,

633
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,000
I will if it pleases
him here with whom I go.

634
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,060
Meaning Virgil are mentioned as if
Dante now were concealing pro forma.

635
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:10,390
To be sure the shifted a loyalty
from one teacher to another and we're

636
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:14,480
considering it from Brunette within
again a cancer again, breathe, Oh son,

637
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,450
whoever this frog stops, et cetera. Um,

638
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,910
go under for a Chicago Matteis skirt,

639
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,640
which some critics have seen as a sign
of this is that the really Dante may have

640
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:30,500
known something about Prenatal
Athena that nobody else knew. Uh, uh,

641
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:34,920
later rejoined my band will,
who go morning that a turn or laws,

642
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,910
uh, look at the spatial
configuration of the scene. It's,

643
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,450
I think it's very significant.

644
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,780
The disciple is above the future is
below so that the disciple has to bow in

645
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:51,410
order to be able to speak to the teacher,

646
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,040
which would be a sign of his reverence
for the authority of the master.

647
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,060
But at the same time it indicates
that the hierarchy between them,

648
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:04,110
it's both the higher heat between them
really has completely altered from the

649
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,990
the days that they were or are in
the city, in the streets of Florence.

650
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,580
And then he tells the story up above them
and the bright light, I answered him,

651
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,530
not, I'm sorry, there's not descend
from the track, etc. And he says,

652
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:23,531
what chance of destiny Burritos as brings
the down here before their last day.

653
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:28,930
And who is this that shows the y chance
destiny Brunetto has no understanding of

654
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:38,460
the trajectory of Dante's
life and adventure.

655
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,590
And this is really the beginning of a
series of misunderstandings between the

656
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:46,920
teacher and the disciple tool.

657
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:52,070
Different value systems are being
deployed and there are going to be in

658
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:54,780
collusion with each other.

659
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,880
Brunetto speaks like a true humanist
and men who belonged to the CIS Aronian.

660
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:04,310
And who espouses this is Haronian ethics
for whom here the world is one indeed

661
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,890
of chance encounters, uh, uh, destiny, ah,

662
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,420
that takes us one way or the other and
there is nothing in the, the providential,

663
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,680
ah, about it. And Dante, uh,

664
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:20,010
a response by really giving a kind of
pithy summary of his experience in the

665
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,070
last few hours up above there
in the bright light. I answered,

666
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,780
I answered him before my age, who was at
the fool hill repeats in fair, no one,

667
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,700
I lost my way in a valley. He appeared
to me when I was returning to it.

668
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,630
And by this road he leads me home.

669
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,330
These are extraordinary rewards because
what home means for the politically

670
00:45:45,331 --> 00:45:50,331
minded Florence centered and of existence
of Brunetto is not the idea of what

671
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:53,010
home means for Dante.

672
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:58,011
For Dante home is the place of the
soul and the place where the soul is,

673
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,280
uh,

674
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,280
at its most distended distension of the
solar cookers for Brunetto home can only

675
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:08,730
be the CTO forum.
One has a political frame of reference.

676
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,170
The other one has a theological frame
of reference and they two are colliding

677
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:15,990
with each other. Let's continue
and see how this is extraordinary.

678
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:19,500
And he said to me,
if you follow the star now again,

679
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,330
an extension of the language.

680
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:25,470
That metaphor picks up the metaphor of
chance of destiny, kind of astrology.

681
00:46:25,471 --> 00:46:27,640
Follow your star, right? Uh,

682
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,250
the astrology of the desk in the destiny
of Dante Dao cannot fail the glorious

683
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:33,084
haven.

684
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:38,220
Another one another that is dramatizing
the radical ambiguity of words that seem

685
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:42,840
to be so bland,
like glorious,

686
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:47,910
glorious means to a humanist is not
what glorious means to a theological

687
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:51,900
reminded thing. You know, in
theology one things of nature,

688
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,920
grace and glory that
Dante Begins Paradise One,

689
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,410
the first word with which means
it's the glory of him. Gloria,

690
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:06,100
him who moves all things and glory from
Brunette to means the happy ending fame

691
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,640
and whatever the grill use heaven.

692
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,600
If I discern rightly in there for
life and then I'll die too soon,

693
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,640
seeing heaven so gracious to
the again, uh, uh, this is,

694
00:47:17,641 --> 00:47:19,740
you know, glorious in
grace. Once again today,

695
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,480
I would have strengthened in thy work.
But a thankless and Malik malignant fork,

696
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,990
which came down with old
from fears or instill,

697
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,300
keeps something of the mountain and the
rock shall become for the world doing

698
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:35,620
that an enemy and with reason for among
the bitter Sobes, it's not natural.

699
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:38,980
The sweet thing should come to fruit.
Old Fame.

700
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,190
So from Brunette to his point of view,

701
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,960
the reference of all the crisis,

702
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:48,580
the spiritual crisis,

703
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,080
the laws of self of Dante
can only be political.

704
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,680
That Brunetto makes an incredible mistake
of believing that Dante's experience

705
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:01,060
is exactly the replica of his own.

706
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,890
He lost the city while he was,
by the way, Ron says, val,

707
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,590
the place, you know, where the,

708
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:13,870
where the Great Paladin of
Charlemagne or long, uh, was, was,

709
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:16,840
uh, it's a symbolic place.
He chooses was defeated.

710
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:21,940
And now this is exactly what he thinks.
It's happening also to, to Dante,

711
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,960
the pilgrim. Um, among the
bit of sobs, et Cetera,

712
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:30,340
old fame in the world calls and blind
people, avaricious and views and proud.

713
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,413
This is the,

714
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:36,550
the three sparks that have set the
hearts of the Florentines on fire.

715
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,910
And this pride envy,

716
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,770
average envy and pride are the fortune
holds the for such honor that one party

717
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:50,550
and the other shall be ravenous
against the, so then, uh,

718
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:54,100
the language that the
prophecy of Dante's exile,

719
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:59,410
the two parties [inaudible] Berlin's
will turn against them, et cetera.

720
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,550
And Dante answers, we're all my
prayers fulfilled. I answered him.

721
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,880
You had not yet been
banished from humanity.

722
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,420
For in my memory is fixed
and our goes to my heart,

723
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:19,110
the deer and kind paternal image
of you with many time in the world,

724
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,320
you taught me how man makes himself
immortal and how much I'm grateful for it.

725
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,500
My tongue where I live must needs to
declare that we should tell him my course.

726
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:36,570
I write and keep with another text for
comment by lady who will know if I reach

727
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:40,810
her.
Clearly an allusion to Beatrice,

728
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,770
though we will not be Beatrice who will
make the prophecy of Dante's exile.

729
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,710
But in this metrically,
uh,

730
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,750
connected Canto 1516 of Paradise
would be Dantes real grandfather.

731
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,480
So the distinction between this fictional
figure of a self proclaimed spiritual

732
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:03,061
father Brunetto and the the
heroic grandfather Cacciaguida,

733
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,460
uh, the, the, the antithesis is very, uh,

734
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,700
very clear and in the acknowledgement
that Dante gives of the acknowledgement

735
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:16,190
that Dante gives of, uh, um,

736
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,070
burritos teaching when
he says, um, for me,

737
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:23,590
my memory is fixed and
now goes to my heart,

738
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,160
the deer in kind paternal image of
you wear many time in the world.

739
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,130
You taught me how men
makes himself in mortal.

740
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,940
There's also a little bit of a critique,

741
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:36,941
a little bit of a distance that Dante
establishes between himself and Brunette.

742
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,230
For the true point.

743
00:50:39,650 --> 00:50:44,650
The real authentic point of
Dante's experience is that
men does not make himself

744
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:50,600
and more, of course we're
involved. Withdrawal works.

745
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:56,470
Maybe there are many other forms of
achieving some degree of immortality,

746
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,600
but can make children to
become more to one hope,

747
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:03,230
at least a provisional
immortality, continuity. Uh,

748
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,480
but from dentist point of view,

749
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,680
the mortality that he's
seeking is not manmade,

750
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,700
can only be a question of
the salvation of his soul.

751
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:18,710
So in the very great acknowledgment
that form in which the disciple who just

752
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:25,060
love making these claims of indebtedness
to the teacher is also a sense of a

753
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:30,560
difference between them and
misunderstandings. Uh, and this, uh,

754
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,360
uh, we'll, uh, we'll,

755
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:37,390
we'll be in fact the trade
of this encounter to a
teacher who has been shaping

756
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:43,450
the disciple and the disciple
has been going his own way, uh,

757
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:48,090
who somehow things that
education means also, uh,

758
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:52,940
uh, is tantamount to an experience
of freedom. It's what we,

759
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:57,750
this is the way we began when,
uh, when I spoke about the dub,

760
00:51:57,751 --> 00:52:00,350
the figures of doubleness in cantor 12.

761
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:05,500
And this is the theme that seems to be
going through even in the encounter with

762
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:10,340
Brunetto and let's see now exactly
then what is Brunette saw them.

763
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:14,900
Your way of understanding Burritos are
clearly linked to violence within the

764
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:18,040
world of violence. And so, um,

765
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:23,260
Dante wants to know about who the other
centers are and Burrito would comply and

766
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:28,580
sister all clerks and great and famous
scholars and he mentions them over the

767
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:33,510
father was one of the same sin pressure
if famous Grameen Arion, a Francesco,

768
00:52:33,511 --> 00:52:37,850
the Corso who also is a, uh, by the way,

769
00:52:37,851 --> 00:52:41,810
I think he's a lawyer and I started
as the craving such scarf, et cetera.

770
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:44,810
Now then he says,
I will say more,

771
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:50,080
but I cannot go farther talking with
the for I see there and new cloud rising

772
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:51,224
from the sand.

773
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:55,940
People are coming with whom
I must not be let my treasure

774
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:00,830
in which I get live,
be commended to the,

775
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,880
and I ask no more a true teacher,
I say,

776
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,460
who gives bibliography
at the end? Says, okay,

777
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:12,461
now you go and read my book or just read
everybody's book but I recommend to you

778
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,300
my treasurer come in,
which I get live to become mended today.

779
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,360
Then he turned about and seemed like one
of those who run for the green cloth in

780
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,510
the field at and Luda Cambridge,

781
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,340
an image of a race which is run in Verona.

782
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:33,060
And he seemed not the Roos are among them,
but the winner.

783
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,070
So he leaves with the illusion
that he is a precursor.

784
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:41,730
Is it where you understand what I mean?
That he's in a race.

785
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:46,850
He so far behind everybody else that
he seems not to be ahead of them.

786
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,600
He said,
really behind the one circle that's,

787
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,060
that's the emerge with which
Dante ends this encounter.

788
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,880
Brunetto recommends this treasure,

789
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,120
which was a French text that he wrote
this in an encyclopedia that he wrote in a

790
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,440
while in France and he wrote
it in French so much that, uh,

791
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,030
and it's so important this text,

792
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:12,880
it's one of the most important
encyclopedias in the vernacular.

793
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:17,130
Separate PD is being, I may have, I
even gave you, are I remember you,

794
00:54:17,131 --> 00:54:18,570
I don't expect you to remember it,

795
00:54:18,571 --> 00:54:23,340
but I gave you a definition of the divine
comedy is a poetic encyclopedia in the

796
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:28,110
sense that it tries to gather together
the broken pieces of knowledge of

797
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:30,570
experience.
And at the same time,

798
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:35,130
unlike the technical encyclopedias
such as the Britannica give you,

799
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:40,080
dramatize the presence of someone
who is being educated through them,

800
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:45,150
a process of education. Dante is the
one who is in the middle of learning.

801
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:49,530
So it's an encyclopedia with
a path about how to learn,

802
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:53,280
not the abstract one that
Brunetto had written, uh,

803
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:58,350
but it's written in French and it's, and,
and, and I stress this fact because Ah,

804
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:02,430
elsewhere one of his philosophical who
were refraction's Dante goes on thing

805
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:06,330
that we are all bound by natural
affection for our own language.

806
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:11,440
And because on account of that, there are
those who have, uh, put forth the, uh,

807
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:15,240
the interpretation that
Brunetto is here for the value,

808
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,600
violating the natural bonds
of affection that we have,

809
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:23,780
that human beings have to their own
natural language to their own, uh, uh,

810
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:28,490
mother language, let's call it
that. It could be, it could be. Uh,

811
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,650
but what I think this
is is, uh, a dramatizes,

812
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:36,230
an incredible self delusion
on the part of Brunette.

813
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,060
Here he is dead.

814
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:44,700
He is circling around under the reign
of fire and he thinks he still lived in

815
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:50,250
his own text.
He mistakes first of all,

816
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,080
the symbolic life that he has
within a text with reality.

817
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:58,830
That's a really, that's the first
confusion. That language of images,

818
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,290
the languages of seeming that is running,

819
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:06,630
that pervades this cantor
has to be understood in terms
of this confusion on the

820
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:09,770
part of the unit. Whether it
is more, there is more to it.

821
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:14,450
The mistake that Brunetto
makes is to believe that Dante,

822
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:19,380
Dante's whole life is a replica
of his own. Read my textbooks,

823
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:24,381
whatever it is that you have to know is
already available to you in my own book.

824
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
That is to say he faces the difference
between Dante and himself and Brunetto.

825
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,020
He refuses to see that
Dante's old life can have eh,

826
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,430
it's home development and it's home
destination, which at this national,

827
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:46,140
which she can not understand at all.
So that's the,

828
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:51,100
the end of Canto are 15 this,
this sodomy.

829
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:55,570
Then there's also confusion
between the real and the imaginary,

830
00:56:55,571 --> 00:57:00,571
the way of drawing the real world
and to one of a fictional fictions.

831
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:02,230
And imaginations.

832
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:07,400
That is one scene before I stopped and
give you a chance to ask her a question.

833
00:57:07,401 --> 00:57:10,630
Now we'll go into Canto
16. It's the end. Really.

834
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:13,480
We are reaching the end
of the intermediate area,

835
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,440
the moral or the ground of violence,
which to us of course, may,

836
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:22,180
I don't, I just presumed
that you may be surprised me.

837
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:27,240
We are cultures in full view of violence
really as the worst possible crime,

838
00:57:28,121 --> 00:57:32,530
right? And violence in, in,
uh, uh, in all of its, uh,

839
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,460
its forms and, and uh,
it's, it's expressions,

840
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:41,230
the several psychological,
physical, uh, political and so on.

841
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:46,450
Uh, for dental, the real, the worst crimes
of the crimes of fraud. As you know,

842
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:51,030
this is our bad enough to to be sure,
but the, and that the show is about 20,

843
00:57:51,031 --> 00:57:54,430
enter in,
canto with canto and cantor 17,

844
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:59,380
and he will see a strange failure.

845
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:00,820
Uh,
they are,

846
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:05,200
they have to go over a huge ravine.

847
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,150
There is no way that they can do
this. Uh, but then miraculously,

848
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:14,650
uh, uh, a figure, strange
figure, a monster, uh,

849
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,240
they are the edge of standing at the
edge of the pit. And a, a figure appears.

850
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:24,400
This is the figure of Jerry on that.
At the end of Canto 60,

851
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:27,870
let me read this image of
the figure of Jerry and, uh,

852
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:36,300
Dante will mount on Jerian and, uh, uh,

853
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,640
virtual will sit behind
him and they come in.

854
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:44,410
The descent takes place in three areas
of fraud. So this is the, the, the,

855
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:49,120
these are this, this is a sequence
of happenings in the cantor.

856
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,450
Um, and now let's, let's see
what Anthony says. It's, it's,

857
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:56,000
it's an experience of, uh, uh,

858
00:58:56,030 --> 00:59:01,030
we would even call it wonder in her
ex experience of foremost the sublime,

859
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,930
uh, an infernal sublime. Amen.
This, I'm reading from 16,

860
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:09,040
they'll line one 30, uh,
around around one 30.

861
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:14,041
And following your main should always
closest lips as far as he can to the truth

862
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,150
that has the face of
ally. Oh, that's fraud.

863
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,250
Mixture of truth and deception,
truth and lies.

864
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,300
That's what literature seems
to do. Two though. No. Oh,

865
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:32,450
since without fault.
It brings him shame.

866
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,120
But here I cannot be silent.

867
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:38,660
And by the strains of this comedy is text,

868
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:42,500
this text called comedy.

869
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,480
And this historic moment of an
experience of descent comedy also, uh,

870
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:52,480
captures this, uh, this, this rhetoric
of descent, of lowering oneself.

871
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:57,500
I not just an aesthetic experience.
I swear to the reader.

872
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,760
Another,
the second address to the reader,

873
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:04,100
and you may remember that
we saw one in Canto or nine,

874
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:08,780
and I tried to explain it to you as the
address to the reader as part of the

875
01:00:08,781 --> 01:00:12,620
strategy of authority on the
part of Dante in the measuring,

876
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:15,260
which I need readers
and I may have readers.

877
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:18,080
Then I'm constantly rooted into an author.

878
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:23,370
You understand that that kind of strategic
moves or I swear to the reader that I

879
01:00:24,171 --> 01:00:28,400
saw coming swimming up
to that gross murky air,

880
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,540
a figure,
amazing to the stout as heart.

881
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:37,750
Even as he returns who goes down sometime
to lose the anchor that is called to

882
01:00:37,751 --> 01:00:39,620
the reef or something else.

883
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:44,300
He didn't see stretching
upward and drawing in his feet.

884
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,680
This is the story.

885
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,720
This is the approach of Jerry on what
I want to point out is a number of

886
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:53,540
metaphors here.
This is an aerial journey.

887
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:58,900
Jerian is flapping his wings
and going through the murky air.

888
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,360
Dante describes it as if it were a
journey by see the metaphor he uses his

889
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:07,280
swimming.
I go,

890
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:12,281
I saw come swimming up through the grass
grows and murky and by the way when

891
01:01:13,161 --> 01:01:16,730
Dante's to describe the
story of a mythic sailor,

892
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:21,770
mythic mariner Ulysses whom we are
going to encounter hopefully next week.

893
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,460
I think it's going to be next
week in a or next time the,

894
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:31,630
he describes this journey by CEO of
Ulysses as if it were a journey by air and

895
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:37,991
he does this because for Dante it
doesn't matter how you are traveling,

896
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,540
if you fly or you go by water,

897
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:46,810
it doesn't matter because all journeys
are journeys to the same destination.

898
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:51,500
All journalists are really
journeys to the absolute.

899
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:56,150
He Agera one Samsung to come
to play a ministerial function.

900
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:01,180
He's going to minister to serve Dante and
his guide and at the same time that it

901
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:04,700
says here to there is some
kind of plan here to this.

902
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:07,550
I'm kind of something of the
absolute that I have to see.

903
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,680
So that's the first image.
The second image is this idea of um,

904
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,400
uh, the, the, uh, which will
be described really later.

905
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:21,180
The rotatory movement of
Jerian through the air.

906
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:25,920
And I have been described as the circle,
the spiral, that movement in the spiral,

907
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:30,000
the spiral motion of a all or,

908
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:33,810
or movement in, in, in
fandom. And the third,

909
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:38,811
this is this idea of the
swearing by dontre's own text.

910
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:44,570
That text is given now the
value of a sacred object,

911
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:50,340
something that has, um,
something one can swear by.

912
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,630
If we began with a violation
of the hernia, then canto 13.

913
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:57,180
Now in Canto 16,

914
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:01,410
tell poses to the AENEID
and look to every places.

915
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:05,010
Therefore the new text for us.
It's this common it,

916
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,520
let me stop here and uh,

917
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:10,950
let me see that we have a
few minutes for questions,

918
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:15,690
which I will welcome and tried
to answer about five, 10 minutes.

919
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,770
Yeah, I have a quick thing I want
to clear up. Um, cancer, uh, 13, uh,

920
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,790
at the end when you did let me not
being the artist talking about Augustus,

921
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:32,670
he's referring to Frederick
said the Gusto. Yes. Make sure.

922
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,780
Yeah. The, uh, it's,

923
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:40,080
it's what we call a
typological use of the emperor.

924
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:42,150
The emperor has to be,

925
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,240
it's Augustus or Caesar.

926
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:48,180
These are the two terms used
for the emperor. So it's a type,

927
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:52,140
it's the kind of abstract type
or the czar or the Kaiser,

928
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:56,460
the bowl versions of the Caesar
a myth, you know, I mean,

929
01:03:56,461 --> 01:04:00,960
in more than languages. So, uh,
yeah, that's, it starts this. Yes.

930
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,190
Talk about those people who are guilty.

931
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,370
That gets me off

932
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,880
guilty and bulbous shows

933
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:18,270
over rationality.
They're in the second circle.

934
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:21,420
The sodomites are either the seventh,

935
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:29,020
the difference there because look,
we're serious. Violation of natural law,

936
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:32,190
intellectual choice of near a park.

937
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:37,140
Two engage in behavior,
both intellect,

938
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:42,770
which is much more serious then the
incompetence of the people in the second

939
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:46,784
circle.

940
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:51,780
The question is, uh, um,
uh, mental, uh, have me,

941
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:57,190
uh, think about the relationship between
the centers of lust and the centers of

942
01:04:57,191 --> 01:04:59,680
sodomy. Uh, and uh,

943
01:04:59,681 --> 01:05:03,040
at the premise of the question
is that in the centers of lost,

944
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:08,041
we have a sinners who invert the
order of reason and pleasure.

945
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:09,623
Uh,

946
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:14,350
what has mishandled the question then
is why are the centers of sodomy,

947
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:19,430
uh, placed in Eh, for
the law down in Hell?

948
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,890
And if this is because there's a
question of, uh, intellectual choice,

949
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:28,570
uh, this has been, uh, uh, at
my answer is the following, uh,

950
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,700
that the, uh, no,

951
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:35,990
there's no indication in this
cantos in Canto 15 that uh,

952
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:40,960
the city here, that there is some,
uh, that intellectual perversions.

953
01:05:40,961 --> 01:05:41,800
But you are right.

954
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:47,020
Your question is well taken that all
clinics in the sense of a clinics meaning

955
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:52,021
not just where are we today thing as man
of the cloth but meaning intellectuals,

956
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,310
pressure, uh, are cool shoes. Uh, who is,

957
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,570
who is also mentioned their
famous Seta, uh, of the laws, uh,

958
01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:02,810
then Burrito Latino himself.
Uh,

959
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:07,270
the scene here is a sin of uh,
violence.

960
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,870
Uh, justice. We had the
idea that education,

961
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:15,690
the educators in Canto 12, uh,
those who are, who could, who,

962
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,680
who, uh, what could, could pervert
the very process of teaching.

963
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,540
And just as in canto 13,

964
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:27,780
we had a stoic pf the Levenia is really
a story or a story called now reflects

965
01:06:29,381 --> 01:06:33,920
that suicide is not a virtual and
the virtuous choice. But this, uh,

966
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,800
this has sinners who have veal.
The tool,

967
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:41,430
whether this anger to the,
and the have yield,

968
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:44,680
the tool,
the impulses of violence within them.

969
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:47,380
Dante I think is condemning sodomy.

970
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,250
Cause I think this is also part of the
question you're asking may not be the

971
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:52,084
central part,

972
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:57,260
but because it is whatever there has been
violence connected to their activity,

973
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:03,130
this is the why would he placed them
in, uh, in the circle of violence?

974
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:07,090
Unlike for instance, what
happens to, uh, we the,

975
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:10,240
when it said limb cut in Canto
26 or Caesar, by the way,

976
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:14,350
there's also an illusion to
Caesar in Canto 26 or purgatory.

977
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:19,150
So there's a difference there.
It teacher who uses violence.

978
01:07:19,151 --> 01:07:23,290
So that's the link between teaching
a violence in Canto 12, uh,

979
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,010
the man of a reason,
the story believer in the logos.

980
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:32,460
Uh, and, and, and, and, and, and
the old rule of rationality, uh,

981
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:37,700
are exasperates a principal and believes
that he can be both judge and a and

982
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:43,921
victim at sec executioner and the executed
one and now in Canto 15 is this idea

983
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,810
of, uh, uh, and then the, the,

984
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:52,960
the way in which violence
has taken over and, uh,

985
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,210
and obfuscated the older of rationality.

986
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:00,100
I don't see the element of choice in that.

987
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:03,520
Yes.

988
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,520
Can you maybe discuss how Dante
differentiates various representations of

989
01:08:09,731 --> 01:08:13,820
suicides since Lucretia is in limbo,
died on,

990
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,370
circled the last fall,

991
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:21,230
and then we have [inaudible] who is in
the actual circle of suicide and how is

992
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:26,231
it that he makes the distinction
between where they fall?

993
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:34,170
It's impossible to differentiate within
different forms of suicide since Dante.

994
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:39,410
And that's exactly right.
Exactly true. Done.

995
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:43,980
Do we have Lucretia in limbo?
We have dido in Canto to,

996
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:46,420
among the, the last, last fall,

997
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:50,110
souls will have Cato in purgatory,
et cetera.

998
01:08:50,111 --> 01:08:53,830
And why here in Canto Canto 13,

999
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,230
suicides are punished.

1000
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:00,220
Is there some kind of rationale
that we can see behind the various,

1001
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:03,190
that's a question.
The various forms of suicide.

1002
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:07,100
The answer that I would
give is the following. Um,

1003
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:12,150
Dante know so well that they are the
phenomenology of acts or various acts is

1004
01:09:14,771 --> 01:09:19,771
vast and cannot quite be ever be brought
to one common element so much that the

1005
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:23,440
beginning of Canto 14,
if you turn to canto 14,

1006
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:29,120
Dante's going through the hot
sands because it's, it's, it's,

1007
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:33,520
it's the burning sands of,
of her and he remembered,

1008
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:34,810
he recalls there.

1009
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:39,820
This must be exactly the burning
sands of the Libyan desert,

1010
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:44,830
that Keto Cross, which is a way of
saying, you know, don't be surprised.

1011
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:49,150
I think if you're going to
encounter Cato further down,

1012
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:52,000
I know that you expect them to be here.

1013
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:56,950
So the question is how does Dante
go on determining the particular,

1014
01:09:57,130 --> 01:10:01,660
the value of particular act
when we sin?

1015
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:06,910
This may be a little bit, um, I
have to be very clear about this.

1016
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:13,260
Okay, what did we say? We usually
can say, well, how can it be,

1017
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:16,040
I'm going to give you a kind of,

1018
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,890
I'm going to take a little bit of a
distance from this whole question.

1019
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,110
It's easy to say,

1020
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:27,350
how can Dante be so mmm
ruthless that someone,

1021
01:10:28,681 --> 01:10:33,681
for all we know him have been a good
human being and then the committed one

1022
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:39,221
crime and they are in
hell forever for eternity.

1023
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,160
That on the face of it would seem to be,
uh,

1024
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:48,810
a reasonable query. You know,
it was sort of indirect,

1025
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:50,350
too bleak way of asking for it,

1026
01:10:50,351 --> 01:10:54,460
a little bit more tolerance
and benevolence from this
men who claims to be the

1027
01:10:54,461 --> 01:10:58,100
supreme judge of all human beings have,
uh,

1028
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,420
have been perpetrating. The
fact is the, whenever we sin,

1029
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:03,400
Oh sins had involved,

1030
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:07,540
we think that it's only one
that old sins had involved.

1031
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:12,700
And Dante highlights one specific
aspect in the case of Dido.

1032
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:17,820
Her is more important than in the sense
of more decisive and determines the

1033
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:21,240
character of that figure.
Then the suicide,

1034
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,930
their suicide is seen as
an extension of her loss.

1035
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:27,210
In the case of Lucretia put her in limbo.

1036
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:32,020
That is a wing which Dante really wants
to make that clear distinction and leave

1037
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:35,820
an Antigo stadium.
The stadium moment that look,

1038
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:39,720
creatures virtuals seem to
have been limited as they are.

1039
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,400
She's not saved in any way,

1040
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:46,550
but there is a kind of exemplary
virtual that that allows him to sort of

1041
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,060
remember but not punish her for a crime,

1042
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:55,680
which is really to be understood as
a consequence of an excessive way of

1043
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:57,750
understanding virtual.
You see what I'm saying?

1044
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,960
In the case of Cato and we are going to
see that he sees the sacrifice of self

1045
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:08,160
for freedom. That's really the, the, the,

1046
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,380
the great understanding.

1047
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:14,310
Keto dies for the sake
of freedom and the whole,

1048
01:12:14,311 --> 01:12:16,350
the Canto purgatory is a riff.

1049
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:20,970
The cantor one of authority is a
reflection on the question of freedom,

1050
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,070
Roman freedom.
And by the way,

1051
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,910
the biblical Jewish understanding
of freedom of to, you know,

1052
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:28,610
I'm preparing you for that Canto.

1053
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,280
So maybe I'll save myself the trouble
of repeating these things when we get

1054
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,260
there. Dante, we'll talk about, uh, uh,

1055
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:39,870
Roman freedom through Keto in
the military. After, uh, uh,

1056
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:45,830
the troop of angels will arrive and
they sing one song which is in exit to

1057
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:47,221
Israel.

1058
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:52,221
The Egypt wishes is to say the
Jewish are this famous psalm one 13,

1059
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:55,110
a psalm of David.

1060
01:12:55,111 --> 01:12:58,980
When David is reflecting
about the epic of Exodus,

1061
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:00,443
the lyrical,

1062
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:05,520
lyrical reflection I party idea that
caring from Egypt on the way to to

1063
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,270
Jerusalem was,

1064
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:14,280
which only some got two friends Moses
never did is really a quest for freedom.

1065
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:15,960
So they are two ideas of free,

1066
01:13:15,961 --> 01:13:20,610
not political or civil freedom and
the theological idea of freedom.

1067
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:25,770
And that's really the key to understanding
the Cato and understanding the way

1068
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:28,500
Dante connects these two traditions,

1069
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,350
the Roman and the Jewish traditions.

1070
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,813
Other questions?

1071
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:42,070
We have one minute and the tape
probably last about 45 seconds.

1072
01:13:43,670 --> 01:13:47,240
So we get the question or answer
questions.

1073
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,670
Seems like you're saying here that

1074
01:13:55,070 --> 01:14:00,070
Dante is almost finding a kind of sand
when virtue is taken into your next

1075
01:14:00,231 --> 01:14:05,180
steps. Yes. You can go too far.

1076
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:08,600
You can be too obsessed
with a certain yes.

1077
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:11,560
Misdirection of virtue.

1078
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,360
Yes. It's not a question,
but it was, I said yes, yes.

1079
01:14:16,361 --> 01:14:21,100
And I would agree. The port, the,
the, the reflection is, it seems,

1080
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:26,080
I don't like that it seems
that I'm saying, but I'm
saying that actually, that,

1081
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:31,080
um, uh, that, that, uh,
uh, in Dante, Dante,

1082
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:31,450
uh,

1083
01:14:31,450 --> 01:14:36,320
views the access of virtual
also are as part of something,

1084
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:40,990
part of the sin is sin. And I
would agree with agree. Yes.

1085
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,850
Okay. Thank you. We'll see you next time.
