1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,260
Uh, we're gonna look at 27, uh,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,940
28 and 29 today of Paradise.
Ah, three candles that,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,460
uh,
uh,

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,190
really I think Dante Constructs
together and where Dante puts home,

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,970
puts forth this theory of
creation and cosmology tool,

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,400
which are not the quite the same thing.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,110
A theater Beatrice that's
explaining the shape of the cosmos.

8
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,520
It's very difficult,
uh, three cancers. Um,

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,710
but it's done in such a way that, uh, uh,

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,410
there are two different things
you'd seem creation and,

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,140
and a physical description
of the customers,

12
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:50,760
which we call cosmology and they're
abusing the Dante's dealing with two forms

13
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:54,990
of the universe, a spiritual one. And the
physical one I'm going to show all of,

14
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,570
of,

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,570
of this is as we go over the
three cantos but I would,

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,170
I would like to argue that in effect
they are not quite the same thing,

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,000
but not really all that distinct.

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,200
There's a very tenuous line separating.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,700
The two of them were, where are we first
of all in the, in the, in, in space,

20
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,840
we are somewhere in space.
Dante has gone past now. Uh,

21
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,250
the haven't really fixed
stars with, uh, the, the, uh,

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,210
the examination of the
three, uh, the three words,

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,120
the three terms,
the foundations of,

24
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,180
of things that we experience as trust
or we experience as existential hope or,

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,830
uh,
a love that if you combine it,

26
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,400
it's always implies always
not northern Canto 26,

27
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,900
but possibilities of
betrayal, uh, uncertainty.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,790
Uh, so it, it, it,

29
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,791
it combines both a faith and
hope in a very programmatic way,

30
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,500
but Canto 27th and to
continues, uh, with, uh, uh,

31
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:08,530
in the, in the afterglow of, uh, the, the,

32
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,240
the fixed stars, Eh, and the candle.
Just to give you an idea about how,

33
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,300
what,
what formerly is happening here.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,440
The first part of the Canto really
looks back formerly at Kantar 27 of in

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:28,440
fairness, there is clearly a parallel
between the two candles here. Dante,

36
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,600
you remember what he does?
He meets Saint Peter Actually,

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,260
who has been examining him.

38
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,280
But now after the examination of
the three theological virtues,

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,520
he goes on in a prophetic denunciation.

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,120
He denounces the collusion
between, uh, the,

41
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:51,990
his place. He says, my
place, it's the papacy,

42
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,600
the place instituted by, because
of him. He's the Peter, he's the,

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,830
the stone and his successors.
That's the way it sounds.

44
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,100
So the Canto literally looks backwards.
Uh,

45
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,720
and the parallel with human hair for
a number of parallels with, uh, uh,

46
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,750
in fair 19 where Dante meets,
are you remember the,

47
00:03:11,751 --> 00:03:13,680
the pope's where,
uh,

48
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,760
turned upside down and the flames,
the kind of, the pattern of the,

49
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:23,680
of the Pentecostal fires?
I don't there the plants have their feet,

50
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,580
but this is more clearly a reference
to come to 27 of in fair where,

51
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,680
uh, this is the, uh, the
very beginning. This is a,

52
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,360
there is a him our canto 27 glory be
to the father, the son, et cetera.

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,190
And then, uh, uh, lines
40 and following, uh,

54
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:46,840
we have, uh, uh, this, uh, um, this,

55
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,460
this great,
great attack.

56
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,930
It was not our meaning 45 that are on
the right hand of our successors should

57
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:56,260
sit one part of Christ evil.
And on the other, on the left,

58
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:00,310
not that the keys which were committed
to me, it should become the device.

59
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,550
On a standard for warfare on the baptized
know that I should be the figure on a

60
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:10,621
seal for sold and lying favors for which
I often redden and flash with fire.

61
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,990
This is the fire of prophecy
without a doubt. But it's also, Eh,

62
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,160
retrospectively,
uh,

63
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,260
a reference to the attack against
the Barnabas who encountered 27.

64
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:29,050
We've be fair. No, it
showed as he is in, uh,

65
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,730
colluding with, uh, uh, the, the,
we do the Montefeltro you remember?

66
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,920
So there is a clear, uh, okay.

67
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:40,180
It's a clear symmetry
between the two candles. Uh,

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,500
I will,
uh,

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,520
has and to add that came to 27 is also
has a kind of castic structure because at

70
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:49,660
one point,

71
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,370
just to give you this as a
formal description of what's
happening here a little

72
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,790
later, um, after this outburst by Peter,

73
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,393
uh,

74
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,210
Beatrice and the pilgrim
move on to the next heaven,

75
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,040
which is around, uh, uh,

76
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,070
line 75 and following the next heaven
is the so called Crista lean heaven,

77
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,470
which is still material. He said the
boundary of the material universe,

78
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,680
it's still material, but it's very, uh,
exactly crystal light. It's a very, uh,

79
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,560
thin materiality, almost,
almost, but not quite spiritual.

80
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,240
It's also called the premium
more Beta because it's here.

81
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,410
This is the technical term that they
get it see that in, in this heaven.

82
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,630
Then we have problems of
origins, the origin of time, uh,

83
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,980
the origin of a space. Uh,
Dante goes on giving this,

84
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,780
Beatrice goes on giving this cosmological
description of the universe in

85
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:57,680
material terms, uh, and here
to continue with the formal,

86
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,510
uh, the, the, the question, the issue
of form. Now, uh, I one point B,

87
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:07,370
it says, wait, look behind you
so that you can have an idea.

88
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,430
You can measure the enormous distance
you have traveled from the earth.

89
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:17,240
He said the boundary of the material
cosmos, and you might say, well,

90
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,550
he's at the edge of the cosmos.
He's going to fall off.

91
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,960
And that it was always one
of the objections about the
idea of the finiteness of

92
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,270
the cosmos, which I believe
it or not, the 17th century,

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,440
we'll never really far off because the
university is, is fear. So the only,

94
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,600
the only place he has to go to
is, uh, is bad. There's no, uh,

95
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
literally edge.

96
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,750
Every point is the edge and every point
is in a continuous spherical curve.

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,930
But anyway, from the point of view, oh,
he said he's arriving there. So she says,

98
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,090
look back,
and what does he see?

99
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:52,030
And this is the line from the time when
I had listed on this is 27 line, uh,

100
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,860
75 from the time when I had looked before,

101
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,680
I saw that I had moved
through the whole arc.

102
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,470
That's the language of this
fear. Now, circle an arc.

103
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:05,500
It's just gives you an idea
of Ferris [inaudible], uh,

104
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,010
from the middle to the end of this rose
climb. So that I saw on the one hand,

105
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,600
beyond caddies,
the Med track of Ulysses,

106
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:20,230
she just sits the pinpoints that the
little place where you racist trespass,

107
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:23,000
the boundaries of the world,
of the,

108
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,300
of the Euclidean space he had a,

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,240
for which he has has been them, the
encanto 26 of infanticide, Suzy,

110
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,940
this is what we call a cosmos
and other one's 26 and 27.

111
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,470
We do see that 26 at our illusion, uh, to,

112
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,590
to Ulysses and Adam, right?
Which we talked about about, uh,

113
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,970
this figures and here in 27, uh, and,

114
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:50,280
and in 27 of her there is [inaudible].

115
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,760
And then in paradise 27,
uh,

116
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,030
there is this and there is also a kind of,
uh,

117
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,070
this is Ulysses.
So there's a sort of castic structure.

118
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,030
27,

119
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,030
paradise refers to the sex of
Paradise and refers also to 27 of,

120
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:14,930
uh, of, of inferno and
26 of [inaudible]. So,

121
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,770
and the question is, why does
Dante pinpoint, once again,

122
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,020
Ulysses he sees at the West the
point which you list his head,

123
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:28,830
uh, had trespassed and he
calls it they're mad track. Uh,

124
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:31,610
the math track of Ulysses,
uh,

125
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,670
clearly a counter Ulysses is still part
of this fascination that it exerts an

126
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:42,530
incredible fascination on the imagination
of the poet and the pilgrim. Uh,

127
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:46,670
my, like, you resist or am I going
to be lost now? Like you're racist.

128
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,810
But at the same time,

129
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:52,430
it's a way of hinting at
how much he has exceeded.

130
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,180
You. Listen, as adventure, he will.

131
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,710
This is only one pass the
pillars of Hercules. He,

132
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Dante is now at the outer most boundary
of the visible physical universe.

133
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:09,960
So there's a way in which
there is a little bit of a
detachment and yet, uh, uh,

134
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,310
a constant fascination.

135
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:15,810
We tried to explain why he's so fascinated
with the results. At the other end,

136
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,920
he also sees,

137
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,190
and on the other nearly to the shore
where a roper made herself a sweet burden.

138
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,780
This is really the eastern part of
the, the, the known world Europe,

139
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,700
uh,
uh,

140
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,730
the rape of Europa by Jupiter so that
we really have a term and neurotic

141
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:39,970
transgression and an intellectual
transgression as if the two are now,

142
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:43,500
once again, are involved
in this, uh, in this, in,

143
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:48,120
in a Dante's vision as if he's now
coming to the point where knowledge and

144
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:52,870
desire really have to coincide.
He's come to the point where, uh,

145
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,890
the beautiful in the good are one
at the point where all of the great,

146
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,720
uh,
uh,

147
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,940
contraries and distinctions that we have
been pursuing all along merely have to

148
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:09,450
go on, are converging. Let
me continue with this idea.

149
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:13,870
This is before I go on
with what happens in, uh,

150
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,020
in the Canto Canto, uh, Dante
moves into the Primo Marbella,

151
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,280
which is the place where, uh,
this, I, I continue with this. The,

152
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,880
uh, uh, he goes on, um,

153
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,930
a lined 100,
um,

154
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,090
the goal into the swiftest part of heaven.
That's the premium mobile.

155
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,370
All motion begins from here.
Uh,

156
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,540
Dante is moving from what
would seem to be an ethical,

157
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,960
the ethical seen,
the denunciation,

158
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,640
Peter's denunciation of the abuses within
the church that's done in a prophetic

159
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:54,150
tone, but also from a
tone, a tone of ethical,

160
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,850
the ethical language.
Uh, he goes into the,

161
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,530
the so called premorbid,
which actually is

162
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,480
the heaven of metaphysics. You'll have
been telling you about the grammar,

163
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,720
rhetoric, music, geometry. This is
what we call the heaven of metaphysics.

164
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,920
And you know what that is, right? You,
you understand what metaphysics means?

165
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:20,820
It's a, um, Dante refers to
it as they did refer to it.

166
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:25,821
Harris total refers to it as the first
philosophy and the cold it first because

167
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,980
it rains rules supreme among goal,
the arts and all the sides.

168
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,650
It's the most important of
the sciences is the point.

169
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,710
It's the point of arrival of all the
sciences and it's cold first philosophy.

170
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,690
Um,

171
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,850
because it explains also questions of
origins and you'll see the language of

172
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:51,660
origins or the origin of time.
The original space creation itself,

173
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:55,420
the beginning of the world causes
foundations. These are the,

174
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,600
this is the Great Rome that
metaphysics discusses. Dan Can,

175
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,850
interesting thing is that in the Middle
Ages and Dante so connected with physics,

176
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:06,580
physics, he says a metaphysical
really go hand in hand.

177
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:10,800
One tries to give the explanation of
the physical world and McAfee physics,

178
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,590
the theoretical general rules.
In fact,

179
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,290
and this is probably where
I should mention this,

180
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,360
there are people who
believe that metaphysics,

181
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,440
metaphysics was not a term that
really indicated that anything,

182
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,680
uh,
really different,

183
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,480
a completely different from the, the,
the knowledge that physics provides,

184
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,950
they will say that was metaphysics.

185
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,250
Metaphysics was called
metaphysics because the,

186
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,630
the book was placed on the shelf a
little bit after the book on physics.

187
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:44,680
You see what I mean? It was really
more a way of defining the POC,

188
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,210
the place of the book. On the
library, so to speak. It's probably,

189
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,820
uh, but it was, was known as that,

190
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:55,150
but it's probably more of a
fiction then a than anything else.

191
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:59,680
The fact is that there is such a science
for Dante that deals with causes,

192
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,800
origins, beginnings, time, uh,

193
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,400
etc. One of the things are here
we have, it's uh, uh, the Dante's,

194
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,540
uh,
the Beatrice Psas describing line 100,

195
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,510
the nature of the university
as she plays the cosmologist,

196
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,810
which holes the center still
and moves all else around.

197
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,560
It begins here. So this is already
the beginnings. It literally,

198
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:28,561
the language of beginnings here
begins motion is Dante stands,

199
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,580
uh, uh, then at the boundary
of the physical universe.

200
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:37,680
And now she gives an explanation of
this. He said, he said, the boundary, uh,

201
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,420
and this heaven has no other hardware,
place questions,

202
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,860
but the divine mind, the real
beginning, the, the, the, the,

203
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,930
the real universe is in God's minds.
Okay?

204
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,240
So he distinguishes two worlds.

205
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:57,970
The physical world was he
and the spiritual world,

206
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:02,140
which is in God's mind in a way
and test to make it very simple.

207
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,820
Dante is journeying into the mind of God.

208
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,110
There is one man who had written a
text Bonaventure whom you have seen,

209
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:12,790
whom you have met before.

210
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,090
And he wrote this book called the
itinerary of their mind into God.

211
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,860
It is, uh, the way of trying to explore,

212
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,250
to enter mystically enter the mind of God.

213
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,440
Dante doesn't do it in a mystical way.

214
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:34,441
He tries to understand what's what's
beyond the physical world to give the

215
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,430
description of this universe.

216
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,640
This is the term that keeps reappearing
in the next three cantos light and love.

217
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:47,080
Enclose it in a circle as it does
the others and of the garden.

218
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,650
He that [inaudible] is this whole
intelligence, this premier mobility.

219
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,950
It really is a kind of a curve that
wraps up all the other heavens.

220
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,590
We have seen, this is the ninth heaven.
All the other heavens have been, uh,

221
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,570
uh, our, our enwrapped wrapped within it.
But it's not only a boundary, Dante views,

222
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:13,280
it is also the beginning of the
threshold for the spiritual universe.

223
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,181
Okay?

224
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:19,100
It's both the boundary of the physical
world and it's always also the,

225
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,780
so it goes like this.
This is the earth

226
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,460
and goes growing, et cetera. And
then when we come to the ninth,

227
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,063
hm.

228
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,380
This becomes at the same time,

229
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,123
yeah.

230
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:41,720
Uh, kind of convex and
concave a semi circle. I have,

231
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,060
believe it or not,
a shape of what I think is not this cosmo.

232
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,230
And here it is. This is a, this is, I'm
going to pass it around. This is a shell,

233
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,150
but it's actually really made it seem
cooler and found this would be the,

234
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,990
uh,
the it Auntie and they explain a,

235
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:04,010
there'll spirals really like, uh, um,

236
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,110
the f since Dante thinks of the cosmos
is a book and we will call it a cosmo

237
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:15,750
book. That's if that's a neurologist
that I coined here. Now, uh,

238
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,430
it kind of cosmo book the
book in the shape of a cosmos.

239
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,930
It's really a parchment or
rolled up within itself. Yeah.

240
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,860
You know what I parchments how
and medieval in medieval, uh,

241
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,080
in classical ideas of,
um, of the production,

242
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,570
the material production of books.
We have the ancient parchments,

243
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,590
which are all rolled up
well, like, like Ah, ah,

244
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,090
the term is around a steak and
then held together by a ring.

245
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,520
That's really the,
the shape.

246
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,530
It's [inaudible] production of books that
in the history of the book is Le later

247
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,640
replaced around the fourth century.
But this whole called Codex,

248
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,740
which we have for instance,
even in Binaca, a codex has, uh,

249
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,350
it's made of uh, uh, quartos.

250
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,770
It's made of folios and on divided
like a book today made of a,

251
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,570
ah,
ha would have quarters folios.

252
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,380
If you go and see the
Shakespeare's, uh, the, the, the,

253
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:19,490
the folios of Shakespeare in the
Erisa beaten club. For instance,

254
00:17:19,491 --> 00:17:24,200
if they let you go in or you belong there,
take a look and see what f uh,

255
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,480
the, the, uh, they call x release.

256
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,020
[inaudible] seems to be combining
the two folds. But anyway,

257
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:31,930
you have an idea here of,
uh,

258
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,090
what the shape that I'm
trying to describe to you.

259
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:39,080
Is there a kind of, uh, um,

260
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,270
if you wish there are spirals,

261
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,830
a one following the other and next to it,

262
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,130
that is going to be a spiritual universe.
Now the universe,

263
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,950
which we'll come to in a
moment, so this is the, the,

264
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:57,360
the first description that she's giving,
the idea of the spirituality of space.

265
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:01,880
That's the one thing. The spaces
fair equal, uh, and uh, has,

266
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,950
has the premium mobility as a boundary.

267
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,340
And now we have an be a
discourse on explaining it's
motion is not determined by

268
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,200
another's. This is line one 12. But
from it, the rest of the measures,

269
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,230
everything begins here. This is, uh,

270
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,500
the physical beginning of the universe,

271
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,160
which we inhabit even as 10 from
half and the fifth. In other words,

272
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:30,660
it's as sure as it is the
two plus five make, make 10.

273
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,040
And how time should have its roots
in that vessel and in the others.

274
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,143
It's leaves,

275
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,300
may not be playing to the
even time begins here time,

276
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,810
uh, is understood then by
Dante. Uh, do you see what the,

277
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,990
is as a kind of a tree growing from a pot,

278
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,690
that part of eternity?
Uh,

279
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,620
he does not understand time
in a linear way. You know,

280
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:02,460
the guy has a beginning and an end.

281
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,990
It's not the wheel of time. You,
you heard or the wheel of becoming,

282
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,310
you may have heard this.

283
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:11,460
Have you heard this description about
the wheel of becoming in which this is a

284
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:15,810
platonic idea of time where all
things are contained. Dante,

285
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:19,920
things of a tree, a of time
as a tree. The roots are,

286
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:24,921
which are in the part of eternity and the
foliages are in reach us in reach into

287
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:31,260
our own world.
We are in the shadow of the tree of time.

288
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,470
We only see leaves that were fall because
this idea of the dispersion and the

289
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:43,470
falling of time, the passing of
time. So this is, uh, uh, the, the,

290
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,860
uh,
the definition of what happens in 27.

291
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,270
So she continues after a while
with this about once again,

292
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:55,260
the language of covetousness
and uh, and, and, uh,

293
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,760
moral language about,
uh, the, um, what, uh,

294
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,620
happens in, uh, in the world.

295
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,480
And we move on to Canto 28.
Just some tell you,

296
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,740
uh, I have not forgotten that we are
talking about Ulysses in a little while.

297
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,040
And uh,

298
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,220
so now it continues with a 28
deals with the angelic hierarchy.

299
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,500
We are now still in the premium mobility.
Um,

300
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,850
but we Dante's that seeing into the
other universe, the spiritual universe,

301
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,530
and he sees a university which is
adjacent to the physical universe,

302
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,610
uh, with, uh, inhabited by angels.

303
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,200
And so that their corresponding parts,
you have the nine planets,

304
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,680
the seven planets, Pacific
stars, and the crystal in heaven.

305
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,820
And now you have the nine olders of
angels and Beatrice will go on describing

306
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,500
the v, the three triads of
angels, angels, archangels,

307
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,040
Thrones, you know, the, this is the
language that comes from the Bible.

308
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,900
The old testament comes from Babylonian,
a pedant in Persian sources,

309
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:09,250
apocalyptic sources. And it
will not seem to be really, uh,

310
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,690
really terribly different from
that, from that, that tradition.

311
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,280
And here,
uh,

312
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,870
we have also another way before this
whole description of the angelic holder

313
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,140
continues.
And when I turned line 12,

314
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:27,160
let me just focus on this a bit and when
I turned again and mind were made by

315
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:31,420
what appears in that revolving sphere
to one that looks intently on it's

316
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:35,860
circling,
I saw a point distance.

317
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,550
So we are a deep at the boundary of the
universe and other universes of merges

318
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:40,384
into view.

319
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,830
And Dante only sees a point
which radiated alight.

320
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:49,831
So keen that the eye on which at
Burns must close for it's piercing,

321
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,850
piercing power. Uh, so once again,

322
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,400
a series of revolving spheres,
uh,

323
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,180
this universe is not the
projection of the other university.

324
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,690
They are separate and adjacent.

325
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,400
There are two hemispheres and
this is what happens in a,

326
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,390
in Canto 28,

327
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,510
28 and we go to Ken to 29 and I ask you
to see how the whole argument continues.

328
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,640
Beatrice has been explaining breathlessly
the whole question of angelic

329
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,260
hierarchy.
And by the end of Canto 28,

330
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,670
he sees a,
she even mentioned that the older,

331
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,990
actually it's Dante here who mentioned
that the older his ordering of angels is

332
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
how the hierarchy is very different from
the one of the pseudo dialyzers line

333
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,380
one 30.
He says,

334
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,260
this orders all gays above and so prevail
below the Laurel drone and all drove

335
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:49,690
to God.

336
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,610
And ionizers set himself as such a zeal
to contemplate this is the sooner the

337
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,930
United years who had written about
the angelic hierarchy and dance.

338
00:22:57,931 --> 00:23:02,680
It goes on to say that he defers
from him, that he just, uh, his,

339
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:07,681
his idea of angels is a little different
from his and Pope Gregory's a statement

340
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:12,310
of his own intellectual independence,
uh,

341
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:17,340
both in terms of a theologian and in
terms of an ecclesiastical authority.

342
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,813
Um,

343
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,910
and then Beatrice finishes the description
of this higher meaning the sacred

344
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,760
order.
That's what the Greek word means.

345
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:32,570
The Sacred Order of angelic, uh, uh,

346
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,380
the, the intelligences, the
function is to impart motion, uh,

347
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,740
to this fears.

348
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,950
Their function is to move between
the divinity in human beings.

349
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,010
They are messengers.

350
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:51,011
They the keep their spiritual entities
and they keep moving between God and uh,

351
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,140
and,
and the human beings.

352
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,020
And then we went to canter 29 where
now the language of cosmology,

353
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,670
but the order of the
cosmos becomes creation.

354
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,260
And I want to to show
this to you however this,

355
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:11,060
this shift to the language of creation
is conducted in an extraordinarily

356
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:16,061
interesting way that wants to say that
Beatrice has been talking nonstop about,

357
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,600
we've probably been a touch of playfulness
about the angelic hoarders and then

358
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:28,271
she moves almost right without catching
her breath talking about creation cantor

359
00:24:29,721 --> 00:24:34,721
29 but look how this shift from the order
of angels to the order of creation is

360
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:38,804
described.

361
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,840
This is the beginning of Canto 29 when
the two children of Latona covered by the

362
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,740
regime and by the scales both at once,

363
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:50,690
make a belt of the horizon.

364
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:57,820
As long as from the moment when the zenith
holds them balanced till the one and

365
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:02,831
the other changing hemisphere are
imbalanced from that girdle for so long,

366
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,780
her face illumined with a smile.

367
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,050
Beatrice kept silence looking fixedly
at the point that had overcome me.

368
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,410
What an extraordinary image.
Let's read it again. So we are,

369
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:18,830
make sure that we understand that
because I'm not sure that it's very clear

370
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,180
though. I think it's, I
can make it clear, but the,

371
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,290
let's look at this again.

372
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:27,380
When the two children of Latona
meaning the Sun and the moon,

373
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,750
that's really what he's saying.
Um,

374
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,870
he has to describe the fact that
Beatrice seems not to have kept quiet,

375
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,570
that she went endlessly
from one thing to another.

376
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:43,520
That's what I call the playfulness
of Dante's, uh, uh, thinking. Uh,

377
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,240
and he saying that there was,

378
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,300
this is the image that he uses is when
the two children of Latona a Paulo and

379
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:56,880
Diana, you know that the sun
and the moon were in the,

380
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,550
in the universe of those vantage using
mythical language. Look at the language.

381
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:02,384
First of all,

382
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,560
the two children are Latona myth covered
by the ram and the scales science both

383
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:12,830
at once make a belt of the horizon and
Arabic word meaning the boundary of the

384
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:15,200
heavens. So Science, scientific language,

385
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,800
as long as from the moment when
the zenith scientific language,

386
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,650
the mixture and balancing
of Science and myth, uh,

387
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,380
but also way of talking about the,

388
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,160
a balance that is as vanishing and
there's fleeting as it could ever be.

389
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:36,260
That's the point that there was silence,

390
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:41,261
but he could almost not even tell that
there was a break in Beatrice's speech.

391
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,340
This is where she is he saying,
uh, when the two children of, uh,

392
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,830
of Latona the sun or a Polo and the moon,

393
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,370
they, Anna, uh, along the horizon,

394
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,260
they seem to be aligned together
and are held together by the zenith.

395
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,100
This is the zenith, the highest point
as opposed to the neither. Right?

396
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,550
So this is the balance that he's
describing that kept in a violin,

397
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,910
in a balance, in a, in a,

398
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,890
in a ray equilibrium when they
appear team to be aligned together.

399
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:21,750
And that balance in equilibrium is,
is quickly disappearing.

400
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,830
What is he saying?
He's saying the ship almost wins,

401
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,110
didn't stop speaking and then she began
and she goes home with the theory of,

402
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,880
uh, of creation. I tell Nora
ask what you would hear for.

403
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:36,600
I have seen it.

404
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,600
There were every [inaudible] and every
quando center place I've seen at a point

405
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:42,690
where place,

406
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,700
space and time coincide not
to gain a good for himself,

407
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:48,840
which cannot be,

408
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,110
but that's his splendor shining back
might say I stay in subsystem and he said,

409
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:58,330
turn it to beyond time.
Beyond every other bound is priest him.

410
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,540
The Turner Rov revealed
himself in new loves. Uh,

411
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,840
I have to correct my good friend,

412
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,880
dear old friends and Claire because
actually Dante does not say,

413
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,040
uh, that uh, the uh, he says, uh, uh,

414
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,540
love the Turner love actually the
language he uses. I don't know the,

415
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,400
I hope you are other installation,
social use,

416
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:28,401
other translations that are luckier
opened itself in new loves open itself.

417
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,950
It's, I take this to be um, uh,

418
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:39,660
sexual language as it can be.
Found a new love in gendered,

419
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,900
you know, opened itself
into new loves. It's,

420
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,440
and then in fact it continues
not before they realize it.

421
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:49,080
We're in earth for until
God's moving upon the waters.

422
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,090
There was no before or after,
before God's creation.

423
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,550
The language is biblical from Genesis.

424
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:59,250
There was no before and
or after in the physics.

425
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,980
This is an illusion to Aristotle's physics
when we're Iris told her is to define

426
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,360
time. He says it's the measure. Uh,

427
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,500
we speak of time when there is an a
before and an after because this is really

428
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:17,080
what time is the measure
of motion of motion.

429
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,560
A regard for a before and an after.

430
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,390
Dante says that before this time of
creation, there was no such a thing.

431
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,850
There was a, there was that it could
not be distinguished before, uh,

432
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:30,030
in terms of a of time, there was no
such a thing as before and after.

433
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,160
And then he goes on just to continue
with his sexual metaphor, foreman matter,

434
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,500
United and separate came into
being that had no defect,

435
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,910
like three arrows from a three string.
Paul,

436
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,570
that question of creation as a coming
together of form and matter is here.

437
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,730
Describe this juncture with,

438
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,730
since the language of creation
takes place as an act of love.

439
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,470
That's the first thing Beatrice is saying
and creation comes through as passion

440
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,340
and love. Passion. It's
an opening up in love,

441
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:04,390
opening up in new loves
and it's as physical,

442
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,530
the language of creation is,
could it would ever be. It's as,

443
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,480
as in terms of the natural,

444
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:13,600
the language of natural
production and reproduction.

445
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,560
This is the context of what
she saying before and after.

446
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,840
It is a safe to heavy creation.

447
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:23,200
Creation is that which in introduces

448
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,740
introduces the possibility
of distinguishing between
a before and then after

449
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,130
introduces a difference.
That's, that's what, uh,

450
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,250
the,
the language of Beatrice is,

451
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,100
let me go back to the image
with which we started.

452
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,233
Dante

453
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,510
is wondering whether or not there was
any break in Barrett's reaches speech and

454
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:52,130
he says that they,
there was a break.

455
00:30:52,131 --> 00:30:57,131
It was so fleeting as happens with
whenever the sun and the moon along the,

456
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,780
the line of the horizon are going to be,
are aligned together.

457
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,700
And it is as if they are balanced and
held together by a, the zenith above.

458
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,450
And that is such a fleeting moment
in the alignment of the stars.

459
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,230
Why this metaphor?
Not only his saying that,

460
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,020
but I think that is also
an illusion to be it to,

461
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:23,140
I'm sorry Francesca here in Canto
five did you catch it where he says,

462
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,130
ah, for so long her face illumined
with a smile be it is kept silence.

463
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,500
She,
she just kept kept on talking,

464
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,510
looking fixedly at the
point that had overcome me.

465
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,070
The point that had overcome me is clearly
an allusion to per only a point was

466
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,120
that overcame us. Francesca
says in Canto five. Okay.

467
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,190
That's also there's an
illusion to Francesca.

468
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,160
The question that I have to
answer that I raised with us,

469
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,430
why is Dante mentioning this to inferno
figures and framing his discussion on

470
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,450
cosmology creation?

471
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,560
First of all by talking about Ulysses
and now talking about or alluding to,

472
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,270
not even mentioning, but alluding
to Francesca, why this fit?

473
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,320
One Who wants to transgress and trespass
the boundaries of the world in order to

474
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:17,270
know the other one who chance dresses,

475
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:21,290
the norms of what is
allowed because of love,

476
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:26,510
knowledge and love somehow come into
play but they're in the inferno version.

477
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,520
What is he saying though with this image?
Why this is talked about Francesca,

478
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,770
the uh,
the sun and the moon aligned briefly.

479
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:41,860
What do you think he's saying?
It's not a rhetorical question.

480
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,230
Let me just,
what,

481
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,730
why do you think he would use this kind
of language immediately after Beatrice

482
00:32:47,731 --> 00:32:52,320
goes on explaining the creation of the
world and the distinction between the

483
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:55,750
before and then after.
Why this metaphor,

484
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,290
but this long paragraph,
this image here,

485
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,873
anybody,

486
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,760
I think that Donthe is asking right here.

487
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,700
Is it possible to localize a break?

488
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,030
And he's saying,
if this is when we speak,

489
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,980
the thing seems to be continuous and your
justice in every syllable between the

490
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:27,310
sound and another,
that is always an interval.

491
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:32,490
So that was in the language of Beatrice
and that's what to him is the idea of

492
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,263
creation.

493
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,620
It seems to be there is the opposite of
creation will be determinative of the

494
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:42,010
world. Something which would be
that the universe is eternal.

495
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,240
It has no beginning and no identifier.

496
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:49,350
You Bilbray I think you'll tell
if the universe is eternal,

497
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,190
you have no differences in, in
inside it dump. It wants to say,

498
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,990
it seems to be a continuous,
uh,

499
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,030
the university was to
pay continues extension

500
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,440
without time. It kind of
return it, it goes on and on.

501
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,600
And yet it says when we speak
that you can identify the break.

502
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,530
There was however minute
there was a break between,

503
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,900
reaches a exposition about the angelic
holders and now the exposition that she

504
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:23,080
goes into about the,
uh,

505
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,040
about creation and why then the
other two methods for them. Now,

506
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,990
now it's time to answer the question. Why?
Talking to him through Ulysses and uh,

507
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,010
and Francesca, why you vote
those two images. Um, the,

508
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:39,250
I wish we could, uh, uh,

509
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,910
I have to keep that hanging a while
so can be become a little bit more

510
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:48,190
compelling. What I'm going
to tell you. So with it, uh,

511
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,810
[inaudible] now this is, uh, uh,
and this erase shines. This Dante,

512
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,340
Beatrice is continuing with form
and matter United and separate.

513
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,960
This is conjoined, impure,
pure, and conjoin. He says,

514
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,090
and this Henry Schein's into
glass or amber or crystal.

515
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:07,990
So that's from it coming to its
completeness. That is no interval.

516
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,790
So that a threshold,

517
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,020
a threefold creation flush into being
from its load load all at once without

518
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,620
distinction.

519
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,420
And it's beginning with it all that was
created and ordained for the spirit.

520
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,420
And these were the summit of the universe
in whom was produced pure act two,

521
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:27,490
a part NC and so on. So, uh,

522
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,510
the idea is that there is
a universal creation, uh,

523
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,710
the University of creation, which seems
to be very much like the physical world.

524
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,360
It's described in physical
terms, the terms of, of uh, uh,

525
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,490
the moon and um, sexuality, uh,

526
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,040
the cosmological language
in scientific terms.

527
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,340
And yet there is some kind of a difference
that is introduced without creation.

528
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,810
We will not have difference,
would not even have origins.
That's the language. Now,

529
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:02,450
why those two figures,
why you listen and um, uh,

530
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,820
Julissa's and, and, and, and, and
Francesca, you [inaudible] uh,

531
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,790
I think that what Dante's doing

532
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,740
finally is allowing us to see what the
world of inferno has to be seen as the

533
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,870
wilderness [inaudible].
We,

534
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,160
we only saw as a world rejected as a world
of evil and horror all of a sudden is

535
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:32,121
now retrieved as the best exemplar of
what we may come to know of the spiritual

536
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:35,010
world.

537
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,010
It is almost an imaginative redemption
that Dante goes into about the actual

538
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:44,490
idea of, uh, of her. He's implying.

539
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,540
And that could become
in many ways heretical.

540
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:52,710
But I hope to show you that
it is not that, that, uh,

541
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:57,840
the universe as it goes back,
it's one goes back to the beginnings.

542
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,981
Clearly,

543
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:03,981
the journey to the beginnings has to
be seen as a redemption of all that has

544
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:10,770
been falling away. Uh, let me just say
it in a slightly less tortures way.

545
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,860
They can be no redemption unless it
implies that the whole of evil is overcome

546
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:23,400
and destroyed so that even the world
of hell now appears all of a sudden,

547
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,700
as part of what we get to now about
the ultimate structure of the universe,

548
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,820
this seems to me to be the
real, uh, uh, lesson. They,

549
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:39,330
the underlying and powerful
message that Dante sending through,

550
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,200
uh, this three candles in
the habit of metaphysics.

551
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,390
Let me stop here before I move into the
next Canto Canto 30 and see if there are,

552
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,480
let me take the questions now
before we go on to the next candle.

553
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,890
Um,
I,

554
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:59,690
I could go back maybe and try to Redo
what I have been saying was it's uh,

555
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,180
uh, but then me see if you have some
questions and then, then we can do that.

556
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,073
Please.

557
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,900
He never says that. Let
me be very, very clear.

558
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:27,490
He never says it anywhere
are,

559
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,120
there is never an indication thematically.

560
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,640
There's everything else that I have
said I could find counterparts and the

561
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:41,641
thematic Dymatize in the sense that
it's becomes part of a conscious

562
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,940
articulation on the part of what
he knows and he theme attached.

563
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,200
He makes it a theme clear.
Never says that.

564
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,290
Um,
but the,

565
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,340
there are two implications though that
I'm drawing on in order to be able to

566
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,460
make the kind of statements.

567
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,340
The first is the very
idea of the cosmos as a,

568
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,330
as a sphere, right? And the
idea of the cosmo was his fear.

569
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,430
It really means that,
uh,

570
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,340
wherever you are going and
you are going toward God,

571
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,800
then you're going back to the beginning.

572
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,910
Everything else can go back to the
beginning because that's the form,

573
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:26,530
the shape of the cosmos. And I'm
joining out in publication about this,

574
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,600
this understanding of the universe.

575
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:34,020
The other reason is that there is such
a thing has a redemption and Dantes we

576
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,150
didn't read the Canto
Canto seven of paradise.

577
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,590
It's focused on redemption,
a new beginning.

578
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,880
That's what redemption means.

579
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Redemption means that the cosmos can go
back to its beginning and be restored

580
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:49,870
and its original form.

581
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,910
If this is true or it could
very well be that, you know,

582
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:56,200
from that point we have the poem,

583
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,230
Lucifer is always going to
be stuck in his eyes forever.

584
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,410
There's no, no, no hint
that he can move. Even. Uh,

585
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,760
Francesca is always moving around
in, in, in vicious circles,

586
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,170
right by remembering and then lost
in the labyrinth of time. You know,

587
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:19,120
to her is she literally moves in time
memory or cannot think about the past

588
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,410
without, we moved by it and goes
back constantly about, around it.

589
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,810
Uh, Ulysses gets lost. Who knows
where there is no way for him.

590
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:33,190
He, he has no sense of a trace.
Even, even from this point of view,

591
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:36,160
I can go on understanding
that in, have, in, in, in,

592
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,180
in a can't where place matters.
Ulysses never had a sense.

593
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,230
I never had a sense of belonging anywhere.
That's the Arthur dislocation.

594
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,540
Nanga uh, kind of, uh, you know,

595
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,510
he doesn't have a family that holds him
back and the children of the kingdom,

596
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,240
Ithaca,
anything in cash just goes on moving.

597
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,240
That is the overt sense of the poem.

598
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,750
But there is this theology of redemption.

599
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,200
And I'm wondering whether Theology of
redemption does not entail necessarily

600
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,090
that there is a return to the beginning.
But I,

601
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,910
before I go on the with restating
some of this, I want to ask you to,

602
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,183
um,

603
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:21,010
because I think it's one of
the technique that Dante users,

604
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:25,340
which is really extraordinary. Can
you go to the beginning of Canto, uh,

605
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,400
that the famous image of Latona
when the two children of Latona,

606
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,300
um, beginning Canto 29, I did.

607
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:38,780
It would like to ask you to look
at the Italian a little bit.

608
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,600
I'm not going to read it
when I'm just going to read.

609
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:47,120
I'm going to ask you to look.
I want to read it though.

610
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,440
Uh, at the first word wonder, right?

611
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:56,630
You all see that and look at line.
That's really the problem.

612
00:41:56,790 --> 00:42:01,270
What do we call rhetorically
the practices of the cancer?

613
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,510
The beginning of the candle
introduction again, go to line 12,

614
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:08,690
the last word.
Quando right.

615
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,200
Go to the first law. Back to the first
line. The last word in that line.

616
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,650
Latona. Latona. Okay.

617
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,680
The first two letters,
law,

618
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,630
go back to Canto two line 12.
I'm sorry. The first two letters.

619
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,030
La Joel, this cat, that's a cosmos.

620
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,640
The lines together and they will
meet exactly at the word hemisphere.

621
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:42,780
Emis Pharaoh. That's the
center. Uh, that's the, uh,

622
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:46,140
the hemisphere hemisphere means
that they are, it's half Emmy.

623
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:48,540
The Greek is the two half spheres.

624
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:53,440
The universe is two half
spears composing one. I,

625
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:58,670
I think Dante's placing
us at a cosmic crossroads.

626
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,990
He's tough. He's locating us. It's
telling us where we are first of all.

627
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,980
Okay.

628
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,980
But he's also telling us that this
universe has a kind of video cold and very

629
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:15,840
secret laws, that that poem is
the secret laws that regulated.

630
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:21,380
I'm really arguing then that
there is this subtext that is if,

631
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,780
if a radical redemptive
theology would only,

632
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,480
uh,

633
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,420
entail the absolute purification of,

634
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,690
of evil, oh, that the
universe will have to,

635
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,960
to really go back to this kind of,
um,

636
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:44,940
Pythagorean purity, but without
the phases and descends, you know,

637
00:43:44,941 --> 00:43:49,470
this whole, you know what I mean? All
of you, this Pythagorean idea that the,

638
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,880
the uh,

639
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:55,200
the life of the universe
stretches for 360,000 years.

640
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,130
Did you ever hear about that? Uh, he has
this, he has, which I really liked the,

641
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,970
the days of the year, you
know, then the, the, the 365,

642
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:07,530
I think we have 360 thousands.
Uh, he has every 3000,

643
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:11,850
6,000 years, the university rotates
and goes back to its point of origin.

644
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,780
And then it,
that Kevin's starts again the age of gold,

645
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,260
the age of silver, the age of, uh,

646
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,790
the age of paper we would call
it. Now, let's say that it's,

647
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,600
that goes back in and then it
goes back to its origin. Uh,

648
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,790
that's not the way downtown, the
stains, the movement of the cosmos,

649
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,840
but he doesn't the, the,
the, he, he, he, he,

650
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:38,820
he does present this redemptive
event that makes the universe,

651
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,850
uh, return to its pristine,
uh, uh, purity. That's,

652
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:48,270
that's why I made that statement. Um, any,

653
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:50,820
any other points before I go back?
Cause I do think I should,

654
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,050
I should say all of a, what I said
before, uh, any other questions were,

655
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:59,400
can help me clarify this
various points I can, yes.

656
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:05,520
I'm sorry.
The incarnation,

657
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,980
the incarnation is the redemptive
events that allow, what means,

658
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,430
what is the redemptive event,
the incarnation that the,

659
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:18,440
that accorded redemptive events
that would make the, the,

660
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,490
uh,
a new creation.

661
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,640
A New Adam has come into the
world and the new Adam through,

662
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,790
uh,

663
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,790
the sacrifice is sacrifice
through the gift God gave.

664
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:36,270
Allow the incarnation because human
beings on their own will not be capable.

665
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,060
That's the, the theology
of redemption. Uh,

666
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,800
human beings on their own would not
be able to save and redeem themselves.

667
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,920
So that an intervention from God through
his son was made inevitable in order to

668
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:54,810
reconstruct and in order to bring out,
uh,

669
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,070
and produce that original
order of the cosmos.

670
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,050
And if that is true,

671
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:04,260
and it is true when you only have
to look at everywhere in the poem,

672
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,110
but Canto Seven of paradise,
that's really what it is,

673
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,600
an enunciation of this whole theory in,
in,

674
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:15,270
in the terms of, for those of
you who are Anselm, et Cetera,

675
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,510
then that implies that there must be
some kind of a general remaking of,

676
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,240
uh, of the world. That's, that's
uh, what I think the, the idea.

677
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:32,170
But nonetheless, this should not obscure
the fact that there is a, uh, kind of, uh,

678
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:32,540
uh,

679
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:37,540
parents juxtaposition between the
physical description of the world and the

680
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,200
spiritual description of the world.

681
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:43,090
There are two hemispheres and
yet they are connected. The,

682
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,750
the spiritual,
uh,

683
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,820
the creation of the experience of
creation is really the way of positing a

684
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,460
distinction or a difference
into the universe, into,

685
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,270
into the theory that the world is eternal.

686
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:02,610
They are two conceptions that operative
in the Middle Ages and they're really

687
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:05,400
represented by,

688
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:10,920
one is by our clients who is a theologian,

689
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:15,810
but he's also a philosopher. And in fact,
he could be called as the, the, the,

690
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:20,320
the writer who wants to make a
philosophical theology. He argues, no,

691
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,610
he's known for the famous Suma,

692
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,600
but he wrote a tract called
Suma against the gentiles,

693
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:32,820
not the summa of theology,
but summa contra gentiles where the,

694
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:37,240
he argues that the eternity of the world,
the,

695
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:41,020
the theory of the eternity of the world,
that he said that there is no creation.

696
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,130
Ah, he says, could be
philosophically demonstrate it,

697
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,200
but it could also be philosophically
repudiated. He says, you know, if he lost,

698
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:54,760
we can argue one side of it. Then
he goes on arguing, uh, the, the,

699
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:59,260
uh, that there is no way of thinking
of, you know, the usual questions.

700
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:04,300
Who created the creator? The kind of
the oldest, this, uh, this objections.

701
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:09,010
It says, however, there is a
theory, a view of creation, uh,

702
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:13,990
which is, uh, um, allowed and
it's possible on account of faith,

703
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,120
but it also allows for the
thought of freedom, origins,

704
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:21,040
beginnings,
uh,

705
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:26,150
etc. Bonaventure picks up some of these
that these ideas debated in Paris in the

706
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:29,620
13th Century and 1270, uh, in Paris,

707
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,700
that both of them are teachers at the
University of Bordeaux ventures has no,

708
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,620
this is untenable.

709
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:40,030
The idea of the eternity of the world
is absolutely untenable because if the

710
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:44,310
world were a terminal, then
we really would have, uh, uh,

711
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:49,350
no way of no real succession of
generations that would be endless.

712
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:55,060
Uh, uh, people who have been living before
us, there's no evidence for this, uh,

713
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:58,090
would be endless forms of etc. He holds,

714
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:03,330
he upholds the Thea of creation than
intervenes into this debate and says that

715
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:09,460
it is the effectively the physical
world and the spiritual world.

716
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,500
I really one continuous,
one complimentary to the other,

717
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,110
and yet there is a
difference between them.

718
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:22,180
And the difference between them is
the difference that he can find,

719
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,890
embed outreaches, speech, that
little point of time, that little,

720
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:31,120
uh, intrusion of time that distinguishes
between one sound and another sound.

721
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,593
Um,

722
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,480
but the spiritual universe originates
in the world of nature is a natural

723
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:39,940
production and reproduction.
All of God's love.

724
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,690
The physical world in
exactly the same way.

725
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,820
So there is a kind of symmetry.

726
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:49,780
This is not pro Plato's
are inverted universe.

727
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:55,210
The physical world is not Plato's
inverted world. It's adjacent to it.

728
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,350
It is a safe,

729
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:01,680
Dante discovers that there
are more dimensions to the
world that we see then the

730
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,671
what,

731
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:08,671
what medieval are cosmologists or
classical cosmologist had imagined.

732
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:11,620
Interestingly enough,

733
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:14,950
and I don't say this is a proof
for any of what I've said at all,

734
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,930
but there is a famous 19th century
mathematician by the name of Freeman,

735
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,220
a German mathematician.

736
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,290
I don't know how many of you
studied history of science. He was,

737
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:30,200
he's known among other things for
having been the mathematics professor of

738
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:35,201
Einstein while he went on with a team
of his students studying the scandals of

739
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:42,610
the divine comedy to find evidence that
in fact Dante had already a theory of

740
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,310
fourth dimension. That there is
the, the University of we was it.

741
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:51,020
And then there's another universe.
It is almost as if the full of books,

742
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:55,850
the folds of the parchments.
I'd exactly giving an idea of,

743
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,020
that's what [inaudible] wrote me the,
the,

744
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,630
an idea about what the actual structure
of the universe. Maybe having said this,

745
00:51:02,631 --> 00:51:06,890
don't forget to turn back
to me, my shell, the, the,

746
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,530
the emblem of what I take.
Very good. Thank you. Ah,

747
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:15,280
so let me see if there's some questions.
If it goes, we can go on, uh, uh,

748
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:16,790
talking about some of these issues.

749
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:22,570
Please. I'm so lucky as to how
the reference to it was seasoned

750
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,530
and Francesca and these cancers relate
Beatrice's description of the University

751
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,730
of redemption back to back
to inferno and how, um,

752
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,260
a reduction of the universe necessarily
implicate including inferno as numbers.

753
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,820
Excellent question. And I, I
really welcome your skepticism.

754
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,330
The question is, uh, uh, about, uh,

755
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,130
how exactly do the figures
of Ulysses and Francesca,

756
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,620
uh, shed light on what's
happening here. And, uh,

757
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,790
is it really tenable,
uh,

758
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,660
that Dante's implying the dose that
they, the, the, the sinners are,

759
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:12,760
are going to be a redeemed,
saved, more or less? That's

760
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:17,350
yeah. And, and why, like,
why, why they're brought up,

761
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,360
how they fit into that explanation.

762
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:24,110
Good, good, good. I think that
that's, that's a crucial issue.

763
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,940
Uh, it's clear, it's interesting that
Dante should look at Ulysses and,

764
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:33,230
and bring up the image of
your races and Canto 27.

765
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,690
You find that interesting and that,
uh,

766
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,130
and Dante one can say Dante's really
unlike your races now, he probably,

767
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:45,050
he probably realizes how different he is
from your racists because your list is

768
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:46,680
when to [inaudible] he's,

769
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,570
he's implying how risky his own
enterprise may be exact. You know,

770
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:55,130
which we have seen before. Uh, Ulysses
was brought up in this journey,

771
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,470
in Canto with the meeting
with a dream of this.

772
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:02,080
Irene was a happening even
before in indirectly many other,

773
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:06,830
in some other cases, uh, 26 and
in to one of, in fairness, even,

774
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,450
uh, and, and maybe we could just
stop there as well. Dante still,

775
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,990
that's a kind of
retrospective fascination. Uh,

776
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:20,020
he's looking back and I'm
pinpointing that tragic moment.

777
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:26,050
Calls it the mad they're mad track
of Ulysses madness implies that he,

778
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:30,870
uh, this man had the,
violated the limits or limits,

779
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:35,600
including the limits of reason.
Okay. In this rational pursuits,

780
00:53:35,601 --> 00:53:39,990
philosophical investigation of the,
of the world, the scientific, uh,

781
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,610
who wants to go into the, and I'm
peopled world to have experience. That's,

782
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:47,120
that's the key word for him.
And yet therefore,

783
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:51,880
that madness implies that he had been
delirious, had been now going off the,

784
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:56,190
the track. Okay. It's just
Dante, maybe I'm that for me too,

785
00:53:56,191 --> 00:54:00,840
but maybe not. Maybe I'm really a little
safer now. I'm in the hands of Beatrice.

786
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,900
She's guiding me. So it's the way
of trusting Beatrice. So we could,

787
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,160
we could say that that is all true.
Uh,

788
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,610
and therefore I could even see an
element of a relief on the part of Dante.

789
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,920
We would even catch that the
relief is, uh, uh, that, uh,

790
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:21,540
his own adventure, uh,
diminishes the epic,

791
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,810
the Greek epic hero. You
know, really the very little,

792
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:29,430
he just went beyond the pillars of
Hercules. So we could stop there.

793
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,780
It happens all the retrospectively we
can see the story of Ulysses is also the

794
00:54:36,601 --> 00:54:40,580
story of a metaphysician. Dante is
in the heaven room at the physics.

795
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,210
In what ways in the place of,
uh,

796
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,380
what does make the physics
deal with those with place?

797
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:51,240
There's with time and that we can
understand why you listen to in Canto 26,

798
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:56,450
he seems to be going from place to
place is the metaphor that distinguishes

799
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,140
Julisa sold. And Dante says
he's a failed metaphysician,

800
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:04,420
but we understand that he really
was going to the absolute,

801
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:08,730
it really was trying to go where I'm
going, man. And there is nothing else.

802
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,700
We stopped there. We'd go to be at
risk than to meat. Saw is talking to,

803
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,490
to uh,
is,

804
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,040
is listening to Beatrice in Canto 29.

805
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:25,550
And he's tying to figure out if it's
possible to think of a beginning how do

806
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:27,860
things, how, how,

807
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,320
if you have the eternality of forms
and you have the [inaudible] of matter,

808
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,220
it's very difficult to know how you could
really distinguish anything that goes

809
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:42,330
before from what goes after. There is no
such a thing as a before and an after.

810
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,860
He tries to localize time.
That's really the problem. Uh,

811
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:51,330
and to localize time, he
says that it really, um,

812
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,850
uh, Beatrice, uh, uh, looked, uh,

813
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,590
and the reminded him of the point,

814
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:02,430
there was a point of joy that
overcame him. Maybe it's alluding,

815
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:06,240
there's a languages that are
Francesca. Uh, so why Francesca?

816
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,140
Let me just explain it at one point,
maybe he's alluding twick case,

817
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,240
the two of them that he
remembers. It's, you know,

818
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:16,950
all sorts of very spiritual eyes. The
context that is never, never vulgar.

819
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,720
Maybe he just alluding to a case that had
been exchanging to, oh, maybe the will,

820
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:26,080
the desire, the long game to have a
case now exchange a kiss with her.

821
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,040
Um,

822
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,830
but one thing is clear that he's thinking
of Francesca is also kind of Meta

823
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:35,860
physician because that's where we are.
What is the metaphysics of Francesca?

824
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:40,860
But the physics of desire, first of all,
a desire that, uh, what does it mean?

825
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,900
The metaphysics of desire,
desire, but it's home definition.

826
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:48,610
We submit the physical in the sense that
it's always a moving beyond the objects.

827
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:52,390
It gains a,
because it burns up the various objects.

828
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,720
Today I want this book, then I want
another book, and then I want the car,

829
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:59,440
and then I want the library, et cetera.
That's the inflict movement of desire,

830
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,920
which is what we call a
metaphysics of desire.

831
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:06,790
So she's a metaphysician not only she's
a metaphysician, she lives in time.

832
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,650
So she's a complimentary for a
complimentary figure to Ulysses.

833
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,390
Ulysses is, you remember
I stopped at sales, uh,

834
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,480
I left behind me, Seville and
then I, et Cetera, et cetera.

835
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,100
Now Francesca instead says,

836
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,610
or how difficult it is to
remember the joys of the past.

837
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,540
I remember I was reading,
uh,

838
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,850
that day I began reading that day
I stopped reading a only a poet.

839
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:35,170
Who was that that overcame at that point
of time, a point of the book, et Cetera.

840
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:39,760
So maybe Dantes seemed really saying she
too is another failed with a physician.

841
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,880
I they would like to be where I am now,

842
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,320
both Francesca and Ulysses.

843
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:49,630
So we are bringing them to the
private place where Dante is,

844
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,170
they're looking for
the same thing is he's,

845
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:58,180
he's having now a conjunction of
time in the Turnitin space in time.

846
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:02,770
We'll be in Quando to see the
point when all things go here.

847
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,750
That's, that's, that's exactly where he's
looking. How do I make things go here?

848
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,850
Of course it's possible to thin,
you know,

849
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:17,650
one way of thinking of paradise and the
joy of the blessed is to go on thinking

850
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,780
that my joy suppose that are saved
and whether unlikely proposition,

851
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,393
my joy,

852
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,460
it's possible to to argue is
increased by it's sadistic.

853
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,580
The view of those were suffering.
So

854
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,550
mercifully I'm saying, you
know, to me it's supposed to,

855
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,420
it was improbable form of a, of beer
beatitude, but it's likely that you know,

856
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,770
seeing someone down trodden
and punish the right like that.

857
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:49,450
Be The dentist saying a hierarchy. I am
the neither. Neither like you racist. No,

858
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:53,320
like really Francesca.
I don't think that that's Dante though.

859
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:58,210
He's talking about cosmology and creation.

860
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,600
The older other within how this order is
an order of love and now he's coming to

861
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:09,271
know this order of love because now
knowledge is love and love is knowledge.

862
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:12,370
I think that by the allusion to them,

863
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,990
he's also saying that here on
earth you can grant me that.

864
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:21,890
That's what I said before and I think
that I'm not pushing it to the point of

865
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,180
unbelievability. The whole
argument becomes unbelievable.
I can stay here and say,

866
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:31,340
wow, now what he's really saying is that
I am here and I see how things go here,

867
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,520
but I know that sinful people on earth,

868
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,820
those who of us who live
in the shadows of time,

869
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:42,470
you know that this tree and we
had under the leaves of time.

870
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:47,740
Then I know that in a sinful way they
were trying to do and know what I now have

871
00:59:50,661 --> 00:59:55,160
come to do and know I could substitute
and said, well, we're all happy.

872
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,010
There's no argument.
I think that that makes logical sense.

873
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:03,350
I can push it to the level, to
the point of absurdity, to say,

874
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,870
look,
maybe if this is true,

875
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:10,460
he's also saying not only
that day in a shadowy way,

876
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,640
in a dim way where I'm dissipating the
real happiness in the sinful modes,

877
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,890
the sinners,
but that may be they too.

878
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:22,220
If you move out of the
stacks is you know this,

879
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:26,000
this is not set in the
techs that they too will be,

880
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:31,180
are going to be taken and placed in the
bosom of Abraham where all the blessed

881
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,540
dwell. Maybe two. This is a, uh,

882
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,230
is it my wishful thinking I grandchildren?
It's probably wishful thinking,

883
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:44,410
but I do have the theology of redemption
behind me that stands as authored by

884
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:48,710
Dante in Canto Canto seven of paradise.

885
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:53,420
I restated the whole thing
and two minutes. That's good.
That's not bad. Thank you.

886
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,990
Other questions before
we go back to please?

887
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:10,100
Yes. Thank you. Can I comment
about Francesca and the,

888
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:10,660
uh,

889
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:15,660
that the fact that there is the
creation is given in sexual terms,

890
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:19,550
you know, that this is
love that opens itself. Um,

891
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:24,080
the opposites of two new loves and so on.
Uh,

892
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,970
the,
uh,

893
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:30,790
I can not help but,
um,

894
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,610
play a little bit of editemological
game too, by the way.

895
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:38,330
Cause this is the world of origins and
I, I don't want to lose you. I mean,

896
01:01:38,331 --> 01:01:42,260
I know there is only one
class, but I don't want to
lose you. Of course. The only,

897
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:46,390
the way in which length is conveying
all the senses is by playing with

898
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,290
etymologies. We set the mortgage is
the science of the origin of words.

899
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,920
So let me give you only one.
You,

900
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,280
I corrected my good friends and
Claire in separable from May. I mean,

901
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,030
I'm never going to be training,

902
01:02:00,031 --> 01:02:03,250
but I have to correct them because
he says reveal. That's what he did.

903
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:07,850
He said the, uh, the eternal love,
uh, revealed itself. He knew loved.

904
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:11,780
He's missing the,
the whole sexual language,

905
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:16,190
which is exactly the reason.
Thank you. Thank you.

906
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,400
It's exactly the reason why I think that
Francesca to who can arguably can be

907
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:26,420
saved. That's exactly the reason that
the lay, the term he uses is, uh,

908
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:31,690
is uh, pants from the Italian.
In Italian we call it a plea,

909
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:36,240
right? Very close to in
English we have the word April,

910
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:40,810
by the way, as an opening of
the, of, of the spring. Uh,

911
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,710
just to give you a sense in
its demolishing a comes from,

912
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,200
I believe that Latin,

913
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,850
which really means to generate,

914
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:56,630
to bring to light is a woman
brings a birth to light and life.

915
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,650
That's really the word.
That's the meaning of the word.

916
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:06,420
So it's a sexual in this productive
as it can be. Before I go back though,

917
01:03:06,421 --> 01:03:10,710
to your question about how does that go
into, it just happened what Dante saying,

918
01:03:10,711 --> 01:03:15,600
that creation is the sexual process,
a sexual experience,

919
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:20,750
which is exactly what Francesca also that
breaking the law and doubted that she

920
01:03:21,891 --> 01:03:25,620
has been the hell, is she going
to be in hell? Is she going,

921
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,880
are we going to understand that there is
a possible continuity between what she

922
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:33,300
did in the physical sense? And what
Dante is doing in a spiritual sense,

923
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:38,420
but this is the whole point of the
discussion on cosmology and creation that

924
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:43,320
there is some kind of continuity between
the two modes. Not Quite the same thing.

925
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:48,030
Of course creation is a different
order of experience that he said thin,

926
01:03:48,031 --> 01:03:49,200
very thin line.

927
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,440
It's like a little breath of breath that
Francesco can release a c or Beatrice.

928
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,130
So call on talking endlessly
that she too would have.

929
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:01,230
That's the difference between the two.

930
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:06,530
So between the language of sexuality of
physicality and in fan and the language

931
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:10,500
of spirituality here in paradise,
the line,

932
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:14,850
there is a continuum between them
and there is a little difference,

933
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:17,260
but there is also a
possibility of a continuum.

934
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:20,670
That's exactly the argument that I,

935
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,970
I would make about that.
Let me,

936
01:04:23,971 --> 01:04:27,740
they'll tell you more in a
historic way and up, uh, uh,

937
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:32,640
historical so that if you
don't agree with what I said,

938
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:35,490
so be it. Don't worry. The,

939
01:04:35,491 --> 01:04:39,990
I don't agree with are completely
on my own, but the, the,

940
01:04:39,991 --> 01:04:41,270
I think that there is a,

941
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:46,480
that's a radical reading of the
notion of cosmology and creation.

942
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:47,754
In Dante.

943
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:52,590
But let me tell you something
else historically where
it's done for taking these

944
01:04:52,591 --> 01:04:53,790
ideas from

945
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,930
whenever you read commentaries on Dante.

946
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:03,170
And I hope that some of you will go on
reading and reading also our scholars.

947
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:08,190
Thank you critics. I I see
that nodding. It just, uh, uh,

948
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:13,020
my heart's just this gladdens when
I see that and they will tell you.

949
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:18,220
And I indicated that tool that you know,
that Dante is some kind of Aristotelian,

950
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:21,170
and that was talking about
metaphysics. How, uh, how,

951
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:26,180
how are they stole it or cause it first
philosophy and also in terms they never

952
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:30,100
tell you what the actual
sources of Dante are.

953
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,570
The sources of Dante about cosmology and,

954
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:38,690
and a small graphy really
neoplatonic the idea of creation.

955
01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:45,160
Um, so especially with one
text that I have to mention,

956
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:47,670
this guy who writes the cosmo graph,

957
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:50,310
we are called a 12th century man.

958
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:53,770
[inaudible] Sylvester,
a Frenchman,

959
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,740
Bernard Sylvester who writes

960
01:05:58,810 --> 01:05:59,643
yes.

961
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,170
Cosmograph yet 12th century,
uh,

962
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:08,860
known as the author of the
School of shout. By the way,

963
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:12,460
this text is what available to Dante.
Uh,

964
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:16,480
we have a text of this man.
Cosmograph yeah,

965
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:19,900
one copy only because a Florentine later,

966
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,520
let me say in Florida, but in my book
capture some of you know very well,

967
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:27,250
he copied it down and transmitted to us.

968
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:30,790
We know his handwriting because
we have his text. So we,

969
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:33,850
we know this is 1340.

970
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,730
Dante of course wrote 1302,

971
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:39,940
but clearly the Texas
available that in this text,

972
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:45,520
Bernard give us an idea of
creation and cosmological ideas,

973
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:46,383
physical ideas.

974
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:51,130
They had been reading the time he is in
France and they were always surprised

975
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:54,400
and wondering what is the difference?
How can we go on having,

976
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:59,700
having pleat or say one thing
about creation and geneses
saying something else.

977
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:04,570
How were we going to connect
this to this two forms,

978
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:09,400
this tool, uh, sources of, of,
of a traditional and authority.

979
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,650
And they, when they
argue, when he goes on,

980
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:16,740
Tony's talks about the idea of
a preexisting world of matter.

981
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:22,500
That natural world, uh, and,

982
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:27,501
and the malignant materiality and how
this malignant materiality is subdued into

983
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:34,381
shape and subduing into shape
is always sexual language,

984
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:39,010
not to Hra is that which produces,
generates,

985
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:44,250
this is the text that I believe stands
behind Domtar's a physical explanation of

986
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,790
a universe which is physical,

987
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,210
but at the same time it
is not just physical.

988
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:56,670
There's also a theory of creation
and it's the theater of creation has

989
01:07:56,830 --> 01:08:01,480
unpredictable possibilities is it tells
you the things can be renewed if you

990
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:02,410
stayed within the bowel.

991
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:06,280
You see how he criticizes the
physical conception of the world.

992
01:08:06,370 --> 01:08:08,020
If you stay within those boundaries,

993
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:11,920
you can't expect anything other
than what you already have.

994
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:16,010
You cannot expect any more evil or
any less evil than what you already

995
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:18,020
experience.
The only idea,

996
01:08:18,021 --> 01:08:23,021
the only people that way in which human
beings can think about renewal can think

997
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:28,211
about change of free them up or origins
is only within the context of creation.

998
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,050
That's exactly Dante's argument.

999
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:37,260
And that's the profound
justification for the,

1000
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,680
for the distinction between one,
uh,

1001
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:42,050
older of experience at the
different order expats.

1002
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:45,380
But if this is true and
it is true for Dante,

1003
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:50,540
then I have to take also
seriously this idea of, uh,

1004
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,870
this,
the central event of redemption,

1005
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:57,260
which now we understand where he
takes that. To me, the moment,

1006
01:08:57,261 --> 01:09:00,980
the experience of the incarnation,
this is exactly,

1007
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,650
it follows the four if he has to,

1008
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,770
if he believes that there is such
a thing as Andy does creation,

1009
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,020
than he has to believe that there's
is also the idea of a re create a re a

1010
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:13,160
second creation.

1011
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:17,270
There's the first creation clearly
didn't work out all that well.

1012
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,540
So there is this other possibility

1013
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:25,963
please

1014
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:33,510
the sense that in these lines at the
beginning of 29 that we've been talking

1015
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,850
about,
that Dante is,

1016
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:42,330
is very aware of being on theological
in the ice skating close to the danger

1017
01:09:44,091 --> 01:09:44,924
line.

1018
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:50,260
The idea is that divine love
spills over into a creative

1019
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:55,860
so that

1020
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:02,470
it can be reflected back and adored and
loved in return the way that Paolo and

1021
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:09,590
Francesca,
um,

1022
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:15,320
that's not far from before
that before creation,

1023
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:20,170
God has everything, but it's
still a little low to me. And, uh,

1024
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,720
and that suggests a kind of imperfection
or at least in completeness,

1025
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:28,210
but how can God,

1026
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,550
this passage by saying, uh, uh,

1027
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,650
not to acquire new goodness for himself,
this is in the legislation,

1028
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:46,040
which cannot be perfect because of that
he wants to announce before he offers

1029
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:54,860
his neoplatonic vision of the
relationship of the God had to creation.

1030
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:02,720
He wants to signal his orthodoxy to
doubters who might hear in this something

1031
01:11:06,421 --> 01:11:11,340
which is less than perfectly
Christian because it, it,

1032
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,880
it comes close to the,
of an, of an, of an,

1033
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,940
of a needy God or a God who in the way
that every lover needs something and

1034
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:27,351
other to love in return is
in a predicament and creation
is the solution to the

1035
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:33,570
predicament that God is in
before the world is made.

1036
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:39,740
The question is that we're actually,

1037
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:44,650
cause it was more of a common,
uh, uh, by the Mastro here, the,

1038
01:11:44,651 --> 01:11:47,250
the, uh, the comment is that Dante

1039
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:54,590
seems to be on a theologically
risky thing on thin ice.

1040
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,340
I'm quoting thin ice because,
uh,

1041
01:11:58,341 --> 01:12:01,220
the notion of a god who are

1042
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,790
really trying to,
uh,

1043
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:09,020
save his skin as it were
by claiming a kind of, uh,

1044
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:13,700
of theological orthodoxy when he
actually knows that the very notion of

1045
01:12:13,701 --> 01:12:17,510
creation, uh, whereby
God opens up into new,

1046
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:22,100
into new loves.
It seems to imply that before creation,

1047
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:27,050
God was a lonely guy. Uh,
looking for a partner,

1048
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:31,680
some kind of, uh, Adam Adam in the
garden replaces that. That's really the,

1049
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,690
the question.
I um,

1050
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,340
I think that's a very interesting
idea of course, but I have to,

1051
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:44,090
or two I would respond this
not an entirely in a funny way,

1052
01:12:44,091 --> 01:12:47,210
but I hope it will come
out. There's funny, uh,

1053
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:49,460
it's really the,

1054
01:12:49,461 --> 01:12:54,461
it's really the question that synth
Augustan asks in the confessions.

1055
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:57,200
You know,
there are always those people wonder,

1056
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,850
cause that's really what the question is.

1057
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:04,300
What did God do before creation
and since I gas in response,

1058
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:10,270
he was busy preparing health to people
like you who ask this kind of this kind

1059
01:13:10,791 --> 01:13:15,260
of questions. And that's it. The,

1060
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,780
but the the most seriously.

1061
01:13:17,781 --> 01:13:21,350
The idea is that indeed creation implies,
I mean,

1062
01:13:21,351 --> 01:13:25,160
that's a response that I would offer
creation in price, a big healing,

1063
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:31,390
but this creation has been
going on forever and that
the idea of the Trinitarian

1064
01:13:33,561 --> 01:13:38,360
God is really a response to this problem.
You have,

1065
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:43,100
you obviously, I think it's not
obvious, but to me it's more obvious.

1066
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:48,460
I think that you are appealing
to a different theological
paradigm of where the

1067
01:13:48,561 --> 01:13:52,410
unity of God can be. The the,
the loneliness of God, the,

1068
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:57,580
the Christian reading of that unity is
there is always a productive in internal

1069
01:13:58,671 --> 01:14:02,720
life of love. They're always goes on,
producing itself and improve itself.

1070
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:08,120
On that note, to feel logical, grand
jury, I thank you and I say, thank you.

1071
01:14:08,121 --> 01:14:09,710
We'll see you have a good thanksgiving.
