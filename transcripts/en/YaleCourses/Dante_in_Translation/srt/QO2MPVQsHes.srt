1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,720
We'll begin today with,
uh, uh, in fair, no,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,640
let me say a few things about the poem
in general as the structure of Department

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,140
of form or structure. And
then we get into the, uh,

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,660
the cantos one, two, three, four,

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,990
which have been assigned
to you. Um, I already,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,910
in passing in my introductory remarks,
I did,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,770
I did say something about the title.
As you recall, the title of the poem,

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,970
the poem,
we referred to it as the divine comedy.

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,450
It should be comedy.
That's what Dante calls it.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,900
And he called it comedy
for a number of reasons.

11
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,300
The first reason is that it
ends in, uh, with in, in,

12
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,200
in happiness.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,000
It's a story that begins with a kind
of a disorder catastrophe if you wish,

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,330
the pilgrim who is lost in the woods
and then works himself out toward the

15
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:01,320
light,
told the truth toward God.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,300
That's so comedy describes the, the, uh,

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,950
thematic trajectory of, uh,
the poem. It's, it's, uh,

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,310
it's going from one condition to another.
And from this point of view,

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,300
it's the very opposite of the tragic
movement in the tragic movement.

20
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,130
You'll always have some kind of initial
state of cohesion or an initial state of

21
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:27,540
happiness that then goes
on going toward the, uh,

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,450
some kind of fatality or a disaster.
Uh,

23
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,960
but it is a second reason for the title
comedy at the second reason is stylistic.

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,490
Uh,
Dante,

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,440
he calls it a comedy because he
adopt the vernacular first of all,

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,340
as opposed their possibility would
have been writing it in Latin,

27
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,720
in a kind of a,

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,320
the language of philosophy and the
language of great cultural exchanges,

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,030
but it calls it instead,

30
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,840
he uses the Italian vulgar language.

31
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,460
It also means a,
stylistically he adopt a humble style.

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,790
You know what the theory of styles is
coming to us from ancient Greece and Rome.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,330
Uh, there are three levels of styles, uh,

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,470
three levels of style that is the high,
a tragic style,

35
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:21,471
the sublime style that describes exactly
the events that involve kings since

36
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,060
style is must have some,

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,640
some kind of APP tennis to the
situation that the story describes.

38
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,940
Then there is a middle style or
[inaudible] style and then there is a,

39
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,850
a low style, the style of comedy,
the style. Then did Dante,

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,160
uh, with adopts lowly, uh,

41
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,190
that this is a kind of a
peculiar implication for
Dante to call a story such as

42
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,300
his, a comedy. And this is the
implication that are in effect,

43
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:56,301
he undercuts the idea of a
rigid hierarchy of reality.

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,420
There is no such a neat
separation of the high,

45
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,290
the middle and the law that
which is low and humble,

46
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,410
such as the experience is describing or
his own experience and no ordinary human

47
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:15,451
being of living around the year 1300
who manages to have this extraordinary

48
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:20,701
experience of going up to see the face
of God and come back to return a call

49
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,770
back two years to, to
tell us about it. Uh,

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,800
it's really a sign that the lo can
become high and the high can become law.

51
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,950
That is that a classical, uh,
distinctions that we read,

52
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:39,550
the of which we read in the poetics of
virustotal that Dante did not know or in

53
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:44,170
horses poetic heart that Dante
did know, uh, are really,

54
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,130
uh, false. I really user it.
This is not the way to proceed.

55
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:53,131
So Dante has a number of items that
he's pursuing in calling this text.

56
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,090
Uh, uh, the comedy.

57
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,330
The other thing you have to say about
the formal structure of the poem is you

58
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,450
all know it's divided into three parts,
hell,

59
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,300
purgatory and paradise easy.

60
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,770
Each of them has 33 cantos
with the exception of,

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,360
of inferno in federal has 34 cancers,

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,100
which means has one can to,

63
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:20,101
one is we're going to read in a moment
plus 33 they are neatly separated in that

64
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,890
can to one represents and stands
for a kind of general rehearsal.

65
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,460
It's a journey that fails,
downplay the real journey.

66
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,070
We'll begin with Ken too.
So uh,

67
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:38,071
it has 100 canters but the basic
unit of his narrative is the three.

68
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,020
Number three,
in fact,

69
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:45,370
it's written in so called a
style or a magical formula.

70
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:50,371
He devices are so called Delta Rema
that I'm sure you recall from your own

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,560
readings in high school or in
other courses that they have even,

72
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:58,060
which uses the rhyme scheme is
always going to be a, B, a, B, c, B,

73
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:02,200
and so on. Number three,
once again, is the, the,

74
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,080
uh,
the fundamental symbolic,

75
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,490
a number of division within,
uh, within this text.

76
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,720
What is the reason for this?

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,700
There is a large aesthetic reason and
aesthetic reasons, but it can be found,

78
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,750
formulated,

79
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,430
crystallized in a verse
from the Book of Wisdom.

80
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,880
You are God have created everything
according to number measure and weight.

81
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,870
And so the divine comedy has to duplicate
the symmetry and the older and the

82
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,390
harmer he that he thinks
he sees in the universe.

83
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,690
The poem is presented and produced as a
reflection of that superior divine order

84
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,310
of the universe and
wants to be part of it.

85
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,490
So it's both as this kind of ambivalence
to reflect it and become what we call a

86
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,150
Maconomy, uh, the part that
wants to be to a larger, uh,

87
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,890
ho. Uh, so these are the, some general
concerns that you gotta have it now, uh,

88
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:08,600
about deploying some general ideas that
will help you understand the pattern of

89
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,020
parallelisms that are we
going to find within the poem.

90
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,500
And that can give you one very quickly.
Now in a sense,

91
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,660
I'm really asking you that
when you read the poem,

92
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:22,580
you should be aware that there is a kind
of linear structure from one to 100,

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,700
uh,
and yet within the triple a,

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,550
the traditional department hell,

95
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:33,551
purgatory and paradise there Qantas
that correspond to one another,

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,460
10 to six of inferno, uh,
prefigures Canto six Uga,

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,730
toto in both of them in turn will
prefigure Canto six of paradise can

98
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,370
[inaudible] and so on. It can
be done, but can 10, 10 and 10,

99
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,260
it can be done in a fairly
systematic way. So, uh, if you wish,

100
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:55,310
sometimes you could really read, uh,
one, two, three, four and yet one,

101
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,320
one and one which is,
oh,

102
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:01,240
maybe you wait until the end of the poem
when you have read the whole poem and

103
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:02,510
then you can go back and read it.

104
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,370
A horizontal is it where as much as
vertically down. So these are some,

105
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,230
some uh,
employee ideas,

106
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,890
general concerns and implications
in Dante's structure of the port.

107
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,660
We begin now with Canto one.
It's a very well known cancer where the,

108
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,660
the step general preamble,
uh,

109
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:25,270
you know how the poem starts
is I'm just reading the Eh,

110
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,270
the famous lines.

111
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,290
Everybody reads a and everybody probably
remembers in the middle of the journey

112
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,150
of our life,
I came to myself.

113
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,700
Those of you have a different
installation, will nonetheless, uh,

114
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,040
get the gist and it's, it's the
changes. The shifts are really minimal.

115
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,250
I came to myself within a dark
wood where the strict way was lost.

116
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,490
Ah,

117
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,490
her hardest thing it is to tell that would
savage and harsh and then the thought

118
00:07:56,001 --> 00:08:00,290
to which renews my fear so bitter.

119
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:03,530
It is that death is hardly more.

120
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,700
But to give account of the good,
which I found there,

121
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,870
I will tell of the other
things I noted there.

122
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,170
I cannot write retail how I entered there.

123
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,280
I was so full of sleep at that
moment when I left it through rea.

124
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,600
But when I had reached the foot of
the hill at the end of the valley,

125
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,700
we should pierced my heart with fear.

126
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,940
I looked up and so it's shoulders already
clouded with the beams of the planet

127
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,880
that leads men straight on every road.

128
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,580
Then the fear was quiet to the little
which had continued in the lake of my

129
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:43,320
heart during the night had spent so PTSD.

130
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,650
And as he who with labeling breath
has escaped from the deep to the shore

131
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,050
terms to the pearls waters and engages.
So my mind,

132
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,410
which was still flight turned
back to look again at the pass,

133
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,300
which never let yet any go live.
It's an a great beginning.

134
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:07,760
It begins in a very, uh,
extraordinary way, begins with, uh,

135
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,210
in the middle to begin with.
Right? So that's the, the
beginning is in the middle.

136
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:17,211
The beginning is the present a reality
of the pilgrim who finds himself lost,

137
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,850
but it's more in that first line in
the middle of the journey of our life.

138
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,200
Um,
what is he saying?

139
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,030
I think it's fairly clear the first
conceit and the fundamental conceit of the

140
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:34,040
poem is that life is a journey,
which means her,

141
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,880
we are always on the way. We don't
know where we're going yet. Uh,

142
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,860
he will find out soon,
which means that we are displaced,

143
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,740
which means we're going to
have an number of adventures.

144
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,690
It means that we are not yet where
we want to be. Life is a journey.

145
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,570
In fact, he will go on. We're only
calling in the middle of the journey.

146
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,390
He also calls it our life that,

147
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,940
that that's a possessive our life.

148
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:02,060
It's sexist way of establishing one fact
that this is not really yet a unique

149
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:07,140
experience is something we all share in
something which might also concern us.

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,760
That we are also not only he
is in the journey of his life,

151
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,300
but we too are in that journey of
the common journey of her life.

152
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,680
And then in contrast with that,

153
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,550
there is now an autobiographical focus.

154
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,590
There is a stress of I found I are,

155
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,530
I came to myself within
a dark wood and so on. I,

156
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,150
so this is going to be very much the
story once again very much has the Vitor.

157
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,380
Moreover, uh, an autobiographical
story can only be a personal story,

158
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,540
but here the self is going to see the
world is coming to see himself through the

159
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,320
prism of the world.
He will lend to a public space.

160
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,010
The great difference I will
say between the Vita Nuova,

161
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:54,840
which we just looked at last time,
and the divine comedy is the following.

162
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,280
The Vita Nuova was destined
to fail as a narrative.

163
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,290
Exactly because the, the, the,
the protagonist went home,

164
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,820
uh,
drawing us,

165
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:09,570
enjoying himself within the solitude,

166
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,980
the inferiority of, uh,
of his own life alive,

167
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:18,600
which was completely disengaged from
the concerns for the outside the outside

168
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:23,400
world. The divine comedy starts
exactly with that kind of ship wreck,

169
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,470
the shipwreck of some other intellectual
activities that he will go on

170
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,890
describing. And I will describe it with
you as soon as we read this first slide.

171
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,100
I came to myself in a dark wood.
And you,

172
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,870
if you read a lot of
traditional commentators,

173
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,570
medical treasure commentators
will tell you, oh, well,

174
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:44,120
Dante is here in the state
of sin are the dark wood, uh,

175
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,870
is really the condition of spiritual.
Maybe despair. He's an impasse,

176
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:51,450
an impasse.
We know he doesn't know where to go.

177
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,170
I think that this are a little
bit too easy and it's not really,

178
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,110
we have no evidence for this in
the poem yet. We don't know what,

179
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,700
what did we do know is that Dante
law is lost in the landscape.

180
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,480
That is terrifying.
He's caught within it.

181
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,810
He's clueless about how he got there.

182
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,940
I don't even know how he goes on to say,

183
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,900
I don't know how I got myself in that
situation, whatever that situation was.

184
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,890
But he knows one thing that
he wants to get out of it.

185
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,020
He understands that.
He understood.

186
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,230
He does not know yet how he has
to get out of the situation,

187
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,200
but he knows that he has to get out
of it. Impanelment of the wood. Um,

188
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,610
and uh, and then he goes on
our heart. That is et cetera.

189
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,580
So bitter is that death is how the remote,

190
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:41,230
but to give a count that's
an ex terse it of the good,

191
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:42,340
which I found there.

192
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,640
I will tell the other things I that
in a way the problem is already over.

193
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,500
He's now shifting from the
narrative of events. You know,

194
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,560
I was lost in the van.

195
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:58,550
Savage hush would have a night.

196
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,010
His gaze rents this night,
tries to find out.

197
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:06,550
I cannot see anything beyond
himself immediately he says,

198
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,960
but to tell you the good day noted there
I have to tell you other things that

199
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:13,390
poem has right from the start,

200
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,690
the double narrative focus.

201
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,920
The first focus is that he's going to
tell us the story of a pilgrim who is

202
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:27,550
caught in the quarter.
We call the diachronic the time bound.

203
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,820
The daily events are a
number of encounters which
he can not quite this hide as

204
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,800
to their meaning.
So He's,

205
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:40,060
he's led by virtualizing going to find
out soon but he doesn't understand what's

206
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:40,870
happening to him.

207
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,870
And then there is the second focus and
it's the focus of the poet who has seen

208
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:51,070
it all and then enjoys what we would
call an omniscient perspective and the

209
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:54,220
whole poor and really moves
around this double axis.

210
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,370
The axis of Eh synchronic view synoptic
view of the poet a lot who are senior,

211
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,450
who has, he becomes a port. It was
a pilgrim. Has had this experience.

212
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,870
And then he goes on telling
us about this experience.

213
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,760
That's what I call a synoptic adolescent
narrator. And then, uh, he looks at the,

214
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,890
at the, of what the
pilgrim did not know. This,

215
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:19,891
a kind of irony in this
discrepancy between the day
or chronic viewpoint of the

216
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,850
pilgrim and the synoptic viewpoint of the,
uh,

217
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,340
of the port,
uh,

218
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,190
goes without saying that the
structure is not that neat.

219
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,600
You will see that there are moments when
Dante would go on one's point of view,

220
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:36,290
will encroach upon the other.

221
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:40,660
So we'll tell you more about
this particular structure
and now he starts this.

222
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,530
Now let's see what has happened.
Uh,

223
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,550
I can not tell how this is the
second paragraph of installation.

224
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,580
I cannot rightly tell how I enter there.
I will still of sleep at that moment.

225
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,950
It's a kind of torpid, lethargic, uh,

226
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,050
that lack of consciousness that
like the lack of any, everything,

227
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,560
his faculties are dormant. Let's,
let's paraphrase it like that.

228
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,590
When I left the two way,
but when I reached the foot of the hill,

229
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,190
at the end of that Valet,
we should pierced my heart with fear.

230
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,510
I looked up and saw the shoulders already
quoted within the beams and the planet

231
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,700
that leads it in straight on every
road or he does don't has come.

232
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,280
Uh,
dawn breaks and he looks up toward the sun

233
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,810
believing that the natural sunlight is
going to unveil to him the layout of the

234
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:36,350
land and he may find Eh, uh, uh,

235
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,380
an escape route from this
particular disaster. Uh,

236
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,410
apparently one thing that if this were,
eh,

237
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,970
a platonic narrative,

238
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,230
that point would come to an end right
here because this is what happens in a

239
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:55,250
platonic narrative. You are in
a cave. You know, we are all,

240
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:58,160
this is a famous myth of the republic.
We see nothing.

241
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,760
We only see flickers of light.
It's like being at the movies,

242
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,210
flickers of light and real.

243
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,400
There are simulations of the truth that
they are being projected on the side of

244
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:14,030
the cave. And we mistake
those shadows. Four realities.

245
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,400
If you are really wise and you are a
philosopher than you do know that you can

246
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:24,401
turn your neck around and find out where
the source of true writers and then you

247
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:25,274
are saved.

248
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:30,200
The whole experience of the cave
is predicated on this premise,

249
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,410
that knowledge save shoe,

250
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,250
that knowledge is virtual and knowledge
that save you to the extent in which it

251
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:42,020
really can heal. But why call?
So what one could call the, the,

252
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:45,530
the wounds of, uh, of the intellect,

253
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,330
ignorance being the wound
of the intellect, which
knowledge, learning, uh, uh,

254
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:53,470
education philosophy
could really cure Dan too.

255
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,480
We'll find out very quickly that that is
a false promise that in many ways that

256
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:04,220
our realities and that his own reality
is going to be a little bit what complex

257
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,600
then are,
what one can find in books,

258
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:12,950
manuals or philosophy about how we get
saved and how we can save ourselves.

259
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,720
And let's see what he says
and what happens. So he
sees a, he turns toward the,

260
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,800
uh, the light. I saw the already
they've the sunlight and then he,

261
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:25,380
the he fear are this, this passion, uh,

262
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,410
because it's a passion of the soul.

263
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:32,180
The fear that paralyzes him
and paralyzes is discernment.

264
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,220
He cannot pay it. It literally stops
him, does not know which way to go.

265
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,050
And it's, it's, it's the,
the overpowering, uh,

266
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,510
passion at this point of the point was
quieted a little which had continued in

267
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:50,280
the lake of my heart during the night
I spent so PTSD a dark night. What,

268
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,620
what leads some basics done.
This is not a mistake.

269
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,580
Please clear the alluding to the dark
night. This is the dark night of the soul.

270
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,410
This is a spiritual experience that has
found now it's coming to a head. Uh,

271
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,580
Eh,
if you wish.

272
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,240
And this he who the laboring breath
has escaped from the deep to the shore,

273
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,380
turns to the perils of waters and gays
is so my mind, which was still in flight.

274
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,920
You see, look, the whole passage,
I have to tell you this whole,

275
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the two paragraphs with it is
replete with neoplatonic language.

276
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,950
He's talking about himself as if this
were a fright of the soul sought the

277
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:28,050
flight or the mind, my mind,
which was still in flight.

278
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,100
This is the idea that we have
experience share, pure intellectual,

279
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,790
that kind of experiences that we can
all find when we're reading a book,

280
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,780
we are studying, we are thinking
that mine takes its flight. Okay.

281
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,140
This is an intellectual problem.
Other,

282
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,350
there are other many other terms
here that remind us of the,

283
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,640
his use is deliberate use of neoplatonic
language. For instance, the word woods,

284
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,200
which is it a lot in this, uh,
in in the Italian is Silva, uh,

285
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,980
which translates the Greek Cuellar which
isn't always the prime or matter are

286
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:02,730
the which then the demiurge
or form and shape reality.

287
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,120
And yet immediately there is
a great shift that I want to,

288
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,130
to focus on briefly after had
rested my weird frame for a little,

289
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,520
I took my way again over the desert slope
keeping all with the lower foot from

290
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,930
and low almost at the beginning of the
steep peppered light and very swift

291
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:26,160
covered with a spot at hide.
And it did not go from before my face,

292
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,750
but so impeded my way that I
turned many times to go back.

293
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,920
Uh, he has been just now talking
about the flight of the mind.

294
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,710
My mind was still in right.

295
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,900
It's an experience of a shipwreck for
wall that many epic stories begin like

296
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:46,200
that. Think of the Aeneid, the
shipwreck of in years on the,

297
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,510
on the shores of Africa as
he's about to enter the city.

298
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,530
Dido is about to build,
right?

299
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:56,580
And that will bring him to a great
revelation and their great love story with

300
00:19:56,581 --> 00:19:59,400
Dido here, there's no such,
such a relief for him.

301
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,670
It's the shipwreck of the mind and mind
that seems to be literally unable to

302
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,700
define both his whereabouts
and his destination.

303
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,230
But as soon as he does,
as soon as he understands that what,

304
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,890
that's what the problem is,
he shifts the language from mind to body.

305
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,330
My weird body,

306
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,630
and this is the great difference between
neoplatonic narratives and Dante's kind

307
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:28,620
of experience, the intrusion
of body, and what is the body,

308
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:29,970
what does the body stand for?

309
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,300
The limit of purely intellectual journeys.

310
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,590
The real journey that he has to undertake
is the journey of mind and body.

311
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,710
And their body stands for the
irreducible historicity of oneself.

312
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,230
The stands for one tone. Uh, the reality,

313
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,040
the passions stands for one's hall.
Well,

314
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,920
this is the difference between what
the Greeks understand as the great, uh,

315
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,280
intellectual ventures,

316
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:05,281
which is one of knowledge and Dante's
idea that the real problems are problems

317
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,340
of the wheel.

318
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,140
We may know all where we are and we all
may understand that we are not happy

319
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,540
with the situation that
we find ourselves with,

320
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,320
but we can look quite solve it
because the problem by knowledge,

321
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,230
because the problems are problems
of willing. What is he doing?

322
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,870
Let me just try to make this very simple.
There are two schemes.

323
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,340
I'm really simplifying it too because I
think this is dramatic enough in and of

324
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:34,360
itself. I don't have to overdo it
with, with unnecessary complications.

325
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,540
That is a Socratic scheme whereby
all issues or issues of intellectual,

326
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,610
intellectual, the intellectual sought. Uh,

327
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,170
I know, and therefore
I'm virtue. I know, um,

328
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,690
I know what justice is and
the implication is I'm just,

329
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,290
that's a false implication was if,

330
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,050
if I go around the room here and ask you
all to give me a definition of each and

331
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,580
every one or your definition of justice,

332
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:06,980
you will tell me something that
justice is a justice within the self.

333
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,660
That just is the way I relate to my
family or just as a way or relate to the

334
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:15,400
city or just as a way to take care of the
problems or whatever of the world that

335
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,790
I find myself in.
Dante,

336
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,800
we'll say this is not the knowledge of
what the definition of justice can not

337
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:24,220
make you adjust.

338
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,630
The issue is one of willing desire.

339
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,700
The other scheme that downhill poses to
the Socratic idea that all issues are

340
00:22:33,701 --> 00:22:38,590
issues of philosophy or
ratios of knowledge is one
of the will in the letter to

341
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:43,591
the Romans Send Paul writes the good
that I will do that I do not do the evil

342
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,710
that I would do,
that I do.

343
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,360
He draws attention to the
essential existential problem.
The problem of herself,

344
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,320
my will is divided against itself.

345
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,090
May the the only way I may know where
it, what to do, but I do not know really.

346
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,470
I'm not sure that I will, uh, will
it, that's the fatality of life.

347
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:09,760
And we all know what's good.

348
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,460
Many of us go around choosing and
doing what we know, uh, where he goes.

349
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,090
So is we know it's good for us.

350
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:19,050
It's not the best in terms of
our own judgment of situations.

351
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,250
So he's willing and uh,

352
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,280
the perspective of the will
becomes Dante's perspective
in coming to terms with

353
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:31,270
the limitations of philosophy,
intellectual knowledge. We shall see,

354
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,110
uh, Dante talks about the will
in, in a, in a number of ways.

355
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:40,090
Last time talking about the Vita Nuova I
was, I began mentioning to you that, uh,

356
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,601
they will,

357
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:45,190
is even better of course for him then
unwilling and yet the best experiences

358
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,400
life seem to be those a one does
not want to happen to us. As I say,

359
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:53,390
Dream for instance,
the dream or falling in love or,

360
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,830
or sometimes in the death of the beloved.
No, you don't. He didn't search it.

361
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,080
Didn't not want that death of Beatrice.

362
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,560
It's a way of understanding that
unwilling is as compelling as willing.

363
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,900
And yet he understands that as soon as
he focuses on Beatrice as the figure,

364
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,140
the real contingent,
historical figure of love,

365
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,850
that he has to give a direction
to his own desires that he has to,

366
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,500
to define the wheel so that it's,
you understand what I'm saying?

367
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,870
Uh,
and he understands that too.

368
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,880
So that's already an anticipation of
what, uh, of the problems with the will.

369
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,610
Now he starts exploring other problems.
We should,

370
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:39,050
we'll see both as they relate to the self,
to the psychology of the character,

371
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,750
but also still relate to politics,
for instance,

372
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,570
to a vision of the world as an act of,

373
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:48,770
and the projection of our own will that
the world is the way we want it to be.

374
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,130
And that may not to,
to the way in which we relate to problems,

375
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:56,420
which are problems necessarily problems,
the problems of reality, et cetera.

376
00:24:56,421 --> 00:25:01,421
For the time being though Dan prepare
pigs the will as his own or the body,

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,140
his own, uh, his own
perspective. He find out,

378
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,300
he finds out that he can not go up the
hill, that he has seen three beasts,

379
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,790
just paraphrasing the tech's,
a leopard,

380
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,990
a she wolf Elian on that all the lion
and the she wolf will block his, uh,

381
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,480
his journey up. And so he's going right
back where he finds himself in this.

382
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,260
He's now back into the, the, the, the,

383
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,360
the deepest despair possible because
there seems to be now really no exit then,

384
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:32,840
ah,

385
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,840
he something he sees something when I
was rushing down to the place below the,

386
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,160
appeared before my eyes,

387
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,080
one whose voice seemed weak from long
silence when I saw him in that great

388
00:25:45,081 --> 00:25:49,330
waste. And as you know, because this
is, uh, uh, the first words that he,

389
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,890
Dante was ses have picked, the
pilgrim have pity on me, whoever the,

390
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,240
our tech tried to him shade or real men.

391
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:01,070
These are the words taken from the psalms,
Ms. Herrera,

392
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,020
of, of, uh, so his, his prostrating of
King David. So He's prostrating yourself.

393
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,970
And that stress this because the voice,

394
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,410
the village voice will constitute
an important strain in this matter.

395
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,450
How does Dante Talk?
That's,

396
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:18,890
that's one of the ways and we should see
how discreetly it will appear further

397
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:19,970
down in the poem.

398
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,950
And now the conversation when he meets
is the fear he meets is Virgil. Uh,

399
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,400
no, not, not Maine. Once
I was a man said, look,

400
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,250
we can stop a little bit to reflect on
what is this experience here has been

401
00:26:34,251 --> 00:26:36,740
like,
and we can we define it in some ways.

402
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,160
Dante finds him sort
of lost in a landscape.

403
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,250
He does not know how he got
there. He, the sunlight,

404
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,260
the natural sunlight as the
light of truth by fallen,

405
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,380
which he thinks he can reach the plane
of tools up to the top of the hill,

406
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:57,360
the top of the mountain from which you can
survey the land and find, uh, the exit.

407
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,450
If I in an escape finder, it's
transcendence, what to call it,

408
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,630
let's call it a way of getting
out of that, this entanglement.

409
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,280
Then he comes right back.

410
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:09,180
He says for three beasts that we
don't know what they are. They are,

411
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,790
are they sins?
Are there this positions too?

412
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:16,260
Since there are animals and therefore
their stand for animal projections of our

413
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:20,790
desires of his desires. The she
wolf, that lion and the leopard.

414
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:23,160
That's all we can see about them.
Then he meets a,

415
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:26,430
figured that and can even
know if it's a shade or a man.

416
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,150
His dramatizing what in medieval thought
in medieval literature there it's

417
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:36,330
called the land of disability.

418
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,820
[inaudible] the land of unlikeness.

419
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:43,500
He finds himself in a world where
things are not what they seem,

420
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,890
where there seems to be a
disparity between, let's call it,

421
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,540
let's use the literary language
within signs and things,

422
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,980
science and their meanings,

423
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,080
things and what they stand for and part
of his effort is to literally stitch

424
00:27:58,081 --> 00:28:02,400
this to this,
this break between signs and symbols,

425
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,160
meanings and signs.
Stitch them together.

426
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,380
First meeting then this with this figure
by the name of Virgil who will become

427
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,930
his guy. No Man, you know who he
is. He's the author of the need,

428
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,690
but look how he presents himself. I
think it's crucial. You'll pay attention,

429
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:22,310
but not man.
Once I was man and my parents were wrong.

430
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,200
Bart,
both management by birth,

431
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,070
I was born soup Yulia in Caesar,

432
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,520
which is true though it late in
his time and I lived in Rome.

433
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,860
He gives a biography of himself,

434
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,100
his self presentation
in terms of his life,

435
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,520
the historical circumstances,
and also his works.

436
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,970
That's what we call a miniature biography,
right?

437
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,680
The sense that I came into this world and
somehow this is what it all comes down

438
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:54,090
to. This is really the sense of my birth
cause he speaks about his own birth,

439
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,320
uh,
our live,

440
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,860
the Roman that the good Augustus in
the time of the false or lion guard.

441
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,300
I was a poet and single that just
sound off on crisis in years.

442
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:08,160
Who came from Troy after proud
Elian was burned, but you,

443
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,030
why are you returning to such misery?

444
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,690
Why does that not climbed
the delectable mountain,

445
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,940
which is the beginning
and calls or happiness,

446
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:21,150
meaning the mountain of purgatory
that will take him to Eden,

447
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,360
which is really what all things according
to the biblical version of a cosmology

448
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,280
or things started and he'll say, are you
thou than virgin? Of that famous witch,

449
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,490
that fountain, which pours forth
to reach a stream of speech.

450
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:40,491
I answered etc. Or glory in light of
where poets let the study and the great

451
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,010
love that has made me search.

452
00:29:42,011 --> 00:29:47,011
They volume my me that what my master and
my author that he from whom I took the

453
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:52,120
style whose beauty has brought me on.
This is Virgil,

454
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,230
clearly the poet and the
extraordinary recommendation,

455
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:57,970
which I can tell you as a teacher,

456
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,720
every teacher really would love years
after the students have been with, uh,

457
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,980
starting the teacher is kind
of greater acknowledgement.

458
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:10,090
How I remember your teaching. That's what
he does. And rhetorical, we'll call it,

459
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,200
uh, uh, the,

460
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:15,940
the rhetoric of capturing the
benevolence of the interlocutor,

461
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,950
but it's clear that he exchanged between
them and the recognition of Virgil is

462
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:21,880
as a poet.

463
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,570
And therefore I have to take a few minutes
to tell you a little bit about this.

464
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,500
It's because virtual, we know, uh,

465
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,140
he's the poet of the Aeneid.
Clearly the,

466
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:35,380
the story of a journey of a
grand epic journey by an ears.

467
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,390
We'll talk a lot about that. The
hope you believing that, that,

468
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:41,620
that poem if you haven't already.
Um,

469
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,870
but that's not the way he was known.

470
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,640
Virgil was not known this
way in what we call the, um,

471
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,060
the 12th century Europe in the cultural
immediately proceeding Dante's time,

472
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,050
uh,

473
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:01,050
he virtual more than as a poet
was known as a philosopher.

474
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,160
He was a neoplatonic philosopher
and your platonic philosopher,

475
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,650
they say one who had written a poem,

476
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,000
but the substance of that poem was not
the fiction about the burning of Troy,

477
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:18,001
the journey of a nes to as an exile who
could go around and looking for a new

478
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:22,810
land, uh, with his father on
his back. And the kid, uh,

479
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,520
the, the, the, the escape yours by his
hand, it was not nothing like that.

480
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,580
He really had some philosophical depth.

481
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,490
It was a way of acknowledging
that poetry is capable of, of, uh,

482
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,820
providing philosophical illumination.
So what was the,

483
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,440
the philosophical message or
call it neoplatonic those,

484
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,630
it's very much like what they thought
was the, all the say. And that same,

485
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,613
the Odyssey,

486
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,530
the story of Odysseus or Ulysses
who goes from Ithaca to Troy.

487
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,390
And then after 10 years of the
war in Troy goes back to to uh,

488
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,440
ethical techs in 10 more years to do that.
The neoplatonists,

489
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,560
the or Lego risers were viewing that
poem as the metaphor for the journey and

490
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:09,510
experience of the soul.
It was the story of this.

491
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,860
All that goes from the point of origin.

492
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,340
Once home that's home is
always we call one's home.

493
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,070
That plays at once by one soul is what
one can find oneself somehow, right when,

494
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:24,250
when he's familiar, comfortable,
wherever. So he left,

495
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,880
he lived lives.

496
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:30,890
It's like a ghost to trolley goes thrive
and then he has to purify himself in

497
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:36,331
order to go back as in a circle and
neoplatonic circle back to the point of

498
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:39,650
origin. This is the
neoplatonic lived all over the,

499
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:42,980
all this say they would do the same
thing the 12th century. France.

500
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,660
I could give you names if you wish.

501
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:48,740
Bernard Sylvester Full Gen
z use a little bit earlier.

502
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,390
John of Salisbury, who is an English
manor, the 12th century who goes,

503
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:55,070
go on writing about the,

504
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,100
are there any or there's a story of a
hero who is born in Troy and then goes

505
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:05,330
through the stages of life. Each book
represents a stage of life, childhood,

506
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,660
youth maturity with all the temptations
of the thrush to happen with Dido.

507
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,640
Uh, and then he goes back
to two k arrives in Italy.

508
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:18,530
That's the book six. They will never
really bother reading the other.

509
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,351
The other book,

510
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:24,351
so the engineer that was viewed as a
philosophical text illustrating the,

511
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:28,730
the, the pattern and the movement
of life. It was really telling us,

512
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,270
and that's really the promise
of philosophical knowledge.

513
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,140
It really PR that we all
like in years our board,

514
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,670
but with care improvements
can reach the promised land,

515
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,100
Dante changes and this interpretation.

516
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,620
And he changes this interpretation
by making and insisting that you,

517
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,960
that Virgil is a port.

518
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:56,170
He replaces the philosophical promises
with the idea of poetry in the belief

519
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,190
that poetry is better than philosophy.

520
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:05,120
And that philosophy can not quite
reach the depth of immense life.

521
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,130
That makes two general promises.

522
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:09,920
Toy everybody tells us that
we can all be like you, like,

523
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:14,270
like an ears going from Troy
to Latam. And Nantais says, no,

524
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:19,271
this is not really say much that say
anything or talk about the reality.

525
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,930
And the individuality of my life.
Poetic language is for him.

526
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,640
The language that addresses these issues
and therefore poor to here is seen as a

527
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:33,200
version of history. You know, this is,
you had the writer, he says to Virgil,

528
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,520
who wrote that poem dealing with
Roman history, poetry and history,

529
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,730
the deal with the world of contingency
and not the world of universal and the,

530
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,780
and therefore potentially empty
promises. So that's the, the uh,

531
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,770
the great change,

532
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:53,771
the great new interpretation that
Dante's advancing about a part of virtue.

533
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:59,120
And what Virgil, we'll tell
him is that, uh, uh, the, uh,

534
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:01,520
the go on talking about Dante,

535
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:06,430
we'll call him a master and
a, and author. This is a, uh,

536
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,180
great sage and all that. And
uh, and virtual says to him,

537
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,710
this is very simple.
You must take another road.

538
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:20,510
You are going the wrong way. This
is not, that's what I call the,

539
00:35:20,511 --> 00:35:23,960
the idea that came to one is
the rehearsal to the whole poem.

540
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,080
It gives the story of a journey,

541
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:31,130
a journey that fails,
a journey that is a bolted,

542
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,520
that's not the way you go. It's not,
you know, you find yourself lost.

543
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:39,130
What do you do? You try to
go quickly up to the, uh,

544
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:44,040
uh, to the destination. You can climb up
the hill and you think you can make it.

545
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,580
No, no, no. Uh,

546
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,260
virtual replies that he has
to go in a different way.

547
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,210
He might reach the same point, the
same destination, the world of justice,

548
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,980
division of God, the idea of
love, the good as he calls it.

549
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,290
But he must go down
that the way up is down.

550
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,680
He has to go through the whole spiral,

551
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,660
through the horrors and the suffering
of hell then reemerged through purgatory

552
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,890
in order to be able to reach the
beatific vision. That's very simple.

553
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:21,190
The way up is down.
And this is something that,

554
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,930
that marks the difference
between philosophical
presumption and the notion of a

555
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,020
spiritual Christian humility that he
has to pursue and wants to pursue.

556
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,400
So this is, uh, uh, it, the, the, the,
the conversation between them, uh,

557
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,430
goes on with this a prophecy
of the so called Hound,

558
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,220
uh, page 27 line 100. He
says, you know, the, uh,

559
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:49,640
the world is in such disarray and yet 100,

560
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,980
they're very mysterious and enigmatic
prophecy that will come to when they

561
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:56,100
discuss by the time we come
to the end of purgatory.

562
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,960
And so now the journey begins.

563
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:02,790
Then he set out and I came on behind him.
That's the end of Canto one.

564
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,060
And we come to Canton to where now it's
worth the time of the year since this

565
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,400
is, this has to be a historical
irreducible and, and, and, and,

566
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:17,330
and essentially a biographical
experience that has to be very careful.

567
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,350
He will give us the time,

568
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,500
that precise time and place
of his experience. Uh, we are,

569
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:29,770
are the poem starts on Good Friday in
the evening of Good Friday of the year

570
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,860
1300. These are the, so it's, it's,

571
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,560
it's a very crystal mimetic we call
it an invitation of Christ kind of

572
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:42,000
experience because will emerge to
the light to purgatory on Easter,

573
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,840
Easter Sunday. But Dante says, but
why should I take this journey?

574
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,040
It's such extraordinary. You hear
such a, this is the whole brand,

575
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:54,870
the whole substance of cancer to
ignoring. He as he says, I'm not poor.

576
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,240
Why should I be here? Why
should I go on, uh, uh,

577
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,580
w poet? I'd be in lines 10. You got this,

578
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,250
me consider my strength is a sufficient,

579
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:09,810
you tell us if the father of
silvers as he went, uh, meaning, uh,

580
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,660
meaning of course and ears, uh, et cetera.

581
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:17,530
And then you also tell us about the Paul.
Uh,

582
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:22,380
and he concludes, but I, why should
I go there? Line 32, and who,

583
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,760
granted, I'm not in years, I'm
not Paul. He's, first of all,

584
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,440
these are the coordinates, the imaginative
coordinates for his own journey.

585
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,040
And he is the hero who brings
about the foundation of,

586
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,430
and then Paul the apostle to the gentile,

587
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,810
the 13th apostle who really brings about
who also goes to Rome, but he goes, oh,

588
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,740
the the, the, the, the spiritual domain
of the church. So these are the tool.

589
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,150
So who is he? That's the first question
he must answer. I'm not an ears,

590
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,480
I'm not poor.
The implication is who am I?

591
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:01,050
This whole part of this story is to find
out who he is and part of this journey

592
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,320
is indeed to find out the part of the
beginning of this journey at least,

593
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,880
is to find out that the poem is written
in order to bring some degree of

594
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,820
redemption and clarity to the world.

595
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,910
He really believes in this in this
way we call salvific role of his own,

596
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,660
of his own voice. Not without
either, not without discouragement,

597
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:27,370
not without a sense of that.
This may indeed be a proud,

598
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,190
arrogant kind,
sort of a posture.

599
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,430
This whole idea about who he
is is immediately countered
by a reflection on his

600
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:43,390
own divided we'll line and that
just want to read this thematically.

601
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,900
And there's one, one wheels where
he willed and with new thoughts,

602
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:48,070
changes purposes.

603
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,120
So he withdraws from what he has begun
such I became on the dock slope for by

604
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:54,521
thinking of it.

605
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:58,750
I brought to not the enterprise that
was so hasty in its beginning. Uh,

606
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:03,810
it will take me really too long to give
you a sense of an appropriate gloss to

607
00:40:04,841 --> 00:40:09,630
this lines. The alliance about
the limitations were willing be,

608
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:14,620
Dante begins by claiming the importance
of the will in the act of knowledge.

609
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,650
And we do see that he saw
aware of it to your waist.

610
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:20,620
One detail that I did not
mention you, you, you,

611
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,270
you realize how the pilgrim moves
throughout, uh, in the, in Canto one.

612
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:29,730
And he will move in December.
We will never talk about it
again. He hobbles in, uh,

613
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,400
in, uh, uh, toward the light
hits. It goes around hobbling.

614
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,760
And that hobbling is part of his being,

615
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:41,440
being wounded and having a wound
that will, that he must somehow heal,

616
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,070
so it would say, well good. Dante
said, voluntary voluntourist not quite.

617
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:48,250
That doesn't believe in philosophy
and intellect, not quite.

618
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:52,570
He believes that the two
faculties of the soul,

619
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:57,430
intellect and will I like the
feet of one's body. They got,

620
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,630
if you really want to walk
fast at least and safely,

621
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,150
you're going to be using both.
Yeah.

622
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,420
Use the intellect and they will buy
soon as he claims the importance of the

623
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:11,530
wheel, which this Socratic
experience had somehow neglected.

624
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:15,520
He goes on reflecting about the
limitations of the will and what are the

625
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:18,820
limitations. One of it is we all
can be divided against itself.

626
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,260
The second one is that they will need
something to regulate it because I can,

627
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,550
I can. We'll any day I can go this
and that. How do I order what I will?

628
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,300
The third limitation of the will,
and we'll talk more about the company,

629
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,920
some of these aspects, but there's
a third limitation with the will,

630
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,990
is that I can never really go
faster than my home wiggle.

631
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,540
I'm a prisoner or if I believe
that that's all I have,

632
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,910
my where I can't go faster than it.

633
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:49,010
If the will is weak and slow and divided,
that's what I am.

634
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:53,630
I can't, I can't go past it. So
some, some of the difficulties.

635
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:55,460
So he,
he goes Ken to true,

636
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,560
trying to think about I the identity
and the purpose of this journey.

637
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:05,570
Who am I? I'm not in ears.
I'm not poor then who am I?

638
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:10,310
That's a great question. And
as soon as he does this, he,

639
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,000
he admits he,
he,

640
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,810
he sheds light on the first
internal issue that he must show.

641
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:21,640
And an internal issue is
the divided, divided. Well,

642
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,060
we come to Canto three. I'm sorry. There
we go a little, little fast, but that's,

643
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,200
we are, we'll moves
fast. Uh, so, you know,

644
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:34,890
this is now Dante enters to the hate.
The Gate of hell are the famous, uh,

645
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,660
uh,
inscription through me the way,

646
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,850
pretty scary and that scares
him. Uh, uh, uh, quite a lot.

647
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,650
And Dante meets the first, uh,
the for sinners that he meets

648
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,760
the so called neutral angels can two,

649
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:57,170
three around line student flooring.
I and I,

650
00:42:57,171 --> 00:42:59,690
my head is circled with said,
master,

651
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,730
what is this are here and who are these
people who seem so mastered by their

652
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:06,710
pain?
And he said to me,

653
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,600
this miserable state is borne by the
wretched souls of those who live without

654
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,490
disgrace.
And without praise.

655
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:18,470
They're mixed with a Katif choir
of the angels who are not rebels,

656
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:23,890
no faithful to God by word
that my Texas for themselves,

657
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,010
the right translation is by themselves.

658
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,340
Because if you are for yourself,
you are for someone.

659
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,040
These are the angels called neutral,

660
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:39,340
who in the great cosmic battle with
which the world begins between God and,

661
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:46,370
and the satanic forces just
became spectators just watching.

662
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,200
So that sensation is bear
in Italian says bear Stacy,

663
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:56,300
which we translate this by themselves.
So taking a separation. In other words,

664
00:43:56,301 --> 00:44:01,301
Dante begins by dramatizing that which
to him is the most serious of sense,

665
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,280
not being disengaged,

666
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,550
not taking sides in the belief that
somehow you wait and see what the outcome

667
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:13,780
is. And then you can go on taking
sides. That's the, the, the,

668
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:18,760
the start of this, uh, of this
experience. And then he goes on a wire,

669
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,010
the grievers, and he responds, they
are, have no hope of death, et Cetera.

670
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,870
Our PT and justice despise them.
Let's not talk of them,

671
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,170
but look at them and pass.
There's even name them.

672
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:35,230
He won't even name them because to name
them will be to bring them into reality.

673
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:40,320
And then we'll travel at the stands and
is a sign of their way in which they,

674
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,220
the realize the world that
he use the world tool,

675
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:49,340
a pure show of their own
for their own spectatorship.

676
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,700
So, uh, he, he goes on from here and, uh,

677
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,620
and now, uh, the second action is that he,

678
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,700
he sees Charin the famous, uh, uh,

679
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,740
uh, uh, he goes into the
ferry who will share,

680
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,310
who will ferry the oldest
souls. And, uh, uh,

681
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,160
gives an extraordinary
description of this figure, uh,

682
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:18,180
and the souls who blasphemed God
and the parents, the humankind.

683
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,690
And then there is an extraordinary
image that I want to read with you when

684
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:26,691
Dante's to describe the souls and what
he sees as holes that go on the boat of

685
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,120
chairman. This is toward the end of
Canto three lines. Month one, one 12,

686
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:35,250
and following as in autumn,

687
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,630
the leaves drop off one after the other.

688
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,440
The branch is old.
It spoils on the ground.

689
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,660
So the wicked seed, um, the,

690
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:53,661
we could see the Adam fling themselves
from that shore one by one at the signal

691
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:55,980
as a falcon.

692
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,420
And it's recall that's the
part of the dark water.

693
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:02,850
And behold they've
landed on the other side,

694
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,960
a fresh cloud collect again on this,

695
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,990
my son said,
the culture's master,

696
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,120
all those that die in the wrath of God
assemble here from every land and they're

697
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:17,400
eager to cross the river,
et Cetera.

698
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,640
But I really want to focus on this
image of the autumn leave whereby Dante

699
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:28,881
describes that dead souls as the leaves
in autumn that had fallen from the tree.

700
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:36,200
And the conceit is that the souls are
leaves and it's an image that Dante takes

701
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,790
straight from the need of Virgil.

702
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,870
When books six, also virtual describes
the book, six of your need, uh,

703
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,090
focuses on the descent
of engineers into hades.

704
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,070
And there he also weights and he sees
the souls waiting for reincarnation.

705
00:46:56,071 --> 00:47:00,740
The famous theory of the met them
psychosis, you may have heard this term,

706
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,470
she doesn't mean it's a
reincarnation of the soles.

707
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:08,130
The souls are waiting to be reincarnated
and come back in an endless cycle.

708
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,540
And in Dante,

709
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,950
virtual himself had taken this
emerge from Houma of course,

710
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:19,490
but Dante changes Virgil's the thrust
of Burgess image because in Virgil it's

711
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,104
quite accurate.

712
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:26,550
He has a Pythagorean
understanding of existence.

713
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,490
They say life is a complete,
a continuous circle.

714
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,970
The we love becoming Plato's
we'd of becoming time goes,

715
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,770
goes on and on.
Returning on itself,

716
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,920
we always witness the circle and cycle
of the seasons and this is also what

717
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:45,460
happens with human life.

718
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:51,030
There's nothing really unique about us
because we die and then we can wait for

719
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:56,050
the reincarnation of our soul.
Okay.

720
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,190
So death in Virgil is
an Ilit Jaya experience.

721
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,990
It's never really tragic and cannot be
tragic because it lacks that edge of the,

722
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,370
the uniqueness there.
Yeah.

723
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:11,260
Just something particular and special
has been happening to the world because I

724
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:15,760
am here certainly to my world because
I am here and then I made this appear.

725
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:21,070
Okay. Dante changes this
idea of the circularity,

726
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:25,720
the [inaudible] quality of death
and life that we have in virtual.

727
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:29,170
Why do I call it a giant?
Because you die and yet you can come back.

728
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,250
Because we're really like leaves and
justice leaves fall in the autumn.

729
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,610
You just wait for the spring where
I will not be the same leaves,

730
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,370
but leaves very much like
those that have just fallen.

731
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,400
We'll return them to
look about Dante does.

732
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:47,590
Dante goes on focusing on the idea of the
uniqueness of every leaf as in autumn.

733
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:52,890
They leaves drop off one after the other
till the branch sees all the spores on

734
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,530
the ground. So first of all,
the wicked seed of Adam.

735
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:02,230
So the we there is already some kind of a,
some evil,

736
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:06,370
uh, being acknowledged at the root
of, of, of, of our own existence.

737
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:09,580
The wicked seed of Adam flinging
themselves from the shore,

738
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,410
one by one at the signal
Sfr corner that's recall,

739
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,540
that's the depart of the dark water.

740
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,980
And before they have landed on the other
side of fresh crop crowd collected.

741
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:24,130
And then, uh, on this. So for Dante,

742
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:29,340
this image shows not that leaves
our souls are like leaves,

743
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,520
but that a leaf can be described.
This is soul.

744
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:38,580
Only few insist on it's own uniqueness
and the fact that it will never return.

745
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,320
That is one con fairly contemporary
report who understood this.

746
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:46,030
And I really want to
quote to you a few lines.

747
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:49,300
I don't know that I remember the ball.
It's Gerald Manley Hopkins.

748
00:49:49,301 --> 00:49:53,200
Some of you who have read, who read
English literature. Remember this,

749
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,370
you may remember this.

750
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:59,790
He writes his famous poem called
Golden Grove Margaret Golden Rule.

751
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:04,300
You know the poem, you know what
I'm talking about, Margaret,

752
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:09,390
are you grieving over Golden Grove and
leaving leaves like the things of man you

753
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:14,194
care for?

754
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:19,470
Can you are as the heart grows old or
come to such sites called et cetera

755
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:25,120
continues. What is Hopkins? Who
really is reading this image?

756
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,070
What is he really saying?
He Sang, he understands.

757
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:32,870
It leaves like the things of men.
You care for Kenya,

758
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,520
what comes back.
It's not the life of human beings.

759
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:42,550
What comes back at the things that human
beings may use and waste those things

760
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,840
so that the right analogy for Gerald,

761
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:49,250
Gerald Manley Hopkins in a sense really
in the wake of Dante is between the

762
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:50,120
things of man,

763
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:55,121
the things that we have that the things
that we can produce and leaves not

764
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:59,150
souls.
In formal terms.

765
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,540
This really means that Dante is replacing
the notion of epic circularity that

766
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:10,050
you find in the classics, the classics
of Homer, the clocks, classics.

767
00:51:10,051 --> 00:51:14,060
How such as the Aeneid
with an idea of linear,

768
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:15,763
novel,

769
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:20,390
the life of human beings is best described
the formerly by a novel in the sense

770
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:23,600
that we are caught in
a journey that goes on.

771
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,170
It's unique and will reach its
destination, whatever it will be.

772
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,050
We don't know yet at
this point of the poem.

773
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:35,450
And now Dante enters into the
circle, into the, the garden,

774
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:39,210
the first experience in book
and Canto for, uh, I will, uh,

775
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,410
I want to give you some time to,
uh,

776
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,320
but I will have to deal with Canto
fall and then I will stop after to come

777
00:51:45,321 --> 00:51:47,820
straight to the point about Canto for,
uh,

778
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,580
Dante comes to what is
called limbo are the,

779
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,080
a word that comes from Latin in Latin.

780
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,640
That's what the limbo is. This is, uh,
uh, the edge. That's what it means.

781
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,660
Lambros you're usually in Italian,

782
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,910
you speak of the lay of the lenders
of the air, the edge of, of a,

783
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,840
or a dress or my jacket and so on.
Uh, uh, comes to the area of health,

784
00:52:10,841 --> 00:52:15,350
which really is outside of her. In
fact, it's a, it's, it's, it's a, it's,

785
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:19,250
it's very much like,
uh, the Virgilian, uh,

786
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,090
afterlife of the virtuous and here he
meets a lot of which it's described as a

787
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:26,710
garden, one of the gardens,
one of the three, four gardens.

788
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,560
You find sort of pre figuration of the,

789
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:33,350
in many ways of the earthly paradise
and Gardens in, in purgatory,

790
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:37,760
but it's also prefigure aeration of
the world, of, uh, of paradise, where,

791
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:41,570
where the city Jerusalem is
described as a garden. Uh,

792
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:46,310
so the first thing about this,
uh, uh, it's called, uh, the, uh,

793
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,520
it's called the locals are Mainers,
uh,

794
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:54,100
in case you want to know
what the technical serve, uh,

795
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,880
low who's Aminos, uh, the
kind of idyllic place.

796
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,450
Uh,
and at that,

797
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,580
this is a term of first theology that
belongs to my very much the epic world.

798
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:09,830
And in the epic world of reasons
later in the renaissance, uh,

799
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:12,340
whether it's going to be spent her or,

800
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,170
or even Dasso or Milton,

801
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:20,270
there's always the story of the hero who
reaches this idyllic bucolic place and

802
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,680
relax. So it's really appraised
of the breakdown of the, the, the,

803
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,640
ah,
Everence hailed as the hero of the,

804
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:31,750
the adventurous spirit and all his shows.

805
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,760
So this is the irony in
Luther restructures that
whenever heroes seem to look

806
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:42,201
for a pause to the quest by
reaching the garden and relaxing,

807
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:48,080
that's where they find out they are
in the most dangerous situation.

808
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:52,800
That whenever you think that you are
safe and you can disarm and there's,

809
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:54,120
you know, there is uh, uh,

810
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:58,740
the running cool water of the river that
is the shade that is the fragrance of

811
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:03,000
the landscape. This is the way that, where
the w the, the, the where with all the,

812
00:54:03,001 --> 00:54:06,390
the, the, the, the, the, the
description of this bucolic gardens.

813
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,910
That's exactly when the snake will appear.

814
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:14,270
That's exactly when the enemy will be
capable of reaching you and overwhelm you.

815
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:18,600
And this is also, in other words,
there are all his places of temptation.

816
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:22,620
And that's what happens
here. Dante here, uh, uh,

817
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:26,190
arrives and he sees the poets cantal for,

818
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,270
it's an extraordinary,
they're all virtuals Hayden's,

819
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:34,830
he sees the poets and the
breakpoints poets that, uh, uh,

820
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,940
uh, he will see the first post that he'll
see are, first of all, he is all the, the,

821
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,580
the, the figures from mark. He
will enumerate the characters,

822
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:48,270
scientists, philosophers from
the Greek and Roman world,

823
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,540
but put a little bit at
the edge. You know, the,

824
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,080
the real don't seem to have much impact
on the situation here. But then, uh,

825
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,710
the dramatic situation
is when he, uh, uh, uh,

826
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,760
lines 80 and following, uh, or you, uh,

827
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:04,230
he sees the poets,

828
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:08,340
the classical poets from
homer to Horace and Ovid,

829
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,210
or you who Horner owners,
both science and art,

830
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,560
who are these two have such honor that
it sets them apart from the condition of

831
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:20,790
the rest. And he said to me, the
virtual speaking, the honorable fame,

832
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:25,610
which resounds in their life are both case
against favor in heaven, uh, et Cetera.

833
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,390
Honor the loft deport.

834
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:32,391
He has his shade returns that left us
with the voice had paused and there was

835
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:37,740
silence as a footbridge shades coming
to us. The looks were another sad,

836
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,590
no joyful. It's be fit. Limbo.

837
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:44,320
This is really like life here.
Uh,

838
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,310
that's what the afterlife
is in Dante's conception.

839
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:52,620
It's only an extension or we
choose to do on this earth.

840
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,810
If you really think that what life, the
beauty of life, which is not a bad idea,

841
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,790
is talking about having endless
seminars of aesthetics, a poetry.

842
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,580
It's this poet's too.
That's what your afterlife is.

843
00:56:05,581 --> 00:56:10,110
You sit down on the sit on the grass
and you go on talking about beautiful

844
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:15,060
things. He says, he says the good master,

845
00:56:15,061 --> 00:56:20,061
begin mark him that with their with sold
in hand who comes before the three is

846
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:25,240
there lord, he is homer.
Um, the sovereign port,

847
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,570
he that comes next is Horace,
the moralist,

848
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,610
all of it is the third and
the last looking, uh, famous,

849
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,590
uh,
epic poet,

850
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,800
Dante will again celebrate in purgatory.

851
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:42,370
Since each shares with me in
the name that one voice uttered,

852
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,690
they give me honorable
welcome and in this Duwell,

853
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:51,250
thus I saw assemble the noble
school school in Greek means,

854
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,600
uh, it's also leisure illusionary
life scholar, right? This, the,

855
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,700
the, the, the,

856
00:56:57,701 --> 00:57:02,701
the world of play and the [inaudible]
load of lofty song who flies like an eagle

857
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:06,290
homer above the rest.
And the irony of course is,

858
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:10,630
is it blind and the Eagle or to
have the sharp, the sharp view,

859
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:15,610
the sharp vision that they,
Homer's visionaries and then the vision,

860
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:15,941
right.

861
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:20,870
He looks he's blind because he's looking
inward in order to know what the psalm

862
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,250
he has to say or be about after the
head talked together for a time,

863
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:28,720
they turned to me with a sign of greeting
and my master's smiled at this and

864
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:30,850
then they showed Mr greater honor for,

865
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:35,370
they made me one of their number so
that I was the sixth among those higher

866
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:40,150
intelligences. Thus we went home as
far as the light talking of things,

867
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:44,680
which were fitting for that place in
a widget as well. Now to be silent.

868
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,040
So he is Dante,
uh,

869
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:53,610
inscribes himself in the history of
western poetry from homer to dance.

870
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,480
He counts himself as sixth.

871
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,750
Among them is Virgil is Luca is all of
it has Horace and of course the master of

872
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:06,100
them all. Oh, mom. Okay. So
we go from homer to Dante.

873
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:10,950
It's a little history if you wish of
western Western poetry and Dante things

874
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,040
that he belongs to it.

875
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,500
We could say a number of things about
what they are talking about. He says,

876
00:58:15,501 --> 00:58:20,380
it doesn't say, uh, we talk about
beautiful things which we infer.

877
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:24,460
We can easily infer. They
talk about poetry, they talk
about their craft, right?

878
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:28,310
They may be a little link that
I would like you to reflect on,

879
00:58:28,311 --> 00:58:31,630
on your own between the
garden and the kind of poetry,

880
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:34,870
the kind of beauty that they
are really talking about.

881
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,390
This is the way Dante's imagination works.

882
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,960
You have to pull together things
that don't seem to be described.

883
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:45,310
So this is the garden. There's some
kind of self absorption about this.

884
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:50,570
It seems to be a kind of self enclosure.
Part is kind of poetry. It's a,

885
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:54,400
it's a little scene that reflects on
what their spiritual condition may have

886
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:55,234
been like.

887
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:59,880
But what is the most surprising and what
constitutes the temptation of this camp?

888
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,880
The temptation of the scene
for the pilgrims on spiritual
pilgrimage is involved

889
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:09,700
in a spiritual descent,
which turns out to be a sense.

890
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:14,910
He says at one point I was
sixth among such genius to see,

891
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:19,630
do you see the discrepancy? Did you see
how this is jarring? Can you hear it?

892
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,560
He's going down for redemption,
his descending and humility,

893
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:28,160
and yet now he talks as a poet,
his poetic voices,

894
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,770
one that elevates itself.

895
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,590
There seems to be a kind of
discrepancy between the two.

896
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:38,950
That's the great temptation of
[inaudible] to believe that is a poet.

897
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,110
He has been claiming that poetry
is better than philosophy.

898
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:50,111
That porch is like history and the first
concern now he has is to reflect on the

899
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:53,390
hollowness of this claim.

900
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:58,070
How this kind of claim about the
importance of poetry can turn out to be a

901
00:59:58,071 --> 01:00:02,790
temptation for him.
It's a Hubris and I, I,

902
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:07,550
I focus on it as I have focused
on it because in effect,

903
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:12,880
but we're going to discuss next time canto
five is an extended reflection at way

904
01:00:13,261 --> 01:00:18,261
for Dante to reflect on this claim and
extended reflection on the dangers of

905
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:24,221
such a claim and the
responsibility of writing poetry.

906
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:29,660
Dante, we'll meet the great heroine
of all love stories. Francesca,

907
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,860
everybody knows about this.
Fantastic figure, a lovely figure.

908
01:00:33,861 --> 01:00:36,140
Francesca who dies for love,

909
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,440
but Dante's actually encountering a
reader of his own poetry and he witnesses

910
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:44,880
the kind of traps and,
and,

911
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,900
and risk that reading in price.

912
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,130
We are going to go on next time
thinking about this whole question of,

913
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:56,700
of reading a responsibilities
of writing the can't afford,

914
01:00:56,710 --> 01:01:00,620
but I can not live without saying
something about the epic quality.

915
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:02,960
But I've been just talking about,
uh,

916
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:07,990
I've been defining the poem really is
and novelistic visa vi the circular

917
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:13,100
structure of uh, uh, uh,
Virgil's understanding of, uh,

918
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,910
the reincarnation and therefore the
great notion of why or what an epic is.

919
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:20,990
And now I will say,
actually Dante goes on mixing these John,

920
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:22,640
as soon as you formulate something,

921
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,000
Dante has a way of
undercutting that formulation.

922
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:31,300
Can't afford ends with a miniature
representation of the epic quality of this

923
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:37,340
text that goes on enumerating all
the souls that are, he can see,

924
01:01:37,341 --> 01:01:40,070
which is really, as you know,
if you remember from urine, uh,

925
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:44,420
your ilium on the gates who
really are my one point,

926
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:47,630
Helen will go on a numbering.

927
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:50,750
All the ships of the Greeks to old prior.
Remember that scene?

928
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:54,140
Some of you may remember that, and this
is the weekend or four ends with lines.

929
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:54,950
Uh,

930
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:59,950
one 2014 in there before me on the
animal green were shown to me the great

931
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:03,020
spirits by the sight of
whom I'm uplifted in myself.

932
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,840
I saw electra with men in her company and
you Hector in the knee is and sees us.

933
01:02:07,841 --> 01:02:11,000
So Camilla fantasy layer. So
legislation, King Levenia,

934
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:15,770
I saw Brutus who drove out
Tarquin Lucrece, Julia, Marsha,

935
01:02:15,771 --> 01:02:16,371
Cornelia.

936
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:20,970
And by himself I saw
Saladin sign of honor,

937
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,090
the salary and who sits by himself.

938
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:28,620
I said kind of lofty state.
And when I raised my eyes a little higher,

939
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:32,190
I saw the master of them, not the now
sitting a minute. Philosophic family,

940
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,630
Socrates, Plato, uh, the other
one was always thoughtful.

941
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:40,760
Democritus they origin is all the Greek
philosophers. And then Orpheus, Cicero,

942
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:44,440
lean was Seneca, Euclid Ptolemy. Um, yeah,

943
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:48,420
it version of classical and cycled PTO.

944
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,480
All of the knowledge is gathered
here and yet to has a website,

945
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,850
keep it in the,
the traditional of encyclopedias.

946
01:02:56,851 --> 01:03:00,870
This formal structures as he want
to organize the world of knowledge.

947
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,750
That is something, one
thing about them. Why,

948
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:08,610
what's one thing they never tell you?
How you can really educate yourself.

949
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:13,800
Then never described the process of
education to know that to describe the

950
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:14,760
process of education,

951
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:19,761
you got to have an encyclopedic poem
where you are showing the phases and the

952
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:24,110
stages of learning as the pilgrim.
We'll show, we'll show it twice.

953
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:28,740
The second thing that I have to say is
that in any enumeration cause you have

954
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:33,741
here an epic can hemorrhage and that will
close by the marks for the day and you

955
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:39,291
buy Asians always imply the wish of a
narrative such as an encyclopedia cause

956
01:03:42,991 --> 01:03:45,300
it's a little bit of an
encyclopedic form I say

957
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:50,180
to encompass the whole of reality.

958
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:54,980
That's what encyclopedia as one to do
have reality of it intellectual reality

959
01:03:55,340 --> 01:04:00,250
and yet enumerations by the very
virtue of being a numeration.

960
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:04,550
So we'll tell you that no
total ideation is possible.

961
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:08,300
That is something that always escaped the,
the,

962
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:13,220
the four more ordering that,
the encyclopedias one to reach.

963
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:17,480
And for now, I stopped with my
remarks and we have a few minutes, uh,

964
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:22,310
in case there are questions
as I hope that, uh, I, um,

965
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,300
welcome questions. So I will
repeat your questions by the way,

966
01:04:26,301 --> 01:04:29,570
for the benefit of the videotape,
Huh?

967
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:37,053
Please

968
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:42,260
talks about the first group
centers who were for themselves.

969
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:46,040
It didn't take a side. Do you think
that was also a political commentary?

970
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,750
Yes. The question is, uh, Dante
talks about the neutral angels are,

971
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,080
uh, he calls him for themselves. So we
say it's by themselves. Uh, and the,

972
01:04:56,090 --> 01:05:00,120
and the question then really is, is
that also a political commentary? And,

973
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,100
and before I could rephrase a, I could
repeat this, the question I said yes,

974
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:04,934
absolutely.

975
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:10,030
Down to we'll use the very same experience
for himself later in paradise where

976
01:05:12,651 --> 01:05:17,651
he will say that in many
ways being by one by oneself,

977
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:22,330
there are times when that
can become inactive virtual.

978
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,610
What are the notion of neutrality
is going to be redefined?

979
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:30,000
Nancy doesn't like clearly
neutrality, right? Uh, why,

980
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,290
why is he, does he find neutrality? Uh,

981
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:37,860
because it's the language or provation
for him. It's really a way of, uh, um,

982
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:41,360
you know, it's, it's, it's,
uh, uh, it's in the, the,

983
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:44,980
the decision or to take decisions because
we are always making a decision even

984
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:48,700
when we think of, we are not making good
decisions. You really are. But to him,

985
01:05:48,701 --> 01:05:52,150
that is the sign of a great cover dish.

986
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,960
He explains that in cosmic terms,

987
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:59,860
this is the metaphysics of the,
the, the Great War in heaven,

988
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:05,250
which by the way enables me not to say
that it gives the whole of hell a kind of

989
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:10,060
symmetrical structure because it clearly
begins with the neutral angels and ends

990
01:06:10,061 --> 01:06:12,580
with the encounter with
Lucifer at the end.

991
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:17,110
So you see that this is really the kind
of what frames, uh, the narrative of hell.

992
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:21,460
But to go back to your question, when
Dante is going to talk about politics,

993
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:25,690
he also believed for a while that
he had to take sides. He did.

994
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,460
And he did are going back now to the
few remarks I made about his language,

995
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:36,850
his political involvement. Uh, on the
first, the first class for seminar,

996
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,520
he was banned.

997
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:44,521
He was sent into exile and then he removed
himself from more partisan politics.

998
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,190
And how did he do this and what
did he do this for? A while,

999
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:55,900
he was a wealth being thrown out
of Florence with many others.

1000
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:57,530
Um,
uh,

1001
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:02,580
also as an actor of a punishment for a
decision he had made to throw out the

1002
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:08,410
gibber leans among whom his own best
friend with Okawville Kantor who died in

1003
01:07:08,411 --> 01:07:12,910
exile. So he's thrown out and we
do know this historical happenings.

1004
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:18,180
They spend the first few years of their
exile parting and making and going on

1005
01:07:19,901 --> 01:07:24,370
through machinations as to how to
get back to Florence and dammit,

1006
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:26,650
really make them pay here,

1007
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,860
realizes very quickly the
wickedness of this plan.

1008
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:35,210
He realizes that his own party is
no better than that of the Gibbons.

1009
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:40,500
And so he removes himself from
them that act to removal from the,

1010
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,590
the, the criminal violence
that he and his other,

1011
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:45,940
uh,

1012
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,890
accomplices were for a while thinking
about turns out to have been madness.

1013
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:55,120
And so he decides in this act of virtual,
uh,

1014
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,600
absolute solitude and that is by himself.

1015
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,070
So there is a kind of judgment but very
refined and how can you go and really

1016
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:06,910
describing that the s the
act of neutrality is bad.

1017
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,860
And yet there is a way in which there
are times where neutrality can become

1018
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,120
nothing less than virtuous decision is.

1019
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:18,680
He will make no other questions

1020
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:22,740
please.

1021
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:23,820
I have a question.

1022
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,460
Last.
Yes please.

1023
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,190
Hello. Uh, friendship and love it.

1024
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:37,710
There was no conversation about loss and
we know from his history they're both,

1025
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,190
uh,
both of them

1026
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,560
were married, he had children. And I am,

1027
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:51,570
I'm wondering if the physical aspect
of love is irrelevant or the public,

1028
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:58,270
the question refers to the remark,

1029
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:03,350
a remark I made back then was picked up
by a student are also another students.

1030
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:08,870
The remark about love and friendship
as the two are dramatized in a,

1031
01:09:09,151 --> 01:09:13,200
in the Vita Nuova and a,
it refers to a wants to know,

1032
01:09:13,201 --> 01:09:17,460
actually wants me to explore more the
role of lost since we know that Dante was

1033
01:09:17,461 --> 01:09:22,140
married and, and, and a, ah Ha.
What does last have to do with love?

1034
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:25,740
I take, that's really
the, uh, the question. Uh,

1035
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,910
and now let me just say that it's a very
complicated question and I will talk

1036
01:09:29,911 --> 01:09:34,911
about this next time when we deal with
Francesca who is of course the heroine of

1037
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:41,640
lust, if there's ever one. Uh, and
then we'll see what Dante means.

1038
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:46,260
By that I mean the,
it clearly is an issue related to love,

1039
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:50,410
fundamentally related to love,
but to believe in.

1040
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:53,700
I'm really from Froebel would
confuse some of you here, but don't,

1041
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:58,740
don't be confused to believe that Dantas
judgment of Francesca is limited to the

1042
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:04,890
representation of Canto five where he
describes the relationship between the and

1043
01:10:04,891 --> 01:10:09,360
love less than love, uh,
would be a grand mistake.

1044
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,220
Dante understands,

1045
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:16,350
understands that without
physicality there can be no love,

1046
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:17,370
uh,

1047
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:22,170
that there is no soul which
is not connected to a body.

1048
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:26,250
In fact, some of the remarks that
I made today are really about,

1049
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:29,340
can be construed.
I did not make the point,

1050
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:34,410
but can be construed as his sense
of the inevitability of the body.

1051
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,720
That the intellect in and of by itself,

1052
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:39,690
this whole inner itself
without materiality,

1053
01:10:39,691 --> 01:10:44,691
without some degree of being wedded to
the body is really not a part of the

1054
01:10:46,231 --> 01:10:47,520
human experience.

1055
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,600
So this is what I was saying to them about
the fact that the journey is not just

1056
01:10:51,601 --> 01:10:56,320
an intellectual journey, has to be done
in the body, is part of his sense of uh,

1057
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,760
the, the inevitability of
the body. And after all,

1058
01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:03,730
this is really what his
Christianity is about. Uh,

1059
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,680
it's about the incarnation is
about the being embodied, about,

1060
01:11:07,681 --> 01:11:12,681
about the divinity being embodied and
therefore entering our human human

1061
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:17,490
condition. Let me also say that Dante
goes on thinking about Francesca.

1062
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:22,970
He condemns her and Francesca is
always circling around in the state of

1063
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:27,790
permanent desire with bowel over
those, by moving around. Yeah,

1064
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:31,980
they really describe me, the
unquiet hearts. If you are,

1065
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:35,070
when you are at peace,
you just stop and sit.

1066
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:38,670
She just goes on moving around and
the round, that's their punishment.

1067
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:44,750
And yet he remembers her
when Dante reaches the habit
of metaphysics in paradise

1068
01:11:45,251 --> 01:11:48,030
and his to talk about
the kiss of creation,

1069
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:53,380
how creation God creates the world by
imprinting a kiss on the material that he

1070
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:56,070
had at his disposal.

1071
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:00,360
And the language that he will use is
going to be the language of Francesca.

1072
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:06,050
And that to me means that the case of
Francesca can also be construed as the

1073
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:11,280
existential, um, our counter to gods,

1074
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,470
the gods kiss on creation and say,
wait,

1075
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:15,470
I don't think that he's
redeeming her there.

1076
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,870
There's no such a thing as the
redemption for the infernal souls.

1077
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:23,370
And yet there is an idea that is something
that may have gone wrong and we have

1078
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:27,000
to see what it is. And it's not the last
we have to see what the situation is.

1079
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:30,750
It's not the last, uh, I don't
think it's homely lost. Uh,

1080
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,880
and that is part of,

1081
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:36,750
or there's something even
larger at bought her.

1082
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:41,990
What the mistake that she seems
to be making is of a different,

1083
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:46,700
so the, I keep you hanging
until next time, so that, uh,

1084
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:51,240
otherwise, what's the point? It will will,
uh, uh, we have total to Luca Canto five.

1085
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:55,470
Let's read Canto five for next Tuesday,
but before you go, uh, there's,

1086
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,260
there's some time, some case they
are, they have a couple of minutes.

1087
01:12:58,420 --> 01:12:59,253
Other questions

1088
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,450
please
is talking to Virgil.

1089
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,530
He says you're the only one in my
writing through the normal stuff,

1090
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,493
which I had been,

1091
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,390
uh, it's how he says, oh,

1092
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,750
so he's saying that he's,

1093
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,380
that he's taken his style from him and
that stop or what she's been with for

1094
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:24,610
which he's gained honor. He's not
honored as an epic poet. He's not,

1095
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:27,700
that's not what are the
implications of what I'm saying?

1096
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:29,670
Okay. The, the,

1097
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:34,670
the question is referenced in the
encounter between the pilgrim and,

1098
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:40,010
uh, the pilgrim and virtual in candle
one over, uh, over in federal way.

1099
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,010
Dante, in what I call the
Cup Tatsuo Benevolence. We,

1100
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:47,270
we're capturing the benevolence
of virtual, the only living,

1101
01:13:47,271 --> 01:13:50,000
he doesn't even know if it's a shade or,
or a human being.

1102
01:13:50,001 --> 01:13:51,770
It turns out that he's a
human being. He says, well,

1103
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,420
you are the poet from whom I took car.

1104
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:58,460
The style that has honored
that has made me on her.

1105
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:02,270
And the, the, the salt of
the, the real question is,

1106
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:05,270
this is a little bit of a
lie, isn't it? Because Dante,

1107
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:09,900
but this time is not really
known as an epic poet. Uh,

1108
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:14,590
I would really say [inaudible] I say
it's part of the simulation rhetorical

1109
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:17,570
simulation of a, of, uh,

1110
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,950
capturing the benevolence of the listener.
At the same time.

1111
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:23,950
It's really an
acknowledgement, uh, of, uh,

1112
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:28,120
Virgil's mastery and
what is virtuous mastery.

1113
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:29,560
Um,
you know,

1114
01:14:29,561 --> 01:14:34,561
Dante really thought that his own poetry
is that Latin is not a dead language,

1115
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:40,860
that the vernacular is really
the way Latin has become in time.

1116
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:45,520
So they continue with the, between
Virgil and him. It's real, it's real.

1117
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:50,030
So there's a kind of continuity
of poetic continue with it. Uh,

1118
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,140
but you're quite right that it's
literally, it's not true at that point.

1119
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,610
Dante's more of a province,

1120
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:58,870
our port or the portal follows the still
novice to the poets of the sweet new

1121
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:03,040
style from Bologna and Florence.
Then, uh, then Virgil. Yeah.

1122
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:05,380
But thank you so much.
We'll see you next time.
