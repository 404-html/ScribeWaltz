1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,890
We're meeting

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,440
kitchen.
Um,

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,260
and there's the middle
section of the poem,

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,950
literally a place of transition between,
uh,

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,770
the have the world of health and, and,
and all the evil that we have witnessed.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,550
And then the, the, the realm of glory,

7
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,440
which is going to be paradise. Um, uh,

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,600
let me say a few things about purgatory,

9
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:42,940
both as an idea and, uh, as, as a,

10
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,490
a poetic construction, Dante's
poetic construction, um,

11
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,320
as an idea, uh, the were
Dante understands it.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,160
Precatory is part of a human geography,

13
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,990
as you know, it's, uh, located
in the southern hemisphere.

14
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:06,740
There are two hemispheres
in medieval geography,

15
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:09,680
the Northern Hemisphere,
which is that when we inhabit,

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,280
and then there is the southern hemisphere,
uh,

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,830
the purgatory is an island.

18
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,950
I have tried to explain to you last time
the origin of this place in Nantucket

19
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:27,050
Mitchell boy, uh, uh,
thinking, uh, it, uh,

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,080
it's an island that emerged from the
northern hemisphere at the time of

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,310
Lucifer's for, uh, the
earth trembles and retreats.

22
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,200
That's the idea,
uh,

23
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,760
as Lucifer approaches and such does,
it creates the void,

24
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:48,370
which becomes hades, the
abyss and the island. And the,

25
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,820
the purgatory emerges on the other side,
the southern hemisphere,

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,100
the top of the pool. That story there
is the island of, there is the, the,

27
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,970
the peak is the garden of Eden.

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,780
They are where God placed
Adam and eve. So that, uh,

29
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,680
from this point of view,
purgatory is part of human geography,

30
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:10,460
but it's historically in
accessible to human beings.

31
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,970
One hero that already we
already met you listen in,

32
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,740
in federal 26 tries to approach
an island at retrospectively,

33
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,090
we can understand that that was,
uh, the island of purgatory.

34
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,250
This is a place of immortality that
you listeners wanted to reach and uh,

35
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,230
could not that journey of his and the,
the shipwreck and tragically,

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,210
uh, in federal 26 is the text
for that kind of concern.

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,260
The other trait about a
purgatory moral trade, uh,

38
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,030
since this is now,
uh,

39
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,740
we are going to enter the
realm of reconstruction of
the human and the soul to

40
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:51,910
make sense. A dentist should
place it immediately after hell.

41
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,460
It is as if only by knowing,

42
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,610
only by experiencing more or less as
metaphoric ways we can through the poetry

43
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:05,200
of Dante.
The nature of evil and the horror of it.

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,520
Can we begin to have an
appreciation of, uh, of the good,

45
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,890
the good toad, which, uh,

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,940
now the pilgrim is going to climb.
The other,

47
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,120
the other thing that you should keep
in mind about, uh, uh, about, uh,

48
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,150
progress or in the difficulties that the
poet we'll have, uh, is the following.

49
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,080
Uh,

50
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,080
the perception of moral life and political
life in purgatorial was so satanic,

51
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,900
so narrow, so terrible that Dante's
going to have a lot of quite a,

52
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,950
quite a,
quite a challenge to try to explain the,

53
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,860
the usefulness and,
and the,

54
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,720
and the possibility of reconstructing
a moral world and the political world.

55
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,400
He was, he came very close
to a total rejection of a,

56
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:00,010
of a historical world
and the political world.

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,450
And now he has to find out how that
reconstruction is going to be possible.

58
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,580
The way he will do this is literally
to go back to the natural world.

59
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,910
Do not expect Dante to imagine a place
where there is some kind of redemptive

60
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:20,140
intervention from the outside. I can tell
us this is the way you do it. No, no.

61
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,110
The natural world, a
world, the natural world,

62
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:26,680
it must be capable of
producing within itself.

63
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:31,681
Some at least contain some seeds for a
need to reconstruct for a need for the

64
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:37,790
good. So this is going to
be part of, uh, uh, his,

65
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:42,040
uh, his strategy and his difficulties
at further tray to purgatory,

66
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,730
which was really completely
missing in the Fed.

67
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,200
And the Fed we had never
had a sense of time.

68
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Time was the biological clock of the
pilgrim who was the only living creature,

69
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,200
the only truly displaced figure.

70
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,340
And he is the only displaced figure
throughout the poem and purgatory who will

71
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:05,230
find further. They're all displaced
figure. So it's a more human, uh,

72
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,100
world. Uh, but here now they have
their sense of time. In fact,

73
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,130
the first thing that we, we,
we come to understand is how,

74
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,190
what time is it's time
understood as future oriented,

75
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,000
as a projection in some kind of future.
And at the same time,

76
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,360
this idea of time also turns out to be
in a return to the past so that as the

77
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:33,010
pilgrim is going ahead, he's literally
discovers that he's going backwards.

78
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,220
To the garden of Eden exactly there where
Adam and eve were placed at the top.

79
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:41,100
Who Purgatory.
Bye Bye,

80
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,030
bye God at that time in the store
that you have in, in Genesis,

81
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,270
uh, uh, for instance.
But this idea of time,

82
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,010
this will become truly a light motif
throughout full authority idea of what is

83
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:57,500
the relationship between
the past and the future,

84
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,370
since the only real time is really the
future. And from that point of view are,

85
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,100
which makes you understand that even
the past was the future at some point at

86
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,934
least.
Right?

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,080
So the future is the only thing that
Dante is going to be interested in and the

88
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:16,130
future will come and the possibility of
a future and the way it's related to the

89
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:20,600
past will become,
are the object of his concerns,

90
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:25,601
the object of his thinking or openly
as he goes through the various Ah,

91
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,590
ah, Ah, the Veterans Ledger.
So purgatory, poetically,

92
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:34,640
the poor guitar is divided into two,
two to three parts.

93
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,040
I would say actually the,

94
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:41,000
the first part is the so called anti
purgatory made of souls were awaiting,

95
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,310
uh, don't, don't really penitence yet,

96
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,790
but waiting to be assigned a
particular place along the ledges.

97
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,200
And then the so called penitents who are
going through the process of cleansing,

98
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:55,760
beginning with pride and ending
up with ending with luxury at, uh,

99
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,760
just before the pilgrim gets
into the garden of Eden.

100
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,360
The ordering of sins is the exact
reversal of the ordering of,

101
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:09,380
since you had an in fair no,
here you begin with a spiritual,

102
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:14,450
sane or intellectual saying the question
of pride and end up with the most

103
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:19,020
physical and material of the more luxury,
which as you'll recall,

104
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,160
is the, the inverted image of what
happened in, in, uh, in, in fan.

105
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:28,480
All right. With the Lucifer and the scene
of Lucifer being really seen of, uh,

106
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,640
of pride at the end of Ken to 30 for the,

107
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,550
well, having said this, maybe other things
will come to mind as I go on. Uh, uh,

108
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,620
uh, today. And let me begin
with, uh, uh, with, uh,

109
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,580
some other couple of details is
just getting to plunge into the,

110
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:52,580
the can to one where, where
is the pilgrim? Now, the poem,

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,830
the journey began on a good Thursday,
as it's called,

112
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:00,410
right? The Dante spends the
first night, but the journey,

113
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,620
the real journey begins on Good
Friday in a clear imitation of a,

114
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,540
uh,
Christ's,

115
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:12,541
a harrowing of Hell and emergence
into the light on a Easter Sunday.

116
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,430
That's where we are now.
Easter Sunday morning,

117
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,410
if the federal begins at dusk,
and therefore, uh, the, the,

118
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:25,411
with the idea of the approaching night
and night that stands for the and no

119
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:28,170
ability of whatever
he's going to confront.

120
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,060
The dentists fascinated with the
idea of the night throughout, uh,

121
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,230
in fan reimagine.

122
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:38,030
Remember a Ulysses who travels following
the sun and then the, and, and,

123
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,920
and ends up really gazing at tonight,
the unknowability of his destiny.

124
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,320
They had no ability of the
place even where he is.

125
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,340
Now we'll begin with dawn and therefore
10 to one of purgatory becomes that

126
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:54,350
which in province our literature,
it's called an Obod. Oh,

127
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,240
from the word [inaudible] in
Italian a U, B a, d, e the,

128
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,230
the song, the dawn song, a song
that in many ways reverses,

129
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,470
uh, the grand tradition of, uh,

130
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,390
the erotic lyrics of a,
of a province are, uh,

131
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,830
poetry,
uh,

132
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:17,670
where the dawn becomes the unhappy
time for the parking of lovers.

133
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,680
And here now it's regained as
the great time when finally, uh,

134
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,700
um,

135
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,050
the pilgrim can go on and the port and
go and mapping literally now mapping the

136
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:28,340
journey,

137
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,340
sailing through or sending is the metaphor
that he asks a that he adopts or can

138
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:39,330
be in deployment. The second part of the
point purgatorio begins first of all,

139
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:42,930
with an image of water
and, and, and therefore it,

140
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,650
it carries further this motif of
the cleansing and purification.

141
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,930
But really with a better metaphor from
our point of view to course of a better

142
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:52,764
waters,

143
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,870
there'll bock who my width now
lifts her sales leaving behind her.

144
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,170
So courtesy and that will sing of that
second kingdom where the human spirit is

145
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,960
purged,
it becomes fit to ascend to heaven.

146
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,513
But here,

147
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,940
let poetry rise again from the dead
or holy musers since I am yours.

148
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,140
And he'll let Kalia pay rise
up for awhile. And the company,

149
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:21,060
my song without strain,

150
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:26,061
which smote the ears of the wretched
pies so that they despaired of,

151
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,220
pardon, it's an extraordinary
problem, uh, to,

152
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,940
to purgatorial with for a
number of reasons. First of all,

153
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,940
[inaudible] picks up the
metaphor of the, the, the,

154
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:40,920
the epic oppose the epic
metaphor of, uh, of,

155
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,330
uh, the, the, the journey, uh,

156
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,260
with which the poem began in the middle
of the journey of our life as you recall.

157
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,220
But now this, uh, uh, this, this,

158
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:56,610
this idea of the process is
indicated with a all failing.

159
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,460
Therefore, literally recalling the, the,

160
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,280
the sea voyage of Ulysses. What's,
that's one an oblique metaphor,

161
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,550
but I want to draw your attention
to the use of this adjective,

162
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,760
a comparative adjective. That's where
we call it in grammar, as you recall,

163
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:18,180
the better waters.
Uh,

164
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,220
it's Dante's emphasis at
exactly on the process.

165
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,680
And then the con, the comparatively
good. This is not the best of waters.

166
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,180
It's not the worst of worst. This is
the better waters. We are really in the,

167
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,530
on the way to, uh, to better things. It's,

168
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,010
it's a world of be green,
uh,

169
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,120
that Dante introduces visit
that have really believes in a,

170
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:46,240
in a sort of hierarchy, in
the hierarchy of, uh, of,

171
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,990
of values, of states,
of, uh, of powers, of a,

172
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:54,310
of beauty, of intellect, the world be a,

173
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:59,110
it's an a dualistic world between
what's bad and what's good.

174
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,180
They said a lot of mediations,
mediating steps along the way,

175
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,390
and now he already
introduced this, this, this,

176
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:11,030
this whole question with an ocean of
the better waters, the little backroom,

177
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,940
my witness.
This is not only a journey.

178
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,460
The interesting thing is
this is a journey of poetry.

179
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,440
It is as if Dan Pennell wants to highlight
a motif which is going to be very

180
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:25,240
crucial throughout the poem and in our
reading of this poem that they really,

181
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,250
at this point,
I have been addressing this issue.

182
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,060
So some of your questions
that there really is no sharp,

183
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,440
no drastic discontinuity between the,

184
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,020
the journey of the pilgrim at
the journey of the port, right.

185
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,570
That the journey of the
poet is an extension.

186
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,480
It in itself is a journey in itself,

187
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:48,010
is a journey of knowledge and a
journey of discovery. And Dante makes,

188
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,390
uh, a large claims for poetry.
Poetry is a way of knowing.

189
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,650
It's just not a and ornamentation
recommed memorization of the past.

190
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,280
Now here he talks about the journey
has been the journey of poet,

191
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,500
the little bark of my weight.

192
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,000
It's a conventional way of thinking about
the bark of poetry with which he is.

193
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:12,070
So they say, there seems to be a way of
saying this is now more at this stage,

194
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:16,390
at least it was to us to think about
the journey of poetry and not just the

195
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:19,980
journey that he himself will
use. Uh, we'll, we'll, we'll,

196
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,820
we'll undertake the journey of the
pilgrim, the hard, difficult to journey,

197
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,510
uh, filled with fear, uh, that, uh,

198
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:32,050
that he was experiencing
in, in, in, in federal.

199
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,740
And I also want to draw your attention
to another little detail of the text.

200
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:40,300
This is this the first time now
that Dante, we use the future tense.

201
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,660
I will thing we're in the world to open
to futility and if it's open to future,

202
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,790
the only way of thinking about futurity
is made possible by a belief in the new.

203
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,500
You have to not really think,
yes you can think of the future,

204
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:00,100
but if the future is exactly
as as as it is today,

205
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,350
then you really have no future,

206
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:07,300
then you really think that all is
released into the domain of sameness.

207
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:10,770
You know, if my day today is
exactly what more the the,

208
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,470
the world that I experienced yesterday,
there's no new,

209
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,330
no idea of the new and that instead
here now users the future and clearly

210
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:22,600
implying that there is an alternative,
a difference,

211
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:27,190
a possibility of doing things in
ways that have not been done before.

212
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,400
This is going to be a new departure
and new departure for thoughts and new

213
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:37,750
departure for the imagination and now he
says it has to be also a new departure

214
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,820
for poetry itself.
I emphasize this idea of the future,

215
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:46,990
I will sing the first time that he will.
He wasn't saying this in fan.

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,710
Of course he couldn't even say that
in the Vita Nuova you remember that I

217
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:55,711
pointed when we were reading the little
autobiographical great text called the

218
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,730
Vita Nuova,
the beginning of the term.

219
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,740
I indicated to you that there is
never the future tense used in that,

220
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,633
in that,
uh,

221
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,940
in that text it was all a book of mammary
with the difficulties and the dangers

222
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:10,730
of mammary.

223
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,680
Dangerous with memory being that memory
changes can draw us into a world of

224
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,580
fantastic. That's one of the,
it's not a rejection of memory,

225
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,850
only a way of highlighting.
It's possible dangerous,

226
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,690
right in the belief that they should
live with some idea of danger.

227
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,510
Maybe we are not really thinking are
hard enough. So here now it's the, the,

228
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,660
the only time that the future was using
the Vita Nuova was either in the idea of

229
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,320
death,

230
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,320
when Dante has a prophetic dream and
he hears a voice that he perceives as a

231
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,490
kind of so,
so,

232
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,930
so truth leading is that voice that
he thinks of it as a kind of, uh,

233
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,790
of profits is a Soto of Oracle
speaking to him. You too will die.

234
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,110
Beatrice has just died.

235
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,330
And then the death of Beatrice brings
to his mind the fear and threat of

236
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:02,000
mortality to him.
You too will die.

237
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,420
That's the way the future's going
to be understood. But then the poem,

238
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:08,690
the whole Vita Nuova ends
with a statement of hope.

239
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,990
I hope to work and write things
whereby I can say I can dry.

240
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,570
I can say things about,
uh, uh, about Beatrice.

241
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:22,350
I had never been said about any woman.
And so that becomes the two possibilities.

242
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:26,120
So that's usually the only, literally
once grammatically, the future tense.

243
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:29,810
And the other one with, through this,
uh, petty faster construction too.

244
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,930
So bleak construction. But the
hope, the verb, we use that to, uh,

245
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,540
in with the idea of the future
indicator there and then, uh,

246
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,430
but he'll let poetry
rise again from the dead

247
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:47,030
and the prayer to the musers very much
in the style of the epic tradition and

248
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:51,770
especially of the music two one,
the Muse of the epic poetry Kaleo pay.

249
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,360
But then this,

250
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,250
the focus on Calliope we really tells
you something about the kind of, uh,

251
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,180
uh,
I think retrospectively Reid explains,

252
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,190
but let here they'd poetry
rise again from the dead.

253
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,380
Uh,
the poem presents itself as clear.

254
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,710
It was the mother of
whom anybody remember?

255
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,370
You remember your mythology,
okay. No, you don't now, but it's,

256
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,130
it's the mother of all fears so that
they let their poetry rise again.

257
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,130
Uh, let that poetry rise
again from the dead. It's,

258
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,880
Dante presents himself as it were, a
Norfolk poet. He was Nora Norfolk poets,

259
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,220
but it's for the airport
in the traditional Morpheus
who wants to conquer death.

260
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,590
That's clearly enough for him.
That's,

261
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:40,100
that's what the old fuse descent
into the underworld really is.

262
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,930
The way of conquering death,

263
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,980
the belief that poetry can do the trick.

264
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,910
That's true poetry. We immortalize
ourselves, we conquered death.

265
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,040
He's going very soon to talk to him to
understand that that's not the way he is

266
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,790
going to do that. And then
something, a second paragraph,

267
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,791
I want to read it a little bit because
it really gives us a different sense of

268
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:10,311
the tonality of Purgatorio because
there's not only you have now morning and

269
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,860
time,
you also have for the first time light,

270
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,690
not this hotel have a
spectacular shades of light.

271
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,630
The blue, the reds, uh, uh,

272
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,660
the green with which he experiences and
dramatizes paradise according to the

273
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:31,260
lights emanating from the various planets,
red of Mars,

274
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,350
the white of Jupiter, the blue of
Saturn. And so there is a kind of public,

275
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,800
chromic, a pallette that is
going to be deployed here.

276
00:18:40,801 --> 00:18:45,660
It's now a more human and natural world,
the natural world. And listen to this.

277
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:48,790
And then this enables me to say
something else about the traits of,

278
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,770
or the sweet hue of the Oriental Sapphire,

279
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,900
which was gathering this region,

280
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,560
face of the heavens from the
cleared zenith to the first circle.

281
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,300
Gladden my eyes again.

282
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,760
As soon as I passed out of the day there
we should affected my eyes and breast.

283
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,250
They're fair planet that prompts
to our Venus the morning,

284
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,150
the morning star that loved me,

285
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:18,930
the older east laughs veiling the
fissures, which were in her trains.

286
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,870
I turned to the right.
You remember that? I,

287
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,580
I sort of tried to explain to you that
with one exception that I can't explain,

288
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,320
nobody can explain.
And on very few people have noticed,

289
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,010
uh, the, the, uh, Dante now
is turning to the right,

290
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:39,840
which is to say that even while going
down, spiraling down in the world of l,

291
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,460
he actually was going to the right,

292
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,970
though he'd said that he was going to
the left and he was going to the left

293
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,210
because it was upside down.
Now he's right side up.

294
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,340
And so the directions of the
human world are going to be, uh,

295
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,860
to be regained.
So I turned to the right.

296
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,820
He will never use this image again
and set my mind on the other pole.

297
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,680
And I so far stars never seen before.
But by the first people, Adam and eve,

298
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,170
the sky seemed to rejoice in the flames.
All we do,

299
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:11,610
regions was the north since Dour,
denied that side.

300
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,020
The northern hemispheres where we are,
Dante's in the southern hemisphere,

301
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,120
he is connecting with us,

302
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,380
telling us what we are
deprived of in by not knowing,

303
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,140
by having lost a paradise.

304
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,820
A couple of things that I will not since
then we'll go back to these images.

305
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,440
Um,
the,

306
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,060
the way he literally orients himself,

307
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,190
let the metaphor he uses
is that of, uh, here, uh,

308
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,140
is the oriental light.
Uh,

309
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,350
and the way he's always
orienting a reorienting himself.

310
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,510
How do you know where you are is now in,
in purgatory and also in paradise?

311
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,760
When thinking about about,
uh, uh, characters, uh,

312
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,590
here on earth and, and, and,
and recalling their lives,

313
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,340
it's always by looking at the east.

314
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,230
It's always by looking in the light of
the east. And from this point of view,

315
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:13,231
Dante really retreats that most incredible
metaphor that is available among the

316
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:16,180
mystics, medieval
mystics. And I'm thinking,

317
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,990
or thinkers I'm thinking of even bullied.
He was Casio doors.

318
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,790
I hope they're not just
names for you who think, who,

319
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,130
who believes that you can only
think that we in the West,

320
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,250
a western in Clyde can only
think by looking toward the east.

321
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,800
That the way in which we can be orienting
ourselves is by trying to capture

322
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,000
that,
the source of that light.

323
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,140
And I mean this in the most
metaphorical and as we shall see,

324
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:48,280
the widest sensors, uh, possible.
But that's all he's saying now.

325
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,820
But at the same time and the language,
it's incredibly hard,

326
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,510
has shifted between the first paragraph
and the second paragraph that which

327
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:59,470
seems to be the excitement for the light.
And now he's experiencing again,

328
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,310
it's Easter Sunday.
He and he understands that it's direction.

329
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,450
This is going to hit him
very, very strongly now. Uh,

330
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,270
but it's also an allergic.
That tonality is Lhi.

331
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,290
And the idea of what we have laws
that widowed region of the Northern

332
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,590
Hemisphere, uh, the sense of
the sense of general laws,

333
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,850
though it's a provisional privilege for
him to see all this. But this indicates,

334
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:30,100
it introduces that the,
the,

335
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:33,280
the extraordinary tension
poetic pantry in purgatory,

336
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,730
the dialectic between excitement for
the future and then log for the past

337
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:46,050
pilgrim is called in between and we shall
see the consequences between this is

338
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,600
zero, the level of, of, of
tonality I would call it,

339
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,770
but we shall see what this
really means in a, in a moment.

340
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,420
This Dante approaches now,
um,

341
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,300
I had drawn my grade race and
so on. Uh, this is lines, uh,

342
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,130
uh, 25 when I had withdrawn my gaze
from them turning to the stars,

343
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,580
turning a little toward the other pole
where the wind had already disappeared.

344
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:13,750
I saw beside me an old man alone,

345
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,180
worthy, but his looks of
so great reverence that no
son owes more to a father.

346
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,480
His beard was long and stretched
with white and his hair the same. Uh,

347
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,800
double trust falling on his breast,
et Cetera.

348
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,850
This is going to be the
encounter with Keto.

349
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,340
And I want to talk about Cato. Wow.
Let me just give you a real bit of, uh,

350
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,750
extra, uh, Don Teske information. I mean,

351
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:45,220
in a way this is, you probably do
not know that this representation,

352
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,990
we call it, uh, this, this, uh,

353
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,130
the script seal of the old
man with, uh, the, the,

354
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,830
uh,
with a beard or white street with whites.

355
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,070
But on two sides really is the,
the paradigm,

356
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,190
the model that,
um,

357
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,490
Michelangelo writes a Michelangelo
follows in his conception of Moses,

358
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,340
though Dante doesn't lose sight of the
fact that this is Kate or just a little

359
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:18,341
piece of how Michelangelo Red Michelangelo
read this particular particular

360
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,350
meeting.
So who is this Keto?

361
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,530
And Dante describes as an old man,

362
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,310
and we also know that
he's a Roman pagan fat.

363
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,600
He's in Raleigh, a pagan.
He's a man of laws.

364
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,360
The first thing that
he wonders and he says,

365
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:39,880
pattern of who are you that
have fled you? It's, these are,

366
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,940
these are just, uh, are,

367
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,730
are people who have tried to
literally escaped from prison,

368
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,480
the eternal prison against
the bright scream. He said,

369
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,690
who has guided you or who was your lantern
in coming forth from profound night

370
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,370
that holds the perpetual blackness,

371
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:03,080
that valet of hair or the loss
of their best? Very Roman.

372
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:06,740
This is the room and tradition of the
law, right? How the loss of their best,

373
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,200
in a way, this is a man, was a
stranger to the world of purgatory.

374
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,620
Strictly.

375
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,730
It certainly doesn't seem to understand
that there may have been some grace.

376
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,080
It may be Dante and his guide that here
out of some providential intervention,

377
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,051
which has not,

378
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:29,051
not to be explained by Lowe's or by
natural or by the laws of nature or by Ben

379
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,070
men. Men made laws at the loss of their
business, broken or has a new decree.

380
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,940
He wonders, been made in
heaven. Uh, that being damned,

381
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,200
you come to my clips,
my leader Virgil,

382
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,240
the two Romans talk. Now I'm for
myself. Then I answered him. I'm sorry.

383
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,260
Uh, the Nance with him or
myself. I came, not a lady,

384
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,510
be Trish recapitulation of women fair.

385
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,020
No one descended from heaven
for whose prayers a sucker.

386
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,900
This man with my companionship.

387
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,720
But since this is a wheel
to have it made more plain,

388
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,320
how intrusive stands with us. It
cannot be mine to deny. Denied.

389
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,140
This man never saw his last hour,

390
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,700
but by his folly was only a twit.
That little time was left to run.

391
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,280
I will send to him and have shown him

392
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,490
all the guilty race and our purpose
to show him those spirits that cleanse

393
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:27,491
themselves under the I charge how I have
let him would belong to tell the there

394
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,920
descends from above virtue,

395
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:35,450
which aids me in bringing him to see
there and to hear the made please lead to

396
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:39,260
be gracious to his coming.
He goes seeking liberty,

397
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,340
which is so c so dear as he
knows who gives his life for it.

398
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,760
And the reference is clearly to Katelyn
himself who historically historical

399
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:54,810
failure actually committed suicide,
uh,

400
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:59,990
in the civil war and refusing
to take sides between,

401
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,740
uh, Pompei and uh, uh, and,

402
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,670
and Caesar as it's told in the great epic.

403
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:13,910
By looking the Roman Spanish poet
who wrote the so called civil war,

404
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,060
uh, a tax that is, uh, uh,

405
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,920
very polemical between in between
or among other things, uh,

406
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,821
with,
with,

407
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:28,050
with Virgil that notice it since
death for it was no bitter to the,

408
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:32,490
in Utica, in North Africa where
the did sleeve, the vesture,

409
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,480
the body and which, um, in which,

410
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,540
which is a great day,
we'll be so bright.

411
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,250
The terminally dates are not broken
for us, for this man lives in minus,

412
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:47,640
there's not buying me,
but I'm of the circle limbo.

413
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,940
Where are they chase the eyes of Marsha,
his wife,

414
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,090
who in her lopes still praise the holy
breasts that are hold her for thy known,

415
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,150
for her love, then do, are inclined to us,

416
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,390
allow us to go through the seven kingdoms.

417
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:08,700
I will report to her kindness if that
deigned to be spoken of there below.

418
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,740
And he responds, Marsha, so please
my eyes. While I was younger,

419
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:17,940
he said then that whatever
kindness she sought of me I did.

420
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,120
Now that she dwells
beyond the evil stream,

421
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:25,590
she not move me more by the law, which
was made when I came forth from thence.

422
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,600
But if a lady, et Cetera, et
Cetera, um, it, this is an amazing,

423
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,573
uh,

424
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,680
from insubstantial terms and amazing
beginning in the poem because Dante Meets

425
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,190
Cato, who redefines. We are being
told there that he's an old man,

426
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,600
a pagan and the suicide there traits that
virtual singles out bleakly referring

427
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:57,810
to his adventures and that
clearly contradict the,

428
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,800
to purgatory.

429
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,720
Purgatory is a Christian
canticle this is Easter Sunday.

430
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,200
Why have it inaugurated by the presence
of a pagan who knew nothing of the,

431
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,380
of, of the incarnation? Why
have it? It's the, it's the,

432
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,260
it's the Rome of every new life.

433
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:20,850
Why started with the suicide someone
who we saw what Dante thought to the

434
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:24,990
suicide when in a, in a complicated
way, throughout, in fair,

435
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,400
there were a number of suicides
inhabiting various aspects of various,

436
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,320
uh,
regions of hell,

437
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:35,940
but especially among the Er with the
violent against nature and inferno 13.

438
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,480
And so an old man as
suicide and the Pagan.

439
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,900
Why does he do a figure
that he drove out of the,

440
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,690
the world of up of Lucas?
Um,

441
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,380
what we are told about him.
This,

442
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:54,010
it's usually whenever you have
representation so that beyond,

443
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,600
you always have a young man,

444
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,670
for instance [inaudible] or
is this is a kind of day,

445
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,430
the Latin term meaning a young,
uh, in the lien for instance,

446
00:30:01,431 --> 00:30:05,660
it's always a young man or a young
woman welcoming to indicate the,

447
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,940
the renewed life. No, the novelty,
the freshness of our life. Uh,

448
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:14,320
you certainly don't have an old man and
you certainly do not have a suicide.

449
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,020
Now the question,
the suicide is probably the easiest to,

450
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:23,260
to determine cause Keto suicide.
It's a suicide for freedom.

451
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,790
And let me say a couple of things
about freedom because it's, um,

452
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,980
I call purgatory really the,
um,

453
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,380
the domain of freedom.

454
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,440
It's really the place of freedom that
he begins here explaining as it were,

455
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,690
political but also moral state. It's
a political because it's, it's, it's,

456
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:50,691
it's a refusal of the disarray and
chaos brought in by the war between pump

457
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,670
brought in by the war
between Pompey and Caesar.

458
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,320
At the time of the civil war.

459
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,590
But it is also a moral state because Cato
decides to put an end to his life in a

460
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:06,640
sort of sacrificial move as
if to draw attention to the,

461
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,450
that the, the, the way in
which the state had been, uh,

462
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,820
killed,

463
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,080
had been destroyed by the
rivalry between this two,

464
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,850
uh, these two great figures
who have not opposed,

465
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,550
but they'll have a rivalry about power.

466
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,110
That freedom is the fundamental problem.
It's a woman issue at me.

467
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:32,600
Just say non paid wants
us to think of it at, at,

468
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,600
at the very beginning of Purgatorio
in pagan intellectual terms, freedom,

469
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:38,803
uh,
the whole,

470
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,880
the whole precatory ends up with a pilgrim
regaining and being crowned as he'll

471
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:47,410
say with the attainment of free will.

472
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:51,690
So the whole poem really moves
this idea of from uh, uh,

473
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:56,140
Keto search for freedom, personal freedom,
and the pilgrim attainment of freewill.

474
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,380
Now there is an obvious relationship to
begin with between freedom on the one

475
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:06,010
hand and, and, uh, I would
say the future on the other,

476
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,990
right.
Uh,

477
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,870
the poem begins with the future and now
we are going to decide what are they,

478
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,970
what is the virtue of the future?

479
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,060
You cannot conceive of freedom unless
you have an idea of the future.

480
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,510
You cannot con you understand that the
connection between the two of you cannot

481
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:25,960
conceive of a novelty unless
you have an idea of the future.

482
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,120
And unless you have an idea of freedom,

483
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:31,690
the notion of originality
is actually even poetic.

484
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:36,691
Originality is impossible unless it's
tied to a certain idea of freedom.

485
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,370
It treats you poses the more so that
the attainment of freedom really means a

486
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,580
poetic originality ideal of the future.

487
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,380
The notion that things can be
different if I am a slave to the past,

488
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:53,120
if I'm a slave to a political order,
if I am a slave to my own vices,

489
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,980
internal as internalized as that quest
can be, then I really have no freedom.

490
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Keto embodies one who refuses living
if living means living in a state of

491
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:07,910
tyranny to,
uh,

492
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,620
civil war violence and therefore
to the possibility of a moral life.

493
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,880
Okay, so that's easy to
determine. That's easy to explain.

494
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:20,740
I even think that the notion
of the old man can be expanded.

495
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:22,760
Dante wants to draw
attention first of all,

496
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,620
that somehow this search
for the future, he's, it's,

497
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,440
it's not,
not an alternative to the past.

498
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,590
It grows out of the past so that we,
we,

499
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,970
he's rejecting the idea that there may
be some sharp distinction between the two

500
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,830
and that the seeds of the future I don't
really contain in the past few years,

501
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:44,960
such as an old man,
a Cato.

502
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,650
The third problem is the
question of his being a pagan.

503
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,870
And this brings me back to that, which
is the project. Dante's project in the,

504
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,910
in progress toward the
project is that there is,

505
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,400
he must make a careful distinction,

506
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,960
which center Graston could not make in
the city of God. Damn. We'll make it.

507
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,750
That's his, that's Dante's, uh,

508
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,810
target polemic or target are Gustin
really distinguishes between the earthly

509
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:16,730
city and the heavily city and the
heavily city may live on earth,

510
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,200
but it's really a pilgrim
church going on told, uh,

511
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,350
told the beatitude and
the encounter with God.

512
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,520
The earthly city is corrupt
and in many ways, uh,

513
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,350
not assimilable to the, the world
of a, of the redemption. This is,

514
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:38,590
this is may if you are at another stint
eons and you have very supple view of a,

515
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:44,140
and may strike you as crude, but I don't
think that it really, it really, uh,

516
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:49,210
violates the essence of that dual idea
between the earthly city and the heavenly

517
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:49,580
city.

518
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,580
Dante is literally talking
against the Augustinian dualism.

519
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,020
There is in nature that is within
the pagan secular historical world.

520
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:05,310
There are seeds that can become crucial
for the making of the political,

521
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:11,290
for the making of a new moral life
that will be really consonant with not

522
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:12,171
dissonant,

523
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:17,000
with in a chord with the redemption and
the Christian redemption that he will be

524
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:20,330
actually seeking.
Keep this very much in mind,

525
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,220
a sign of this incredible tension time,
the meaning of freedom,

526
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,110
the value of the pagan world.

527
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,320
The insistence on the secular as as a
capable of producing some kind of a seed

528
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,720
for the future emerges really in
the second paragraph, wouldn't.

529
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,970
Finally a virtual tool bend, uh, to the,

530
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:46,530
the harshness to temper the
harshness of Keto says, look,

531
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,180
let us go through bills.
I know your wife very Italian.

532
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,320
I know your wife and I'm going to go
very back. This is to say, you know, uh,

533
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:58,770
I know who you are, so do me a favor
because I'll be doing that a favor.

534
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,840
Let me go and Marsha,
let Marsha.

535
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,380
I would go there and they'll tell
her what a great man you are.

536
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:07,950
What a good man you are.
What he's doing.

537
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:12,951
He's appealing to Kato's affective
memory and it is an appeal.

538
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,700
It's a solicitation that Cato refuses.

539
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:22,650
She can do nothing for me.
He refuses to be determined by the past.

540
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,960
You see the ambiguity's
they're running through.

541
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,130
Dante understands that
you have to go some,

542
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,110
the poet in the figuration understands
that you cannot really have a sense of

543
00:36:31,111 --> 00:36:33,930
the future without being
rooted in the past.

544
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,130
And then here you have Cato who
can only make sharp distinctions.

545
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,180
She can do nothing about me.
I could tell you that this is a very,

546
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:46,500
the appeal to Marsha,
they appear to Marcia's memory for,

547
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,640
for Cato can become also
a cook is full of ironies.

548
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:52,524
And I,
I,

549
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,300
I would only tell you or I will
take us to too far a field.

550
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,810
I can tell you that in effect
in the history of Cato,

551
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,640
Marsha had left,

552
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Kato had asked Taito to divorce her
because she wanted to marry somebody else

553
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,390
and that the death of the other,
the other husband,

554
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:17,160
Marsha asks Cato to
take a bag and she will.

555
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:22,050
And Dante is the accounts don't recounts
this whole story in the banquet and

556
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:26,400
views it as a sign of the
extraordinary generosity of this man.

557
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,050
So the th th th th there
is all of that law in the,

558
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,720
in the background of this reference
to Cato, but from our point of view,

559
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:38,490
then it is a question of the power of the
power of memory and the limits and the

560
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:43,110
limits of memory. And
then finally, um, uh, the,

561
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,790
he will go home saying, giving
some Mar Keto, we'll go on, uh,

562
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,300
giving us some, some mum, uh,

563
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,010
rules that he has to follow
in the process of cleansing.

564
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,140
You go and wash yourself
from the stain of in. I,

565
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,660
he will tell him and gird your
loins. They will be there. Uh,

566
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,770
he would mention a go to the desert of
shore, uh, therefore, uh, go and, uh,

567
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,120
uh,

568
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,120
this is the last pattern of the dawn is
the dawn song was overcoming the morning

569
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:12,600
breeze,
which Fred before it.

570
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,480
So that I described far off
the trembling of the sea.

571
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:19,200
We made our way over the lonely plane,
like one returns to the road.

572
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:23,910
He is lost until he finds it seems to
himself to go in vain when you were a part

573
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:28,860
where the do resist the sun. And being
in shade is little dispersed. My master,

574
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:31,170
Jen's relate both hands out,
spread on the grass.

575
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,460
I therefore aware of his purpose reached
toward him. My tear stains cheat.

576
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,700
That's the ritual of purification,
uh, which he had appealed.

577
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,920
We must undergo. And on them.
He hoarded, restore the collar,

578
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,150
which have I did an in me,

579
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:51,360
we came down on the Deseret shore that
never saw men sale its waters after had

580
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:56,080
experience of return. Whom are
you supposed to over here? Here.

581
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,420
What is the reference tool?
Andy Buddy.

582
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,630
Absolutely. Absolutely.
He makes it very clear.

583
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:09,490
The Cato and your listeners out of the
two pagans that he said difference,

584
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:12,100
he intrudes.
He in Sydney,

585
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:17,101
Wade's a distinction big within
the body of pagan culture.

586
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:22,990
You listen to on the one hand and his
own transgressive search for knowledge in

587
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:25,780
the belief that it really, there is
no knowledge without some suppression,

588
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:30,130
which is, which is considerable and
and worth would be worth considering.

589
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,860
And on the other hand, uh, the, the,

590
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,440
the experience of Keto himself.

591
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:39,700
Now here we are here with that different
at different pagan there he girded me

592
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:40,990
as the other head bitten.

593
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,640
That's a phrase that comes straight
out of infinite 26 or marvel for as the

594
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:50,080
lonely plant he chose such did spring up
again immediately in the place of where

595
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:53,860
he had parked it.
So Dan has to gird himself that way.

596
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,480
Jordany man would, whenever they
undertake a journey in antiquity, it all,

597
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,730
whether this,
the biblical journeyman or the Romans,

598
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,180
the gird that they fought this Gerbil
around themselves, uh, they, they,

599
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,420
the gird their loins. It's, it's, it's,

600
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:13,470
it's a moment of gone payment
of, of self, right. And that,

601
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,380
and that's the ritual he
has to, to undergo. Uh,

602
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,730
from my point of view though,

603
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:24,090
the emphasis falls on the power of the
natural world to the store itself because

604
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:29,560
immediately, and it's an emblem of the
resurrection here now, but it's still,

605
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:33,900
we're still in the natural world. That is
no, no element of grace nature. The, the,

606
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:38,480
the plant in an inversion of what
had happened in, in federal 13. Uh,

607
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,400
the plan is, uh, is, arises
again this born again,

608
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:46,170
and then we'd come to Ken
to, to, uh, the, the, the,

609
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,700
the situation changes somewhat. But, uh,

610
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,620
let me just begin another point of,
uh,

611
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,790
it starts with another
search for orientation.

612
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,290
And I mean that in a, it's
an easy pawn, the east,

613
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,080
the Orient and orientation
for the pilgrim.

614
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,940
And now it becomes clearly Jerusalem and
you will see the reason why it's going

615
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:11,640
to be Jerusalem in a moment.
Well,

616
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:14,230
one reason why they didn't just say it
immediately because has nothing to do

617
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:16,030
with the,
this has to do more with a,

618
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:21,330
let's say the myth about then with the
text is that hell and purgatory is at the

619
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:27,640
antipodes of Jerusalem, uh,
against the feet of Jerusalem.

620
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,830
Jerusalem was known as the, the, the, the
navel of the earth. And now we are in,

621
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:37,190
it's in purgatory, uh, edits
antipodes it's always starts already.

622
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,840
The son had reached the horizon who's
meridian circle covers Jerusalem.

623
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,130
So Tillerson will become the point of
reference with its highest Poland and

624
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,580
night circling opposite.

625
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:52,100
It was issuing from the Ganges with the
scales which fall from her hand when she

626
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:54,800
exceeds the day,
etc. I was white,

627
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:59,210
the rosy Chico Federal Aurora with her
increasing age where turning orange,

628
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,250
we still beside the sea,

629
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,910
those that ponder on the road,

630
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,450
who go in heart and embody linger and
extraordinary image of this location of

631
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:19,121
being both being body and mind and the
wear of a break between the two who have

632
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:24,540
expectations and hopes of moving ahead.

633
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:28,320
And yet they're kept in place
by the heaviness of the body.

634
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,700
And low is on the approach of morning.
Mars glows or ruddy,

635
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,200
uh,
through the thick vapor.

636
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:39,810
Slow in the west of the ocean floor
swore appeared to me. May I see it again,

637
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,070
a light coming so swiftly over the seat
that no flight could make it match it.

638
00:42:45,071 --> 00:42:49,920
Speed. Uh, and here he
sees a boat, a fast boat,

639
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,900
um,
bringing,

640
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:55,990
carrying the souls of Penitence who,
uh,

641
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,910
reaching the banks of purgatory.
Uh,

642
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,960
they're very opposite to what we saw with
children's boat in how the boat of you

643
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:08,370
remember of, of the sinful, uh, souls. Uh,

644
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:12,000
and then an angel of gardens.
And then as the divine bird came,

645
00:43:12,001 --> 00:43:13,470
told us more and more,

646
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,650
he appeared brighter so that my eyes
could not bear lines 38 a cast them down.

647
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,740
Uh, and he came on the shore with a vessel
source with the enlite that the water

648
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:27,720
took in nothing of it on the poops
too heavily steersman such as the

649
00:43:27,721 --> 00:43:28,351
blessedness,

650
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:32,700
assuming that written upon him and more
than a thousand spirits set within.

651
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,160
And they sing a song he Nexi to Israel,

652
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,290
the Egypt toe. So on, according
to the vulgate one 13,

653
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,470
it's the song we're in,

654
00:43:46,471 --> 00:43:51,471
which the Jews are remembering
their exodus from the bondage,

655
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,680
the slavery in Egypt to the,

656
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:06,060
um, to Jerusalem. That's
it. That's really the story.

657
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,330
This book of Exodus in Exito Israel,
Egypt,

658
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,100
you understand retrospectively
that reference to Jerusalem
that gives a kind of

659
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:16,920
unity to the whole Canto.
It's a song.

660
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,340
It's a song that are,
uh,

661
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,270
a number of things about this.
The only,

662
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:28,460
the only text that Dante
sites textually sites,

663
00:44:28,461 --> 00:44:31,650
he made references to the Bible all time.

664
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,790
But the only text of the Bible that done
through really sites literally in pigs

665
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:38,640
from textual,
it is always the book of Psalms,

666
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,480
probably an acknowledgement
that it's poetry. Uh, and,

667
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:46,740
and that he responds to that poetry.
But I spatially he does so and our only,

668
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:51,120
because it's the probably the text
where for the first time we have,

669
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,450
we have a representation of subjectivity
in western Western consciousness.

670
00:44:56,451 --> 00:45:01,451
It's the story of someone who is looking
inward and finding out the diseases of,

671
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,480
of, of self, the appetites
that passion's et Cetera.

672
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,500
That may be what reasons in say
is engaged in that kind of a,

673
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,960
he himself appealed and was
engaged as sort of quest.

674
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:18,320
But there is another reason I believe
because the psalms are basically lyrical

675
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,740
recapitulations of the story of exodus.

676
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,780
So that Dante's saying that exodus is
the figure that the divine comedy is the

677
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:31,680
lyrical representation of the story.

678
00:45:31,681 --> 00:45:33,870
The Biblical story of exodus that he too,

679
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,980
that is human history is
engaged in that search.

680
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,150
A search from slavery to liberty.
So,

681
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,870
let me just pursue this a little
bit from another point of view.

682
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:51,000
In Canto one of Pro Victoria, we saw
that the presentation of Roman political,

683
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,990
moral liberty.

684
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:57,230
Now we have an idea that the whole of
history is really engaged in this exodus,

685
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,270
a journey toward liberty,
two types of liberties,

686
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,880
a Roman one and the Jewish one
which Dante wants to connect.

687
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,540
It is as if he understands
that there are two traditions,

688
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:13,860
both of which are based
on a quest for liberty,

689
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,270
that there is a sense of in both
of them though in different ways,

690
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,250
a sense of beginning that
he must try to harmonize.

691
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,860
He must try to explore and probe in depth.

692
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:31,010
What do they mean and what are they
about in one a kind of legal idea,

693
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,290
uh,
moral political idea of liberty,

694
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,800
Cato that comes to a point of self
destruction. And the other one,

695
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,590
the question of spiritual exos,
by the way,

696
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,660
a second thing I can say about this
reference to, uh, the, this psalm one 13,

697
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,960
is that Dante uses it as the basis
for explaining his use of allegory.

698
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,030
You remember that I spoke about the
allegory of poets and allegory of

699
00:46:57,031 --> 00:47:02,031
theologians and that the difference was
the historical basis of the narrative,

700
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,770
sort of exos for dentist
historically. Uh, true. It's an event.

701
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:13,010
So this gives a kind of biblical Figaro
Aura to Dante's representation or they

702
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:18,030
go record a presentation at least.
Uh,

703
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,290
and the third thing has to say is
that the story of exodus in many ways

704
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,260
embodies,
um,

705
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:30,410
crystallizes the real intellectual issues
of what is this photo of exos about

706
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,580
horse. They leaving behind the
house of bondage or as they call it,

707
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,000
the house of bondage.
Uhh,

708
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,910
they taking along the
gold of the Egyptians,

709
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:46,510
which really means the secular knowledge.

710
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:51,511
A secular knowledge is also part of what
we must carry with us in the journey

711
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,920
toward freedom. That's that's, but it
also means that they stay in the desert.

712
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:59,800
The Jews stayed in the desert for 40 days.

713
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,040
They feel that they're abandoned by
Moses who has caught up to receive the

714
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,420
tables of the law.
And what are their abandoned,

715
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,760
they engage in idolatry.

716
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:16,710
This is the story of exodus story of the
people caught between I dollar tree and

717
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,070
revelation and promises
and prophetic promises,

718
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:23,050
prophecy and idolatry.

719
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,410
And the ideology shows
itself as a statement or as
an experience of nostalgia.

720
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,483
That's what the,

721
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:35,440
the making of the golden calf is
a statement and way of, you know,

722
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:36,280
desperate is,

723
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:40,420
they may be because they are now leader
less and they will be for a while.

724
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,660
Then they engage in a,
uh,

725
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:45,730
an act of a desire,

726
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:50,731
a longing for at least the safety or
what they perceive as the safety of their

727
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,770
dwelling in Egypt. Mindless of
the fact that the were in bondage.

728
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,520
This is if safety,

729
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,210
the safety of living where
preferable to them even in,

730
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,600
if that is a safety, uh, uh, provided,

731
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:08,680
procured and in the shadow of a,
of tyranny of bondage.

732
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:09,720
So you see this as a,

733
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,640
these are the concerns that Dante we'll
have as it comes into a program. Toilet.

734
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:17,860
The whole Purgatorio is literally a
journey of what we were looking back and

735
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:22,210
forth between the future and the
past and the future and the past,

736
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:27,160
her rivaling with each other for the
control of the mind of the pilgrim.

737
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:32,140
Let's see how this is going to be, uh,
developed. Uh, and I hope I have time to,

738
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,850
um, uh, go give you time for, for,

739
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,800
for questions because I, I'm, I'm really,

740
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:40,840
I realize I'm saying a lot of
things in there. A lot of things.

741
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:42,460
I am not even saying

742
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:46,930
the poem,

743
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:51,930
The candle shifts from this
grand historical concerns,

744
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:58,750
this reflections on how the pagan
world experiences beginnings and new

745
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:03,640
departures only with an ideology
of freedom and this idea,

746
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,630
biblical idea of,
of a new beginning,

747
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:12,970
which is really a break with
slavery, a break and, uh,

748
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,070
the, uh, the retrieval
of the idea of, of, uh,

749
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,550
of freedom in a

750
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,910
general one historical way.

751
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,880
Now it shifts the narrative
shifts and the, it's,

752
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,910
it's whole internalize the
pilgrim moves within himself.

753
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,810
And the first statement is that
he does not know where he is.

754
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,800
And that's an emphasis.

755
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:40,830
This was a way of alluding to this
exhibit exhibit predicament he has.

756
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,960
He literally has,
he does not know where to go.

757
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:50,350
He already had indicated that his state
of mind was as that that have one who

758
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:55,451
with the mind keeps going toward some
place but with a body his kept behind you

759
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,680
remember that line which,

760
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,800
which clearly dramatizes the split with
a kind of inner self dislocation for the

761
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:08,711
pilgrim and now he just is no meeting
this penitent so souls who are as lost as

762
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,560
he is,
uh,

763
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:16,580
about the place and they all
ask him for directions which,

764
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,210
which, which were they are singing
in exit with there in that desert,

765
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,620
the desert to be in the desert.
Where is the desert?

766
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,090
This is where one is the desert.
If you don't know which way to go,

767
00:51:29,091 --> 00:51:34,091
the desert is the unmapped space
between Egypt typological speaking and

768
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,500
Jerusalem. It's some space
in between. I have no roots.

769
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:43,760
You have no paths, there are no
carvings and markers left for you.

770
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,810
And so they ask him,

771
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:49,040
you can you are lions sips
and foreign if you know,

772
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,580
show us the way to go up the
mountain and virtual answered.

773
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,680
You think perhaps we are acquainted
with this praises but we are strangers.

774
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:02,660
That's what it means to be an exile
and that's what it means to write this

775
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,960
poetry of exile. That Dante,
we'll right this a pull,

776
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:09,080
that Oreo is the place of the desert.

777
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,570
There's a spirituality even of the
desert and certainly the statement of the

778
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:17,720
exit condition.
We really don't belong here.

779
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:22,930
We're always displaced and going somewhere
else and the end up at the basis of

780
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,920
the Dantes or religious longing
there is the sense of displacement.

781
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,750
There is a sense of where we are somehow
out of that our hearts are out of where

782
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:37,430
they should be. We came but now we're a
little while before you buy another road,

783
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:42,431
which was so rough and hard that another
client would seem to us as a pastime.

784
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:48,100
The souls who had perceived from my
breeding that was still in life turn Pale

785
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:53,270
with wonder and this to a messenger who
bears and olive branch that people crowd

786
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:55,940
to hear the news and no one,
he's a crush.

787
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,740
So every one of his fortunate souls fixed
his eyes on my face as if forgetting

788
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:03,080
to go and make themselves fair.

789
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,440
Now he then becomes the object of
temptation for the penitent souls.

790
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:11,180
They should be going somewhere.

791
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:15,380
They should be going up the mountain
and yet they stop where they are.

792
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,770
So another, another way of
thinking about forgetfulness and,

793
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:24,770
and the sense of, uh, of, of uh,
of a name of a place to, to reach.

794
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,740
Let's see how this is developed. I saw
one of them come forward. There's so many,

795
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,300
so much affection to embrace me that
it moved me to do the same or empathy

796
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:36,240
shades except in sandbars
three times a clasp.

797
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:40,230
My hands behind them and there's often
brought them back to my breasts. Wonder,

798
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:44,370
I think it was painted in my looks at
which the shade smiled in Lubeck and I

799
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,390
follow him, pressed forward
gently. He obeyed miss then.

800
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,260
Then I knew who it was and begged me
that he would stay a little and talk with

801
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:54,840
me.
This little detail of the embrace,

802
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:59,841
the field embrace is one of the three
failed in braces and way of acknowledging

803
00:54:01,141 --> 00:54:04,590
for the pilgrim. And NASA had
knowledge that the really the soles,

804
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:09,510
you have no substance reality
that we can grasp. Okay.

805
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:13,860
Um, this is the first and there will be
two more that I will talk about as we

806
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,060
proceed. He answered even as
I love the my mortal flesh.

807
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,010
So do I love the, uh, fried,

808
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:28,530
therefore a stay? But thou,
why are thou on this journey?

809
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:34,190
Micah Sela Dante meets a friend of his
youth and musician and musician who

810
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,860
probably had even said to use it,

811
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,170
not his own poetry, men from
Sienna, clearly his died.

812
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,230
So it's, it's uh, uh,

813
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:50,220
to relieve the hardship of the
journey as this is a parent.

814
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,010
An exist are more a moment of indulgence,

815
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,740
a way of a meeting with a friend,

816
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:59,410
a little pastoral interlude if you wish,
uh,

817
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,680
to break up the,
uh,

818
00:55:01,681 --> 00:55:06,240
the hardness of the desert and the
implications of, of that metaphor.

819
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,100
The world of, not the quest,
but now the pause, the pause of,

820
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,260
of refraction,
the paws of relief,

821
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,120
the aesthetic relief that this can give
him my cassela to return at a time.

822
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,330
But why are you, uh, or take this road?

823
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:25,080
But from the how has so much time being
taken and he said, no wrongest than me.

824
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,400
Uh, et cetera. He explains
how he got here and die.

825
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:35,090
If a new law does not take from the
memory or practice of the songs of love,

826
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,730
which used to quiet,
oh my longings.

827
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:44,190
They said that this clearly
is a reflection on the
power of aesthetics and on

828
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:48,200
the limits of aesthetics made.

829
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,700
Please do refresh my soul
with them for awhile,

830
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,790
which is so spent coming
here with my body.

831
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,070
And so Casella starts singing a song,

832
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:01,340
which is a poem that Dante himself
wrote and now he sets it in music as he

833
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:06,930
probably may have done in this life.
Love that this course is to me,

834
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:08,940
my mind, he began then. So sweetly,

835
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,420
the sweetness sounds within me stale
and his sweetness is to be understood as

836
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:18,750
the attribute of musical harmony.

837
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:23,740
I know the sweetness and I indicated
this when talking about the, the is,

838
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:28,960
it's always the language job
of, of the Palette and, and, uh,

839
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,830
the savoring a certain savoring
that goes on with the gluttons here.

840
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:37,570
It's really a musical attributes.
This, the quality of the sound. Uh,

841
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,560
and, uh, my master denying these
people who were with him seemed to sec,

842
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,680
it's contentious.
If nothing else touch the mind of any,

843
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,240
we're all wrapped into attentive
to his notes. When low Cato,

844
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:53,590
the venerable old man crying.
What is this laggard spirits?

845
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,380
What negligence,
what the glaze,

846
00:56:56,381 --> 00:57:01,300
this haste to the mountain to strip
you of the slough that allows God to

847
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:06,210
manifest to you. Uh, okay.
So here is an aesthetic, the,

848
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,630
the uh, an anesthetic enclosure. Uh,

849
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:15,660
the port listens to his own song with a
little touch of narcissistic amputation

850
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:21,580
there. His cassela is playing
up to him, reassuring him,

851
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:25,330
giving him a sense,
this is you and I know who you are.

852
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,350
And they're all wrapped and they forget
about the ascent. And then of course,

853
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:34,300
Keto comes the ethical voice, the voice
of the law. So you may have a kind of,

854
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,740
you may even want to write about this
scene as a sort of conflict between

855
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,150
aesthetics and ethics.
How are they working against each other?

856
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,420
But one thing is clear here that Dante
is forgetful of the real lesson that he

857
00:57:50,621 --> 00:57:52,630
had learned in the encounter with Keto.

858
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:57,490
It just happened that Keto himself,
therefore he intervenes.

859
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:00,360
And His anger is,
it's the anger of the teachers.

860
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:04,750
But I just explained to you
what the problems are. Cato,

861
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:09,930
Virgil had approached Cato hope and had
hoped that Keto could be swayed by the

862
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:17,071
memory of the past in Cato had
rejected the power of that memory.

863
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,540
He of the, the affection or even
in the pleasure of that memory.

864
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:26,020
Dante comes in Cantu too,
and he's involved in,

865
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:29,200
let's call it even an idolatrous moment,

866
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,570
the moment where he just witnesses some
things that he has been making, uh,

867
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,330
that he has built, he has
composed, is taken in by it,

868
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:42,420
but essentially it that has the power
to distract him from his own ascent.

869
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:47,850
He has forgotten the reasons
why he is here in purgatory.

870
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:52,890
And so the whole program story begins
with the s the explicit statement about

871
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:56,950
the importance of new beginnings,
new departures,

872
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,320
the recognition that everything new and
the future can only come out of some

873
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:03,220
sense of the past.

874
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,810
And then the discovery that
the past can interfere,

875
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,010
can intrude.

876
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:14,220
And therefore the steady process of
a continuous quest that continuous

877
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:20,150
rethinking a opens up in front of
the pilgrim and in front of us. Um,

878
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,160
and the, the interesting thing and the,
and he had, I stopped, Keto uses one word.

879
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:30,200
What kind of negligence is this?
And you know what the word means?

880
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,610
Negligence. We're all negligent. But what
are we, when we are negligence, what does,

881
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,410
what does the word called pain?

882
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:39,910
Since they were talking about beginnings
with pollution, but at the model j,

883
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,110
which is the language of beginnings,

884
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:47,440
negligence means not
to choose what Keto is.

885
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:52,990
Reproaching Dante and his guide and all
the other souls is reproaching the power

886
00:59:54,141 --> 00:59:59,141
of poetry to produce this
atmosphere of non choice.

887
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:01,483
Ah,

888
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:06,710
and obliquely that's then what his ethics
is that we always engaged in an act of

889
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,910
choice.
He speaks from the perspective of freedom,

890
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:16,450
which literature or the [inaudible]
has the power to tame and somehow for a

891
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:21,230
moment at least here neutralize.

892
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:26,350
So you see the extraordinary degree of
self reflection and self reflection as it

893
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,190
from all points of view.

894
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:33,520
And let me stop and see if
there are questions and the
hope to be able to answer

895
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:38,870
some of this. Uh, um, elements in
the introduction of prudent pouring.

896
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:47,993
Yes.

897
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,400
He talks about leaving
behind her so clueless.

898
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:58,400
And they struck me about the
arc of his intellect leaving

899
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,910
the barcode was with, it's
called in English. Yes.

900
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,000
Is um,

901
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,800
is that also a reference to
past poetry tradition besides,

902
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:14,290
I mean I read it as sort of, um, he's
looking behind me right now. Yes. It is.

903
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:18,910
It also reference to how he's
leaving behind and excelling past,

904
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,500
uh,
past epic tradition.

905
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:26,920
The question is the metaphor, the
beginning of Purgatorio when the, the,

906
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:31,320
the poet,
so he's leaving behind a such a cruel sea.

907
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,180
Uh,
the crew seems to be in this,

908
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:38,440
actually we can agree easily add
reference to two in fair. No.

909
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:43,450
But then the question is, can
it be also reference to pass
epic, uh, uh, traditions?

910
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,520
Uh,
it could be,

911
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:48,090
but you would have to be a little bit
more specific about what you mean.

912
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,550
The all this, say for
instance, or the Aeneid, uh,

913
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:56,790
journeys by see Dan pays the divine
comedy is constantly imbricated with his

914
01:01:57,851 --> 01:02:01,700
other, um, poems. Uh,

915
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,310
and in fact,
uh,

916
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:08,240
the great poem that he recalls a
pass epic traditional is Luken. Uh,

917
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,020
and he chooses Luca because Luca is,

918
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:15,310
so I'm coming back to your car,
your, your question and tried to,

919
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:19,360
tried to welcome it and say that
indeed the it, it's possible,

920
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,840
but I have to explain why
I think it's possible.

921
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:27,140
The Lukens Pharsalia is a unique text
epic and the epic solution because it

922
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,460
deliberately places itself as a historical
or historical work that polemic of

923
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:40,350
[inaudible] toward Virgil
is that Virgil sure.

924
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:43,050
He had been talking with was talking
about the foundation of Rome.

925
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:46,830
And for the Roman, there's nothing more
historical than that. As you'll know,

926
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,480
the Romans had the peace holds a practical
people that will count. We'll, we'll,

927
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:55,740
we'll, we'll calculate history
from the foundation of the city.

928
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:00,960
They never a scheme about the garden of
Eden or be the host that's rioting about,

929
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:05,910
uh, uh, unknown events
in the past or whatever.

930
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:11,590
Uh, the Roman starts with the
foundation of the city, live it there.

931
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:16,020
So, uh, Virgil writes about the origin
of Rome in front of the point of view.

932
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:20,010
He a historical author, but he,
he mixes his historical accounts.

933
01:03:20,011 --> 01:03:24,870
It's so much mythmaking that
Luken rejects the form of poetry.

934
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:29,910
And he writes in epic about
the civil war. Luken, uh,

935
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,620
writes about Caesar and Pompey,

936
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:36,800
which clearly is a boy of other braiding
and other more pressing civil war that

937
01:03:36,901 --> 01:03:40,850
between Anthony and Augustus
and, um, and, and, and, and, and,

938
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:44,610
and alluding to the one
between Sula and Mario's,

939
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:49,320
the whole sequels, civil wars that
had punctuated and given it's,

940
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:53,680
uh, uh, it's, it's, it's the
quality and the, the, the, the,

941
01:03:53,681 --> 01:03:58,110
the distinctiveness of,
of Roman Roman history.

942
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:59,520
So,
uh,

943
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:04,640
in a way I would say that Dante is
rejecting a certain type of a epic poetry,

944
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,980
uh, that deals with, uh,
some kind of generalized,

945
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:12,900
a metaphorical account though.
For instance, he's, he's,

946
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,010
he's going to be Jason. He's going to be
a knee as I'll give to keep her in mind.

947
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,740
It would be a turn to,
uh,

948
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:23,520
at least in Canton one a
turn to the historical world.

949
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,700
And we've making poor gatory
part of history because
that's really the secret or

950
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:33,390
purgatory. Purgatory began by saying it's
part of human geography, you remember,

951
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:38,190
but not all of human history. Dante
wants to make it part of human history.

952
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:43,580
We really can go back to the garden
of Eden if not directly through some

953
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:48,520
reconstruction and shadowy,
um,

954
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:53,720
re figuration something that looks like
there will be of the garden of Eden or

955
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:55,374
something like that.

956
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:00,470
Not really utopia about something can
approach the older of the garden of Eden.

957
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:06,540
I must have confused you with this,
this answer and if so good. Thank you.

958
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:10,480
Well of course not, but I think that I
was going five different directions that,

959
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,660
and I apologize if I did.
Yes,

960
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,753
journey

961
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,960
poetry has the power you want to,

962
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,950
you can work your way to clarity
through the beauty of the poetry.

963
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:25,570
And then you were just
talking about though,

964
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:30,100
how aesthetics can get in the way and
how you can have a neutralizing effect.

965
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:32,340
And could you just talk a little
bit more about the tension there?

966
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,070
Like what do you think to the common
rule which you should be able to let you

967
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:39,120
act towards the action and
then they'll still neutral?

968
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:41,540
Yes.
Great question.

969
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:45,860
The question is that I begin
by talking today about, uh,

970
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:51,150
the journey of poetry and really ended
with the idea of the danger of poetry

971
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,520
that are that aesthetics of confrontation
that are the pure that the poet Dante

972
01:05:57,281 --> 01:05:59,980
has with a poetry of his own youth.
Ah,

973
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,680
so what gives about this tension?

974
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:05,380
Since I'm talking about a tension
between two modes of poetry,

975
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,000
I claim on the one hand that poetry
is for Dante, the way of knowing.

976
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,040
And then he has seems to get in
the way a scandal. It's a scandal.

977
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:18,280
It really stomach makes
us, makes him stumble. Uh,

978
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,600
so what is this a,
the connection between these two,

979
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,860
these two forms? Yeah, that is,
that is a really great question.

980
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,550
I think that Dante understands
that. Uh, first of all,

981
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:36,370
let me just give him a great deal
of credit. By the time Dante writes,

982
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:42,870
poetry was still by and large a little
game that the province are poets were

983
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:50,371
playing in the codes of pro Vance and
northern Italy where little games about

984
01:06:51,161 --> 01:06:55,540
secret love stories,
little games about hunting,

985
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:56,290
et Cetera,

986
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,150
or the great poems of
the so called goal yards.

987
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,650
The gluttonous one said the belly
worship, Dante comes along and says, no,

988
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:10,651
this vernacular poetry can really become
the medium for knowing everything up.

989
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,330
Everything that we can humanly
can about ourselves, about God,

990
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,670
and about all the things that we can,

991
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,790
we believe in and the things
that we would like to believe in,

992
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:26,710
all the hopes and defeats that we have.
So that's a great idea of what it means.

993
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:31,030
And so it's from his point of view down
to engage his poetry within the circle

994
01:07:31,031 --> 01:07:33,910
of knowledge of what I call the
encyclopedic commpass of knowledge.

995
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:35,680
So he involves all the sciences,

996
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,590
but at the same time that you
asked me to think about that day,

997
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:43,060
electric one is not
conceivable without the other.

998
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:44,740
In order to really know,

999
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:49,660
the first thing that poacher has to do
is show that it knows itself usually the

1000
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,220
way, the reason my poetry is it's
treated as a, as a lonely art.

1001
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,300
You know that the,

1002
01:07:55,560 --> 01:08:00,370
because this meretricious it doesn't
sa it gives itself to everybody.

1003
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:01,323
Uh,

1004
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,720
I'm saying all of this builds the scene
of canto to really recall a great scene.

1005
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:09,190
We haven't got time to go into that
in recourse, in other grades in.

1006
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:11,110
And I think that Dante's really rethinking

1007
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:17,180
the famous opening scene of fuse,
the consolation of philosophy,

1008
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,120
which I don't know if you have read,
but I have mentioned it, but you will,

1009
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:23,820
you look like someone who would go to the
library now and pick up the beer. It's,

1010
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:27,350
it's really, it's really a
book. It's a no, I'm serious.

1011
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,080
It's really a book where
the philosopher is sick

1012
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,273
in bed.

1013
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:36,240
He is, he does not know his
disease and other to find comfort,

1014
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:41,140
he picks up a book of poetry. The musers
go to him. What's up a book of poetry,

1015
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:44,700
which probably is what most people
will do with the got the flu.

1016
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:46,830
It's time to read good poetry,
right?

1017
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:51,910
And then all of a sudden
lady philosophy your peers.

1018
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:52,900
Yeah.

1019
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:57,210
And banishes this musers get the hands,
you hollered,

1020
01:08:57,211 --> 01:09:01,540
he calls them of the theater because
you don't give any real remedy.

1021
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,990
You just only provide provisional solace.

1022
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,000
So what [inaudible] is doing is,

1023
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:12,080
so the whole [inaudible] philosophy
is really better than than poetry.

1024
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:17,770
Hey, way of recasting the
old platonic oral as, as we
know from even the republic,

1025
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:22,690
right between the debate between poetry
and and and, and, and the, and philosophy.

1026
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,430
What Dante's doing this, no, no.

1027
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:29,340
Poetry may have this dangerous
temptations, impossibilities.

1028
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,510
But that's what makes it part of
its own self knowledge. I want to,

1029
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:39,640
I can not guarantee or promise that
poetry will lead you to knowledge unless I

1030
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:42,580
show that the medium
that I use knows itself.

1031
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:45,970
It knows its whole own temptations.
It's known,

1032
01:09:45,971 --> 01:09:50,170
it knows its home meretricious
possibilities. You see what I'm saying?

1033
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,900
It always a comp one.
It says,

1034
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:57,790
would you want me to highlight the reasons
of that day elected that tension and

1035
01:09:57,791 --> 01:10:02,500
that the only answer I can give is
that one flanks, the other constantly.

1036
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:06,940
So the voice of Cato and the voice
of Casella there at the same time,

1037
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:11,850
they belong necessarily
belong together in, uh, the,

1038
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:16,750
the unfolding and the articulation
of Dante's old Nah voice. This is,

1039
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,680
you know, you cannot expect to have one a
while then. If this is really dangerous,

1040
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:24,280
can I have something else?
No, no. It's not either or.

1041
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:29,200
It's both end the either or the ethical
or the aesthetic and the ethical,

1042
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:32,640
uh, as if they were to a
post forms just will not.

1043
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:35,733
Okay.

1044
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:40,900
Other questions?

1045
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:48,480
I wish you had another hour here so that
I could really talk about some of these

1046
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:53,560
details, uh, in the, in the, in
the beginning of the poem. Well,

1047
01:10:53,561 --> 01:10:57,550
since I hear none, no other questions.
Thank you. See your next start.
