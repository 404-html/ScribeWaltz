1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,990
So we begin with the Paradise,

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,703
um,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,370
which clearly is different from the
earthly paradise to paradises. We,

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,310
we went through the earthly
paradise. This is, uh,

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,790
whenever we begin the third Cantica,
which is called the paradise.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,430
And this should read,

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,440
use find that Dante uses eh Ptolemaic,

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,170
um,
structure of the cosmos.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,950
Atomic structure means that,
uh, for him, as for Ptolemy,

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,270
the earth is at the
center of the universe,

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,350
um,
unmoved immobile,

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,140
and there are a number of,
uh,

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,140
seven planets that circling around it.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,410
The moon is thought of as
a planet, Mercury, the sun,

15
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,370
then there will be Mars,
Jupiter,

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,590
and Saturn. Beyond that, there is this,

17
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,690
the heaven of the so called fixed stars.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,270
And beyond that the, uh,
premium, the Imperian,

19
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,400
the heaven or fire from which all motion,
uh,

20
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,280
begins, uh, from which time
starts. That's really where they,

21
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,600
the, the roots of time, uh, our, our, uh,

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,640
found and they stretch
out into the finite world,

23
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,520
uh, so that we really are in the
shadows of the leaves of time,

24
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,800
uh, which means that they
are, uh, all is falling and,

25
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,520
uh, being, uh, being replaced. Um,

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,030
but another thing you have to keep in
mind as you go into paradise is that, uh,

27
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,810
uh, Dante links the, uh,

28
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,290
each of the planets with, I
have said this before, I know,

29
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,310
but it bears repeating, uh,
with one of the liberal arts,

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,610
uh,
and their respectively.

31
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:19,180
The liberal arts are the seven
liberal arts. And then there were the,

32
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,200
there are two more's in
say, nine heavens, uh,

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,820
begins with grammar in
the planet of the moon.

34
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,350
And so you will have to expect that you
will find the language of Grammarians

35
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,150
Grammar, uh, the moon and
grandma, the, the, um,

36
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,510
if a very wide definition or what
grammar can be. It includes poetry,

37
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,750
includes history, even include
some rhetorical tropes, um,

38
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,000
and then the heaven of, uh, of,

39
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,350
of mercury with dialectics.

40
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,390
And so you're expecting to find the
language of dialectics deployed and it's

41
00:02:57,391 --> 00:03:00,610
going to be the, uh, deployed
throughout the Canto,

42
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,620
the having of Venus and rhetoric that
probably is the least surprising,

43
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,740
uh, arrows and rhetoric. Uh,

44
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,910
I have an old a kinship.
They seem to each other.

45
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,510
Then they have enough Mars,
the god of war,

46
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,850
which he had Dante couples
with music in the persuasion.

47
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,970
That music is a harmony made
off of discordant parts.

48
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,201
So that there is a,

49
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:34,201
is kind of the same time simultaneously
a pool and a strife within the heaven

50
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:40,060
of, uh, of Mars. So that
old music then beyond that,

51
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,900
there's geometry, uh, linked with, uh,

52
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:49,380
the temperateness of Jupiter and
beyond that astronomy and or Saturn,

53
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,890
uh, they haven't really fixed
stars is tide is linked to, um,

54
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,923
ethics.

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,570
Whereas the heaven of the Imperian is
really the heaven of metaphysics is Dante,

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,430
we'll call it. And it will see
the kind of interesting, uh, uh,

57
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,340
arguments that Dante we'll
have because in effect is,

58
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,290
has changed his mind in when writing
the philosophical text known as the

59
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:19,210
banquet. Uh, you know, now the
come Viveo he writes it in Italian.

60
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,320
Uh,

61
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,320
he had a really claimed that ethics is
the first or the most important of the

62
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:30,700
arts. It's really the,
the, the discipline tote,

63
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:34,570
which all the are to chose other
arts are subordinated and Toad,

64
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:38,680
which they all points when
Dante writes the Paradiso,

65
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,490
he has changed his mind about that.
Though.

66
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:47,290
He also knows that in many ways
you cannot quite separate ethics,

67
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,370
whatever he means by ethics with
some theory about how the world is,

68
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,170
they really are inseparable. And
Dante, we'll go on back and forth in a,

69
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,790
in a re, uh, configuring
the relation of those two,

70
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,840
uh, uh, disciplines. The
other thing that I, uh,

71
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,130
I should mention before
we go on is that, uh, uh,

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,160
much of the Paradiso
really, uh, it's, it's,

73
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,010
it's going to come through as a way of,
is it teaching?

74
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,810
Uh, it's already implied that this
should be the thrust of Paradiso,

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,510
but the very idea that, uh, the,

76
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:29,800
there is the disposition of the arts
and sciences in through parties,

77
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,820
which means that the journey that Dante,
we'll have this cosmological journey.

78
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,390
It's an interplanetary German, he
goes from planet to planet, uh,

79
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,530
is already, Eh, an educational journey.

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,630
That's so he goes through grammar,
rhetoric, dialectic, et Cetera, et cetera.

81
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:51,310
Til He reaches a metaphysics or,
and beyond that there will be theology.

82
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,470
Uh, so it's, uh, it's,
it's, it's literally a,

83
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:59,240
an educational journey.
And this is already understood.

84
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,680
Those words already carried
out by the focus on, uh,

85
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,740
the teaching that Beatrice will deliver.

86
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,810
So I have to say a couple of things that
Danfoss teacher in paradise and this

87
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,580
is,
is an innovative,

88
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,090
very imaginative and
highly unusual move on.

89
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:22,091
The part of a port is not some kind of
abstract matron called Dame philosophy.

90
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,030
It's not some kind of allegory of nature.
You know,

91
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,010
you do have this kind of allegorical,

92
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,010
didactic categories where
nature appears as a, uh,

93
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,630
larger,

94
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,630
the disheveled woman wounded egos
because nature is fallen teaching.

95
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,140
Uh, the, the, the, the, the pilgrim or,

96
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:48,141
or that or that or the tray
or the traveler about the
secrets of nature and the

97
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,940
wealth of nature. Here
is a personal, uh, his,

98
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,380
his girlfriend to be sure.

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,680
And it's someone who also replaces all
the other likely candidates for this

100
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:02,780
teaching,
which is w would be Aquinas,

101
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,790
a boy he'd used to Bonaventure Oh,
figures that he's going to meet. Um,

102
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,310
it's a mistake to believe however,

103
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,630
that as some great scholars or
of Dante have said in the past,

104
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,700
the police was really a journey to
be a Trish. That's what they did say.

105
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,650
That's not the case because
Beatrice will disappear from,

106
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,360
she would still be within view,
up to a point in, in, in paradise.

107
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,530
But a role ends with Canto 30 of Paradiso.

108
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,550
And that from that point on,
a mistake by the name of Bernard,

109
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:41,690
the historical figure,
Bernard of Clairvaux will take place.

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,800
So this leads me now to
a further clarification.

111
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,090
Um,

112
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,090
they may be the tendency in some of you
to view the [inaudible] as some kind of

113
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:56,270
account to the mystical
experience. Uh, you know what, I'm,

114
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,330
what I'm saying that Dante sort of goes
beyond his own self beyond and the idea

115
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,690
of rational understanding of the world.

116
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:08,691
They're so rendering of
his own subjectivity to
some insight into the whole

117
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,410
this, I don't think that this
is what's happening here. Dante,

118
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:17,411
we'll preserve his rationality and his
sense of distinction and separation from

119
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:23,471
some kind of cosmic or cosmological
and cosmic hall till the very end.

120
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,980
Uh, there is a way in which Dante
we'll deploy the language of the,

121
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,700
of the mistakes.

122
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,150
And I want to give you some evidence of
that because I think that it opens up an

123
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:36,570
interesting chapter for your further
readings. Uh, but it's, he's not,

124
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:40,970
this is not to be read as a kind of
subscription of a mystical experience,

125
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,721
uh,

126
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:46,721
where the text then goes on in some
kind of a random approximation or random

127
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:50,750
copying of what the mistake.
So,

128
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,670
and becomes ineffable.

129
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,610
Dante uses occasionally if toward
the end the language of ineffability.

130
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,110
But this is,

131
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,170
remains a poetic construction and
imaginative projection into where it is a

132
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:08,640
journey into the absolute unknown,
into a space.

133
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,000
No other imagination had
really traveled and if those,

134
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,120
and have been those who had traveled
there, but they never really took,

135
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,180
came back to tell us Dante,
we'll play with that.

136
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,720
His is to use that language
and kind of a way of,

137
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:26,721
of getting into that which had
been left inarticulate and silent.

138
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,120
It's really largely a
battle against, uh, the,

139
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:38,040
the, um, for a poet threatening
a boundaries of silence.

140
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,930
Something that threatens him
with, uh, with uh, uh, uh,

141
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,920
with the defeat.
He will not be able to speak.

142
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,760
And from one point of view that the
feed for the Christian could also be of

143
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,560
course a victory,

144
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,750
but Dante is suspended between the two,
the two poles.

145
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,730
If I had to define,

146
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:04,500
and I have already given a kind of general
definition or what kind of ages and

147
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,570
which rubric, uh, should we
try to go on reading? Uh,

148
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,510
this part of the poem, I really
think this is, um, uh, is,

149
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,960
is really a poem about beauty,
uh, in the sense that, uh,

150
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,990
uh, Dante Hill tried to
understand what the beauty is.

151
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:26,880
Beauty is the visibility of,
of Patina says this. It's the,

152
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,360
the visibility of being,
he calls it being life.

153
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,190
The whole of life becomes visible only
because we have perceptions and images of

154
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:39,510
it. So it's, it's, I think
that Dante's trying to, uh, to,

155
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,480
to see that, to explore, uh,

156
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,460
what is that lies beyond that
which we see, um, what is,

157
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,840
is this beauty skin deep is it were,

158
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,140
because that's really one of the
dangers of focusing on beauty.

159
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:56,490
That it's really the surface of things,
the appearance of things. And, and,

160
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,370
and he will go between appearances,
images,

161
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,580
and some s in the idea that there
are essences are lying beyond them.

162
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,820
Um, okay. So I really
have said more or less,

163
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,370
all I had to say in the mode of,
uh,

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,690
of an introduction and I
immediately get into the, uh,

165
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,060
can't have one. Uh, let me just read,

166
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:21,810
Canto one a little bit with,
in some detail

167
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,510
the glory.
That's the way it starts.

168
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,510
The glory of Him who moves all things
penetrates the universe and shines in one

169
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:39,300
part more and in another less.

170
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,050
That's the first tercet
famous for [inaudible].

171
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,310
And I will read this in Italian
so that you sense how even the,

172
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,180
the rhythm, the rhythm of, of, of,

173
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:56,181
of the poem completely changes the rhythm
and even the syntactical structure of

174
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:00,990
the poem because you made
a call and I say this, uh,

175
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,820
knowing that you have
already noticed that,

176
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,670
that if you read Canto one of him fair,
no,

177
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,860
or Canto Wando purgatory did to exhort
idioms of the other canticles you know,

178
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:16,861
that the poet is immediately casting
himself into the role of the agent.

179
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:23,380
Right in the middle of the journey of
my life, I found myself that's really,

180
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,250
uh,
uh,

181
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,980
the very start of in fair no
one and in purgatory or to, uh,

182
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,580
uh, to course of a
better waters, the ship,

183
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,120
the boat of my genius now
goes and I were saying,

184
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,150
you remember not so in paradise or there
is a way in which immediately the first

185
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:46,710
tercet which has a car.
So to premial value, uh,

186
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,750
seeks to bracket the idea of the self
and the idea of the subjectivity.

187
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,330
It emphasizes the question of uh,
uh,

188
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,760
what God becomes the agent here is to
say it in a very direct as director,

189
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,220
the season says the glory.
It's a circumlocution once again,

190
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,110
but let me read it in Italian so that I
can, I can give you a sense, as I said,

191
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,640
of the new music that he has
found a new sense of, uh,

192
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,790
the in the Harmoni that toad
which language you have to, uh,

193
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,840
strive La Gloria the curoil to move
the Loonie Val's so pay and they try to

194
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:28,080
respond in an Aperitif view,
a I'll trough.

195
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,000
That's it. And it's rendered very,
very faithfully by Saint Claire.

196
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:36,610
I Dunno the other translations,
but probably they can deviate from edge,

197
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,630
but very much, and I read it in
Italian because I also would like you,

198
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,610
and this is understandable to the eye,
if not just to the ear for you, uh,

199
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:50,380
how he's playing with in line one,
the glory of Him who,

200
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,510
or moves. So God, the mover, I'll talk
about it in a little more. The, the, the,

201
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,760
the one who moves all in that,
oh,

202
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,910
then becomes one in the next line universe
or the old becomes a that which has

203
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:08,440
turned into one. That's what the
team logically the universe. Uh,

204
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,780
and then, uh, it goes on,
pen penetrates and uh,

205
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,770
uh, the university and shines in
one part more and in another less,

206
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,660
um, well, uh, the thirst it casts.

207
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,340
Um, God, Oh,

208
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,050
this is about God as a circumlocution.
He's not a,

209
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,600
it's really a god who is visible
through God's effects. Uh,

210
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,060
is God appears,
is kind of course now.

211
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:40,510
Then if you really understand the
effects it means is a causality.

212
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,810
I don't want to get into too much
into that, but you know what I mean?

213
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,040
That simple. You only know the
effects. You know the glory.

214
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,920
We see the glory, which is the
light glory. It's a semantic for us.

215
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:56,060
The first thing we have to
say, this is a, Eh, a shift,

216
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,510
a change in the history of the word.

217
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,190
That's what poets do. What it was.
The poets invent reinvent language.

218
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,390
That's largely what they do. They
change the meaning of words. Glory.

219
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,380
In the classical time and all the way
down to the renaissance in the romantic

220
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:14,730
age, our glory means, uh,

221
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,850
it means fame in sees the child of clear,
I mean the,

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
the power we have to survive now try the
posthumous life because whatever noble

223
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:29,390
deeds heroes may have achieved,
that's not what it means here.

224
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,070
Glory means light. It's like, of course
they're light to once fame if you wish.

225
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:37,220
But this is the light and fast.
And why do we know that?

226
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:42,140
Because light now is linked to two verbs
of the glory of Him who all think moves

227
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,530
all things, uh, penetrates
the universe and shines.

228
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,670
So you see there is says there's a
metaphor of light that is conveyed here.

229
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,900
So the first Tercet, uh,
presents God in the, in a,

230
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,600
in a cosmological row,

231
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,670
which is double one of motion
and one of light to things. It,

232
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,530
he come,
Dante's combining.

233
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,660
And that is still telian idea
of God as the prime mover,

234
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,020
the one who imparts motion to all things.

235
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,200
And the second image is that of God as
the principal of light and neoplatonic

236
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:20,540
idea.
So He's fusing together.

237
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,900
Two contradictory apparently
contradictory traditions,

238
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,060
light emotion.
One is talking in terms of causality.

239
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,200
And the other one really, I'm not going
to go much, much further than this.

240
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,370
The other one in terms of,
because light does that penetrates,

241
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,150
shines all over,
uh,

242
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,270
according to a principle of hierarchy
more unless there is no uniformity in and

243
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,520
with light. And I'll come back
to this notion in a moment. Uh,

244
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:57,550
but so one idea cast God is the prime
mover according to the tradition of

245
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:59,480
restore telian philosophy.

246
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:04,430
The other one thinks of God as in
the mode of light or participation.

247
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,980
They are two different theological modes.

248
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,570
God participates is part
of creation, right? Uh,

249
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,040
the natural world is part
of the supernatural world.
It's not just a causality,

250
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,760
uh, the course begins or
things and then somehow, uh,

251
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,250
retreats in some sorts
of, uh, uh, invisible, uh,

252
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,660
and unknown, uh, uh,
non space or of its own.

253
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,610
Uh, the other, uh, item and this,
the first tercet is that of the,

254
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,580
that I want to emphasize is
the principle of hierarchy.

255
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,440
Light shines more and less. Uh,
I have been hinting at this,

256
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,490
this is really a great problem for Dante
in, in, in other parts of the poem,

257
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:50,010
you remember two course
over better waters,

258
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,900
Dante says in Purgatorio one, and that
implies of course, that there are bad,

259
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,310
good, better, best, uh, that we
are in the principle of hierarchy.

260
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,500
Differences are very crucial for
Dante because they, they, they,

261
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,540
they allow us to know things. Only two
differences. And also the, because,

262
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,770
uh,
this,

263
00:18:10,771 --> 00:18:15,260
this differences and that's the value
of hierarchy are still combined in some

264
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,140
way. Some kind of unified, uh, structure.

265
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:23,700
Hierarchy is a structure that unifies all
differences according to the principle

266
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:28,470
of degree. Uh, more of this a
little bit later as we go on.

267
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:30,550
And then Dante, now, uh,

268
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,280
I said he's not a mystic subjectivities
not erased that mistakes.

269
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,130
10 though they all claim a unique vision,

270
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,850
they all end up resembling each other.
When they talk about the ineffable.

271
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,970
Dan Introduces now the
subject and he says,

272
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,440
I was in the heaven that
most receives is light.

273
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,120
There is to say past in the Imperian,
which is sort of spiritual,

274
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,570
uh,
he was in as close to God as it can be,

275
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,840
a which will also be as
far from God as it can be.

276
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,680
Um,
uh,

277
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,860
I was in the heaven that most receives
his light and I sold things which he,

278
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:17,550
that descends from it has not the
knowledge of the power to tell again.

279
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,610
So,
uh,

280
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,830
no sooner does Dante introduce
his subjectivity as and,

281
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,970
and his, his, uh,

282
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,230
a way of knowing and the are
this intimacy of closeness to,

283
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,310
to the,
the,

284
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,860
the beatific vision than he has
also to cast himself as a visionary,

285
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,120
has no knowledge or the power to,

286
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,440
I saw things and you will see how
Dante goes or refining his eyesight.

287
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:51,010
A little detail that you might really
enjoy is that we do know that Dante would

288
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:56,550
use lenses, glasses, uh, toward the
end of the had just been invented.

289
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,260
You know, there are books written
about when we're a glasses in the,

290
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,630
whether they invented in piza
where they invaded in Padua.

291
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,540
There have been wars
going on about this claim,

292
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,490
but then he uses uses glasses.
So he really had difficulty.

293
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,670
That's the point in seeing and the whole
of Paradiso is about the refinement of

294
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:21,080
site and the refinement of vision.
How you're going to be able to, a,

295
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,610
to attune as it were, your eyes to
the objects that aren't you. Anyway,

296
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,880
he cast himself. Now he's a visionary
with an internal vision. You know, it's,

297
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:34,170
I'm not casting him as a homer who is
blind that therefore he sees everything

298
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,890
with the inner thigh, but he wants
to be a visionary report and they,

299
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:42,270
so things which this to say,
one who sees things as a whole.

300
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,200
That's what the difference between
ear, you know, there are great,

301
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,230
great debates within the ear and AI is
that the ear you hear and you hear all

302
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,480
this old for bomb in the,

303
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,550
in the linear way and all the
things can come from all sides,

304
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:02,260
but you can only catch a thing at a
time with the eye. You have the eyes,

305
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,700
the Olgan gives you the chance to the
old one of the contemplative gives you a

306
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:11,110
chance to see, uh, totalities I ISO
things which she had the sense from.

307
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:14,920
It has not the knowledge
of the power to tell again.

308
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,160
And then he explains why he explains
to the status of his poetic language.

309
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,480
I, so what is the relationship between
language and vision? That's the,

310
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:27,790
if you want to put it
in a very abstract way,

311
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,030
how are the two related
to farther intellect?

312
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,920
Joy near to its desire? Uh, intellect, uh,

313
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,730
yearns longs for the
object that it desires.

314
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,130
So there is a desire of
the mind that desire.

315
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,100
It's not just the desire of
the up intellectual desires.

316
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,110
A sink so deep that memory can
not follow it. Very simple.

317
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,430
Forgetfulness intervenes so that the,

318
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,520
he may have an intuition
and insight into things.

319
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,570
He can not quite go on a
recalling what it nevertheless,

320
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,330
so much of the Holly Kingdom is,
I was able to treasury,

321
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:08,020
my mind shall now be matter of my song.

322
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,350
So whatever he's going to tell us is
literally a shadow of things he manages to

323
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,420
remember.

324
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,160
And it makes sense that he should not
remember because part one of the paradoxes

325
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,840
of this political structure is the
following you. He has a beatific vision.

326
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,220
How can he retain in his mind,
the site which is finite,

327
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,110
that which is infinite,

328
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,150
if not through vestiges and if
not through through shadows.

329
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,040
You know, how can you, how can my memory,
which is, which is a metaphor of time,

330
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,830
right? By definition, I
remember certain things,

331
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,190
but how can I go on remembering and
holding that which is without time,

332
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,490
which is infinite.
So the first paradox of,

333
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,600
in the representation of Paradise,
let me go on with the next one.

334
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Next paragraph.
Now,

335
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,400
Dante turned to the god of poets to a
Polo or good Apollo for the last labor

336
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,390
make me such a vessel of
their power. Ah, he's, he's,

337
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,540
he cast himself into a passive
mode vessel one who receives,

338
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,490
uh, he's, he's, it's, it's the
language of, uh, of restraint.

339
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,330
It's a language robe holding back.
It's, it's, uh, it's in a sense,

340
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:33,100
it's really the classical are
commonplace, you know, of, of, uh,

341
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,840
asking the muse to breathe through
us. You know, sing to me your muse.

342
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,720
Remember, uh, the, uh, the, the,
the, the, the Elian, uh, uh,

343
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,200
in this, hey, I'm a
variant of the same thing.

344
00:23:45,201 --> 00:23:48,580
A variation of the same thing
happens in the office. Oh, good.

345
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:52,910
I apologize for the last label. Make
me such a vessel. That power is,

346
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:56,360
that requires for the gift
of their loved Laurel.

347
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,160
What an extraordinary image.

348
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,370
This is a remembering the story
of the God who chases Daphne.

349
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,240
The object of his desire. We
chicken, not really obtain,

350
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,100
that's the stolen, you all know
the story in the metamorphosis,

351
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,730
but he can only obtain, uh,
Daphne, which means lower in Greek,

352
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,710
but he only killed, contain
this young maiden, uh, uh,

353
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,660
Daphne in the form of a
metaphor for the Laurel crown.

354
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:28,500
So it's a sort of a journey,
which is somehow, uh,

355
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,920
the object of which becomes the
procession of the object becomes the,

356
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,840
becomes this located not quite
what the God himself wanted.

357
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,590
But this introduces something
else about the, the, the,

358
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:44,510
the Paradiso thus far,
the one peak of per Nassis has to face me.

359
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,560
You may remember this is a recall of the
dream of Parnassus in purgatory that we

360
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:55,361
saw when the stations and Virgil were
flattered into believing that what they

361
00:24:55,761 --> 00:25:00,440
had dreamt is actually the,
the, the simulacrum of the,
of the earthly paradise.

362
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,350
That's where the one pecan for NASA says,
suffice me.

363
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,540
But now I have need of both
language of humility, um,

364
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,360
entering into the arena
and the arena that remains.

365
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,010
He's a struggle. Now. First of all,

366
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,030
they had introduced this image of
himself as a vessel receptive to the,

367
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,530
uh, inspiration of Apollo. Now,

368
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:25,340
the language of even violence into
the arena where there's a sports,

369
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,110
whether it's is, uh, battles are
fought, enter into the arena.

370
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,870
Now entering on the arena that remains.
And now look at this,

371
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:38,170
come into my breasts and breathe there
as when thou Jewess Marcis from the

372
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:42,310
Scabbard of his limbs,
uh,

373
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,760
an echo of the struggle
between the poet and the God.

374
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,990
He does not want to be like Marcis
because Marsha's Harold presumption.

375
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,970
So that's now you understand the language
of restraint and withholding the Lang,

376
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,040
I will presumption Marcis had tried to
outdo a Apollo and of course was defeated

377
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,640
by a polo and flayed by Apollo.
Dante is not want to,

378
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,910
but this is about is the fear in the
battle for the description of paradise.

379
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,380
That the fear that he may
be usurping God's role,

380
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,710
the fear that he may be transgressing
and violating that which is the,

381
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,850
uh, the sovereign claim of, of
the gods. So he continues now,

382
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,340
or power divine. So that's
one of the, uh, images of a,

383
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,260
a fear of blast for me.
Fear of transgression.

384
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,100
And this will continue to them about the
possibility of Hubris, in other words.

385
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,240
And then it continues our power divine,

386
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:49,470
if they'll granted me so much of myself
that I made sure for the shadow of the

387
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:51,570
blessed kingdom imprinted in my brain,

388
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,800
thou shall see me come
to the chosen three,

389
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,690
call rule and crown myself.

390
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:02,190
Then with those leaves are which the
theme and thou will make me worthy.

391
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,180
So seldom father are there gathered
for triumph of Caesar or poet.

392
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,120
Falton shame of human wheels.

393
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,450
That opinion bowel must be get gladness
in the glad Delphic God when it makes

394
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:19,980
any, any long for it, a great
frame for falls, huddle, spark,

395
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,050
uh, etc. And then the lamp of the
world, I'm just give you this, uh,

396
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,930
uh, Dante is, uh, uh, approaching,

397
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,980
uh, he's moving. He thinks
he's on earth. Uh, and,

398
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,810
and he discovers that I will not
go on into to details in the,

399
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,160
he discovers that his, uh,
uh, on, uh, uh, heaven,

400
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,450
uh, in, in, in, on the moon.
Uh, so he describes here,

401
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,110
this is the image at the bottom.
Page 21 line 65.

402
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:57,090
And following Beatrice stood with her
eyes fixed only on the terminal wheels and

403
00:27:57,091 --> 00:28:01,320
on. Ha, I fixed mine, withdrawn
from above at her aspect.

404
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,770
I was changed within as was globalist
when he tasted of the herbs that made him

405
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:12,590
one among the other gods
in the sea. Uh, it's,

406
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,700
it's a story of,
uh,

407
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,780
clearly the pilgrim is moving into another
level of experience and our level of

408
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:23,781
being and hearing remarks
on the transformation that
he is undergoing and the,

409
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,130
the, the emphasis falls in the
distance between the UVD an account of,

410
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,330
of,
of uh,

411
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,540
Glaukos who believes that he's immortal
and jumps into the water of the tasting

412
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:37,524
of some herbs.

413
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,710
And Dante himself is indicated by
that little preposition within the

414
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:47,250
transformation occurs in
Dante from within himself.

415
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:51,720
No in some literal way
outside, uh, on the outside.

416
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,960
And then he continues the passing beyond
humanity cannot be set forth and words

417
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,790
that the examples of Pfizer therefore
for whom to cook, for him to embrace,

418
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,150
uh, reserves. The experience,

419
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,650
experience the pilgrim is having
is unique and irreducible.

420
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,330
And the poem,
we can only be read as an example,

421
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,430
as an account of, uh, of,
uh, what has happened to him.

422
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:23,340
And then he continues.
If I was only the part of me,

423
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:27,180
which that creates this last thou
knowest love who goes to heaven,

424
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,040
who with Dai flight did raise me and your,

425
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,260
your, your notes. Your footnotes
will tell you that this is a, uh,

426
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,010
a reference to the second letter
to the Corinthians chapter 12.

427
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,290
Bye Paul. Bye. Same Paul, uh, with uh,

428
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,890
he also tells the story of um,
uh,

429
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,920
his, uh, being wrapped
to the third heaven.

430
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,323
So

431
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,300
we have the two accounts
and Canto one of, of, of,

432
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,390
of experiences.
One is that of a,

433
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,120
of encounters with a divine. One is
that of the profit nation by marshes.

434
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,430
And the other one leaves by saying,
Paul, who is, you recall Dante, uh, uh,

435
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,280
casts as one of the
possible models for him.

436
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,290
Says when at the beginning he has
to set out from the Jordan says,

437
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:25,030
I'm not an ears. I'm not poor. Now we
see how Paul comes into play. Who am I?

438
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,750
Then that was the whole thrust of
the point. What happens to Paul?

439
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,910
Paul goes to the third
heaven. Uh, and, and, and,

440
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:36,010
and people have a way of a head away in
the Middle Ages especially said why many

441
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:38,020
have inside of their, uh, you know,

442
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,250
the third heaven and what is meant by
the third heaven was the third modal

443
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,123
vision.

444
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,410
There are levels of vision
that they emphasize that is
a literal level. Uh, the,

445
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,150
the carnal worldly level.
There's an imaginative vision.

446
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,860
And then there is the ecstatic
vision that Paul our head.

447
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,420
But the think is that the second letter
to the Corinthians is the Paul went to

448
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:05,380
the third heaven head. The,
the, the, the vision of God,

449
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,440
the beatific vision he returned
and could not speak about it,

450
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,240
hit it because what he saw had
to be kept wrapped in silence.

451
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,810
So this is now Dante is between,
uh,

452
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:23,800
on the one hand Marcis and that
funeral definition. And now Paul,

453
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,790
it is as if he also is
transgressing the teaching of Paul.

454
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,150
That the whole of paradise is about
limits and the possibility of establishing

455
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:39,400
clear limits.
He will do what Paul himself could not do.

456
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,820
Paul kept quiet in the belief that the
silence was the proper language of this.

457
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:51,400
His sublime experience. Dante,
we'll go on speaking pill.

458
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:56,380
It's possible to him to do so. The
final, he really has forgotten, uh,

459
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,610
everything that I've seen. So you see
how he's casting himself, his own point,

460
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:05,080
the powers, his own subjectivity
between two different modalities.

461
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,760
He doesn't want to go as
presumptuously far as Marcy has did.

462
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:14,880
He does not one tool
retreat as a s a s Paul did.

463
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:18,720
Okay. Uh, I really think that
I should let you know. No,

464
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,750
I take a little digression before we
go into the second part of the Canto.

465
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,753
Okay.

466
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,310
And Ken to one and two where Dante is
really going to face a peculiar issue.

467
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,260
The universe. I mean, is it a
material universe that's the,

468
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,220
that's the, the, the,
the thrust Canton tool.

469
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,000
Is this a natural than part
of the natural world or not?

470
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,170
Cause I'm talking about the spots on the
moon, that's Cetera. We'll come to that.

471
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:53,460
Um, and here in Canton one was just see
that he's going to discuss the, the,

472
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,320
the arrangement of, of the
cosmos. But you have to know.

473
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,010
I want you to too. I want to to, uh,

474
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,190
share with you a couple of paragraphs
of a letter that Dante writes,

475
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,680
uh, to introduce paradise.
This is what had happened. Um,

476
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,430
he lives in Ravenna when he's writing.
He's probably [inaudible] at the time.

477
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:20,180
He writes, uh, the earthly
paradise as you know,

478
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:24,680
he makes references to the garden of
Eden in terms of the park, the pine wood,

479
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,560
the wood or pine trees
around the city. Um, uh,

480
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,240
we do know that he will
live and die in Ravenna, uh,

481
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:40,270
but he decides to send the first
10 cantors paradise to the,

482
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:45,590
uh, so called, uh, can, uh, the, the,

483
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:50,591
the great dog of Verona who had been
his patron for a number of years.

484
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:54,770
And he introduces his 10 cancers
that his ends with a letter code.

485
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,750
The letter to, uh, can grant the anytime
they say Dante writes, I, you know,

486
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:03,980
that this is the 10th letter over a number
of letters that he writes. This is, uh,

487
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,390
this is the, uh, let me
just read this. This, uh,

488
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,530
um,
it's a kind of glossing.

489
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,890
It explains the genre of the
poem, explains what his, uh,

490
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,390
um, models have been, how has to be read.

491
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:24,530
But look what he says about this, uh, uh,

492
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,270
circumlocution here, um,
about Paul the apostle.

493
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,020
They feel this is from paragraph 27.
It's not a really long letter,

494
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:36,980
but I couldn't read the whole thing
with uh, uh, putting y'all to sleep.

495
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:42,290
The philosopher presents an argument
constant with the above in the first book

496
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:47,240
on, on Heaven, uh, the
philosophy of meaning at a store
too. Well, he says that I,

497
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,320
heaven quote,

498
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:52,550
has material more normal than
that of other heavens beneath it.

499
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:57,220
To the extent it has this more distance,
then they from the earth and ability,

500
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:00,680
uh,
in a hierarchical structure,

501
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,490
the nobility of matter,

502
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:07,280
it will depend on its
proximity to the source of, uh,

503
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,960
of a, of light and life.
Uh, okay. And to this,

504
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,041
and too,

505
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:17,780
this might be added with the Apostle
Paul told the Ephesians concerning Christ

506
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,110
who was centered above all the
heavens that he might fill all things.

507
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,370
This is the heaven of the olds.

508
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:25,970
Pleasures to which pleasures at
Gq refers in accusing Lucifer.

509
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,340
Thou was the seal of resemblance,

510
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,290
full of wisdom and perfect in beauty that
was in the pleasure of the paradise of

511
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:38,040
God and after having said in the silicon
persecution that he wasn't that part of

512
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:38,874
paradise,

513
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,060
he continues meaning he meaning I himself
by stating that he sold things which

514
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:45,230
he will descends sense,

515
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,400
cannot relate and it gives the cause of
they're saying that the intellect goes

516
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:51,600
so deeply into its desire itself,

517
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:56,430
which is God that the memory cannot
follow to understand what this means,

518
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,370
it should be noted that in this life,
the human intellect,

519
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,960
because of the affinity test
for the separated intellectual
substance with which

520
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:08,580
it shares its nature reaches such a
height of exaltation when it is Exalted,

521
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,720
that upon his return to itself having
transcended the order of the capacity of

522
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,400
men,

523
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,400
memory fails and this idea is implied
to us by the apostle addressing the

524
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:24,390
Corinthians passage. Just read where
he writes, quote, I know a man,

525
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,890
whether in the body or out
of the body, I no, no god,

526
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:33,891
no with who was caught up to the third
heaven and who heard secret words,

527
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,100
who it is not granted to men,
which is not granted to men,

528
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:43,101
to Arthur c when the intellect had passed
beyond the bounds of human capacity

529
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,720
and its exhortation, it could not remember
what happened outside these bounds.

530
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,160
And the same idea implied to us in Matthew
where the three disciples fell down

531
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:57,570
on their faces and told nothing about
it afterwards as if they had forgotten.

532
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:02,870
And it is written in the GQ quote I
saw and I fell upon my face and quote,

533
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,580
but if the PA, this passage is not satisfy
the skeptical, let them read Richard,

534
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:13,581
have some victor in his
book on contemplation or
Bernard of Clairvaux in his

535
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:18,150
book on consideration or Augustan in
his book on the capacity of the soul and

536
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:22,530
there will be no longer skeptical or
if they should bark out against the

537
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:26,190
possibility of such exaltation
because the sinfulness of the speaker,

538
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:30,180
they should read Daniel where they would
find that even the book of Donna's Sir

539
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,860
by divine permission,

540
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:37,050
so something which was a
warning two centers and then
forgot it for he who makes

541
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:42,120
the sun to rise upon the good and bad
a rain it upon the Justin the adjust

542
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,060
manifest his glory to the living,

543
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,010
no matter how evil they are sometimes
mercifully for the sake of the conversion,

544
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,160
sometimes harshly it as a punishment and
to a greater or less degree according

545
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,790
to his will.

546
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:02,030
And the reason why I want to share
this passage with you is that it really

547
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,780
places a with some clarity itch.

548
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,920
It casts it projects a light of a that
makes things clear about this state.

549
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,370
The status of the poem,

550
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:19,670
the poem involved a number of models
which are all in the contemplative

551
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,480
philosophical tradition or again,

552
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,690
it's not a stool,
the prophetic tradition,

553
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,880
but he makes them agree with
the same mode of the visionary,

554
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,710
you know, you see, that's
what the profits do.

555
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:40,470
They see in order to speak.
He has no you,

556
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,100
if your readers of the Bible,
you probably have heard, uh,

557
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:46,330
you may be right.

558
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,340
If we were to believe that there really
is no necessary link in the Bible

559
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,500
between vision,
between the mistakes,

560
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,870
those have visions and
those who are profits.

561
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,620
They are two different experiences,
two different states,

562
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,380
not so for Dante. It may be true, uh, in,

563
00:39:03,381 --> 00:39:07,610
in the Bible that they are to Dante
things that they too will go to air,

564
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,840
that you have vision in order to speak.
And that's really what the,

565
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,750
so it helps us understand
the sense of, uh, of, of, of,

566
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,620
of poetry with which, which Dante invokes
here at the beginning of Paradiso.

567
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:25,460
Let me go now. Uh, Dante has to go on, uh,

568
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:30,700
tries to find out landlines
900. So, uh, or so, uh,

569
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,950
uh, how, uh, us a question about,

570
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:40,570
uh, uh, what has been happening
to him now. I said, been moving.

571
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:43,450
He thought it was on earth and the Earth,
earthly paradise.

572
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,220
Now he seems to be on another,
on another planet. Client 95.

573
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,840
If I was freed from my perplexity,
um,

574
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:57,110
Beatrice dismisses some fancies of is
you make the surf dog with false Dan

575
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,030
fancies, sort of cannot see is the
woods, if that had cast them off,

576
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,220
you are no longer on earth as you think,

577
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,690
but lightening flying from its
own place never ran so fast.

578
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,010
Is that return to dine the journey?
Dantes is traveling so fast,

579
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:16,330
the speed of light to go from
the earthly paradise to the moon.

580
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,340
If I was freed from my
perplexity, um, dope,

581
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,300
but the brief words, she smiled to
me, I was more entangled in a new one.

582
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,280
And I said I was content already
resting from a great wonder,

583
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:35,670
but now I wonder how I should be
rising above this light substances.

584
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:42,470
Um, two, three things. One, uh,

585
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,750
that I, I should, I should,

586
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,080
I should mention to you and that will
never mention them again, but better.

587
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:51,820
This was all or unfolds the whole,
the,

588
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:56,821
the narrative economy with the pilgrim
experience in perplexities in doubt,

589
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,910
which Beatrice will clarify.
And in turn those questions,

590
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,810
those, those, those, those responses
go on triggering new doubt.

591
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,180
So it's really a question of, uh, uh,

592
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,210
doubts answers in an unending process
of the mind and lodging and large in

593
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:20,260
itself and always filled with wonder.

594
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:24,670
And that's really the language that I want
to start emphasizing for you here. Uh,

595
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,700
how Dante's using this figure of
admiration recalls at line 97,

596
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,690
or I was content resting
from a great wonder. Now,

597
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,550
why wonder and, uh, uh, this will, uh,

598
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,470
you will see continues throughout
the beginning of, uh, of, of,

599
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,340
of, of Paradise. What is this
wonder? It is, first of all,

600
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,390
a definition of the
aesthetics of paradise.

601
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,080
Wonder translates the Latin,
uh,

602
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,730
Admin Rasia uh, that's the Italian
word in English. Admiration,

603
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,890
uh,
which actually is to be understood at me.

604
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:08,540
Roseo the Lathan English admiration.
But for, for the Middle Ages,

605
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,090
it's nothing less than the sublime.

606
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,360
If you wanted to translate the medieval
era and mid axial or alliteration into

607
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:22,010
an equivalent English and aesthetic
English term would be the sublime,

608
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,950
the suit of the United States ideas.

609
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:28,750
[inaudible] it's not a romantic
idea is probably you are,

610
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,240
you're led to believe it's
an old idea. It's the, uh,

611
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:37,241
it's a Greek notion of indicating
the mind that is overwhelmed with the

612
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:43,280
spectacle of things that do wharf.

613
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:48,230
The mind thinks that the mind cannot
quite comprehend. That's the sobriety.

614
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,870
They can be the sublime in nature.

615
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:54,230
They can be the sublime and in
arts they can be other forms.

616
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:58,220
And the Sublime Dantas
mode of paradise is indeed.

617
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:02,870
This is the oscillation of a mind
that is opening up full of doubts,

618
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,990
which really now that's what he
becomes subjective, critical.

619
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,760
And then the experience with
sublime overwhelming him, uh,

620
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,990
uh,
show.

621
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:16,991
But this idea of the sublime now
introduces a picture of the universe,

622
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,590
the way Beatrice will deliver it.

623
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,410
She therefore, after a sigh of pity,
I love her and I say, you know,

624
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,630
the way she's going to two, three, Dante,

625
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,920
like a child that is formed as a result,

626
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:38,150
a bent her eyes on me with a
look of a mother cat. Look,

627
00:43:38,151 --> 00:43:40,940
her mother casts on her delirious child,

628
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,610
delirious in the theological sense.

629
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:47,900
I don't think that he's really actually
crazy delirious or the word English word.

630
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:52,901
We use delirium since me as simply
means getting off the furrow.

631
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,970
Leerom in Latin means the
furrow. Wherever you go off, uh,

632
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,630
the rat as it were or some or
the further you are tracing,

633
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,490
then you are delirious.

634
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:09,491
You are going off on your own in
some kind of a silly a direction.

635
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,760
And she began. That's the, the
first picture of the universe.

636
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,990
And we are going to find that this picture
is going to be refined in a number of

637
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:21,020
ways, but this is what
he can understand. Now.

638
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,320
All things whatsoever have
order among themselves.

639
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,190
That's the premise in Dante's costs
and they will just add for you.

640
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,000
And he continues.
She continues.

641
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,240
And this is the form that makes
the universe resemble God.

642
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,050
This is so, so that the universe
has enlightened us to the divinity,

643
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:45,210
to things to be said immediately.

644
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:50,570
The word order in case you don't know
it's or though that our deo means beauty,

645
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,380
it's idea that it's,

646
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:02,580
it's the symmetrical arrangement
of proportionate light,

647
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:08,760
full of light and clarity. Uh, um, uh,

648
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,530
structure of all of the whole order.
This,

649
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,040
even the word Pharma,

650
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:17,910
one of it means form means that
there is a shape to things,

651
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:23,120
but it translates the Latin
[inaudible] another synonym for beauty.

652
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,270
The picture of the universe that Dante,

653
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,100
that Beatrice evokes for
Dante is one of beauty. Um,

654
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,090
uh,

655
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:38,090
which in turn implies a vision because
beauties and they find that that was she

656
00:45:39,941 --> 00:45:42,120
seen,
gives me pleasure.

657
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,710
This is the famous definition
of Aquinas that which has seen,

658
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:50,940
gives pressure. That's beauty. It's a
sort of subjective idea of beauty here.

659
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:54,720
Of course Beatrice thinks of an
objective order of the world. It's not,

660
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,680
it's not the fact that I like it. Only
though Aquinas also gives that, that,

661
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,030
that, that, that, uh,

662
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,370
explanation of beauty
that which scene pleases,

663
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:09,810
that implies a self, uh, it tastes
a personal taste and made the very,

664
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,800
very rich, medieval understanding
of the aesthetic experience.

665
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,980
But there is also an objective idea of
the whole universe laid out in older

666
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,970
shape clarity.
These are the proposed number,

667
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,730
proportion clarity.
These are the attributes of a,

668
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,220
of beauty. And this, this
cosmological do that. And just to,

669
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,520
with this line that the universe is,

670
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:40,790
resembles card seems to be such a nice
way of thinking about the universe.

671
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:46,580
But if you really think about it, it's
really a heretical proposition. You know,

672
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,450
the universe, it's like God, what about
the evil that there is in the universe?

673
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,220
Is the idea that there is a continuity
between God's transcendence and God's

674
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:58,320
eminence that says,
Hey,

675
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,900
I know that he's a little bit like
Marcis and he just doesn't like it.

676
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,950
He just likes to be a
little better than Paul.

677
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,900
There are at least he's going to talk,

678
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,370
but now this is really strange statement
and therefore has to be clarified.

679
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:15,810
And I think, uh, uh, she will,

680
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,840
I talk like this because I have to
explain that I just was looking at an old,

681
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:26,250
a great text of 'em in view
of my class today, last night.

682
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:30,240
It was really a great text by a Lovejoy.

683
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:35,280
So some of you may know him. It was a
great, one of the truly great inventor,

684
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,130
one can speak to this.

685
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,580
The whole idea of the history of ideas in,
in,

686
00:47:41,581 --> 00:47:45,880
in the United States used to be a great
professor in the forties 50s and early

687
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:48,550
success at Johns Hopkins.
And he wrote a great book,

688
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,510
which I still advise people to
read the great chain of being.

689
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:56,210
Cause that's really the idea, you know,
the great chain of being. It's this,

690
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,040
that God is this great chain of being.
It's this a virtual,

691
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:05,260
a metaphor of the continuity between
the world of unity and the world of

692
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,210
multiplicity. And parality said, you know,

693
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,270
and it implies that we are on the,
uh,

694
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,820
that the whole universe
is this arrangement,

695
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:17,380
a chain and invisible chain.

696
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:22,210
It's an idea that reappears in the
18th century English literature. Pope,

697
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:26,950
for instance, he uses his, that I
read this in, in Lovejoy, uh, the,

698
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,620
uh,
but it also implies it's,

699
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,860
it's a strange idea as it
implies that the value of things,

700
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:38,490
the values of every entity depends on
the position one occupies in the various

701
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:43,210
rings of the chain so
that if you are an angel,

702
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,770
then you're really above,
uh,

703
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:50,830
above human beings were made
all bolt where beastly and
angelic at the same time.

704
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:54,640
We have this kind of paradoxical
quality of being spiritual,

705
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:59,410
an animal at the same time.
And then we are according to the idea,

706
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,180
don't,
some of you may doubt it.

707
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:06,190
We are better than dogs and dogs are
better than stones and so on is in a kind

708
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:09,910
of hierarchy, a system of degrees. And,

709
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:12,160
and he loved Joel goes on saying,
well,

710
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:15,220
this is really the moment when Dante has,

711
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,960
is adopting the idea of the great chain
of being and this great chain of being

712
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,470
makes him a really unorthodox.

713
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,610
I want to tell you that that's not true
because I think we should read more

714
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:28,720
carefully this passage.

715
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,730
This is the beginning here and
others about this resemblance. Uh,

716
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:37,120
the universal resemble God. Here
Beatrice continues to the high creatures.

717
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,360
See the impress of the
terminal excellence,

718
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:47,670
which is the end of which that system
itself is made in the older I speak of all

719
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,380
natures have their bands.

720
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,940
We all have our own specific gravity.

721
00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:00,220
We're all drone. We have
done by our desires. We go,

722
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,900
we're, we're at desire,
uh, takes us desires.

723
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,580
And so there's a kind of natural instinct,

724
00:50:07,581 --> 00:50:10,750
the natural movement in
this way in which a stone,

725
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:15,640
if you drop it for or risk to the
ground naturally because of its specific

726
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:19,420
gravity and the fire,
if you light a candle,

727
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,540
the fire will always go up.
Instinctively,

728
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:26,290
all things move according to their weight,

729
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,890
according the specific weight.
It's a spiritual gravity. Now,

730
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:35,130
are we like that? Is that really what
Dante is saying? That it seems easy?

731
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,360
He seems so that's where he seems to be
saying according to the different laws

732
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,540
and near to the source
and farther from it.

733
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,960
They move there for two different poles
over the great sea of being each with an

734
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:50,780
instant given to it,
to Barry wrong.

735
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:55,850
This bear fire up towards the moon.

736
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,840
Uh, this is by the way,
this is really the passage,

737
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,260
his lantus rewriting a passage
from Augustine's confessions.

738
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,530
This is the motive force
in more to creatures.

739
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:11,770
This binds the earth together and makes
it one and not only the creature that

740
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,060
with our intelligence as this bow shoot,

741
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,750
but also have intellect
and love meeting us.

742
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,820
We have intellect and love.
You know the,

743
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:24,821
remember the famous great poem from
about women who have intellect and law.

744
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,520
Now we all have, yeah, she
says, she says Internet,

745
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,470
the providence that regulates all this
mixed forever quiet with its light,

746
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,910
the heaven within which turns out of
the greatest speed on top of the Primo

747
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,700
Morbidity and didn't now as to a place,

748
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:45,530
a point of the power of the bow string is
bearing us which aims at a joyous mark.

749
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,760
It is true.

750
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:51,230
And now that's the correction
to Lovejoy's interpretation.

751
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,250
It is true that as a shape of and does
not accord with the arts intention

752
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,980
because the material is
definitely responsive.

753
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,280
So sometimes the creature having the
powders impelled to turn aside another way

754
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:07,880
deviates from his course and there's
fire maybe seem to fall from a cloud

755
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:12,080
lightened inc for instance,
like does not go always up tight,

756
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,300
can call also down.
Um,

757
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,890
and this farmer is far from my couch.

758
00:52:19,891 --> 00:52:23,370
So the primary impulse
diverted by false pressure,

759
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,790
it turn to the earth.
In other words,

760
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
within this description of the order of
the cosmos be as it goes on to say that

761
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,850
human beings are the odd,

762
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:41,930
the old figures that we
somehow have the power to.

763
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,970
Did you deviate from this pattern
of order that we can undo?

764
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:55,190
We have this paradoxical freedom that
makes us are the stay within a particular

765
00:52:56,551 --> 00:53:01,551
idea of what God may have meant
or really for us or really,

766
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,520
uh, uh, uh,

767
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:10,580
breach that particular or the human
beings are the certain elements in this

768
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,080
older portrait of the universe.

769
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,960
And that is the whole
statement of freedom.

770
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:21,780
So the Dante's removing
from a deterministic,

771
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:26,781
that w w that's what it would make it
into a heretical texts at idea of what are

772
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,310
the cosmo Moses. Then she turned her
face again to the sky. Let me go.

773
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:37,470
I was a little bit, uh,
quickly on or can to, to,

774
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,800
um, and so, uh, but I
will need a few minutes.

775
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,640
Came to to Dante now is in
the sphere of the moon. Um,

776
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,760
you know that and there'd
be a discussion on the spot.

777
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:51,090
This is whole medieval legend.
Uh,

778
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,200
if you look at the moon and full moon,

779
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:58,201
you see the dark spots and the legend was
that cane and the medieval legend that

780
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:04,740
cane, uh, running away from, uh, the,

781
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:09,450
the, the knowledge of the murder of
her, of his brother had actually,

782
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:14,430
uh, with the help of God that had removed
him from the earth and had taken refuge

783
00:54:14,431 --> 00:54:18,750
there. And wherever we see there
is just the imprint of Cain.

784
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:23,820
Dante dismisses this legend. What
goes on talking about science. She,

785
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:28,110
Beatrice will have a scientific discourse.
And the question is,

786
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,920
is this unnatural cosmos or not?
Do we,

787
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:37,190
do we see shades on the moon simply
because they said density or,

788
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:41,270
uh, not orality, uh, of matter?

789
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:46,730
Or is it because it therefore light has
a way of going through this Ma matter of

790
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:48,090
the moon,
uh,

791
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,100
according to the principle or more
or less the radically and density?

792
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:55,080
Or is it because there's a different
way in which light is distributed?

793
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:59,070
The Solution Dante gives or Beatrice
will give? It's the second one.

794
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:03,420
We should the shadows on the moon simply
because I said different source of

795
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:04,500
light.
In other words,

796
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:09,501
the natural cosmos has to be
understood in terms of its metaphysics.

797
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:15,030
The physics has only can only be
understood in terms of metaphysics.

798
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,040
But what I want to stress to you is that
the natural and the supernatural are

799
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:24,600
always seen by Dante as
holding hands together.

800
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:29,780
There are not two separate worlds.
They're not two separate. Uh, uh,

801
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:30,540
they,

802
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,980
they mentioned that two different
ways of looking at the same,

803
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,480
at the same thing. But let's see
how he introduces the Cantor,

804
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:43,481
which I think is important for a number
of reasons came to true or you who in a

805
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:49,410
little bark.
The language of humility,

806
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,580
uh,

807
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:55,580
is suspects at this point because
we know that the sublime is,

808
00:55:55,891 --> 00:56:00,440
uh, is the mode is the trope that
he will use or you in a little bark.

809
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,660
You, he's addressing us
is beginning a dressing.

810
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:07,780
Readers eager to listen,
um,

811
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,020
have followed behind my ship.

812
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,260
The singing makes her way turned
back to see your shores again.

813
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,280
Do not put fault on the
deep for perhaps losing me.

814
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:25,050
You would be left bewildered.
That waters I take what?

815
00:56:25,051 --> 00:56:28,050
I never sailed before. Oh, that's uh,

816
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,930
it gives poignancy to the little bark.
It's a little bark and he was,

817
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,620
I'm doing such, I mighty. I'm
engaged. Such a magnificent,

818
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:38,500
extraordinary adventure.
Right?

819
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:43,540
The one is the take we're never seal
before. Minerva breeds are polar pilots.

820
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:48,541
Me and the nine busers show me the
bears and then a restriction of the,

821
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,410
the children's that he has been
addressing. You are the few, uh,

822
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:59,110
kind of reductive apostrophe.
The very few here. The,

823
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,140
it's the lucky,
I'm the lucky [inaudible] he would say,

824
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:07,141
have you guys a very few really know and
are interested in the mysteries in the,

825
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,300
in the most esoteric,
uh,

826
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:13,750
hurricane sciences that he's
going to put out here. Uh,

827
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:18,100
you are the few that
reached out early that

828
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,860
the language actually says turn your neck.
Uh,

829
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:27,310
this is really poor translation.
I don't know what other,

830
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,820
um, since later say, uh,

831
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,800
you are the few who turn your
neck because it's the whole idea.

832
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:40,600
Uh, another form of presumption.
You, you may have heard,

833
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:44,620
you may recall in the Bible,
but the stiff neck, right?

834
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,270
The definitely the,

835
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:51,160
of course the neck is always the emblem
of conversion when you want to, when you,

836
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,330
for Plato, you reach a conversion.
You really turn the neck.

837
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:00,010
That's how you do toward a, not for
Dante that he turned upside down, but in,

838
00:58:00,011 --> 00:58:03,530
in play to you turn the neck and you
know where the source of light is.

839
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:07,890
The Biblical counter to that is the,
maybe the,

840
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:10,530
the stiff neck,
those who do not,

841
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:14,440
who lack humility right
behind this metaphor.

842
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:17,650
That is the whole idea that
what makes a human being,

843
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:23,520
what confers dignity to a human being
is the power that we among all animals

844
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:29,911
have to look up at the sky and see and
look at the stars and therefore wonder

845
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:35,980
all other animals are always looking
down, right? We are alone. Of course,

846
00:58:35,981 --> 00:58:40,030
there are other people who believe that
what makes human beings give particular

847
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:42,010
dignity to human beings is something else.

848
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,150
The of all of them as those who
said that we speak of course,

849
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,410
but they have all of them.

850
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:51,050
The one I really like is that
we are capable of laughing. Uh,

851
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:55,100
that's the exploration. It's
an Aristotelian idea, but
it's exploration of, uh, of,

852
00:58:55,110 --> 00:59:00,010
of, of comedy. Uh, to hear.
It's that that's the illusion
though. You have who feel,

853
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:05,070
who could be also implying like me
that do not be too arrogant about this.

854
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,930
Who reached out early for angels,
bread,

855
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:14,590
knowledge for knowledge by which
men here live but never come from.

856
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:15,580
It's satisfied.

857
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,760
You may indeed put forth your vessel on
the salt that holding my furrow before

858
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:23,210
the water returns smooth.
Again,

859
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,520
those glorious ones who crossed the
sea to call Chris. We're not amazed.

860
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,720
Once again, the language of
admiration, that language is sublime.

861
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:37,721
Or can I come to this in a moment as you
shall be when the they sold Jason Turn.

862
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,970
Plowman okay. Um, well,

863
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:46,010
the metaphor of the journey by water
to describe now an real journey.

864
00:59:46,370 --> 00:59:51,370
So an anti Dante is clearly thinking of
that metaphoric compression that we saw

865
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:56,810
in Ulysses. Remember the sailing
that became a mad flight.

866
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:01,800
Now here, if the flights that
becomes a ceiling, um, and,

867
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:06,220
and the notion that he's guiding us,
so the sense of his responsibility,

868
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:08,870
he's turning his back,
unlike Ulysses. Okay?

869
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,830
We dispose of that mythic
resonance, uh, very quickly.

870
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:17,560
But what he's really saying is
that the journey we're undertaking,

871
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:22,250
which is the reading of this book,
can become extraordinarily dangerous.

872
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:22,940
And why?

873
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:27,590
The reason why it becomes dangerous is
because he's traveling over water that

874
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:31,670
leaves no wake behind it.

875
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,110
This is the, the, the,

876
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:39,260
the what I would call the danger
of the seafaring in seafaring.

877
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:45,830
You have no preestablished roots.
There is nothing. There's no way,

878
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:49,520
no road, no path that can be
they're fixed then you can find.

879
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:53,690
So he's inviting us to
keep very close to him,

880
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,330
but we might be losing
him at the same time.

881
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,720
The journey by water is not exactly like
the journey by land because there are

882
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:07,331
no pre established
directions marked are for us.

883
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,120
And then finally this allusion to Jesus.

884
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:14,660
So he's not like a uterus.
This is like, like the,

885
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:19,010
the hero of the organoids who
has gone looking for the Golden,

886
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:22,430
the golden flees. And He, uh,

887
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:27,460
it's an image that he appears at the end
of Paradiso 33 where Dante has the god

888
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:32,950
Neptune from the depth wondering at
the extraordinary power of the human

889
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:38,240
imagination and the human will that
wonder at the heroics of Jason,

890
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:43,400
uh, telepathy owners without, uh,
he can't quite believe what he,

891
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:48,350
when he sees it's clearly an illusion
to a Dante himself is going to do in,

892
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:53,300
in, in, uh, seeing God face to face. And
then, uh, and then returning to the earth.

893
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,480
But what I want to emphasize
in the here really I will stop.

894
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:59,400
They'll give you a chance to
ask me some questions. The

895
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,820
is that we probably never read.
Uh,

896
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:09,640
I think we skipped Canto,
um, 18 of him. Fair?

897
01:02:09,641 --> 01:02:11,390
No,
I think we did.

898
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:15,350
I don't think that I asked you to read
it and I don't presume that you would go

899
01:02:15,351 --> 01:02:19,410
and read what I don't ask you to
read. So you, you never really did.

900
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:22,220
But in Cantwell 18, Dante, you there,

901
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,510
if you go and read Canto of inferno,

902
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:29,750
you will find Jason punished among the
flatters and the juicer because he's the

903
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:36,300
famous for seducing hips pile
and abandoning her. Okay.

904
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:39,320
It's a version of what happened.
Fees. You said media. It's,

905
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,980
it's one of the great fixation
Salva of Greek. Chuck,

906
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:46,620
one of the great situations of repeat
the situations of a Greek tragedy.

907
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,720
But the interesting thing is that
bumper now is distinguishing between the

908
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:54,750
ethical judgment of
Jason who is behind in,

909
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:59,751
in February team and the imaginative
aesthetic value of the adventure itself.

910
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:03,143
No.

911
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:07,530
Is he saying that if for that the good
and the Butte and the beautiful I really

912
01:03:07,531 --> 01:03:11,010
two distinct things,
he's warning us about that.

913
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,160
And that's what I want to
pick up the conversation, uh,

914
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:19,250
next time where we are going to be
talking about the value of images and uh,

915
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,390
the ethics of images.

916
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,490
But let me finish here now and see if
there are some questions which I will try

917
01:03:26,491 --> 01:03:27,720
to answer.

918
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:45,913
Please.

919
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:50,990
Turning your minds to the bread of angels.

920
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:56,060
And then he talks about the image of water
and all of those symbols that come in.

921
01:03:56,390 --> 01:04:01,120
But it seems a little strange to me that
you're talking about translation did

922
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:05,630
that you're turning your mind to bread.
It's very strange.

923
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:09,530
I was just wondering if you could talk
about that symbolism or significance of

924
01:04:09,531 --> 01:04:10,670
that is turn your mind.

925
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:16,820
The, the question is about
explaining, uh, the image of bread,

926
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:21,900
uh, in the beginning of
Canto two of paradise, uh,

927
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:27,290
where Dante says dressing the
readers that they are turning their,

928
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:30,650
uh, their, their neck, uh,

929
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,810
too early to the bread of angels.
Uh,

930
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,720
I have a question for you. What
we'll do. You find that strange?

931
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,030
Well, I have nine that instead
of turning your neck, but just,

932
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:46,120
okay. Oh, right. Okay. The, well,

933
01:04:46,121 --> 01:04:47,470
the bread of angels.

934
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:52,590
So I would see the bread of angels and
the breadth of angels is his knowledge.

935
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:57,970
So I think that the implied,
uh, the, the, the, the,

936
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:03,040
the transference, the metaphorical
reading by Mandelbaum is accurate. Uh,

937
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:08,040
I wish it were a more
literal, um, but just justice.

938
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:12,250
I think that my own translation,
of course, saint clay are also,

939
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:17,170
it's one of the few times that he, he, he,
he, he, he deviates from the, the literal,

940
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,570
because the literal burden of the, of the
metaphor, uh, has a number of residences,

941
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:27,110
which I think are valuable. Like
exactly the stiff neck, the, the,

942
01:05:27,111 --> 01:05:31,300
the turning of the neck,
uh, in, in the context,

943
01:05:31,301 --> 01:05:35,950
in a context like paradise where
Dante starts out by clearly,

944
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,820
uh,
locating himself within some,

945
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:41,980
some contradictory possibilities,

946
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:46,480
the possibility of a transgression
or the possibility of, uh, uh,

947
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:50,380
trespassing in the case of, uh, of Paul.

948
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,360
So what exactly is he so
that that image is his,

949
01:05:55,361 --> 01:05:59,440
his by the image of the, of the,
the turning of the neck, uh,

950
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:04,470
early for the bread of the angels is also
a reverberates with anxieties that he

951
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:08,640
has about his own adventure and a,

952
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:11,530
and his own enterprise.
That's,

953
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:15,290
I don't know if this answers
your perplexity but yes.

954
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:16,183
So the random angels

955
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,900
knowledge, uh, of angels is no
knowledge. Yeah. That, which,

956
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:22,331
you know,

957
01:06:22,331 --> 01:06:27,331
the I the idea that you find
in the banquet that why,

958
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,220
why do philosophers,

959
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,630
what I'm sure that it's literally true
that there is nothing better for a great

960
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:35,460
philosophical conversation then,
you know,

961
01:06:35,461 --> 01:06:39,840
a glass of wine and you sit it out and
then you'll, you and, and, and your talk.

962
01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:44,550
But it clearly is, uh, uh, is
the food for, of knowledge,

963
01:06:44,551 --> 01:06:49,110
the food of the mind, the food of
knowledge, uh, the taste of knowledge,

964
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,760
et Cetera,
all those metaphors.

965
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,343
The bread of life.

966
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:58,370
Yes. Since that's very good. That's
very good. Because I think, uh,

967
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:00,310
cannot be also grace.
Yes. That's what it was.

968
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:04,110
Because we are healing the world of
paradise. And I know that I'm really, I'm,

969
01:07:04,111 --> 01:07:08,200
I'm giving a Chi sort of philosophical,
our emphasis,

970
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:11,250
but there is also the,
with Paul that is also the fuel.

971
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:14,460
So we were dealing with a poetic,
more than the philosophic,

972
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,370
the poetic and the theological together.
Absolutely. Very good. Thank you.

973
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,950
Um,
other questions

974
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,910
please. Um, beginning of Canto Lynn,

975
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:31,410
when he describes how God shed some
more or less pure men light on different

976
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:36,970
parts, um, the phrase pure of men,
it was also used in purgatory, um,

977
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,250
to describe different
aesthetic perspectives.

978
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,750
Is Dante trying to bring that in here or
is he just talking about the hierarchy

979
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:47,650
of
who God chooses to shed light on?

980
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,000
Well, good, good. Uh,

981
01:07:50,001 --> 01:07:54,670
the question is in a line
three of Paradiso, one,

982
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:55,880
uh,

983
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,880
Dante uses the phrase more and less
talking about the light that shines on a

984
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:06,120
creation according to a principal
of more or less. And then the,

985
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:11,150
the concern is with Dante uses this phrase
quite often in Canto 10 of purgatory,

986
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:16,970
where in the world context of art, uh,
that is that phrase about approach.

987
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,700
I call it the approximation. Uh, uh,

988
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:25,520
so it's, it's, it's, it's done to
joining the tool. Does he want us to,

989
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:26,420
uh,
to,

990
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:31,350
to put the two things together
and let me answer that far,

991
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:35,870
be it from me ever to say no.
Dante does not want us to do that.

992
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,810
The whole reading,
I mean,

993
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:43,040
if there's a principle to the way
I read is that they're more echos.

994
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:47,570
You can find the better it, the
better. I think that we serve,

995
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:50,450
whether we understand the appointment,
we reserve what we,

996
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,470
I take it to be the intention of the poet.
Uh,

997
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:58,160
but I had never really conjoined the tool
in my own mind for one simple reason,

998
01:08:58,161 --> 01:08:59,060
because here I think it's,

999
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:03,200
it's Dante's asserting the
principle of hierarchy.

1000
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:07,280
I think that improved factorial dentists
doing something completely different.

1001
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,430
Uh, since it's the
context, there is pride.

1002
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:15,380
He's really reversing or
forms of, uh, of, of, uh,

1003
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,190
what is the measure the human beings,
how do we measure human beings?

1004
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:23,870
I could say that this is
actually a problem that goes
here every time you have a

1005
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:26,050
higher, okay. You know, um,

1006
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,980
really placing myself in between
a Noda, a rank, uh, of, of,

1007
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:36,040
of different values. And so I can say
that that is also happening in, in,

1008
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:39,380
in, in a, in Canto one. But frankly,

1009
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:44,030
the context will not allow me
to go far to much beyond this.

1010
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:48,170
So yeah, there is a way in which every
time I talk off of hierarchy, I'm talk,

1011
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,710
I'm talking about a rank ordering and,

1012
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,270
and therefore the sense of my place.

1013
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:57,700
It's a little bit removed
from the concerns here, uh,

1014
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:00,620
of uh, uh, it's there, it's there,

1015
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:05,420
but not the most compelling
argument for me. Uh, you may,

1016
01:10:05,421 --> 01:10:09,530
you may prove me wrong of course,
but, uh, I would say this issue,

1017
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:14,330
uh, appears there. You know,
we can we join things together.

1018
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:19,570
Let's try to keep also each entity in
its home specificity so that we really

1019
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:21,710
understand that the,
the,

1020
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,920
how far he's thinking can go with a
representation of a scene than another.

1021
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:32,630
But I like that. Good. I like the
fact that you true joy, you combine,

1022
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,273
yes,

1023
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:47,820
we're speeding.
Why people

1024
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:52,343
paradise,

1025
01:10:56,350 --> 01:11:01,250
how one would need to know
about philosophy and theology.

1026
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:03,060
And politics in border.

1027
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,360
That's the question is

1028
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:16,200
who on earth could Dantes audience B?
We know

1029
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,770
who the audience of
Houma Virgil, uh, can be.

1030
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:25,530
Uh, [inaudible] is, uh,

1031
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:30,050
w w what about the audience for,
until someone who has to know philosophy,

1032
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,540
theology, uh, and so on. Uh,

1033
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,100
and my answer is, you're right, we
do know roughly about Houma, uh,

1034
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,620
because after all the,

1035
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:44,970
there is always the modal
course in the all this see who,

1036
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:46,103
uh,

1037
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:51,110
is singing to the audience at court till
your list disappears and their episodes

1038
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:56,360
and Houma, uh, is, is the,
uh, one of the reps holds.

1039
01:11:56,361 --> 01:11:58,380
I may be the one who stitches together.

1040
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:02,460
The voices are episodes that
gives us immediate, your, uh,

1041
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:05,930
account of an audience. Um, um,

1042
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:10,800
with Dante is a little bit more
difficult to understand. It's,

1043
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,200
I think con,

1044
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:17,130
I can tell you in our contemporary
reports think that Dante is a poem,

1045
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:20,130
especially in federal,
ought to be read in the streets.

1046
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,730
Like really [inaudible]
going on the ancient Greece.

1047
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:28,860
They would go from one fair or market
place and the day with the market to

1048
01:12:28,861 --> 01:12:33,540
another and gather people together.
They feast days of the community. Um,

1049
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,980
but I can be a little bit more
romantic that I think it's true.

1050
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,210
Uh,

1051
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:44,480
but that Dante probably did read some of
his cantos when he was in Ravenna and a

1052
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:48,860
over owner to the,

1053
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:53,460
the in the evening gathering the
circles of, uh, of courtiers.

1054
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,820
Uh, but, but I don't think
of Dante's a coacher. I mean,

1055
01:12:56,821 --> 01:12:59,820
it doesn't seem to have the values.

1056
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:03,090
Pairs are the Socratic values of the mind,
of course,

1057
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:07,830
but he doesn't seem to share the
social problems of the court.

1058
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,670
I can think of, uh, some aspects
of Shakespeare being, Eh,

1059
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:14,640
Eh,
the poet of the court,

1060
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:18,150
the poet who would be read
by the Queen and he wants,

1061
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:23,070
he wants the queen to read his,
his texts or the theater.

1062
01:13:23,130 --> 01:13:26,180
We know about the theater. Uh, uh,

1063
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,180
a part of Paradiso was not known at all.
Some people,

1064
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:35,790
the first time cantors were sent to the
patron who would probably give him a

1065
01:13:35,931 --> 01:13:39,100
check. But today we'll call it grant.
You know, you apply for a grant.

1066
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:42,510
They'll give him a, uh, a
gift for, for the great,

1067
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:47,460
extraordinary dedication. That's what
patrons would, the role they would play.

1068
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,600
But I think that Dante,

1069
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:56,910
and this is going to be a very
romantics, are Benjamin now, uh,

1070
01:13:56,911 --> 01:14:00,240
I think that Dante writes this kind
of poetry at the end to for God.

1071
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:05,370
I don't think that he could
care. Uh, uh, I only has a,

1072
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,080
an empirical audience in mind.
He really means that the few,

1073
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,300
I don't think it's a
total strategy at the end.

1074
01:14:13,301 --> 01:14:17,230
You feel we're going to read that and,
and uh,

1075
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,970
it's too much written.

1076
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,830
It's written too much in
the mode of a quest for God.

1077
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,440
You know, the, the prayer actually,

1078
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:31,110
it's a more a moment at one point where
language bends into a prayer and they're

1079
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:35,050
hit with the language of a longing
that, that, that goes with prayer.

1080
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:37,060
That I really think it's meant for God.

1081
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:39,700
I mean it in a very serious
way and ends with a prayer.

1082
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:45,130
The Great Kanto 33 is what
an extraordinary prayer. Um,

1083
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:48,520
so that's my answer. Uh,
I'm sure that the, you know,

1084
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:51,250
I have a dear friend,
uh,

1085
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:55,690
who wants to make a movie about
reading Dante in the streets.

1086
01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:00,670
And that's fine, but
I'm not sure, uh, that,

1087
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:04,900
that's what Dante thought. I mean, I
read them. I'm not sure about that. Um,

1088
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,900
great question. Thank
you. So you're excited.
