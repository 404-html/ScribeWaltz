1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,250
Last time we looked at the,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,180
at the Canto of Canto 15,

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,720
or in fair nor the Canto of Brunette told
the teacher of Dante's teacher and the

4
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:19,860
teacher or the Florentines. And we, um,

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,370
and we pointed out the,
the,

6
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:28,371
the rhetoric of the cancer after
all Burrito is a master restoration.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,390
Uh,
so it was quite appropriate.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,930
The dantes account of his meeting with
his teacher will be carried out through a

9
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,530
careful, very careful, uh,

10
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,540
highlighting of the
ambiguities of language.

11
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,960
The way language is used very carefully
to mean one thing for one order

12
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:00,270
experience grenade,
toes for instance,

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,960
anthropocentric political
understanding of the world.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,380
And then, uh, Dante, his own
understanding of the world,

15
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,420
which we could call theological,
but it really means, uh,

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,990
the point of view of
someone who is cresting,

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,020
who is moving and who will
move beyond a Brunette.

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:25,030
And how a language oscillates the same
words seem to acquire different meanings

19
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,200
in those different contexts.
And in many ways that language,

20
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:34,020
it would become the
language that rhetoric,

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,320
which should be the instrumental
persuasion and agreement becomes in and of

22
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:45,471
itself the cause of two of
misunderstandings between them.

23
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,230
Between master and uh, and disciple. Uh,

24
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,950
but, uh, the, the candle
Burrito for all of its, uh,

25
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,290
the intensity and poignancy over personal,
uh,

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,620
confrontation of, of a, of a
disciple who meets his teacher.

27
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,570
And the many ways shows even there there's
a sort of great deal of ambivalence,

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,960
a great deal of acknowledgement
or recognition of the
importance of Brunette was

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,210
teaching on him. But at the same time, uh,

30
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:25,410
assault of distance taking
leave, taking from a, uh,

31
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:29,730
that teaching that too though
for its private took quality.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,920
The quality of the great humanistic
values of, uh, are acknowledging,

33
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,000
uh,
uh,

34
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,740
the teaching that shows the way
to how main makes himself eternal.

35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,510
That is says anthropocentric.
It can be that kind of, uh,

36
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,630
of, of, of, uh, aphorism in a way,
which is, which is the way Dante,

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,190
uh,
seals the personality of Rachel.

38
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:57,720
And yet it always had or
actually has as always this,

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,291
this,

40
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:03,160
this exploding personal encounters
doing Dante a political focus.

41
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,540
It was something a little bit
larger than their own private story.

42
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,570
It is the encounter between them was
placed within the crisis of Florence,

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,450
uh, the CTO, Florence, the divisions
between wells and get bylines.

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,360
And then there's also the
announcements, uh, to Brunette to,

45
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,370
to Dante Bible rate to that he is
going to go into his going to end up,

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,090
uh, in, in, in exile that the comfort, uh,

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,840
the human bonds, the comfort of
the city and family and whatnot,

48
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,930
even that will be denied to
him, uh, for Burrito. Of course,

49
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,350
there is also strategy of, uh, uh,

50
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,900
thinking that Dante's own experience is,

51
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:50,020
it's really the mirror image of his own.
Because as you remember,

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,050
and I said this at the beginning
of my remarks last time,

53
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,850
Brunetto all's experiences,
Eh,

54
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,290
exile as he was in, Ron
says, Val, uh, the, the,

55
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:06,291
the classical place of the most
traumatic experience in medieval history.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,801
The,
the,

57
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:12,801
the place where the Paladin roll
on a Orlando in Italia Roma,

58
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,790
uh, and, and the Carolingian drama,

59
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:20,620
the Charlemagne soldiers are the
fitted and Brunetto. That's where he,

60
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,760
he, that's how he views
his own defeat in the, uh,

61
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,890
in the city of Florence.

62
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,400
So there was always a public focus and
the public focus was not just a context

63
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,140
for their relationship, but they, it,

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,750
it was really a way of shedding light on
the very nature of their own divisions.

65
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,110
Uh, it is as if, uh,

66
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,140
the oscillations of language that they
experience in the exchange between them

67
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,690
are really consequences. Also
have larger divisions, uh,

68
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,860
larger suspicions that this,
uh,

69
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,490
characters living in Florence
entertain told each other.

70
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,770
I mentioned that because I'm
going to move today to Canton 19.

71
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,260
We've taken quite a jump.
We went through 16,

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,840
we saw the flight on the back of
Jerry and some, some, some, uh,

73
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,340
adumbration got fried on the
back of [inaudible], uh, uh,

74
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,950
can to 17.
If you were to read it on your own.

75
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,560
It's an extraordinary cantor.

76
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:23,410
It's the only time that
virtual leaves Dante alone.

77
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,170
And Donna has to, uh,
uh, mean there the, the,

78
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:31,610
the usual hours. And he
had, and it is as if, uh,

79
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,660
he had to be left without any guidance.

80
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,900
It is if he hit to discover bite himself
and by his own powers or what those

81
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:45,160
temptations are and what the implications
of usually it would be for him. And,

82
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,440
and there may be a biographical
biographical resonance
there in the sense that,

83
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,120
uh,

84
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,120
a neuron with a poet as edging toward the,

85
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,860
the,

86
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,860
the condition of the user are engaged
in the illusory recreation's illusory

87
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:06,830
productions, but also at
biographical, a reference to,

88
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,900
to Dante's own father who
was engaged in that sort of,

89
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,400
um, of activity. And then
we go through a Kantar 19,

90
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,340
which is really the cancer
I want to talk about now.

91
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,580
And that's the point of my remarks
about medical situations of what I said

92
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:29,690
about, about Brunetto.
I'll takes a public voice,

93
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,370
not only takes it so you have a,
uh,

94
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,040
an experience of the
shifts in his own voice.

95
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:41,900
So you do know the kind of romance
atmosphere in the encounter with,

96
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,820
uh, uh, with, with Francesca,
uh, you do have the kind of,

97
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:47,240
uh,

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,240
the seminar like tones that he uses in
the encounter in limbo with the poets of

99
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:56,120
antiquity, where he, they
go on talking about art.

100
00:06:56,121 --> 00:07:00,690
And the secrets of the craft,
et Cetera. Now Dante takes what?

101
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,970
A headset.

102
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,520
I do not hesitate to call a
prophetic voice if pub he plays.

103
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,380
Now he sees himself as a public
role. They shift all the, the,

104
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,900
the change that departure from,
uh,

105
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,070
the political rhetorical
tone, uh, used and they,

106
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,620
and they encounter with, uh, with
Kurento could not be more vocal north,

107
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,600
be sharper, more radical. This
is, uh, uh, this is, uh, uh,

108
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:31,601
an argument now that engages him as a
public figure as it were indeed as a

109
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:37,610
profit. So what does it mean to be
a prophet for Dante? What kind of,

110
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:41,300
how can one take on this sort of, uh, of,

111
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,970
of voice?
How does one go on?

112
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,630
How does it profit?
A talk like a one thing that you make,

113
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:53,960
you want to keep in mind is I go
on to understand this candle is a,

114
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,100
if clearly the pattern for all of this,

115
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:02,360
the model to be the
prophetic voice in the Bible,

116
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,860
the biblical prophets,

117
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,310
and do not make a mistake of thinking
for a moment that profits are those who

118
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,570
are foretell the future. That's
not really their role. In fact,

119
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:17,150
Dante goes out of the way,
and I'm not going to talk about that,

120
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,600
but really they haven't
got time and can to 20, uh,

121
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:25,370
highlighting the differences were
between prophets and diviners,

122
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,480
the diviners or those who
for tail predict the future.

123
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,740
So if the profits do not foretell
the future, what do they do?

124
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,160
They are literally readers of the present.

125
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,590
This is the point for Dante.

126
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:44,591
The Biblical prophets are those who read
the present history in its unfolding

127
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,620
from the perspective of what they perceive
to have been God's promise to Israel

128
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,410
and to them.
So the profits are in a way and that not,

129
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,340
I don't say this in any way to,
to uh,

130
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,280
to degrade them, but I,
on the, on the contrary,

131
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:06,540
to highlight the importance
of the intervention into
the presence that you could

132
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:10,740
call them as commentators. Those who
are in the true sense of the word,

133
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,790
those who remember, that's what a
commentator is a commentator is,

134
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,530
it's an exercise of memory,

135
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,580
a way of bringing ancient
memories to bear on the present.

136
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,750
That's the way Dante understands
the prophetic prophetic voice.

137
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,320
And Nether little detail
before we go on with the Canto.

138
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,420
You do not know.

139
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:34,320
Some of you may know that that
actually is a writer of many epistles.

140
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,910
He was a letter writer.

141
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,960
We do not know the letters he
wrote on behalf of his patrons,

142
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,350
but we do know the letters
that he wrote in his own name.

143
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,390
And he would be a writing letters
that the array of which is, uh,

144
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,400
can be sometimes moving. Uh, for
instance, when he writes to a friend, uh,

145
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:57,360
he would like to attend the funeral
of his friend's wife and cannot,

146
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,810
he said practically begging because he
doesn't have the adequate clothes to go

147
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,800
to the funeral,
introduce him.

148
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:08,760
So he's clearly begging for
some kind of assistance.

149
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,720
But he writes also letters that
probably never reached the destination.

150
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,750
He wrote letters, for instance, to
the Italian cardinals who were, uh,

151
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,370
in conclave. You, you understand what I'm
saying? What I mean when I say conclave,

152
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:20,941
the conclave,

153
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:25,590
it means that they are shut on the key
and kept in some place where they can

154
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,770
make decisions about electing from within
themselves or from the outside a pope.

155
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,310
And they could not agree about whom
to choose. So he writes a letter,

156
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,950
a letter to the Italian cardinals,

157
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,610
and he begins the letter are addressing
them as in perhaps all of you will

158
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:50,301
wonder who is this man who
gives him the authority to say,

159
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:57,140
to speak to us and address dressers and
spur us on to action that's in here.

160
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:57,974
Remember,

161
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,370
this is Dante speaking and attributing
this thoughts to the cardinals.

162
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,400
They are the possible objection to the
intervention of a layman's voice within

163
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,960
sacred things fast.

164
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,280
He remember the lesson
of the Biblical prophet,

165
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,040
which he doesn't mention.
Uh, the name is mentioned,

166
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,880
who on seeing the arc of the,

167
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,250
of the alliance being carried into,

168
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,360
into the city of Jerusalem
and seeing the are tottering.

169
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,280
He stretches his hand,
trying to protect it to, to,

170
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,370
to make sure that it won't collapse and
break into pieces and God intervenes

171
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,710
and, and through lightening and
four minutes and man kills him.

172
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,720
So Dante's aware of the danger
of taking on. That's the point.

173
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,970
He goes home,
say spring them.

174
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:50,430
So I'm not really touching
the ark and Brady spring,

175
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:53,830
the oxen who are not going anywhere.
Let's see the absence of the letter,

176
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:55,450
but this does not concern us here.

177
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,880
But the point of concerns as here is that
in the background to this canto where

178
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:02,290
he takes on the prophetic voice,

179
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:07,030
he's aware of the possible profit
nation that he's engaged in,

180
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:11,830
in addressing as he does
the so called symbolists,

181
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,370
it's time to get into the Canto of the
so called symbolists who are the similes,

182
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,210
uh, in fact that we just saw, I
was just reading this little story,

183
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:26,230
the sisters of, of joys that I
have been reading that before.

184
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:28,540
But I know that that is really a story of,

185
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,600
I don't know how many of
you are English, uh, uh,

186
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,860
students and students of
English literature, but he
writes these stories about,

187
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,150
so two 20, early 20th century
version of, uh, of Simonia.

188
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,310
And if someone of you might want
to write a paper, uh, connecting,

189
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,360
uh,
the sisters,

190
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:51,160
this beautiful gem of a story by
[inaudible] and Canton 19, you can,

191
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,510
and you see the differences that they are,
uh, that the, between the two of them,

192
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,240
the similar lists are of
the followers. It's, it's a,

193
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,630
it's a word. Uh, like we said,
they're machiavellians. For instance,

194
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,640
our followers of Machiavelli's those who
think like Machiavelli, the Simone is,

195
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,980
are the followers of Simon who was
called a mongoose or a sorcerer or a

196
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,770
magician.
Simon Simon.

197
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,920
And actually we call this phenomenon
when you have a name that gives,

198
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,770
sort of creates a trend
or a way of thinking,

199
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,570
it's called an EP on him.

200
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,220
I thought that you might from
the Greek [inaudible] him,

201
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,570
this is an Simoni Simoni of
the photos is uh, Simon, uh,

202
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,700
the magician. So it's Dante
is beginning the story, um,

203
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,910
with a reference to a founding event
in the constitution of the church,

204
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,890
goes back to the acts of the apostles
were there is this story that of,

205
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:03,760
of a sourcer men engaged
in witchcraft in illusions.

206
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Simon who wants to buy the gift of
prophecy and the power of making miracles

207
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,630
from Peter,
and therefore then he challenges him to,

208
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,380
or let's see who can fly,
et Cetera,

209
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:21,190
and then they go up on a tower
and tied to fry Simon. Of course,

210
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:24,480
we'll go down and we'll die.
What Dante's doing?

211
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,170
He's now encountering the
popes of his own time.

212
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,690
Nicholas the fifth bone, if
it's the eighth, one of the
great minds, great jurist,

213
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:39,640
by the way. Uh, in fact, there are those
storylines who really think that Dante is,

214
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,870
is a dead mouse in him. That you know,
there's some something personal that we,

215
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,970
we can't quite see bone if it's the
eighth and Clement, the sixth, the fifth,

216
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm sorry,
the three popes and whom Dante lived,

217
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,420
who are engaged in say money.
What is symphony?

218
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,920
It's a sacrilege.

219
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,310
Symphony is the act exactly like Simon
in the acts of the apostles who wanted to

220
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:06,080
buy the gift of prophecy.

221
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,340
It is a sin whereby one can go on in
making commerce of sacred things and

222
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:17,240
thereby engaging in blast.
For me. The question then is,

223
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,720
what does Dante thing this hate crime is?

224
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,130
It's a constant theme in his,
uh,

225
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,520
in his reflections is a constant
theme of his thoughts. Uh,

226
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,980
what is the sacred, how
do we determine it? How,

227
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,050
what does it mean to violate this sacred?

228
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,600
Simon violates the sacred
that pope now who are, uh,

229
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,630
of his own generation are engaged in
the same kind of blasphemy and the same

230
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,320
kind of profit nation and in effect,

231
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,160
let me just give you a little detail
that you might appreciate this ambiguity.

232
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,720
The other neighbor of Peta, you know,
Saint Peter, the guy with the two keys,

233
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:58,340
we saw an illusion to him. We can to
13. The other name of Peter is Simon,

234
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,710
so he's, in fact, he's known. It's Simon
Peter. It is as if by having this tool,

235
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,710
the, the, the, the sourcer,

236
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,370
the magician called Simon and
the pope called Simon Peter,

237
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,070
and they should be a,
or who successors.

238
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:17,470
That's pope's should be the first pope
and the other. He's Dantes actually,

239
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,340
uh, uh, giving us a sense
of what we call for,

240
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:26,720
give them the, the rhetorical
term, immature Nimic proximity,

241
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:29,780
a contiguity in near illness between them.

242
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,740
The nearest between the
prophetic mode and a,

243
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,490
the perforation of the prophetic mode.
How,

244
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,990
how precarious is the boundary
line that divides the two?

245
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,210
How precarious the divide
line that separates the, the,

246
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,900
the sacred from the proffer
nation of the sacred.

247
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,530
So this is really what Dante's,
we'll see how he dramatizes all of us.

248
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,880
First of all. And the question that I
raised with you is how do profits tall?

249
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,350
And one thing that you will
see here is the apostrophe.

250
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,530
This is a candle written in terms
of a positive is look at this. Um,

251
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,150
and we read the Canto. So I'm reading
the Canto. This is for the transcriber.

252
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,410
Uh, um, can talk 19.

253
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,920
Ah, Simon Margot's.
There is the apostrophe.

254
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,890
Think about why their posture,
what is an apostrophe?

255
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,111
And you,

256
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:38,111
his Richard followers who rapacious
prostitute for gold and silver,

257
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,750
the things of God, we should be
brides of righteousness. Yeah,

258
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,690
that's the definition of Samaria. Uh,
viewed us and adultery, a corruption,

259
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,790
therefore of the chastity, of, of, uh,

260
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,820
of the marriage between God and the soul.

261
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,910
Now must the trumpet sound for you,

262
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,120
for your place in is in the third pouch.

263
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,570
We were now at the next tomb and
that climb to that part of the ridge,

264
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,890
which hangs right over the
middle of the ditch. Oh,

265
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,100
and other parts and other invocational
would call it, but it's, it's,

266
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,230
I'm not so sure that we can quiet that.

267
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:19,710
I couldn't quite decide the
difference in between an invocation,

268
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,920
which is obviously a
prayerful and an apostrophe,

269
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,450
a calling on and address a,
that's what the apostrophes,

270
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,600
how great is the art that shows in
heaven on earth and in the evil world.

271
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,260
And how Justin it has that power.

272
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,970
The Spence I saw along the
sides and on the bottom,

273
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,250
they live in stone full of holes.

274
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,940
All of one size in niche was rounds.

275
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,070
They seem to me of a,

276
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:52,071
with no more or less than those that
were made in my beautiful Saint John the

277
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:56,220
Baptist story of Saint John in Florence.

278
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,220
And these are this, uh, the, the,

279
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:04,221
the wells were baptisms take place
that usually octagonal in shape.

280
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,690
The eighth day, you know, the, the, the,

281
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,210
the idea that the rest of the direction
is on the eighth day. Uh, it's, it's, uh,

282
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,080
it's, it's the idea of history
based on the seven days of creation,

283
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,150
the eighth day of the resurrection,

284
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,050
they were made in my beautiful
Saint John as funds for baptism,

285
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:27,420
one of which not many years
ago I broke for wonder,

286
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:30,180
was drowning in it.
And to this,

287
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,570
I set my seal to clear the
mind of everyone with Dante's
doing is acknowledging

288
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,330
what could,

289
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,620
what could have been seen as
an act of profound nation.

290
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,050
He broke one,

291
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,650
which is really as a figurative because
they're are huge and I can't believe

292
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:54,570
that he could have the unit 10
people to break these things apart.

293
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,140
Uh,

294
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,140
so it's a figurative idea that he
stretched his head into holy things and

295
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:03,150
violated the holy things.
But he did it.

296
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,700
And that's the excuse is giving a,

297
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,060
he did it in order to save someone's life.

298
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,040
So there is nothing gratuitous.

299
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,420
That's the point in his own
intervention as it is called.

300
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:20,421
It's called an intervention in Zachary's
stretching the profane hands into holy

301
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:26,260
things and two sacred things
where he's, what he is really, uh,

302
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:31,430
removing himself from is the charge
that is act may appear purely gratuitous

303
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,210
prayer or to the tutors.
And if it's not gratuitous,

304
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,160
what is it driven by?
Where does it come from if it's not,

305
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,210
one can say, well, it's a gratuitous
act, which means you can dismiss it,

306
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,580
but this is not the two, two. So what
is the reason behind it then he, he,

307
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,100
if he serious enough,

308
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:55,630
it should provide us this region from
the mouth of which projected of each

309
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,660
projected the feet of a center and the
legs as far as the calf and the rest of

310
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,630
us inside.
He's representing the popes were here

311
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,710
upside down. That's the way,
that's the way Simon fail.

312
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,350
And they'll give a little
story about that too.

313
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,800
It was also the position that according
to legend Saint Peter wanted for

314
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:20,981
himself.

315
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:25,981
He asked that he be buried upside down
because he wanted to show what the cue,

316
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:31,270
the erection of for the soldiers are sent.

317
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:36,010
And purification would be the idea that
wedding, I remember in an inverted world,

318
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,120
a world which is upside down, and
therefore to be with a head down you, you,

319
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,170
you are really a right side up.
You are going toward the,

320
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,430
toward your proper destination so that
it is playing with this iconographic

321
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:53,320
Motif of Peter who asks to be
crucified with head upside down.

322
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,540
And the story of Simon who very
much like him now is as a, as a, as,

323
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,350
as, as a punishment is
with the head upside down.

324
00:22:02,351 --> 00:22:07,351
How were they punished in an avert pat
or day of the Pentecost and the flames of

325
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,860
fire? You know, the
story of the Pentecost.

326
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:16,280
That's the story of the Pentecost is the
story of the gift of language that come

327
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:19,330
down as a rain of fire on them.

328
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,290
Now they have flames on their feet.
This is what,

329
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,090
this is the soul to have a horrible,
uh,

330
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,060
turning around of, uh, of
prophecy. End of the, of the,

331
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,560
of the gift of languages,

332
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,070
meaning that we all speak
everybody else's language,

333
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,940
which clearly means I'm sure that
that was polyglots among view,

334
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,500
but it clearly means that we all speak
one language language of charity and

335
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:49,030
therefore we can all understand
each other that way. So, uh,

336
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:52,050
that's uh,
that they would have snapped with his uh,

337
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:56,170
and ropes is flames on oily thing,
on oily things,

338
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,790
the old unction. Uh, so it's
a further allusion to the,

339
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,820
this equation that is taking place
here moves only over the outer surface.

340
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:11,020
So it did there from the heels to the toe.
Who is that one done tasks,

341
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:16,050
wants to know who it is that he's his
master that rides in his torment more than

342
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:18,760
any of his fellows.
I said,

343
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:24,030
and this licked by a red flame and he
answered me if that will have me carry the

344
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:27,370
down there by that more sloping bank.

345
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,080
Does Sheryl know from himself
of him and of his misdeeds

346
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,590
and I all is.
Well for me,

347
00:23:35,591 --> 00:23:40,510
that is a pressure that with my load and
knows the depart node from the wheel,

348
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,840
the nose to what I do not speak.

349
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,020
Then we came on to the fourth dike,

350
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,210
turned and descended on our left
down to the pitted and narrow bottom.

351
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,430
And the good master did not set me down
from his home to he brought me to a

352
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:02,930
whole of him, the solar mentored
with his shanks, whoever,

353
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:07,931
whoever that wallet I began unhappy
sold that are held upside down,

354
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,490
planted like a post if
that were able to speak.

355
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,200
And now the series of inversions
is introduced here. I,

356
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,770
Dante says stood there like the fryer.

357
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:27,130
He is the layman to changing of roles
and the pope who is going to be unveiled

358
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,320
his own reveal his own identity
in a moment. He is there, uh,

359
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,460
like an assassin because an
assassin that perfidious assassin,

360
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:41,150
I mean the one who broke faith, that's
what the word, uh, perfectly, uh,

361
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,720
means that Shrives the
treasures intolerance,

362
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,020
the paddle fee though as an assassin who
have to being fixed calls him back so

363
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,500
that he delays is that,
and he cried.

364
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,460
This is the one of the pope's
Nicholas who misunderstands,

365
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:59,570
but the misunderstanding
is highly suggestive.

366
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,080
He's telling Dante and us
that the reigning pope or
Dante's writing Bonafides,

367
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,160
the eighth, one of the RCD
family, one of the great families,

368
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:14,240
Roman families has already arrived.
And he says standard style.

369
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:15,890
They're already standard stuff.

370
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:20,660
They're already Bonhoeffer's by
several years the writing lied to me.

371
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,750
And also soon sated with this gains,

372
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:26,650
which thou did not fear
to take that by guy,

373
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,790
the lady beautiful and
then do her outrage. So,

374
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,560
uh, this is uh, uh, the comic con,

375
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,530
the accusation that Dan
picking launch, Eh, the,

376
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,970
the figures of power,

377
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:46,300
the prophet who takes home a
power and unveils it's abusers.

378
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,420
I became like those that
stand as if marked, uh,

379
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,280
not comprehending the reply made to
them and knew not what to answer.

380
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:59,540
And Virgil said, tell him quickly, I'm
not here, I'm not here, that are thinkers.

381
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,490
And I answered as if as I was bitten
and that the spirit twisted his feet

382
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:07,940
together, then sign in with
lamenting voice. He said to me,

383
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,710
what does the want with me then?
If to know who I am, concerns the,

384
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,100
so much that has come
down the bank for it.

385
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,970
Know that I was invested with a
great mantle and so on. And Dante,

386
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:24,410
we'll go on into, uh,
uh, a general attack,

387
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,060
uh, which is really the, the prophetic
moment. Let me just, uh, I do not know.

388
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:33,390
I'm reading from lines 90 and
following. I do not know if, uh,

389
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,180
on that I was over bold when all my
answer to him was in the strain. Pray.

390
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,080
Tell me now,

391
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,620
how much treasure did our Lord require
of Saint Peter Before he gave keys into

392
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:46,080
his charge?
Surely he has nothing but follow me.

393
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,490
Nor did Peter on the other take gold
or silver from attires and so on.

394
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,480
So this is Dante. Now, uh,
the Prophet Dante, the,

395
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,370
the, the man who speaks because, and he,

396
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,470
he feels that he ought to speak.

397
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,190
And that's the distance taking from the
gratuitousness of the accusation because

398
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,390
all figures of authority lack in the
presence of this eclipse of authority.

399
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,950
He thinks that it is incumbent upon him
to go on taking that authority used to

400
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,410
have patient of over voice is a patient
of authority in order to make up for

401
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:31,870
what he thinks is missing.
And the problem, uh,

402
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,800
this whole question about the,
the,

403
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,920
the confusion of orders,

404
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,280
the confusion between the secular and
the sacred and profane and the sacred is

405
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:47,910
brought back to one great event,

406
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:52,530
which was known in the Middle
Ages as the second sin of Adam.

407
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,310
It was so great. They understand
what the first sin of Adam was.

408
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,640
The transgression or the
transgression of the,

409
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:04,641
the command given to him not
to eat of the tree of the,

410
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,700
the, the, the forbidden tree are
the forbidden fruit of the tree. Uh,

411
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,670
the vent,

412
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Dante goes back to his event of the so
called donation of Constantine about

413
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:19,860
which I want to say a few things and
then we move on to the next cancers.

414
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,350
And so it's the donation of Constantine.

415
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,430
It is a refers to the fourth century
when the Emperor Constantine,

416
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:29,490
whose name I think I
have mentioned, uh, uh,

417
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,190
gave extended,

418
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:35,160
gave the land to the
pope x in other words,

419
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:39,690
made the po the ruler of a secular,

420
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,840
um,
domain to Dante.

421
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:47,130
This was a confusion of registers,

422
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:52,131
a confusion of responsibilities that
the pope should be only engaged in

423
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,560
spiritual pursuits and spiritual matters.

424
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,860
He becomes instead involved
in secular matters.

425
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,360
So that scene of ceremony is
really the problem between, uh,

426
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,450
the has to do with the donation.
Of course in an issue. By the way,

427
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,330
and I will tell you why this
is important in a second.

428
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,570
The issue is we'll be really clarified
around the 15th century when two figures,

429
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:17,880
two people, two figures,
one is Cruzan knows,

430
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:22,950
some of you may know him or Nicholas
of cruiser went on repeating the moral

431
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:26,970
arguments against the donation of
Constantine as much as Dante does here.

432
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:32,210
But the one who really proved the
falseness of the documents with which,

433
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,110
uh,
uh,

434
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,210
Constantine supposedly made the donation
to the pope was Lorenzo Valla with a

435
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:44,890
philologist who went on examining
the language of the text.

436
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,260
And by examining that language,
found out that this, the,

437
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,000
the donation was not reading the document
had not possibly have been written in

438
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:56,770
the fourth century because the board,
the traces of 11th century,

439
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,910
uh,
Latin.

440
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:02,230
And so he went home and specifying that
that the region had been a forgery and

441
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:04,900
the forger had been
committed in, in a, in a,

442
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,280
in a convent in the south of France
with extraordinary linguistic position.

443
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,680
What is the,
why is this important to Dante?

444
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:14,830
Dante makes this issue of
the donation of Constantine,

445
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:19,150
the confusion of olders,
the spiritual and the secular,

446
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,630
which Simoni embodies Simoni
crystallizes the real problem of the,

447
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,300
the crisis of his own time.
So, so huge. I repeat that.

448
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:36,301
It's cold as the second scene of Adam
[inaudible] political texts called

449
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,423
Monarchia,

450
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,340
which is really an
argument in favor of the,

451
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,290
uh, the separation between these two
orders. The church and the state,

452
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,240
uh, had to be neatly divided
both to protect the state
from the intrusions of the

453
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:56,350
church and to protect the church from
the likely intrusions of the state.

454
00:30:56,351 --> 00:31:01,250
So it's really an argument that
goes into, into two directions, uh,

455
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,250
so much then for to 19.

456
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:06,820
The last thing I have to save it as I
began talking about the rhetoric of the

457
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:10,990
profits and said the
profits really, um, uh,

458
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,410
use apostrophe ish apostrophes,

459
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:19,450
which are forms of lament are Simon.
You can see it's a kind of morning.

460
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,700
Uh, it's the language of, uh, of,
of, of, of grief frank primarily.

461
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,070
But there is also from a
linguistic point of view,

462
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,890
something else about unopposed
because an apostrophe,

463
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,530
it's has an indeterminacy of its own.
It's not really language.

464
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,610
He says nothing. It's,
it's a scream. But it's a,

465
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,420
the sense of we need to break the silence.
In other words,

466
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:48,421
you are using an apostrophe or emit
a cry because you cannot be quiet.

467
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,990
And that's really exactly what makes
this aspect of prophetic language so

468
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,070
crucial. It's between silence.
One is overcome by what?

469
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:04,930
One. The, the enormity of what one
sees and the refusal to acquiesce. So,

470
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,180
uh, and, and I should leave you are
constantly, that's another apostrophe.

471
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,440
There was also the whole
Cantu is punctuated by this
rhetorical form that wants

472
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:18,790
to break the silence and, and,
and cannot quite find the words.

473
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,620
That's what I call the indeterminacy
of the rhetorical artifice. Um,

474
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,030
let me just go, ah, I know that
I said that. We'll read 21.

475
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:31,840
Maybe I can talk about it.
I have to say very little about comedy.

476
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:36,310
Dante uses the language of comedy.
And what I had, I had with time,

477
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:41,440
I would talk about how Dante out
of the way, 21, two, is he an hour,

478
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,400
my comedy,
the language,

479
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:48,401
the humble style at this as if he
wants to free himself from the shackle,

480
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:56,110
the complications of using their lofty
language or taking on this extraordinary

481
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:01,750
position of being, being the profit of
his own times. So he goes on to their,

482
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,593
my comedy,

483
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,100
but it's common is also linked to a
peculiar experiencing it that he tells in

484
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:10,490
Canto 21,
the fear of falling,

485
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,640
the devils are after him.
And that was the, the, the,

486
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,680
of course he calls them a wealth and he
believes in other way of thinking about

487
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:26,060
them was the war between, he says whites
and blacks, Bianche and airy. That's,

488
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,720
that's the way that would distinguish
themselves. So this demons are,

489
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:32,780
his enemies are the
blacks, the, the, the, uh,

490
00:33:32,781 --> 00:33:35,660
the Gibbons who are
trying to throw him down.

491
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:40,661
And the point is that comedy is always
attached to all is flagged with the idea

492
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:46,940
of the fall. Laughter.
This is where it begins.

493
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,920
At the moment when someone falls,
someone slips and,

494
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,230
and so we could really talk about that.
Had a little bit more but not much more.

495
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:56,450
Had a chance to,
if we had a little bit more time,

496
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:00,560
but I'm anxious to get into
26 and before we get to 26,

497
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,100
there is a passage in Canto
25 that I have to read.

498
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,550
Dante's been going through the Rome of
the thieves can took 24 and 25 and he is

499
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:14,090
overwhelmed by the metamorphosis,

500
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,490
the form of punishment of these thieves,
uh,

501
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,380
that goal and changing,
um,

502
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,560
form that become snakes that are
human beings bitten by snakes.

503
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:31,220
They become snakes that turned into
ashes and the recomposed themselves in an

504
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:33,470
endless cycle.
This is the punishment.

505
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:37,280
And Dante goes on writing as a poet,

506
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,550
breaking the flow of the narrative
of what is happening to him.

507
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,640
And this is what he says
he is. This is some 10, 25,

508
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,030
25 lines 90.

509
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,850
And following his, he describes the, uh,

510
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,970
actual reading from blinds
eight and following.

511
00:34:55,971 --> 00:35:00,200
It's the lizard under the great scorge
of the dog days passing from hedge to

512
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:03,770
hedge seems lightening
if it crossed the way.

513
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:07,430
So appeared meeting for the
balance of the other two. A small,

514
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,900
fiery serpent,

515
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,060
livid and black has a peppercorn and
that part by which we were when we first

516
00:35:14,151 --> 00:35:15,440
receive a nourishment,

517
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,750
it transfixed in one of them then fell
down before him stretched out the ones

518
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,810
that's fixed it,

519
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,260
but said nothing only stood still in
your mind as if sleep per fever had come

520
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:30,470
upon him. He kept looking at
the serpent and it at him.

521
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,180
The only one from the wound,

522
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,080
the other from the mouth smoked violently
and the smoke meth and now he's down

523
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,640
talking as a poet.

524
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:44,330
He breaks the account that the chronicle
what he has seen the witnessing since

525
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:45,991
that's what he is.

526
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:49,980
He's the witness in all of
these experiences and there
and that's what he says.

527
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,670
Let looking now be silent with his tales
of Richard's Abellio and the CTOs and

528
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:00,720
let him wait to hear what now comes forth.

529
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,600
Let all of it is highlands about card,

530
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:08,601
the most angelic Tusa for if in his
lines he turns him into a serpent and her

531
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,170
into fountain.

532
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,430
I do not grudge it to him
for two natures face to face.

533
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:17,280
He never saw transmuted that both kinds.

534
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:21,510
We're ready to exchange their
substance. All right. On the face of it,

535
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,540
Dante saying that the kind of
metamorphosis is describing really is,

536
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,390
um, more horrifying than anything says
that [inaudible] the author of the

537
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,410
metamorphosis or who is all his guidance,

538
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,570
his mom metamorphosis by a belief in the,

539
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,360
in the bondage and the bond of,
of,

540
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,040
in the solidarity between humans,
human beings, and the natural world.

541
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,790
We can go on shifting forms
and there is a kind of Syrian,

542
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,190
a transformation happening in,
in, uh, in, in, in, uh, innovate.

543
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:00,220
And he also, he also says
that he's different from
Luca and other author of, uh,

544
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,040
in of matter of a scene.

545
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:05,340
So metamorphosis in his
story about the civil war.

546
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,170
But the point that I,

547
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,250
that I think is really crucial
here is that it's a different one.

548
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,610
Dante is repeating,

549
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,640
reenacting exactly the kind of aesthetic
temptation that we already witnessed in

550
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:27,490
Canto four of inferno in limbo where
Dante meets the poet and he's so taken,

551
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:33,150
so complacent about undoubtedly that
great imputation of being sitting,

552
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,480
sitting with, uh, can
you imagine Houma Virgil,

553
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,000
Horace Lucan of it.

554
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,360
Exactly the people that he
mentioned them retrospectively,

555
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,690
that scene of harmony that can't have
four seem to dramatize now completely,

556
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,000
completely vanquished. You know, here he
is, he's really saying, I am their rival.

557
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,470
I am even better. I'm seeing things
that they didn't even imagine.

558
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,970
So if you had the illusion of an
idealic relationship among poets, uh,

559
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:05,040
you are this abused at this point.

560
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,300
But it is a temptation
nonetheless because once again,

561
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,430
Dante's going down for, in, in, in, in,

562
00:38:13,431 --> 00:38:17,250
in an expo and the descent, which is
at the center of spiritual humility.

563
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,640
And yet his voice seems to be
going up in an opposite direction.

564
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,980
One of Hubris,

565
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,140
the same kind of temptation that he had
in Canto for, and this is what happens.

566
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:28,441
Again,

567
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:33,441
the structure repeats itself in Canto
for Dan pay claims that he built up a

568
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:36,370
fellowship,
a great poets.

569
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,640
He comes into pental five and he has to
confront the responsibilities of writing

570
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,520
the responsibilities of being a writer.
And he encounters his own.

571
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,580
A reader of his own Dante merges into
Canto 26 and meets none other than

572
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Julissa's their master rhetorician whose
experience and whose journey will lead

573
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:07,681
himself and his are
companions to a tragic end.

574
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,010
For Dante. This is an extraordinary
moment for a number of reasons.

575
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:17,370
Ulysses is a steri point of
reference for his own adventure.

576
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:18,850
Ah,

577
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,850
he would keep thinking of him in Canton
19 Oh Purgatorio El Canto 28 or paradise

578
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:29,170
when Dante is about to leave beyond
the whole, the physical universe.

579
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:31,630
He looks back to see
this as he has traveled.

580
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,580
And the only thing that he sees is really
that passage way where you listen as

581
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,670
violated or boundaries clearly what
kind of boundaries in my violating you

582
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,100
listen as a mode of being a
possibility of being for Dante himself.

583
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,500
And so we come into Canto 26 and I
would like to take as much time as we

584
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,860
possibly can without tiring you
all, uh, about, uh, this can't,

585
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,820
let me begin with,
as I sought to preamble,

586
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,880
tell you a general, a
general, a general point.

587
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,510
Every school child in antiquity and
in Dante's on time knew one thing,

588
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,760
that Ulysses was a famous Greek hero,

589
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:21,310
polio tropic as homer calls him the main
of many terms, the many who knew it. All,

590
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,040
the men who had been seasoned
in order experiences.

591
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:27,550
They know that he had
done to the war of Troy,

592
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,590
that he was the one to suggest that the
building of the Trojan horse and the

593
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:37,360
stealing of the palladium, as you
know, the simulacrum of Minerva wisdom,

594
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,520
the figure of that,
the image of wisdom.

595
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,970
And then it took him that he was
involved in the bath or about inheriting

596
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,410
Achilles arbs with Ajax.
And then we,

597
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:53,350
everybody knew that it took him
10 years to return to Ithaca.

598
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:58,720
Right? This is a story of the Odyssey. He
turns, he goes to, we do not only that,

599
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,950
the, the, the nostrils as the
Greeks call, call it the return,

600
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,450
the journey of return.

601
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,130
He becomes the hero of nostalgia there
going back to a place that he has.

602
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,480
Everybody knew this in, uh, in Dante,
in antiquity, in Dante's times,

603
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,381
in antiquity.

604
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:17,970
They knew it very well because then
the story of Unisys had become a nun.

605
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:22,330
The as philosophical allegory
of the faith of the soul.

606
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,040
The idea of Ulysses who goes
from Ithaca to Troy and then go,

607
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:29,440
goes back for 10 years
after the war of 10 years,

608
00:41:29,441 --> 00:41:33,890
another 10 years of vicissitudes,
cleansing himself in order to reach,

609
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:35,980
to go back to, uh, and, and, and,

610
00:41:35,981 --> 00:41:39,680
and testing himself to go
back to his hometown, um,

611
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,380
was really the story of the soul.
That's what this whole does.

612
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:45,680
It's incarnates itself stroll
fee and the pissed of it.

613
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,730
It goes through the soul,

614
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:52,731
goes through the planets and gets
tainted by the attributes of the,

615
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:58,040
of the plan. At some of us are
lunatics, others are mercurial,

616
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:01,010
others are Saturnine, you
know, that's from the planets.

617
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:05,990
But then by cleansing ourselves, there's
salt and go back to its place of origin.

618
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,820
That's the circle of the return.
That's,

619
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:13,910
that's the way the Alexandra neoplatonists
understood the allegory of the

620
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:16,220
Odyssey.
So this is clear.

621
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,580
Dante violates this rule.

622
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,380
That's what you have in Canto
26 Dante begins with Ulysses,

623
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:29,430
his return to Ithaca and starts his
journeys of exploration all over again.

624
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,260
The idea of the eternal return,

625
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:36,910
the idea of a closure that
he has come back home is not,

626
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,580
not part of Dante's
imagination or sensibility.

627
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:46,030
He is [inaudible] the poet who is truly
restless and always placing himself and

628
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:52,460
his heroes on some kind of quest.
I want a method on a roads,

629
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:55,520
on an address, whatever, whatever the the,

630
00:42:55,521 --> 00:43:00,521
the idea is the philosophers were always
on the road is in thinking about some,

631
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,060
some, some way of reaching wisdom,
reaching truth. That's where he puts them.

632
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,100
And that's what happens with the
story of, uh, of, of Ulysses. Ulysses,

633
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,240
uh,

634
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,240
starts all over again and goes and to
die is involved in a journey that is

635
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:21,980
absolutely the gratuitous,
a journey for wisdom,

636
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:27,480
for wisdom into the unpeopled world
who got to see this in the moment and,

637
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:32,390
and dies. That's, that's, that's
it from one point of view.

638
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,320
And I want you to be careful as you
read the Kantar because you will see,

639
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,420
you'll notice one thing,

640
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:42,860
the first thing you will notice is it's
not Dante who conducts the interview

641
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,640
with Ulysses. No, it is virtual.

642
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,480
The Port of Latin antiquity and supposedly
they speak may be Greek or some form

643
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:57,860
of, uh, clearly Greek.
Um, uh, it is Virgil,

644
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:02,890
the poet of the Aeneid who thinks of
himself as the fitting interlocutor of the

645
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:07,170
great Greek hero,
not Dantes,

646
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,600
Dantes excluded Dante just
watches and witnesses this.

647
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,240
But there is more to this idea of
stylistic, the core because one can say,

648
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:18,560
well,
Virgil,

649
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:23,060
this is in fact that as tragic
as a text get ever get supply,

650
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,500
this is not a comical text. This
is Virgil, the author of a tragedy.

651
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:30,080
That's where Dante calls
and the tragic style,

652
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:35,410
the sublime style and Julisa speeds in
the most in the loftiest way possible.

653
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,660
But it's not just a question
of stylistic decorum at stake.

654
00:44:39,661 --> 00:44:44,661
There is something else you
listen disguises himself
as an ears as and tells the

655
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,530
story of his life as if he were an ESBL.

656
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,000
Now let me just tell you one little
thing and then we get into the Canto. Ah,

657
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,250
this is part of a story in many ways.

658
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:00,990
If you ask readers of Virgil and homer,

659
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,130
they probably will tell you, well
virtual, yeah, good port. But you know,

660
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,490
let's face it,
the first six books are just the,

661
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:10,260
all this say and the second books I just,

662
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:14,610
the yearly that he sort of gives her a
raise, you may have and so on. Not at all.

663
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,110
Not at all. And the difference
between the two heroes is this.

664
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:21,960
Ulysses is a place to go back to.

665
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:27,740
He goes Mythica to Troy back to Ithaca
and he has has no place to go to.

666
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,380
His is the open question.
The open the,

667
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,590
the road on open ended road
and open a red and the journey.

668
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,810
And this is the way you listen is,

669
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:44,250
will think of himself the further the
last thing and then the really we'll get

670
00:45:44,251 --> 00:45:45,980
into the cancer.
The last thing I'll say is that

671
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,210
extraordinary ambiguity.

672
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,990
I want to point out the extraordinary
to be ambiguity with which Dante

673
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:56,930
represents Julissa's.

674
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,500
But the ambiguity of Unisys is part of
the story of Ulysses from the start.

675
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,550
The variant from the very beginning.

676
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,150
Ulysses is a philosopher
and he's a rhetorician.

677
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,310
He's someone who can
manipulate or knowledgeable
his own ends. And this, this,

678
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:19,110
this, this ambiguity that in
many ways, Dante is a fines.

679
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:22,090
Very alluring. Okay. Let's,
let me start with the Canto.

680
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:26,590
The Canto start starts
with, uh, uh, another,

681
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:32,590
uh, very topical relation. Uh,

682
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,600
very topical allusion. Dante is, uh,

683
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:39,370
joined their attention to a specific
place to the city of Florence.

684
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:44,470
It is as if he wants to a more himself
angle himself to something that's

685
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:48,850
concrete as his immediate
time, immediate place, uh,

686
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:53,470
his own native place. And, and, and, and
it's an apostrophe to Florence, rejoice,

687
00:46:53,471 --> 00:46:56,050
Florence,
since that was so great.

688
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,540
Okay,

689
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,160
let me just stop here.
Moment. Pay Attention.

690
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:06,030
As you read the Canto,
pay attention to one,

691
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,250
a stylistic elements,
the antithetical,

692
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:16,850
the empathetical our use of great or uh,

693
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,410
tall and small at the same time.
Uh, rhetorically sometimes,

694
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,460
uh, all women with the
idea that uh, uh, of,

695
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:28,850
of making us ask and one that,

696
00:47:28,851 --> 00:47:32,830
what is the relationship between within
that which claims to be so large and so

697
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:34,810
big and that which claims to be so small.

698
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,700
You list is obviously thinks of themselves
in terms of loftiness and Dante.

699
00:47:38,701 --> 00:47:42,400
Now rhetorically starts with Florence in
south. So great. That's how tight it is.

700
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,840
Obvious that overland and see the Beatles,

701
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:49,570
they wings and through hell
they name it spread abroad.

702
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:54,460
The whole point is that he has seen some
Florentine thieves are named even among

703
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:58,030
the thieves are found five such
citizens of dine. That's shame for them.

704
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:00,010
Comes and once again,

705
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,630
the prophetic voice of Dante peers here
and that they will see that this is,

706
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,010
is fairly important in
the narrative we set out.

707
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:14,010
Second paragraph end on the stairs which
they're projecting rocks had made for

708
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:15,700
descent before.

709
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:20,590
My leader mounted again in drew me up
and following the lonely way among the

710
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:25,120
rocks and splinters of the ridge.
The food made new speed without the hand.

711
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,940
I grieved then

712
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,560
and grief now are new.

713
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:38,460
Then when he was a pilgrim watching
and witnessing the stories,

714
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,210
this is going to tell her and now
as a writer they said double focus.

715
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:48,211
That Dante's using the focus of the
pilgrim and the focus of the narrator I

716
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:52,420
grieved in and agree with.
Now our new,

717
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,780
when I turned my mind to what I
saw and more than I'm warrant,

718
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:03,030
I curb my powers and this is going to
be at least the attempt of Dante to curb

719
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:09,031
his powers as he witnesses the story
of immoderate hunger for knowledge of a

720
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:14,950
flight of the mind. That's what we
have here. The flight of the mind,

721
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,750
which is like the flight of battles,

722
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,980
which is like the flight of Icarus
that seems to know no boundaries.

723
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:28,470
Ulysses is he who transgresses all
boundaries but doesn't Dante also

724
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:33,070
transgressed boundaries? He
won't say, so here he wants,

725
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,160
it seems that he takes you listen as an
exemplary figure that would lead him to

726
00:49:38,591 --> 00:49:43,110
want to curb his powers.
Let's continue, uh, uh, uh,

727
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,370
less, uh, less they run where
virtual does not guide them,

728
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,740
uh, in the languages that of
a horses. Of course horses,

729
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:59,100
the horses of the soul and virtue is
the ability to hold that black and the

730
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:03,340
white horse on the chariot,
uh, to hold them together.

731
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:08,580
And so that's the illusion with the t
that Dante is using and your platonic

732
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:12,670
language so that it favoring star or
something better have granted me such a

733
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:15,220
boon.
I mean not drudge it to myself.

734
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,210
And now the first description of
the landscape as some are landscape,

735
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:21,460
as many as the fireflies,

736
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:25,600
which the peasant resting on the hill in
the season when the heat at lights the

737
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:29,240
world least hides his face from us.

738
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:34,370
What an extraordinary emerge
at preferences to talk
about the sun is the night

739
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,370
when the sun is hiding.

740
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,250
And you'll see the
implications of this metaphor.

741
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:43,880
I hope we're in a moment seize along
the valley below in the fields.

742
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:47,810
Perhaps where the, he gathers the
grapes and entails with so many frames.

743
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:48,351
The eighth,

744
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:52,520
which was all gleaming is a perceived
as soon as I came where the bottom was

745
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:56,900
insight and this he,
that I was avenged but the bearish,

746
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,120
so the chariot of Elijah,

747
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:05,030
his departure when the host rear the
roads to heaven who could not follow it

748
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:08,630
with his eyes, so his to see
anything but the flame alone,

749
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,610
like a little cloud mounting up.

750
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:15,820
So each flay moves along the gullet of
the ditch for none shows the theft and

751
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:19,120
everyone steals away, uh, center. Uh,

752
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:22,490
Dante's not comparing himself to Elijah,

753
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,570
he's comparing to someone
who watches Elijah, Elijah,

754
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,580
who is also engaged in a
flight to fight to the soul.

755
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,340
Right, exactly. Like Ulysses
who is going to be represented.

756
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,460
It's the antithesis to your listeners,

757
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:40,190
but Dante is not that likely larger and
he would like us to believe that he's

758
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:42,530
not really like Ulysses.

759
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,400
He is like Ellie sales,

760
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,750
the one who inherits the mantle of
prophecy from Elijah and the one who,

761
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:55,430
who witnesses watchers. It's,
it's, it's, it's his way of,

762
00:51:55,580 --> 00:52:00,410
of trying to avoid the extreme
of the profit. And now,

763
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:02,240
as it turns out, the iteration, this is,

764
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:07,280
this is the way they lay out here is
between Ulysses and, uh, and Elijah.

765
00:52:07,281 --> 00:52:10,550
And so I was standing on the
bridge and then he goes on.

766
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,560
He's told them within the flames
are the spirits. She's a folk frame.

767
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:18,050
And there are two souls die,
uh,

768
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,700
erases and Diomede pay attention
until this little detail,

769
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:26,180
except in the case of the,
uh, the, the suicides,

770
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,230
Dante or reeses pairs of sinners.

771
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:35,960
Here's Diomede who doesn't
talk. And he sees also, uh,

772
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,600
he sees, uh, Ulysses.

773
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,200
And I suppose that the reason is that
Dante really wants us to know about the

774
00:52:45,221 --> 00:52:50,221
social quality of a moral
violation that are moral violation.

775
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:55,090
All his implies, uh, somebody
else. It's not quite ever,

776
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:56,260
except for the suicide,

777
00:52:56,261 --> 00:53:01,261
which has a peculiar form because you
have witness homicide and victim mode in

778
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:06,170
one. But in, in, uh, in, in the other
centers, you always have a sense of,

779
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:09,200
of, uh, uh, uh, a witness,

780
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:14,000
somebody else who has been touched
or an accomplice of, uh, uh, of,

781
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:18,860
of, of the center. Uh, so
within, we know that he answered,

782
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,970
who are these people I really wish
to us the who is that fire hose,

783
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:27,380
which comes so crew and at the top that
seems to rise from the buyer with a t

784
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,770
Oakleys.
What's led with this broader,

785
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,580
the stories that abide by the
two brothers were enemies,

786
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,440
ATO please and Polynese.

787
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:39,820
Thebes what are they
have an introduction of?

788
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,460
This is all about Greek mythology,
uh,

789
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,160
in Greek mythology with brothers
city over the story of Thebes,

790
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:52,930
which Dante knows through stages,
uh, the idea of the depots of course,

791
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,920
and Jocasta and the tragic city, uh, the,

792
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:00,100
the Thebes becomes, uh, the, uh,

793
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,250
the term becomes a
metaphor. The, the, the,

794
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:06,250
the basic metaphor of, uh, of the,

795
00:54:06,251 --> 00:54:11,251
some of the tragic city app because in
effect presents also one of the reasons

796
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:15,700
that for dentist crucial,

797
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
it presents birth EEOC lists and Polynese,

798
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,010
um,
childs,

799
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:30,090
the children of either pose
and Jokasta is tragic events.

800
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:36,750
This is something that distinguishes
radically the Greek idea is Dante

801
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:38,830
understands it.
Uh,

802
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:43,630
the Greek idea of cities
and birth from say,

803
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,770
Virgil's idea of birth. You know,
something to be celebrated all the time.

804
00:54:48,771 --> 00:54:53,290
None of Virgil is always the one
who celebrates the birth of a,

805
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:56,640
a senior's polio, et cetera.
Now we know who these are.

806
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:00,090
He answered me within there are tormented

807
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:03,340
within their tormented.
You listen,

808
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:07,770
that you made and that's together they
go on the vengeance as under wrath

809
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:12,120
cetera. If they're able to speak
within this lights. I said,

810
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:15,180
I earnestly pray the
master and pray again.

811
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,770
My prayer Availa thousand fold that
not forbid me to stay to the horn.

812
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:23,190
Flame comes near though ceased
how bent on it with desire.

813
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,870
And he said that prayer deserves
much praise for consent to it,

814
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:32,550
but to restrain that Kong
first little earlier,

815
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,120
he wants to curb his powers.
No,

816
00:55:36,121 --> 00:55:39,330
Virgil asks him to restrain his time,

817
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,570
leave it to me to speak for,

818
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:45,890
have understood with a wishes for perhaps
since they were agreed that was the

819
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:50,850
same I speech. So we have really a
sense of the hierarchy of styles,

820
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:54,600
Virgil and your listeners.
And then in cancer 27,

821
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:59,570
it's going to be redone. The
MONTEFELTRO and Dante, uh,

822
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:04,280
or you are to who are to within one fire.
If I deserve what I lived,

823
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,490
if I deserve to you much
or little once again,

824
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:10,130
the oscillation between high and low,

825
00:56:10,131 --> 00:56:14,480
much or little when in the world I
wrote the lofty lines, do not move on,

826
00:56:14,481 --> 00:56:18,340
but let the one of you tell what
are being lost. He went to die.

827
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:24,130
The Greater Horn of the ancient
flame began to a murmur.

828
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,880
Justice if would've beaten
by the wind and weaving.

829
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:30,790
The point to and fro is it's
where the tongue of the spoke.

830
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:36,060
If Frank Fourth of voice and said when
I parted from Cersei who helped me more

831
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:42,040
than a year,
the guy atia before an ears so named it.

832
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:47,041
So you said clearly you list tells
his story through the myth of an ears

833
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,690
claiming priority of raininess but
also the knowledge in one thing.

834
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:56,770
It's an incredibly,
I find it a very moving line that uh,

835
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,750
any his names, places in
memory of his nurse. You know,

836
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,750
your names,
the city of gate.

837
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:07,270
He's a founder of cities
and names the CTO gator,

838
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:11,110
not fondness for her son,
no duty twin aged father,

839
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,190
not the love I owed Penelope.
Look at this,

840
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,130
what we call heavily ethical language.

841
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,450
You listen speaks in terms
of what his duties are,

842
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,300
fondness or sun,
the duty to alleged father liberties,

843
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,520
the love I owed Penelope,

844
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:34,870
which should have gladden
her could conquer within me
the passion I had to gain

845
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:38,800
experience of the world and the
vices and worth event. This is,

846
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:44,010
seems to be an ethical quest and nothing
can stand in the way of this virtuous

847
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:46,143
action.
You,

848
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:51,150
you as thinks of himself as a
virtuous Cuesta after visors.

849
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,090
Understanding and gaining experience of,
uh,

850
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,600
of vices and, uh, and, and,

851
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:00,580
and virtual and the worth of men.

852
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,180
And they put forth on the open
deep with that one ship, uh,

853
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,840
the one shore and the other I
saw as far as Spain and Morocco,

854
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,120
Sardinia and he's a man of,

855
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,680
you mentioned places all the time.
This narrative,

856
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:20,130
he always mentions places,
cities, Morocco, uh,

857
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:25,150
Seville sailed on the other
side of the Mediterranean. Um,

858
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:30,760
it is as if he is a man who
lives in space. He left,

859
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:35,110
his father, loves his son. That would
be a temporal description of him,

860
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,390
but he lives in space because it is,

861
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,680
if he never really knew
his own place in the world,

862
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,540
he's always looking for
something he doesn't even,
he doesn't know where he, he,

863
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:49,390
he, he belonged and, and I come,

864
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,830
my companions were old and slow when we
came to narrow out with per Hercules set

865
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:58,390
up his landmarks so that men should
not pass beyond on my right hand.

866
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:03,750
I left Seville on the other already left
Celta and now the speech he makes to

867
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:09,250
his own companions and look
at the rhetorical that a
torical wisdom with which

868
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:13,720
he moves, he addresses them as
brothers, which is the biggest cup.

869
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:17,470
Tatsuya benevolence. We are all
together. There is no hierarchy here.

870
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:21,620
I'm not your leader. I'm not
yo king or brothers. I said,

871
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:26,540
who threw 100,000 pedals?
Look at the hyperboles. Oh,

872
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:31,600
if you want to seduce people to
come companions to come with you,

873
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:35,480
you have to tell them that they
are mighty actions and he does.

874
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:40,280
And then magnify all the possible
dangers or hundred thousand pedals have

875
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:41,330
reached the west.

876
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:46,550
North definitely plays the
west vague and yet lofty, uh,

877
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,440
to this. So brief vigil of
the census. So the modesty,

878
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:56,630
the oscillation between
hyperbole and, and, and, uh,

879
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,820
the light totay as it were, the, the, the,

880
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:04,990
the recoiling into the sense
of orderliness and small
that remains to us choose

881
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:10,550
not to deny experience,
which I find an extraordinary word,

882
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:15,050
experience. And they probably will,
uh, uh, stop here with this experience,

883
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,910
as you know, is a word made only
of prepositions, uh, expert either.

884
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,460
It's a journey. It's going,
uh, through, uh, bear,

885
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:28,340
no experience.
It's understood is a journey.

886
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:32,060
It is as if knowledge,
that's what the etymology of the word is.

887
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,400
It's a going through,
uh,

888
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,480
it is knowledge literally is compared
to a displacement through a traveling,

889
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:45,860
uh, through, through a, Eh, uh,
Khattab assists even in this case,

890
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:46,920
which is the,
the,

891
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:51,930
the term to indicate the descent into
the beyond in the sands tracks of the

892
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,950
peopled, world tech thought of
the seed from which you spraying.

893
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,570
If you want to know the end of things,

894
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:07,730
you have to know the beginnings.
You have to know the seed,

895
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,830
Huh? Uh, this is the, the,
this is Julissa's perception.

896
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,850
Uh, and because we have a new
Boosie than you do know that your,

897
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:21,650
there's a kind of natural determination
in his own, uh, his own mind,

898
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,400
uh,
that he will reach in the noble end.

899
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:27,590
You were not born to leave as brutes,

900
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,720
but to follow virtual and knowledge
as extraordinary, extraordinary line,

901
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,370
uh, he promises that human
beings will leave behind.

902
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:41,690
What did the illusion may be through a
metamorphosis of Cersei that I changed

903
01:01:41,691 --> 01:01:45,740
the companions into
pigs, right? The Koreans,

904
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:49,160
the hogs of Picuris into
the voluptuary experiences.

905
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:54,320
And he promises to re store in
them not only the human image,

906
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,440
but to bring them to a virtual knowledge.

907
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,130
And it's an extraordinary promise.
It's a very difficult promise.

908
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,440
It's almost an impossible promise.

909
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:08,650
It may even not be a correct promise
because he's making a promise that virtue

910
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,610
is knowledge.

911
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:15,590
I lead you to virtual knowledge
and they may not be the same thing.

912
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,790
I may have knowledge, but it does
mean that I have the virtue of that,

913
01:02:19,791 --> 01:02:24,540
that I claim to have knowledge about.
And My, my, my, it can be anything.

914
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:27,690
Anything at all. I can know
what prudence is. It doesn't,

915
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,100
that doesn't really make me pull
it. That's, so let's stop here.

916
01:02:32,101 --> 01:02:37,101
I'd want to stop here and I'm want to
see if there's some questions and then

917
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:41,310
resume next time with, uh, the camp. Yes,

918
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:47,650
USC is because people aren't
going to any definite place.

919
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:52,870
Is that what you said is like USC?
It's because people don't have

920
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,510
the question is uh,
I mentioned a,

921
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:02,460
actually Ulysses mentions knowing that
he speaks to Virgil mentions any years

922
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:07,710
and uh, uh, so that's the ad.
That's a y n e s and Julissa's.

923
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,460
Vaguely. That's true. Uh,

924
01:03:09,610 --> 01:03:14,400
they clearly were fighting the
same battle and Troy verge,

925
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:19,570
a Ulysses must know that engineers had
lost his hometown and he took his son.

926
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,920
I like your recess. He took
his father on a, on, on his,

927
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:26,754
his back.

928
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:31,970
Literally they is immigrant and his son
and the lost his wife Crozer and goals

929
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,540
looking for a place without really
knowing, but it plays his, for him.

930
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,660
You leases knows what he wants to go.

931
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,170
He has a certain idea of its destination,
which is Ithaca.

932
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,360
He gets a lot of temptations along the
way. No C Cup. And what a temptation. Ah,

933
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,290
sir,
sir.

934
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:54,620
And other great temptation he manages to
move beyond those two conversations in

935
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:59,010
order to go back to Ithaca.
That's the great difference from,

936
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:02,970
from the Roman myth of the immigrant.

937
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:06,810
But in this version, aren't they still
really different because you, let's see.

938
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:11,550
I mean, he, his quest doesn't have any
direction at all. It's just experience.

939
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,880
Um, I'm unused. It's quest. He
doesn't know where he's going,

940
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:18,190
but there's still an overall
plan so that there is a definite

941
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:23,410
exactly, absolutely. So there is
a difference between them are,

942
01:04:23,411 --> 01:04:28,370
becomes that that nes was
stop at one point. Uh,

943
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:32,870
he has temptations to stop in Sicily.
Oh, you remember their, that they're,

944
01:04:32,871 --> 01:04:35,310
they're famous games.
Uh,

945
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,060
the games ritual games in memory of
his father who had died, the death,

946
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:44,840
that hallows, that ground. Then
the death of, of, of, of, of, of,

947
01:04:44,841 --> 01:04:49,500
of, of unkindness that women
burn the ships just as weeks.

948
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:52,300
This is tube to, this is utopia. I don't,

949
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:56,170
we don't want to go around and do this
epic adventure. Let's stop here. He wants,

950
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:59,950
he's always a misunderstanding.
Oracle's, he doesn't know where to go.

951
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:04,210
He's always looking backwards,
but looking forward at the same time.

952
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:09,310
But at one point he stops he and the,
and that's part of, if you wish, the,

953
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:13,420
the realism of, of any as he
stops at one point, they cannot,

954
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,000
we will not go any,
any further.

955
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,170
Ulysses go spec home and then
he starts all over again.

956
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,490
But that's Danfoss reading of Ulysses.
Okay.

957
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,520
So he's really reading him as very much
like as if he would have a variant of a,

958
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,980
of Dante by the way.

959
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:37,650
Uh, yes, it's impossible.

960
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:43,410
I to be is to represent the dichotomy
between Dante, the poet and Dante,

961
01:05:43,411 --> 01:05:44,430
the narrator as well,

962
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,030
because no one has a definite places
looking back at that place where he was

963
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,420
going. And the other is taking a journey
of experience in unsure where he's gone.

964
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,540
Uh,
the question is very interesting and it's,

965
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,560
is it possible to think of a nes and
your listeners is a two functions?

966
01:05:59,051 --> 01:06:03,760
Is it were of Dante, the pilgrim
and the poet? Uh, yes and no.

967
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:09,060
Um, it's a very interesting
question. Um, but I, I would know,

968
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:14,080
um, I, I really hesitate to
agree with you for one reason.

969
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:17,380
Uh, because, uh, writing for Dante

970
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,370
is a prolongation of,

971
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:27,470
of the search than
politically can not stop.

972
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:31,670
It's not that, you know, he on the face
of it, he has seen the beatific vision,

973
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,860
right?
That's new to the story.

974
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:37,760
The story of a man who goes from
the wilderness goes to hell,

975
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:41,990
purgatory paradise and here's a beatific
vision and now he starts telling us

976
01:06:41,991 --> 01:06:46,430
about it. A fighting against
forgetfulness. You know, here's a lot of,

977
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:47,301
as a writer,

978
01:06:47,301 --> 01:06:52,301
he is a lot of temptations and yet
the writing itself is fraught with,

979
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:56,780
with uh, dangers, temptations.

980
01:06:57,290 --> 01:06:59,060
It's a different sort of journey,

981
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:04,090
but it's the journey of writing and
therefore there's no clear cut distinction

982
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:09,830
between the two. I, in fact,
I just read in Canto 25, uh,

983
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:14,100
the little scene when he
challenges Luca and dove in,

984
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:19,100
which it really is, let the past yield
to the present. You know, that's, that's,

985
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,990
that's really the kind of
claim that they can make. Uh,

986
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:26,510
let them be quiet cause I know what
is happening and the stories that is a

987
01:07:26,511 --> 01:07:27,344
writer,

988
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:32,590
he is a lapsing his falling into a number
of them as if it were to peel them.

989
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:38,480
You can expect that from a pilgrim
to being fat, being fascinated by,

990
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,990
uh, by Francesca. I'm having all this, uh,

991
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:46,400
in the divisions,
Dante is a deeply divided man.

992
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:51,320
He has to calm them and at the same
time has to sympathize as, as a,

993
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,870
even as a pilgrim.
So that's really the,

994
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:58,560
that's that's the only little
detail would I would, uh, uh,

995
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,640
I would not agree with you, but
maybe you have right? I Dunno.

996
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,430
Oh yes. Can you speak about
the fact that nothing changes?

997
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,560
The ending is stories and had some
drowned at sea that have intertwined the,

998
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,493
again,

999
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:14,680
he returned. Uh, the question is,

1000
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:18,980
can I speak about how Dante changes
the ending of your list? A story.

1001
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:21,100
And the answer is this,
uh,

1002
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:26,170
Dante makes you listen
this go back to Ithaca,

1003
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:32,170
but then he breaks the
circle of this close circle.

1004
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,880
Let's call it the circle of the epic. Let
me talk formally about it. You know, the,

1005
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:41,540
the idea is that you are what,
what are some traits of the epic,

1006
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:46,870
the epics deal with foundations of
cities and destruction of cities all the

1007
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:51,140
time, no matter what the city
may be. So he has destroyed,

1008
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:55,530
they said it goes back to uh, to
his own city to cleanse it. That's,

1009
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,870
which is Homer's way
of saying, I think, uh,

1010
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:04,430
you Greeks were so, so great when
you were out in the world that Troy,

1011
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:09,080
let us see how that heroic
ethos is going to help you,

1012
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:14,260
that you are back home where the probably
you are going to need more courage and

1013
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:16,100
more determination,
as much courage,

1014
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:20,080
at least as much determination
as you did have, uh, in,

1015
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:24,560
in that great celebration of the newly
found Greek unity, uh, in, in Asia,

1016
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:27,470
minor in, in, in Troy. So that's that.

1017
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,440
Now Dante takes that ntss no,

1018
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:35,770
there's no closure here because he
rejects the idea of Dante to the epic.

1019
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:40,130
He replaces the epic with a novel.

1020
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,340
This becomes a kind of novelistic story.

1021
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:48,540
Where is where we're in a experience
is being arrived at as one goes.

1022
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,990
You see what I'm saying? In the
epic, you have a kind of, uh,

1023
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:56,960
indeed things return to the poets of,
uh,

1024
01:09:57,170 --> 01:10:00,800
of departure. Uh, that's,
so that's the difference.

1025
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:05,330
It's a difference between two radically
different ways of understanding

1026
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:10,570
experience and the self down to
put himself on the open road.

1027
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:15,480
But you listen will remain
that constant reminder to him.

1028
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:19,670
He's the phantasm.
He can never quite exercise.

1029
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,520
It will return to him.
I said,

1030
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:26,500
when the siren appears and temps,
the pilgrim says,

1031
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,280
your look I made,
I gave happiness two uteruses.

1032
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:36,040
Why don't you stay with me?
And the implication is, first
of all, she's lying. Uh,

1033
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,350
because this is,
you know,

1034
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:42,400
the story of your is pouring the wax
in these years is a nice and omitted,

1035
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:43,671
but it's a way,

1036
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:48,671
a temptation to Dante to feel that
he too is an epic hero like Ulysses.

1037
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:55,130
Okay. Did I answer other questions?

1038
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:01,070
We'll come back to this
cancer, which is a truly, um,

1039
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:06,800
plays a crucial role in
Dante's imagination and in the,

1040
01:11:06,801 --> 01:11:10,910
in the divine communists, in the
unfolding of the divine comedy. So, uh,

1041
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,180
read carefully. Then we'll go on
to the other cantors. Thank you.
