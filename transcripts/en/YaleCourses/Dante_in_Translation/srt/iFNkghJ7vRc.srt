1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,620
We are going to try to
finish with in fair no today.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,140
And they would like to look at the
last 10 tolls,

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,730
30 31 32 may be a little bit 33 for sure.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,250
And this a couple of details in 34.
Um,

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,730
from one point of view,
um,

6
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,070
I'll be talking about Dantas
tragic mode at the bottom of hell.

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,370
This is,
I hope to,

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,520
to argue with you that I will
be arguing exactly. This is, uh,

9
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,200
uh,
a tragic representation.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,050
It as soon as I say that you might wonder,

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,890
you probably should
wonder, uh, uh, but the,

12
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:57,810
the difficulty of such an enterprise,
uh,

13
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,620
and the difficulty of the enterprise as
to do first of all with the fact that

14
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:05,170
this is a comedy,
so that difficult,

15
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:08,010
it should go away in the sense that,
um,

16
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:12,330
the tragic is really part,
not an end,

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,050
not a final vision,

18
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:20,550
but part of a larger discourse that Dante,
we'll,

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,370
we'll go into,
which is a comical idea.

20
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,980
He really has this idea of a comical,

21
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,490
comical vision of a or ear
of the divinity. Uh, and,

22
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:36,330
and certainly of the cosmos comical in
the sense that it's really the feast,

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,050
the Feast of, uh, of, uh, uh,

24
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,470
in classical times will be the
feast of the Gods. Here is the,

25
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,130
the redemptive happy,

26
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,600
harmonious sense of it or the whole,
that's one of the difficulties.

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,840
The other difficulty, uh, about this, uh,

28
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,810
mode of, uh, the tragic, uh, is that the,

29
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,270
the, um, within the
Christian vision that Dante,

30
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,920
uh, that sort of shaped Dante's poem, uh,

31
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,430
it's very difficult to locate
the tragic, uh, there is no,

32
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,360
that you think is, Eh, Eh,

33
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,020
a Christian tragedy though one might say,

34
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:25,350
and that will say here
just to sort of of, uh, uh,

35
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,460
give you a sense of how a new ads that
you should maybe is that within that

36
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:33,040
vision, within that Christian Vision, uh,

37
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,100
we are always told that the only thing
we know of God's presence in history is

38
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:45,510
the crucifixion,
is the story of the dying God,

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,640
all of the story of the suffering of
the divinity itself. It is not the,

40
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:52,020
once again a final vision.

41
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:57,021
So there is a theological problem that
he has to confront and there is also an

42
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,160
aesthetic problem, a larger
aesthetic problem. Um,

43
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,200
so to really clarify this issue rather
than just telling you all this comes from,

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,310
I will,

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,310
I will look at this scandals from one
point to view the point of view of Dante's

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,860
uh, writing a particular texts,
the texts about language.

47
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,320
So it's really going to
be about language and,

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,420
and tragedy in the belief that this
is exactly Dante's insight about what,

49
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,070
what the tragic maybe.

50
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,460
So let me tell you have to go a little
bit outside of the text for a while.

51
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:35,461
So when I point out details here
that we'll talk about another texts,

52
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:40,050
you will see what I mean. You
know, this is a sort of a,

53
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:42,790
a also a little bit of a
recapitulation for you.

54
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,690
You know that Dante
goes into exile in 1302.

55
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,050
By the time he had written only one book
after biographical book that had he,

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,580
the data Nuova they, the new life
that I had, he written only that book.

57
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:02,320
He would still be known as one of
the great poets of the Middle Ages,

58
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,260
but he would not really be
known for more than that.

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,060
It's a little bit of a self enclosure
and lyrical poem, a self enclosed.

60
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:12,550
It's about as you recall,
um,

61
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,970
a kind of a sense of the self is absolute
that love is an absolute itself does

62
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:25,381
not allow for the intrusion of anything
within its own orbit and its perimeter

63
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,530
and Dante finishes,
finishes or finish. It all,

64
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,230
finishes it off with a vision,

65
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,880
realizing that has to do other
things in order to go on writing.

66
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,510
He just doesn't write much at that point.
He may be writing some songs.

67
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,750
He is involved in political life in the
footsteps of his teacher Brunetto Latini

68
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,190
are and hoping that his life would really
be very different for Brunette Latina.

69
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,540
Ironically it is not because
actually it's even more tragic.

70
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,960
The brunette [inaudible] 13
it is politically involved
in the history of of of

71
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,123
Florence.

72
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,220
He will experience exile but he will
return to Florence enough to even go on

73
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:14,920
teaching. Dante are here at has
written and [inaudible] Texas,

74
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:18,940
like Trasar has written
allegories autobiographical
allegories about his life.

75
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,730
Dante,
we're going to end in 1302.

76
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,720
And the first thing that he writes is
a treatise on language, which you know,

77
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,450
which is called as on the Volga tongue.

78
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,200
It's a text that written from
the perspective of exile.

79
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,950
Very much like the divine comedy
because as a repeat Dante,

80
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,950
we'll never go back to Florence.
The reasons why he writes this kind of,

81
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:44,350
uh, of, of, of, of texts,
it's written in Latin. Uh,

82
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,680
the reasons are very unclear also
because he never finishes it.

83
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm going to suggest to you that there
are good reasons why he could never

84
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:55,720
finish it,
but he wrote two books.

85
00:05:55,721 --> 00:06:00,440
We don't even know how many he conceived
of a writing. What is this text about?

86
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:03,280
So let me give you a
little bit of, uh, of, of,

87
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:08,050
of a summary of the text and then
you'll see how it will go on. Um, um,

88
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,170
reappearing in, uh, in, uh,
in Dante's a poem and the,

89
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,160
the, the final cantors of, of
infant. We're in effect. He rewrites.

90
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,450
He writes and gives a whole essence
of the wholeness of the stacks and the

91
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,960
difficulties of,
and he will share with us,

92
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,800
he sends with difficulties why that
tract could never have been finished.

93
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:34,250
At any rate, it starts, it's called
the devil. Got It. Real quick answers.

94
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,020
It deals with the, uh, the
origin of the Volga tongues.

95
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,850
He starts very much like a
medieval treatises. Start with,

96
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,200
uh, from metaphysical standpoint,
from the very high. Uh,

97
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:52,310
where does human language do?
Is Language something absolutely human?

98
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,980
And the answer that he
gives is yes and no.

99
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,050
It is human because we are the only one,
the only ones who do speak though he, he,

100
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,120
he makes room for animals
also occasionally speaking
in the human voice, uh,

101
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:08,090
and being understood by human
beings making sounds that are there.

102
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:09,440
And he's not talking about parrots,

103
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,350
he's talking about miraculous
biblical scenes. Uh,

104
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,150
but he started saying the angels do not
speak. They don't use the language we do.

105
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,560
They communicate. Lucifer,
for instance, he communicates,

106
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:26,561
but he communicates with the other angels
or with God intuitively as a kind of,

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,370
so there is a reality that escapes
the human, the human language,

108
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:34,970
the language that we use. There are some
things happening that we do not have.

109
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,020
And then the language is that it's only
human and yet it's not human because

110
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,080
it's actually a gift.
We couldn't really make it on our own.

111
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,290
It's really God's gift.
This is the metaphysical premise.

112
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,900
Who was the first one of
the first people to speak?

113
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,590
It goes on Adam and eve
in the garden of Eden.

114
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,030
That's biblical enough.
I think it's fairly clear what it was.

115
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:58,580
The first language that they spoke Hebrew,

116
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,730
Hebrew is acknowledged as the primal
language and he will leave and go home so

117
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:08,810
far as to say that he brought
his never read, extinguished by,

118
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:12,130
for instance,
either the fall of man,

119
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,960
mankind or are by the building
of the Tower of Babel.

120
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,640
And the whole question of Nimrod, here's
a whole story about who this Nimrod is.

121
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,300
The famous biblical giant
who built a tower of Babel,

122
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,910
uh, and with a, an act
which he even he Dante.

123
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,230
But this is very much like the traditional
Var, the so called patristic writings.

124
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,500
We'll see as the counter to
the descent of the word know,

125
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,940
the redemptive event of the word made
flesh is really the counter to this human

126
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,630
efforts,
uh,

127
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,900
this ascent in pride of Nimrod to try
to bridge the gap between Earth and

128
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,710
heaven. And this an effort to
that fails. So he would go on,

129
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,680
acknowledge him here,
Hebrew, but I must say, uh,

130
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,190
normally he says that it
survives the story of Nimrod.

131
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,820
He says it has never really disappeared.
He takes,

132
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,640
and I'm only qualifying it,
what did we would call a, an a,

133
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,140
an a historical viewpoint.
You know, he does he own,

134
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,530
it was almost as if
Hebrew is accepted from,

135
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,740
does not belong to the flow of history
and the reality of the mutations that

136
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:29,280
twitch,
all things,

137
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,300
oh sub lunar things are
prone and are vulnerable.

138
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,370
Hebrew is accepted from it. I stress
this fact because I'm going to go metal.

139
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:43,260
This maybe toward the end of the term
when we're going to read a parodies or 26

140
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:48,030
where Dante meets Adam and they
are blatantly, he changes his mind.

141
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,390
It is as if something has intervened
in between the writing of that,

142
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:55,200
that we've got an awkward answer and then
counter with Adam. When Adam says, look,

143
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,210
uh,

144
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,210
the Hebrew language I spoke
completely vanished as soon as I have,

145
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,340
uh, the, the, the fruit of the
forbidden fruit of the tree.

146
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,550
So the Antigo zones or there's no trace
of the original injury this to say in

147
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:11,390
paradise,

148
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,990
Dante ready to historicize the
question of a human language.

149
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,640
Okay, but not in this tree. This is a
liberal gathered organs. He goes on, um,

150
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,410
uh, describing, uh, uh, ah, the, the,

151
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:30,720
the, the, the descent of the word.
So it's a theology of language.

152
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,640
And then book one ends and he moves
on to book two and then book to Dan.

153
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,020
He gives a completely different context,
a different direction in the street.

154
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,200
He starts talking not about
the grammar of language,

155
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,400
where we could call the grammar of
language. There is to say the ordering.

156
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,670
How this language was ordered. That's
what I mean by grammar. Of course,

157
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:53,790
it's a word that explains letters,
correct users of things,

158
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,810
but also the ordering
of a surgery reality.

159
00:10:56,811 --> 00:11:01,811
He talks now about rhetoric and he
becomes almost a theorist of poetry and

160
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:06,460
style, poetry and style. He
goes on explaining a four.

161
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,470
Nc goes on wondering what are the
three styles of writing poetry and the,

162
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:13,320
you know, because I have
been mentioning some of them,

163
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,800
you may recall the high style,
the median style,

164
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,130
the middle style and the low star.
This style of comedy,

165
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,190
the style of tragedy and the
style of the allergy, the,

166
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,070
the middle style of giant style.
Uh,

167
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,160
and he even suggests that style should
never really be thought of as a pure

168
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:35,820
ornamentation as some of us.
Maybe we do what we think about side.

169
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,800
So and so has style.
You know,

170
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,720
we all remember the phrase that the style
is the man, right? The character. Uh, uh,

171
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,920
but sometimes we say,
well,

172
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,010
that guy writes with style building that
is Breo he has a particular gift in uh,

173
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,830
uh, in, in putting, uh, putting
together words and sentences.

174
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,160
But then fissile two implies that style
is really a mode of knowledge in the

175
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:03,340
measure in which he says that there's
a high style for high reality and the

176
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:07,960
middle style for the middle reality,
the mixed world, the Ela Jaya world,

177
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,500
and then a low style for the comical.
Well he did.

178
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,280
He says that if you do want to understand
those who are far below the fisherman

179
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,790
for instance,
or a the clowns,

180
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,500
you cannot really give them the,
treat them with the APP,

181
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,380
that the whole room with
which you treat the kings.

182
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,940
So king speak differently with sublime
kind of language. You see what I'm saying?

183
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,110
So there is an idea that style
becomes an instrument of knowledge.

184
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,700
He goes on describing,
uh, um, uh, uh, the,

185
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,040
the, the theory of, um, uh,
of the song, which is the,

186
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,160
the greatest, uh, the greatest
point, a critical form.

187
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:52,540
And it's the song because he said we were
bringing out the music of the language,

188
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,930
the music,
uh,

189
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,090
Dante's responding is a little historical
detail is responding to a poetic

190
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:02,320
revolution that had taken place within,
in Sicily at the core to Frederick.

191
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:06,520
The second those, prior to that time,
the province are poets would be writing,

192
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,180
composing poetry and would, uh, uh,

193
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,180
company their songs with
dilute the famous, uh,

194
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,010
province supports instrument.
The Sicilians had divided those two modes.

195
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,020
It was possible to write poetry,
yeah.

196
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,430
In and of itself without the accompaniment
of music in the persuasion that the r

197
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:29,431
two poetry was the effort to bring out
the inherent harmony of the language.

198
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,870
It talks to, discusses the
song. He discusses the themes,

199
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:38,170
what are the great themes and poetry,
and alluded to that with Beltron.

200
00:13:38,171 --> 00:13:42,520
They're born because Dante says a bit on
the bone was the greatest in writing a

201
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,740
war poetry. Uh, the other themes.

202
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:49,260
So of course our rectitude
rectitude of the wheel, uh,

203
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,980
there is to say a sense of the ethical,

204
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,420
what are the ethical directions that one
should take the direction of rectitude

205
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:58,840
or really have the same,
the same etymology, the,

206
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:03,370
and then also love poems.
So this is the way he,

207
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,330
he proceeds, um, r and d
defines poetry by the way.

208
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,310
He ends with a great definition of poetry.

209
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,410
The poetry is that art
that combines, uh, uh,

210
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,720
music, uh, uh, the art of music, uh,

211
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,620
and rhetoric together. And he
ends there. Um, it's unfinished.

212
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,800
I don't, we'll go on writing other
things. So it's for instance,

213
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:30,460
a philosophical texts. They bad ethics,
which he also will leave and finished.

214
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,790
And then we'll go on writing the
political texts, the Monarchia,

215
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,270
et Cetera when she finishes.
Uh,

216
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,340
so this is the preamble to where
we are going to talk about today.

217
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,630
Uh, and I think that the best
way to begin is to tell you,

218
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,500
since I'll be told me it's mainly
about tragedy and language.

219
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,740
I didn't want to tell you how much
Dante retrieves over the devil.

220
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,860
Got It. Opens. Yeah. For instance,

221
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,520
and I'm not going to be be giving
you a lot of details, but some,

222
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:05,440
so that you can be persuaded
about about this, uh,

223
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,640
that this is really a deliberate pattern.

224
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,640
This is a deliberate retrospective
view that he takes of his past,

225
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,290
of a failure, of his own,
of a certain way of, uh,

226
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,010
why does one fair,

227
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,070
what is so an accomplishable
about a particular task that,

228
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,640
uh, I'm using the words that Nimrod
uses for his own tower of Babel,

229
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,670
since you know that it was an,
uh,

230
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,780
I realize that it was an unaccomplishable
task and I find myself using those

231
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:39,800
words for Dantes earlier effort
in writing on the Volcker time,

232
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,840
but some, some, some connections
between that treaties and, uh,

233
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,900
and, and, and this lower the cantos of
lower hair we've had, we've had the web,

234
00:15:49,901 --> 00:15:50,630
by the way,
I haven't,

235
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,330
we haven't talked about that and talk
about this other cancers of the lower we

236
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,920
are in the general radio fraud.
You'd remember that, right? Uh,

237
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:02,540
we saw violence now than we saw fraud.
But if you're, if you recall, Ken to 11,

238
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,250
where the map of the ethical map
of inferno who had been given,

239
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,430
none distinguishes between the sense
of fraud and the sense of treachery,

240
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,650
treachery subdivision of fraud,
because fraud can be, uh, reiterations,

241
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,680
falsify, or in general, uh, uh, flatters,

242
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:28,430
et cetera. These are the treasury is a
worse and that that's where we are now.

243
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,340
We're in the Rome of
treasury and treasuries.

244
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,670
The treacherous sinners are those we
engage in a deceptive violation of the

245
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:41,570
trust others place in us.

246
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:44,600
This is not necessarily
true for fraudulent people.

247
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:48,410
There's a project those we will can
perpetrate a fraud or new without even

248
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:51,380
knowing you or without even
having anything to do with you.

249
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,800
That question of treachery is different
and implies a violation of what Dante

250
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:58,830
calls the,

251
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:03,831
the ratio of the bonds of
love because implies friends,

252
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:08,360
family, country hosts. I
think the, for instance,

253
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,830
but Beth would be home to this type of,

254
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:15,140
this the tragedy that will belong
to this type of ethical judgment.

255
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,020
I said the Eurasia of the
bonds of love and nature. Uh,

256
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,740
it is as if, as if, uh, the,
the, the treasurer's sinners,

257
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,461
I really,

258
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:30,461
those who are in betraying the
really betray nature itself,

259
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,540
it is as if, uh, something is being
said about the day or night late,

260
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,880
all possible, uh, ties within a
community within the self and others.

261
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,170
Treachery is, uh, the,
the, the language of, uh,

262
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,790
nothing. Uh, it's a way
of saying that matters,

263
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,890
but no bond. There's no bond that I
can, uh, I could feel an attachment to.

264
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,721
So it's a,

265
00:17:56,721 --> 00:18:01,721
it's literally a severing of cells in
the domain of a pure arbitrariness.

266
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:09,810
I mean, this, I am above
everything or I'm below everything.

267
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,730
It doesn't matter, but I certainly have
no attachments to anything around me.

268
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,330
So that's where we are. This is so much
to say where we are in the context,

269
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,250
but the connections with the,
they will carry liquids. Yeah.

270
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,880
I think that even the story of Ulysses
can be read in the light of the,

271
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,150
the got it. Okay. And so because
it's a story of a tragic, uh, style,

272
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,130
Dante had been describing the
tragic style and, and uh, uh,

273
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,500
the tragic style. And the failure
of the tragic style, even the Canto,

274
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,610
the successive can't have, we do the
Montefeltro could be because it's, it's,

275
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,240
it's literally the,
the counterpoint,

276
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,010
the rhetorical counterpoint to
Ulysses is a story of it. The comical,

277
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,170
the comical style.
Uh,

278
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,220
certainly Bertrand the Bourne is a
figure who for the first time and now the

279
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:58,770
second time appears in the devil.

280
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,610
Quincy and Dante has a great
admiration for Burton, the newborns,

281
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,660
a poetic heart. He says the
Italians don't have, uh,

282
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,000
the language of the porch of war,

283
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,590
but the one who has a portrait war
in modernity is Beltron the board.

284
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,270
Clearly Dante has changed his opinion
here. Uh, oh, he may admire Bertrand,

285
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:21,060
they're born, but the dif, the strife,

286
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,160
the divisiveness that his
poetry fosters now sort of has,

287
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,030
has made a victim, uh, of a, of him,

288
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,870
but the were pound writes a
great poem about Ezra pound,

289
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,670
about puppets on the bone,

290
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,840
but really keeping in mind more the bit
of the bone or the devil a requirements

291
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,180
here. Then, then the best from the
board as far as I can tell of, uh,

292
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,130
of in fairness. And we come
to 10 to 29, uh, which is, uh,

293
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,110
which I looked at that a little bit,

294
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,580
but we'll come to Ken to theory for
instance, and then painters deliberately.

295
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,890
Now on the face of it,
very little.

296
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,720
There is very little here that has to
do with it. They will get eloquence.

297
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,130
But here he's talking about two
experiences that define the tragic bode.

298
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,290
One is look at this.

299
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:16,291
So in the time being from Ken two 30 in
the time when Juno was enraged because

300
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,170
of similar, uh, the,

301
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,580
the mistress of Jupiter
against the feeble blood,

302
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,840
as she showed once in the game
after mass turned so insane, he's,

303
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,940
he's really talking about the
tragic text that divide, uh,

304
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,610
the child where the gods
themselves within the world,

305
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:40,611
the classical world that gods themselves
into have been said to be wounded by

306
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:46,131
exactly the same mad passions that
drive human beings to destruction.

307
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:52,240
Yeah. This is Juno. Juno doesn't
really die, but she will, she will,

308
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,160
uh, she suffers the same passions. So
there's a language here of the tragic,

309
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,420
and let's call it the
myth of boy, I can, I,

310
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,660
it's a kind of a classical
theology being tied to weather.

311
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,170
And then the story of the
Trojans once again and feet,

312
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,780
no fury of Thebes or Troy was Evan.

313
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:14,150
So cruel against any et cetera.

314
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,680
And then even further, um, on,

315
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:22,490
on Canto 30 line 40,
the story of mirror, uh,

316
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,200
the young woman, um, who,
uh, it's, it's, it's,

317
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,370
it's a classical story. So it's
also, it's an obedient story.

318
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:33,950
The woman who is inflamed by passion,
uh,

319
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,220
incestuous passion, uh, and, and,

320
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:42,221
and impersonate somebody else in order
to be able to sleep with her are her

321
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:46,680
father. So there is, this is
a part of all, uh, uh, or,

322
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,110
or over all this, this, uh, uh,

323
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,890
tragic comic, call it
tragic perimeter, but it,

324
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,880
everything focuses on
this story of sign on.

325
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,470
I think I like this idea of sign on
who is an impersonator in the falsify.

326
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,160
You know,

327
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,750
you don't really have to know a lot of
Italian to know the dentist is really

328
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:12,610
planning on the name. See
none, which means yes and no,

329
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,241
uh,

330
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:18,241
the very representation of the
falsifications suffocation of personality,

331
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,870
but it's so the tragic is tied
to some sense of identity, uh,

332
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,960
people who do not know exactly,

333
00:22:25,961 --> 00:22:30,961
and that's impersonation a human beings
who may not know who they are and who

334
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:36,091
may take on some kind of either figuration
or the reality of somebody else.

335
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:40,020
So it's, it's this idea of, uh, of, of,

336
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,290
of an ambiguity already betrayed by,
by the name.

337
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,970
So the connection between madness and
tragic. And let me move on to Canto,

338
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,220
uh, 31, um,

339
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,620
where Dante enters and
now meets the giants,

340
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,990
uh, clearly figuration and them an echo
of the devil. Guardiola Quincy. This,

341
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:05,770
uh, uh, and one of them is Nimrod.

342
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,760
So this is really a deliberate reflection.
Let me just read a little bit of, uh,

343
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,620
this, uh, uh,

344
00:23:11,621 --> 00:23:15,940
online sixth and following
where he Dante here, uh,

345
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,710
some kind of sounds and
every commentator of yours,

346
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,740
mine certainly does, will
tell you that, uh, uh,

347
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,180
Dante's using just a, some gibberish,
nobody knows what it means.

348
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,790
These are the words or fair.

349
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,060
My Amex Zombie army began the savage
mouth to cry for which no sweeter psalms,

350
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,500
where am I leader towards him?

351
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,180
It's stupid soul.
Keep today Horn and vent myself with them.

352
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,750
And with that,
uh,

353
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:55,751
when rage or other passion takes the
search at Dinette bewilders hole and Asha

354
00:23:55,761 --> 00:24:00,440
find the strap that holds it tight,
see how it lies across the great,

355
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,970
they're great chest. Then he said
to me, he is his own accuser.

356
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,950
This is Nimrod through who's
wicked device. The world is not,

357
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,290
or one soul speech.

358
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,520
Let us leave him there
and not talk in vain.

359
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,260
For every language is to
him is his two others,

360
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,520
which is known to none.
We made our way,

361
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:29,480
therefore farther on turning
left and found the next,

362
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:33,400
they're both sharp of savagery and larger,
et cetera.

363
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,150
He meets a number of other giants.
Um,

364
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,390
why does Dante,
first of all mentioned giants?

365
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,820
Both of the devil got quilts in here.

366
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,820
What is really what is really the point
of level Gordillo Quinn's. Yeah. Uh,

367
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,560
there is a way in which the little
better it liquids is written from the

368
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:56,561
viewpoint of Nimrod's because what Dante
wants to do something exactly like what

369
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,810
Nimrod attempted neighborhood wanted
to combine all the possible languages.

370
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,220
That's what Baybou the confusion
of the tongues comes about,

371
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,890
was to combine,
uh,

372
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,770
to build the tower whereby
human beings can reach heaven.

373
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,690
And I said that it's really the
other side of the incarnational word,

374
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,550
the word that joins a heaven and
earth one is one of the scent.

375
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,790
The other one is the pride
of a sense that Nimrod once,

376
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:34,040
this is the giant ish.
This is,

377
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,800
it's his is a sin of
sin. It's, it's a trait.

378
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,800
It's a trait of his,
of knowing things.

379
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,220
He wants to occupy a kind
of superior perspective.

380
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,500
That's what is being a giant means,

381
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,950
a superior perspective from which he
can really see the whole of the world

382
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:03,590
around him and then be able to
transcend the world of contingency.

383
00:26:03,591 --> 00:26:07,820
This is the problem
with, with, with Nimrod,

384
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,890
this is what the Tower of Babel is about.

385
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,940
And the theological answer is
that you don't do this by pride.

386
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,620
You really ought to do it by, uh,
humility. Not but time to go up,

387
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,820
but it buy, Eh, going down.
What I'm really also saying,

388
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:26,540
and we could talk about this, there's a
connection between pride and perspective.

389
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,360
Uh,
so they even get an acquaintance.

390
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:33,200
He's also a text of perspective is,

391
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,290
do you know what I mean by perspective?
Is What do we have Red Sofa perspective,

392
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,500
we simply means the presence of
viewpoints, various viewpoints,

393
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,590
which ones I'm help managers spoke
control. I know all viewpoints in Tampa.

394
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,660
This is the case. They were the, the,
the whole, when Ferran was written,

395
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,730
the perspective on styles.

396
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,490
Dante uses all possible styles that have
been exemplifying for you here as we

397
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:04,080
discuss the poem he wrote where he uses
the core three language and the cultural

398
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:07,830
rhetoric. Oh, Francesca, the,
the other court, the court,

399
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,890
the legal court of peer peer
delivering are the core to the,

400
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,640
let's say the schools
with Brunetto Latini. Uh,

401
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,410
the language of the profits are,
he uses old perspectives. It's,

402
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:25,690
it's the whole, the whole of the
divine comedy is such a perspective, a,

403
00:27:25,691 --> 00:27:28,650
a perspective. His story.
Some of you might say, well,

404
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,790
you really are using a language that
doesn't belong to Dante's own culture.

405
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:37,140
There will be a very legitimate
objections because when we talk about

406
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:37,840
perspective,

407
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,790
we usually think about this is really
that evolutionary language of 15th century

408
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:46,650
art. You May, some of you
may be art historians, you
know, you may know that, um,

409
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,460
though I could respond to you that
actually there was a certain knowledge of

410
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:54,900
perspective of prospective
earlier than Dante. Nonetheless,

411
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:57,510
even if they did not have
a theory of perspective,

412
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,010
which I'll explain in a moment, they
had the practice of perspective in art,

413
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,330
we usually speak of perspective in art
and we usually link it with, for instance,

414
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:10,920
a figure such as a Alberti.

415
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,300
You know,
you know who he is,

416
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,570
this 15th century theorist of art who
wrote a treatise called on painting,

417
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,330
right?

418
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:23,330
1436 where he Altium literally theorizes
that which other painters from job talk

419
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,400
Dantes friend Dantes,
they were together in,

420
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:34,080
in Padua for years. We're done. That
was in exile and, and, and, and,

421
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,260
and Giotto was painting in the
Scrovegni Chapel right there.

422
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:40,170
So you could imagine they would
be meeting, they knew each other,

423
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,920
they were contemporaries. One is
a year younger than the other. Uh,

424
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,260
Dante is a year older and
George <UNK>. Uh, so they,

425
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,600
there was a practice or perspective
what is perspective for, for,

426
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,940
for uh,
Alberti.

427
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,970
It simply means the discovery that the
mode of representation practiced in the

428
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,730
Middle Ages really lacked depth,
not only that,

429
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,760
like depth and that somehow they believe
that the world of appearance and the

430
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:13,280
world of reality coincide.

431
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:18,281
It perspective means that the world that
I see shifts changes according to the

432
00:29:19,111 --> 00:29:23,880
position that I, the spectator
occupy in the field of vision.

433
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,430
I'm here and they're going to
show you that I see things,

434
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:31,170
I use it in their cannot see and vice
versa. You see things that I cannot see.

435
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,650
So the perception of reality changes
according to the position we occupy.

436
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,450
That's perspective.
Not only that,

437
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,480
it also implies the possibility
of manipulation of the
space that we witnessed.

438
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,460
We see this particular space. We can
change it according to our, uh, uh,

439
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,190
this according to the
blows of, uh, of, of um,

440
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,150
uh, the eyes, the position of the
eye according to the hour of the day.

441
00:29:58,151 --> 00:30:00,340
I see things which are always different.

442
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:05,410
So this is perspective and therefore
the language of renaissance, uh,

443
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:08,920
there's a called Quattrocento
the 15th century changes,

444
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:13,420
the whole medieval idea of representation
where things were represented,

445
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:17,440
the way they appeared and
they say that's not true.

446
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,260
We are never going to give the
sense of the reality of things,

447
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,550
but the appearance of things. So that's,
that's really the great the difference.

448
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,150
Dante uses this perspectivism,

449
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,720
which I repeat really means a way of
assembling various points of view in the

450
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:35,500
persuasion that this
is what really he has.

451
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,050
He's in exile and 13,
oh two,

452
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:43,410
he has been traveling all over Italy and
he thinks that he can go on forging the

453
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:49,120
language, the vernacular language
of Italy. He will go on. I mean,

454
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,770
just to go back to say other things
about the devil guided acquaints.

455
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,540
I didn't say he would go on
writing about the proximity of the,

456
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,900
the romance languages.
He invents this idea of romance languages.

457
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,780
He says that the way in
which French province,

458
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:04,810
our Spanish Italian
are connected together.

459
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,530
He says it's one particle
the way we use the sea. Uh,

460
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,420
or will he talks about the province are
the, you know, the uh, his uh, his uh, uh,

461
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,960
they actually caused the
say yes. They say arc. Uh,

462
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,500
which I guess is when the other, when
I had to make an affirmative statement.

463
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,160
So he goes on talking about the,
see the language of the c, the way,

464
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:25,090
the language of the,
no,

465
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:30,091
this is what the families of
languages are being built together.

466
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,240
So Nimrod to go back to the text,

467
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:39,570
the story of Nimrod and the story of
Dante seems to be strangely that it costs,

468
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:42,950
what is more, look at what
he does. He, she is so the,

469
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,910
the link with the devil kind of
requests are just extraordinary.

470
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:49,960
Even this line that everybody thinks
it doesn't mean anything. Rafael,

471
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,850
my yard Mech, Zombie army.
If you look at it carefully,

472
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,580
really going to tell you something,

473
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,450
it is an imperfect,

474
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:06,570
there's one letter anagram or the Hebrew
line from the psalms in the reference

475
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:11,320
to suite of psalms.

476
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:16,410
Next will tell you that this
Dante's really giving me the source,

477
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,190
the lion and the psalm.
Psalm 22 is Ellie,

478
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,650
Ellie Lama Sabachthani.

479
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,390
The fact that there is
no exact respondents only
means that the editors have

480
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:30,160
missed the point that they
should amend the text.

481
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,850
So it would be an argument for
textual emendation would like,

482
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:37,210
that's something that the philologists
are very careful about doing,

483
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:41,030
but they always welcome possibilities.
This is really, it's an amazing,

484
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:46,031
so he's choosing Hebrew there because
that's what he had said in the devil.

485
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,080
Got It. Laquinta Hebrew
though this is an inverter,

486
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:52,520
twisted language by the
builder of the Tower of Babel,

487
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,630
we are not supposed to understand
it and yet behind all confusion,

488
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,580
there is still something intelligible.

489
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:03,230
That's the argument behind all
twisted appearances of things. There,

490
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:07,880
there is a residue of intellect,
of intelligent,

491
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,230
intelligible,
uh,

492
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:13,990
unintelligible message that
is going to be given, uh, the,

493
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,990
the what is, what are these
words by the way, Ellie, Ellie,

494
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:19,300
lamaze or back then it
was, I, I, I can go in,

495
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,480
right pass it very quickly in the
belief that everybody will know.

496
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:28,800
These are the words, psalm 22, the,

497
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,950
they're the words that
Jesus on the cross sites,

498
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:38,420
father, father, why have you forsaken me?

499
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,720
It's really big tragic moment or the
moment of the crucifixion where the sun

500
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:48,881
feels or is completely abandoned and
that somehow the whole divine pray,

501
00:33:50,101 --> 00:33:54,740
the whole divine, uh, older is
no longer responsive to him.

502
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,600
It's really the moment of the
theological despair that we call it.

503
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,670
Okay. And pantry. So that's now, uh,

504
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,470
and that he is aware that if Nimrod,
that's what he's done,

505
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,100
I think is telling member of obliquely,
had he not been so stupid,

506
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,310
he would have known by
using this kind of language,

507
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,390
the way in which it would have been
reaching heaven. You know, the, the,

508
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,360
the way to have it is the
way to go down into humility.

509
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:25,420
And up through the building of the Tower
of Babel and the confusion of tongues.

510
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,880
And then there is this whole argument
here, which I'm not going to go into work,

511
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,190
but the, the confusion, the
perceptual confusion perspective,

512
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,740
[inaudible] is a far away and he mistakes
the giants for towers reference to

513
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:44,540
this famous town. There's
still, if you go on the, on
the, on, on, on, on the highway,

514
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,310
uh, you can still see
Montera Joan. And that's,

515
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,320
that's what Dante we're went by and he
thinks that the giants have towers a

516
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,110
question of perspective because in
perspective, you learn that you see,

517
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,160
according to the distance of the,
the arrive from the object.

518
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,730
This is the basic mathematics,
the geometry,

519
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:09,470
that rouge and sustains the,
the theory of, uh, perspective.

520
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,450
Uh, and then, uh, uh,
it will continue, um,

521
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,390
with,
um,

522
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,230
and let me just go on to
a further case of, uh,

523
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,370
this, uh, this question of, uh,

524
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,510
of frustrated and I want to read
through in with some care 33, uh,

525
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,560
returned to Ken to 32 with more pursuing
this line of references to the devil

526
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:34,550
gather loquia answer. Look
at his head. I the heart.

527
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,910
It's the beginning of the text.

528
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,590
Would you like to read?

529
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:46,170
We read in from Canto 32 line one 12th

530
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,030
Oh, I'm impressed. I didn't
mean that. Uh, go ahead.

531
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,710
Kent from Canto 32 line one
to 12 in English one 12th

532
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,880
how do I the harsh grading rhymes that
would be fitting for the small hole on

533
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:07,750
like all the other rocks bear down.

534
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:13,030
I would impress out more completely the
staff with Mike but since I have not,

535
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,920
since I have not, it is not without
fear. I bring myself to speak,

536
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,930
which we describe the bottom of all the
universe is no enterprise to undertake

537
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:27,931
in sport or for a tongue that pride mama
or that and Babbo but may those ladies

538
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:34,360
aid my first who aided amnion to wall
and themes so that the telling may not be

539
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:39,100
diverse from the fast opiod and all
others misbegotten crowd who are in the

540
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:42,160
place.
It is hard to speak up better.

541
00:36:42,161 --> 00:36:44,590
Had you here been sheep or goats.

542
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,540
Thank you. Thank you. Okay here.

543
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:52,610
This is a beginning that in many ways
rehashes what last time I called the

544
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:59,000
ineffability, Topo should remember
at the beginning of Canto 28,

545
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,230
Dante there is talking about the sublime.

546
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,910
I Tova of Parotic,
uh,

547
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:11,980
I a vote of a inverted form of the
sublime a saw the horror of what he was

548
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:16,280
witnessing is such that he could not,

549
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,000
he could not know that he could
find the metaphors for it.

550
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:25,190
This is now the deployment
of a variant of that conceit.

551
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,010
And they can sit here. Is that
Dante's looking for a style? Yes.

552
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,860
Perspective. There must be a unique
style for this particular reality.

553
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,480
And he start, I cannot go on
using the language of familiarity.

554
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,640
I have to use the bat boy,

555
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,920
Mama the language of a child
because this is just there,

556
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,230
the treasurer souls who have betrayed
first of all family. So there is,

557
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,240
that is a sort of a tragic resonance
even at on that little motif.

558
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,910
This cannot be done in the
ordinary familiar language
of every day because this

559
00:37:57,911 --> 00:38:02,820
sinners have indeed betrayed
all of that. No. Uh,

560
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:08,010
I can probably be done at all because
I'm aware and how he could he not be in

561
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,370
this area of treachery and fraud,

562
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,360
that words and deeds do not
necessarily belong together.

563
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,260
I'm only paraphrasing the techs.
So, uh, a search for style,

564
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:23,090
which he understands as a form of
what is convenient, what is decorous,

565
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:25,610
where it's appropriate.
That's the metaphor he uses.

566
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,360
It's better if it were an argument of
little guard Eloquii answer the principle

567
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:34,190
of convention and convenient area in Latin
and the convenience with a particular

568
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:39,180
language over when one is dealing
with a particular reality. And,

569
00:38:39,181 --> 00:38:44,010
and, and, and the further problem of
what kind of style do I had is there,

570
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,640
is it, can I get, in order to
represent this kind of world,

571
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,390
he appeals to anthem and the
building of themes, once again,

572
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,510
this is a tragic story of
themes and the Blakely,

573
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:00,670
he's also appealing to something that
he himself has written since [inaudible]

574
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,880
is the poor to move stones,

575
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:09,040
but the power of his language
I aversion of, of, of Orpheus.

576
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,090
Who plicate tames the,

577
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,900
the savage beasts within the
heart within us. Uh, he's,

578
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:21,370
he's wants to be a kind of Ambien. The
fact is that he has written stony rhymes.

579
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,810
He has written, he's moving. It's a,

580
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:27,470
it's a sort of retrospective view
that he takes. He's, he's, he's,

581
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,490
he thinks that the only kind of a style
adequate to this reality is the style of

582
00:39:33,491 --> 00:39:34,930
the crazy poems.

583
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:40,410
They're presenting that crazy time of his
life for this lady of stone who change

584
00:39:41,021 --> 00:39:42,490
would change him into stone.

585
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,500
We an allusion to this appeared in the
Canto of the Medusa in Canto nine of in

586
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:53,890
fairness. So that that's
really, it begins with this,

587
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,900
the search for a particular style and uh,

588
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,620
uh, Dante, we'll go on, uh, uh,

589
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:07,750
through this, uh, uh, this,
this kind of, this, this whole,

590
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:12,810
whole world of further into the frozen
ice in us of health is not fire burning

591
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:19,610
fire. Uh, and now that's
how the Canto and,

592
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,490
and we start with the next candle.

593
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,330
We had already left
him a land line one 22,

594
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,630
when I saw two frozen too frozen in one
hole so that the one head was a hood to

595
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:37,210
the other.
And as bread is devoured for hunger.

596
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,100
So, you know, we're approaching the most,

597
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,940
to me, the most unbearable
scene of, of, of inferno,

598
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:50,200
that Canada cannibalization,
human being cannibalizing,

599
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,750
literally eating the other.

600
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:57,730
I know that some of you may have
your sense of your taste is,

601
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:59,200
can be different.
To me,

602
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:03,070
this is really the worst
possible representation.

603
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,260
Tragic representation here. The one
above satisfies teeth in the other,

604
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,670
at the place where the Brain
Jones, the nape, tedious node,

605
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,740
the temples of [inaudible] posts for rage,
justice he was doing with a score.

606
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,260
And the other parts,
oh,

607
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:25,261
thou who buys will be still a token
shows the hatred against him that he just

608
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,620
tell me that.
Cause I said on this agreement,

609
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:37,460
if thou his reason in dye
complaint against him,

610
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,780
I knowing who you are
and what his sin shall,

611
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:46,370
yet the required the in the,
um,

612
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:51,160
in the world evolve.
If this tongue I talk with being naught,

613
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,070
whether it,

614
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:57,070
so we're approaching a moment where
literally silence envelops or possible or

615
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:01,190
presentations,
there's something that nothing,

616
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,400
not old can be all too at the sayable
say something that escapes the Sayable,

617
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,020
Eh,
it's,

618
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:13,030
it's that boundary and that
boundary that Dante places us.

619
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,710
So, uh, this is, uh, you know where
it is. I have to read this, uh,

620
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,820
this exchange. I will read it in
and then we try to comment on it.

621
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:24,650
I wish you could have a
discussion about this.

622
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,920
This canto that sinner are
actually the Italian really begins.

623
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,700
Uh, that's the, the, the sentence
structure of the English wouldn't allow,

624
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:39,701
it begins with a mouth that occupies
the primary place in the line.

625
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,380
And Italian is Lubbock the mouth.
Some of the object is,

626
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,470
is, uh, uh, is, is primary
here in English, of course,

627
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,180
to the sinner lifted his
mouth from the savage meal,

628
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,540
wiping it on the hair of the head he had
wasted behind then began that will have

629
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,610
me renew desperate grief,

630
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:09,290
which even to think of already
rings my heart before I speak of it.

631
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,860
But if my words are to be seed to the
maybe fruit of infamy to the traitor,

632
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,920
I know that she'll see me
speak and weep together.

633
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,580
If we had time.

634
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,940
And I were to ask you whether this lines
remind you of anything in particular.

635
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,520
I'm sure some of you would
immediately jump and tell me.

636
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,650
These are clearly an echo of very good,

637
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,240
in fairness,
five Francesca's language.

638
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:47,350
The language of love has become now
the language of hatred because from the

639
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:52,190
point of view of arena,
and that's part of his tragedy.

640
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,410
He can't tell them apart.

641
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,360
He does not know what love
is and what hatred is.

642
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,410
And he can exchange one for the other.
And here we are.

643
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:08,890
You could even argue that retrospectively,
the language of love, Francesca,

644
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,320
maybe it was also the language of hatred,

645
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:16,010
but you would be pushing it beyond
the limits of, of bill livability.

646
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:20,070
I think that Dante is really,
uh, echoing that Francesca, uh,

647
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:24,980
and the love and the romance with
Paolo in order to explain this hatred.

648
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:25,760
And that's the,

649
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,110
the blindness of all
Golino and I use the word,

650
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,360
um, uh, deliberately. No, that's,

651
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,460
that isn't all what he lacks is any
perspective on himself and on the world at

652
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:43,310
island him. So, uh, it
then continues that are,

653
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,640
I ain't know, I know
know who that hard. No,

654
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,070
but what means that has come down here.

655
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:55,470
But indeed that seems to me
Florentine when I hear the,

656
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,550
the focus is on language language here,

657
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,790
which is a part of one
managing to first of all,

658
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,350
no the other and understand the other,

659
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,830
they may know the
inflections of the dialect,

660
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,000
the Florentine dialect and they may
even think that indeed and Dante's has

661
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:18,360
allowed to say that if we've got a real
quick idea about the question of uh,

662
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,800
the dialects and they in the,

663
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:23,340
in the instances that they
can communicate in effect,

664
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,910
there's no possible communication
between the two of them.

665
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,220
If I were to define for you the,

666
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:34,690
the rhetorical czar that Dante Diprose
here is that of what we call a dramatic

667
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,330
monologue.

668
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,900
Uber Reno goes on speaking and therefore
he expects nor does he get any response

669
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:48,330
from his interlocutor.
He's a parent.

670
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:53,190
Interlocutor a dramatic monologue when
he goes home telling us the story of his

671
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:54,780
life, the way he sees it. You know,

672
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:59,850
you all know 19th century dramatic
monologues in English literature, right?

673
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:04,290
If not mean that this is an
occurrence of that genre. I can speak.

674
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,273
I can tell you,

675
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:10,050
I can go on fictionalizing myself and I
believe that my perspective or the way I

676
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:13,920
fictionalized myself
will become your reality.

677
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:17,760
And Dante entices of course,
Uber Reno to do exactly that.

678
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,360
This cause this is exactly,
this is the way in which you are in hell,

679
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,430
where you go on really believing that
whatever you tell that you can go and

680
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:29,280
telling stories and the save yourself,

681
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,860
deceive yourself, that others are
going to believe what you were saying,

682
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:36,660
that you will.

683
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,520
The reality that you're going home and
constructing is everybody's accepted

684
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:42,151
reality.

685
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:47,151
This is one of the issues clearly that
we were going to confront thou art to

686
00:46:49,411 --> 00:46:52,250
know that I was counting to greener.

687
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:57,120
This is the archbishop for Jerry.
What an extraordinary line.

688
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,200
And what makes this
extraordinary is first of all,

689
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:05,010
the occurrence of what do
we call, attributes, titles.

690
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,370
And then the shift in verbal tense.
Who Will,

691
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,430
you know, we'll go on,
uh, attributing time.

692
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,790
I was con count to Galena and this is
there is to say the object of his say

693
00:47:21,031 --> 00:47:24,540
hatred is unalterable is timeless.

694
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:29,590
And that object of his hatred is
exactly what goes on. Defining him,

695
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,710
right? I time belongs to
me. I know that I belong,

696
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,620
I have a history, there is a history
behind me and there is, and this one here,

697
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:43,000
the re fied object to
my hatred is unchanging.

698
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,760
I should bishop [inaudible].
So there is that,

699
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,610
the secular and the sacred if you wish,

700
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:53,140
welds and Gib liens with the idea that uh,
or you know,

701
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:54,890
had really betrayed the side.

702
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,710
It was a world's becoming a Gerbil in a
given him became my wealth and so on. So,

703
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,820
uh, the, the,

704
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:05,821
the recapitulation of all the infernal
satanic since we have seen so far.

705
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,000
Uh, and then how bout
how by means of his evil?

706
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:15,700
I shall tell thee now why I
am such a neighbor to him.

707
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:21,190
What another extraordinary line
because it's, uh, uh, you know,

708
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:24,830
the idea of what a neighbor
is, right? Uh, and awkward,

709
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,590
but the neighborhood has become,
uh, this, this is the way,

710
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,713
uh,

711
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:36,040
neighbors can liberalizing are
cannibalizing one cannibalizing the other.

712
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:41,170
Um, um, hub. How by means
of his evil devices,

713
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:43,390
confiding him.
I was taken and then killed.

714
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,260
There is no need to tell pat
what thou canst not have learned.

715
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,880
That is how cool was my death or shall
hear and shall know if he's done me wrong.

716
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:57,280
And he tells the story that
he was a prisoner in a tower.

717
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,210
We are meant to and understand all the,

718
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,500
the languages of the other Towers Tower,

719
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,570
which isolates him as a tower in Piza.
But the way it's really the tower,

720
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:14,350
this is, has nothing to do with
this, but I find it irresistible.

721
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,870
If you read the Cantos of Ezra pound,

722
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,220
some of the most extraordinary
poetry of his, uh,

723
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:25,270
I think comes from when,
when he was declared the traitor.

724
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,530
Um, in, in the aftermath
of the Second World War,

725
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,870
he was put in a cage,

726
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,230
not too far from this tower of Pisa,

727
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,780
which is really one of
the most beautiful part.

728
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:40,460
It's near the school or
North Malin Piza and a,

729
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:44,380
and he writes his poetry
about the tower that he sees.

730
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:49,180
Clearly his own sense of
trying to understand what
treasury, uh, really means.

731
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,450
Um, and, and I,

732
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,910
what I'm really saying is
these are issues that keep

733
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,990
being present in the consciousness of,
of,

734
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,650
of some of the leading
imaginative figures of our time.

735
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,740
So he goes into this little, the, the, um,

736
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,250
the tower of the hunger as it is called,
and we'll shut up.

737
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,600
I had already shown me through it, slit
several moons when I had the bad dream,

738
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:21,050
which rent for me the veil of the
future. So we are dreams that, uh,

739
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:21,890
uh,

740
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:26,890
he has a dream and the mistake he makes
is to think that the dream is going to

741
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,420
be real.
And the dream is this.

742
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,190
This men appear to me as a master and
Lord hunting the wharf and the Welsh, uh,

743
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,700
the,
the world wealth comes from Wolf,

744
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:42,230
a wolf and Gibbons and the mountains for
which the pieces cannot see Luca with

745
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:46,310
hounds lien train the Nigga,
he had sent it Valon the,

746
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,250
it's sort of when I woke.
So he has this idea of,

747
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,870
of destruction, the mutual
destruction, so the wolf, et cetera.

748
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:55,580
When I worked before morning,

749
00:50:55,581 --> 00:51:00,530
I heard my children who were with me
crying in the sleep and asking for bread

750
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,330
that were cool indeed,

751
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:07,331
if the grievous not now thinking what my
heart for boded and if that will not at

752
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:09,610
what the style ever weep.

753
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:14,030
So they were not awake and are
they are now awake. And the,

754
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:18,200
our approach when a food used to be
brought to us and ditch was afraid because

755
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:22,580
of his dream and the herd below the
door of the horrible tower nailed up,

756
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:28,010
which I looked in the faces of my sons
with that as a word, I did not weep.

757
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,810
I saw turned to stone within.
They wept. And Motherwell.

758
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,950
Anselm said, by the way, uh,

759
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:38,330
to understand how there is a counter,

760
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:44,020
there's a sort of of of movement between
the horror of this tragedy and the

761
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:47,720
tenderness,
the pathos of it.

762
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,110
One of the ways in which dentists suggests
this is the use of diminutives for

763
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:55,350
and said Mucho.
Ah,

764
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,930
this a little kid that he has this
kid that Lucas so farther what?

765
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,830
Trustee at data shed? No tears.
No answer. The whole day. No.

766
00:52:03,831 --> 00:52:06,830
That night after till another
son came fourth in the world,

767
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:10,730
as soon as the little ray made its
way into the dough for prison and the

768
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:13,070
discerned in four phases of my own look,

769
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:18,550
I bet both hands for grief
and they thinking I did it
from a desire to eat rose

770
00:52:20,481 --> 00:52:23,660
up suddenly and said,
father,

771
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:29,410
it would be far less paid for us if
that eat of us thou the disclosures with

772
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:34,970
this wretched fresh
and our strip us of it.

773
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,060
I calm myself then not to make them more
unhappy that day in the next we stayed

774
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:43,580
or silent are hard.
Earth what is done not open.

775
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,860
When we had come to the fourth day,

776
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:50,450
God to throw himself out stretched
in my feed saying my father,

777
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,760
why does that now? No, I
don't think it's farfetched.

778
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,240
If I were to ask you two over here behind
this question of one of the children

779
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:10,780
exactly the neck of the prayer of Jesus
on the cross that we heard a few that we

780
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:13,820
read a few canters back.

781
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:19,120
So there is a way in which the violence
inflicted on Galina's children seems to

782
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:26,111
repeat or reenact the great
drama of the Christian sacrifice.

783
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:33,450
Right.
Cause he are now on are also crucified.

784
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:36,870
In fact there he died
and the store sees me.

785
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:42,020
I so the three drop one by one during
the fifth day in the six therefore I gave

786
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:46,710
myself now blind. That's what it is.
The lack of perspective is he's nothing.

787
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,390
He did a four has no
distance from anything? No.

788
00:53:50,391 --> 00:53:54,000
Can he tell things are
part of distinguish things,

789
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:59,001
one from the other two grouping over each
and for two days called on them after

790
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:00,300
they were dead.

791
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,660
Then fasting had more power than griefs
and extraordinarily ambiguous line

792
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:12,980
because you really do not know what
he's saying according to a role there.

793
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:17,610
For instance,
we'll go around making a statue of this.

794
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:22,611
They said the at the Moma and you can
go and see that the story is that of a,

795
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,190
that reno 80 his own church.

796
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,230
Then fasting had more power than grief.

797
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,860
I yielded to the
appetizer the urging of a,

798
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:37,410
of hunger more than grief.

799
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,290
Or maybe he's saying just something else.

800
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,620
Maybe he saying then fast and
had more power than grief.

801
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,790
I really died of fasting for
hunger rather than for the grief.

802
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:49,163
We don't know.

803
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:54,620
And I think that part of the charge it
bode that Dante is starting to conveys to

804
00:54:55,171 --> 00:55:00,171
us is that we are left and this is by
the way a board has a reading book,

805
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:05,850
has rights, nine uh,
lectures on Dante. What else?

806
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:10,710
Realizing the importance or number nine
for the antis nine lectures on that.

807
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:15,711
And one of them is on the story of who
Reno and he says he actually wants us to

808
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,770
live.

809
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:21,770
He wants to leave us in suspension to
believe that it's possible that he may

810
00:55:21,991 --> 00:55:23,070
have been eating the children,

811
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:28,120
but maybe it's just the sensibility of
so many critics have been offended by the

812
00:55:28,121 --> 00:55:32,970
suggestion that he actually could go
on a candy, buys him his own children.

813
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:38,370
And I think that book is is right that
we are not supposed to be able to tell

814
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:43,371
apart that that ambiguity of that
line is never going to be quite uh,

815
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,740
resolved.
It's going to be forever there,

816
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:51,770
but the most important element of
this tragic occurrence and the Dante,

817
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:57,040
before I go on, let me just say a rps or
Dante goes on into an apostrophe gaze.

818
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,750
Piza again with this
language of now he's talks,

819
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,640
he breaks the silence ips,

820
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:07,970
shame of the peoples of the fair land
where sounds the C and other little touch

821
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:11,510
of another little echo of the day,
we'll gather,

822
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:16,290
equate this to say in the moment
where he's dealing with treasury,

823
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:21,770
which I call the most nihilistic of all
sins because you really declared no and

824
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,950
any bond that you may
have with others he uses.

825
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,230
And that the irony is to me,

826
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,120
glaring the affirmative particle is
if there's any possible affirmation,

827
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,100
there is none.
We're sounds this,

828
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:39,990
see since they neighbors are
slow to punish the makeup, right?

829
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,900
Django Gona shift and put
a bottle of Nando's mouth,

830
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,750
so the drown every soul in thee.

831
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,310
This is really the kind of language that
all reno himself at youth when before

832
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,230
the consummation of the tragedy,

833
00:56:53,231 --> 00:56:58,060
he really begs the the earth or an
earthquake that the earth may open up and

834
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:02,380
swallow or all of them here.
Dante's using the exactly the same land.

835
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,580
The idea that's so horrifying is
the spectacle that he has been.

836
00:57:06,581 --> 00:57:10,360
The tragic spectacle has been
witnessing that the whole world here.

837
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:13,240
That could be an apocalyptic
ending to the work.

838
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,050
But to go back to the
the, the, the key issue,

839
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:20,350
there may not be time for a
discussion today and I apologize,

840
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:25,810
but the real tragic event though,
what is the tragic event other than,

841
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:30,130
okay, what if we go, Leno had the
name of betraying the strongholds.

842
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,540
Thou should not have put his
children to such torment.

843
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,280
So this has been the crucifixion
of innocence, their youthful years,

844
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:44,170
thou new Thebes besides the new themes
and new three by we have been witnessing

845
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:49,171
now made them innocent or drone and
regard and the other tool named already in

846
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:53,650
my song,
this is really the tragic,

847
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,420
Dan has been using other tragic language
indeed that he had been hoping and

848
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:01,480
theorizing in the Devil Valley
rockets and then they move on.

849
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,040
But what is the really tragic occurrence,

850
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:09,010
the tragic occurrences in the very
presence of the Christological language in

851
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:09,844
this camp.

852
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:15,540
Because the sacrifice of the cross
means one thing and one thing only

853
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:23,870
that now all violence is finished and
something because we have found the,

854
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,420
the, the scape goat, the voluntary
scape goat who goes around saying, oh,

855
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:32,130
we're all innocent and
that he is the guilty one.

856
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:36,480
That's how we are declared. That's how we
are redeemed. That's why we are, we are,

857
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,930
we are made innocent once again,
right?

858
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,640
But this story here,

859
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:49,010
reenacting and echoing the story of the
cross seems to say the futility since to

860
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:52,330
announce that utilities,

861
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:57,340
that sacrifice retrospectively says that
that sacrifice too was just one of the

862
00:58:59,301 --> 00:59:04,301
senseless act of violence that has
happened that have happened in history and

863
00:59:05,091 --> 00:59:08,030
the punctuate human history.
Of course,

864
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,130
this is not the end of the poem,

865
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:15,910
but it's the most desperate part of the
poem because Dante comes to believe that

866
00:59:16,191 --> 00:59:20,150
the hole that they, the
law of, of, of, of history,

867
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:25,130
that the law of the is really a tragic
claw and there's something absolute about

868
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:27,380
it and not,
and not quite escapable.

869
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,290
We shall see how he's
going to move through this.

870
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:35,210
And I really have to go into
cantillatory for, um, so a little bit,

871
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:39,710
I would not say too much this time. Can
two, three, four, we're Dante meets Satan.

872
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,160
So the encounter with Satan is first
of all that which gives incredible

873
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:48,350
coherence to the whole movement of
in federal. It was, as you remember,

874
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:53,420
the story of inferno began
with the neutral ingroups.
Those who had been sitting,

875
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:58,220
uh, watching the spectacle of
the disruption of the customers,

876
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:03,450
the neutral angels at the time of
the, uh, Lucifer's rebellion of, of,

877
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,080
against God.
And now it ends with Lucifer.

878
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:09,230
So it's really as a kind of angelic,

879
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,160
a cosmic proportion.

880
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,200
The other thing that I have to say is
that if you imagine those of you who are

881
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:19,490
readers of Milton and paradise lost,
if you,

882
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:23,540
and you know how what a
brilliant rhetorician, uh,

883
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,800
Satan Lucifer is in, uh,
in, in paradise lost,

884
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:32,300
you'll be disappointed. In fact, the
Tsl and who writes a comment about this,

885
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,313
as I said,
he says,

886
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:37,670
I really recommend the first time readers
of the divine comedy to skip Canto 34.

887
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,890
Because it's strange that
Lucifer Satan doesn't speak,

888
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:47,060
and that was exactly the point
that I'm sorry to say TSL.

889
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,920
It at this time really had probably has
never read that they will get it look

890
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:55,460
answer then re he's not supposed to
speak because it's one of the angels who

891
01:00:55,461 --> 01:00:57,020
really do not use the human language,

892
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:01,400
but more importantly
because he represents evil,

893
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,570
defeat defeated from this
point of view. Can Two, three,

894
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:09,800
four stands in radical
sharp contrast to canter,

895
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:12,310
33 in Cantata retreat.
We sort,

896
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,960
we have witnessed the sovereignty of evil.

897
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:20,260
It is as if it were all in golfing
and hovering over all of reality here.

898
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,850
Now we witness exactly the opposite,

899
01:01:22,851 --> 01:01:27,851
how Satan becomes a rarefied dumb object
and actually an instrument for the

900
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:31,430
pilgrims are sent.

901
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:36,640
It's going through the body of Lucifer
that the pilgrim can go on and the guide

902
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:42,380
and Virgil can turn themselves upside
down and finally reemerge to the light.

903
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,470
The rest of the canto good. I think
that we're going to have a few minutes,

904
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:47,330
but I have to say something
about the rest of the cancer.

905
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:52,690
The rest of the canned who deals with
the cosmological argument and the

906
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:55,760
cosmological argument is,
uh,

907
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,550
where does purgatory come from?
And Dante gives an extraordinary events,

908
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:06,350
a poetic myth and the poetic meter
he events is that when Lucifer Fair

909
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:12,680
at the time of the grant are
angelic disruption, right?

910
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:16,880
The first rebellion against,
uh, against the deity,

911
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:22,180
the earth retreats out of fear
at the approaching of this a,

912
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:27,240
this, a fallen angel and re-emerges
on the other side of the hemisphere,

913
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:30,540
the southern hemisphere.
That's the beginning of purgatory.

914
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:33,690
But you see the connection
from an evil act,

915
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,420
the chances of redemption,

916
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,180
how in effect in Dante's cosmos,

917
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,290
there is nothing which cannot be utilized,
no evil,

918
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:47,500
which can not be utilized
to the ends of the gut. Uh,

919
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:52,120
everything they're real defeat of evil
is when that itself can become the

920
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:56,820
stepping stone over the threshold
of evil itself in order to reach the

921
01:02:56,821 --> 01:02:58,500
purgatorial island.

922
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,330
The last little detail that I will tell
you is I asked you to read the last line

923
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:07,620
of Canto through you like
this. It's a little detail
that you're like, I hope, uh,

924
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,660
uh, the last line of, uh,
of, of [inaudible], uh, is
a, a queen. Do she, Maria,

925
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:17,100
let's Lasalle Italian and therefore
we came out to see once again,

926
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:21,730
the stars. Just a little detail to, uh,

927
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,780
remind you about the extraordinary
love of symmetry in Dante's porn,

928
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:32,340
right? That each canticle
we'll end with that same word,

929
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,400
Stella, Stella, stars, Stars and stars.

930
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:40,650
There is to say each canticle
ends with us looking up,

931
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:46,430
reminding us of where we are and still
longing for the stars so I can come to a

932
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:52,140
little in a hurry.
I have reached the end of the,

933
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:56,670
of inferno purgatory now and
then see if there are questions.

934
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,190
Yes.

935
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:09,420
Can you say a little bit more about

936
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,420
almost like a,

937
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,550
a total perspective through his
construction of the various languages from

938
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:24,360
seeing different forms of Italian
and trying to get an all encompassing

939
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,194
perspective.

940
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:30,830
The question is, can I say more?
Good question and the question is,

941
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:35,510
can I say more about how Dante is
trying to construct our users total

942
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:40,150
perspectives and you mean
both in the end here?

943
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:42,260
Yes. Thank you. Because in effect,

944
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:46,470
I was hoping someone would ask me
this question because I really didn't,

945
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:50,270
did not tell you how
this the devil got it.

946
01:04:50,271 --> 01:04:55,271
Acquaints is completed here and
why couldn't Dante complete?

947
01:04:55,490 --> 01:05:00,200
They will carry liquids here. When he
wrote a tract, when he wrote a tract,

948
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:03,690
he wanted to unify,
you know,

949
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:08,600
he believed that they are the dialects,
14 dialects in Italian.

950
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,650
He had knowledge,
he recognizes 14 directs,

951
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:16,870
he knew some of them very well
and he wanted to make a eh,

952
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,670
a unified language.

953
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:23,970
Out of that it kind of artificial
language assault of let's call Italian

954
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,450
experimental,
you know,

955
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,560
something that you could bring
together and what he was lacking.

956
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:33,670
So much so that they are those scholars
who work on who have been working,

957
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:38,560
I don't agree with that is that
almost Dante seem to have a kind of,

958
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:43,360
um, seem to be in agreement
with uh, uh, the so called, um,

959
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:48,310
um, uh, uh, logicians
those who have, uh, uh,

960
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:52,710
kind of, uh, the, the, the idea
that language has assault of a,

961
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:57,190
let's say a Cartesian linguistics
as a kind of, uh, of rational,

962
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:00,640
a rational structure to it
and that can be really remade.

963
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:04,960
The point is that when he writes to the
level, got it. [inaudible] this is true.

964
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:09,350
I don't buy the idea that he's
following the logicians of the, the,

965
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,940
the Middle Ages.
They are Marion's we're really legit ones.

966
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:17,550
But he did it lacked was a historical
sense and the little detail that he brew

967
01:06:18,591 --> 01:06:23,591
was still the surviving language from
the creation of man to our own time

968
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,900
because, and he had a good theological
argument for that because it would be

969
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:33,901
inconceivable that the redeemer of the
world would use a language other than the

970
01:06:34,151 --> 01:06:37,480
language that had been employed by,
by Adam.

971
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:40,840
When he comes to Paradise,
the divine comedy,

972
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:44,840
he completely changes view in Paradiso.
26 says, I'm going to tell you that.

973
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:47,870
He says, no, no. He
builds, appeared with, uh,

974
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,950
immediately after Adam fell with
the fall of Adam from the garden.

975
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:53,260
There was no longer the primal language.

976
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:58,360
And he goes on elaborating the idea
that God does not use any language,

977
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:02,290
but the language of this is to say human
beings have the letters and syllables

978
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:07,000
of God's language. It's not Hebrew.
It's not Latin. It's not Greek.

979
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:11,480
It's not whatever, uh, slow
Chinese. It's that really the, uh,

980
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,880
we are the syllables. That's
Dante's idea. Policies of 20, 26.

981
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,990
So this was the, that's the, the,
the, the real change. What had,

982
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:24,220
what does it mean in terms of divide
of the of the inferno is that he had

983
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:28,300
understood that in order to
write about a unified language,

984
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:29,830
he had to descend.

985
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:35,490
Now he could not go on the tower and
from their watch or the the the qualities

986
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,600
aesthetic.
What is the sweet,

987
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,960
what is the Worldcom language and what
is the less welcome, the harsh language.

988
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:48,640
What are the sounds that he really should
be applying and adopt in two Italian,

989
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,880
but he didn't understand that in
order to have a unified language,

990
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:56,620
you have to descend into the political
realities of the, of, of this cities.

991
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,540
That's why,
that's the difference between the,

992
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:02,400
they will get an acquaintance
and the lower in fairness,

993
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,680
a sense of history.
That's really the difference.

994
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,160
And to see this and
the sense of different,

995
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,550
and you can be in a tower as who
greeneries and be blind or you can be in a

996
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:16,970
tower like Nimrod is and do not even
what you're talking about. You know,

997
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:19,490
who didn't go on completely reversing,

998
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:24,140
messing up and confusing the Hebrew
that he, he should have known.

999
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,200
You understand what I'm saying? So that's
really the difference between the two.

1000
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,440
Good question was that it allowed me to
focus on a detail that I probably didn't

1001
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:35,060
explain. Very, very cool.

1002
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:38,460
I don't understand how
he could have said that.

1003
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,320
Died the fall.

1004
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:46,010
You're on, said why? I don't
understand how Dante could,

1005
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:50,690
could make that statement. Is that what
you're saying? He said, yeah, that's,

1006
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:55,960
uh, I don't think that there are
any traces of Adam's language. Uh,

1007
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,350
the,
the,

1008
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:02,350
the question is why it's a sort of a
predicament and I don't know if it,

1009
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,920
uh, he, he says he doesn't
quite understand the why,

1010
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:11,150
how Dante could say that Hebrew
died with the fall of man.

1011
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:16,380
Um, uh, that's what he, Adam will
tell him. He, there, he meets,

1012
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:20,960
had them, there is another port because
he's the one who names the world.

1013
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,250
Where did the scripture,
the scripture nor in Hebrew

1014
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:31,790
scriptures or you know, uh, the language
of Jesus for instances, Aramaic,

1015
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:37,820
we have to be careful about what
kind of, uh, uh, the kind of, uh,

1016
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:42,220
uh, is that Adam's language or is
that the language? Is the language,

1017
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:45,470
the changes in time, that's all.
That's all he's really saying.

1018
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,450
That the new testament that in Aramaic
for instance, which is a dialect.

1019
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,860
Yes. So, so this, this goes

1020
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:59,360
back a little bit to the, uh,
to the last lecture, but, um,

1021
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,670
looking back over the entirety of,
of inferno,

1022
01:10:02,671 --> 01:10:07,580
it seems like Dante expresses
different levels of, of I guess, uh,

1023
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:11,410
sympathy or pity for the
people who are trapped in, in,

1024
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:15,750
in certain circles of hell,
especially for the sellers of discord.

1025
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:20,340
And then later in, in other cases,
like at the end of the 10 to 33,

1026
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:25,080
he's happy to be a churl to someone
who's on being, being tormented.

1027
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:28,300
Oh yes.
What's up?

1028
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:33,670
And, um, I, I just, it's, it's
interesting though, the, um,

1029
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:39,240
the really the different relationship
that, um, that Dante has, uh,

1030
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,710
to the different reactions.
He has these punishments,

1031
01:10:41,711 --> 01:10:44,960
given that he's essentially
created all of them, that, that,

1032
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:49,630
that in front of is supposed to be
a representation of divine justice,

1033
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:52,020
but it teams like overall. Dot. Hayes,

1034
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:55,420
the judge and executioner here.

1035
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:57,550
Given that the whole,

1036
01:10:57,551 --> 01:11:01,630
how sincere leaders does
Dante believe in this?

1037
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,590
In this divide.

1038
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:07,430
I think he's in this,
in the divide between himself as as this,

1039
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,920
right?
Or who can feel pity for the different,

1040
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:14,700
for the people trapped in
different areas of how vs. Dot.

1041
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:19,470
Hay as as sort of the, the, I mean in some
sense he's the creator of all of this.

1042
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,190
It was just sign everyone
to each level of how,

1043
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,280
I know this is a broad thing,
but I,

1044
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,980
I kind of wanted to see some,
some comment on on that. Dubai,

1045
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,880
how sincerely used to submission to him.

1046
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:38,820
The question is,
since Dante is a Dante,

1047
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,840
the pilgrim has different responses
to the figures whom he has created.

1048
01:11:45,171 --> 01:11:49,160
Sometimes he's tender and sympathetic,
sometimes he just kicks them.

1049
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,020
As far as that's the scene.
You are referring to a and
they're all his creations.

1050
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:58,370
How sincere is he in his vision? Um, okay.

1051
01:11:58,371 --> 01:12:02,240
This one's is that I would formulate
it a little bit differently,

1052
01:12:02,241 --> 01:12:04,130
but you know that that's fine.
Yeah.

1053
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:09,220
We agreed that Dante has is not the
indifferent spectator to all of them and

1054
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:15,650
nothing that what matters to him most
is to show a degree of passionate

1055
01:12:15,651 --> 01:12:18,590
involvement with whoever they may be.

1056
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:23,740
He's not going to be sentimentalize
about all of them are for a number of

1057
01:12:23,871 --> 01:12:26,900
reasons. It's very sentimental
with his teacher. Uh,

1058
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:31,640
I think he's really very sarcastic with
peer. The Levenia whom you remember,

1059
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:36,641
he marks that language of is the
contrived the I thought he thought.

1060
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,300
I thought that's not Dante's language.

1061
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:42,200
That's really because they're living
his own poetry that Dante picking up.

1062
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,190
I think that he is very,
he has a sense of pathos.

1063
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:50,170
It may be is also seduced
by Francesca Francesca.

1064
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:55,040
You can put this pastor that she is
trying to seduce him as well as she said,

1065
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:59,930
users or let's powerless and use
said use when it comes further down,

1066
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:05,150
the, the, the relationship is
no longer a relationship of, uh,

1067
01:13:05,151 --> 01:13:09,950
of, uh, this tenderness of
forms. Now there is really anger,

1068
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:15,670
anger at what an extraordinary
horror or what human beings can do.

1069
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:19,010
And there's not nothing
Dante calls the fraud.

1070
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:22,640
They seem peculiar to
men that human beings,

1071
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:26,720
they seem peculiar to human
beings because they are,

1072
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:31,780
they have a reason that becomes
part of their premeditation,

1073
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:34,640
part of their machinations of evil.

1074
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,960
And I find that that, uh, uh,

1075
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:42,020
uh,
repulsion he has,

1076
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:47,000
I find that I'm very dramatically
speaking, very convincing,

1077
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,670
very convincing.
Uh,

1078
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:54,080
it's still part of the judgments that
he's making and it's not an attenuation at

1079
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:57,210
all of that judgment.
The,

1080
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,950
the anger with which attacks Piza that,

1081
01:13:59,951 --> 01:14:02,270
that idea that he speaks
prophetically there.

1082
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:07,340
Why is this whole place disappearing?
This is, I think that to me is,

1083
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:09,650
you say it's sincere.
I wouldn't be using that language,

1084
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,100
but I think that it's dramatically
very powerful. Uh, and that'll roof.

1085
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:18,400
Who would agree that, that probably
the best way of referring to this term,

1086
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:23,020
to the, the th two. Describe
the, this, uh, this situation.

1087
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:26,680
Would you agree?
I find it,

1088
01:14:26,681 --> 01:14:30,490
I find it dramatically very apt.
It's a,

1089
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:35,710
because it's a consequence of
the genuine horror. You imagine.

1090
01:14:35,711 --> 01:14:37,300
I mean,
you had the earlier,

1091
01:14:37,301 --> 01:14:41,230
even diviners with a shape,

1092
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:45,880
a human shape twisted the
head turns around. Uh, uh,

1093
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:49,690
then, uh, uh, the alchemists, uh, uh,

1094
01:14:49,691 --> 01:14:52,570
also representing the
kind of twisted forms.

1095
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:57,460
It's this twisting of the human image,
uh,

1096
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,320
and this and the reality of what
human beings can do. Uh, an ongoing,

1097
01:15:02,321 --> 01:15:04,660
and this says hatred has taken over.

1098
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,630
I think that is approaching them too.

1099
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:13,140
There is a way in which I was saying he
echoes w w [inaudible] when Orino says,

1100
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:17,530
you know,
on earth,

1101
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:21,940
why then was there an earthquake
and which would swallow everything.

1102
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:25,930
I mean the, the, the language of
the Itar, the cannibal, so to speak.

1103
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:30,820
And then Dante just says on why
is there some, some kind of great,

1104
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:33,140
uh, uh, uh,

1105
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,350
drowning of all this wire on the
islands just moving and just,

1106
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:42,670
and be a barrier so that the
whole town will go under.

1107
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:47,290
I think that there is a way in which
he's almost doing the same thing.

1108
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:52,320
So that's it almost a reenacting the
kind of a sense of nothingness that

1109
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,430
[inaudible] had shown to him.

1110
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:04,560
But obviously he does not
agree with two Golino and no,

1111
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:08,770
it's not that there is a
kind of a complete, uh,

1112
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,570
identification with them.

1113
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:13,420
And how do we know that this
is not going to be the case?

1114
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:16,130
He's writing reasons.

1115
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:21,690
The poem is what rescues Dante from
yielding to the temptation of absolute

1116
01:16:22,961 --> 01:16:26,650
despair and therefore distinguishes him.

1117
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:31,930
It distinguishes own temporary impulse
for nihilism with the nihilism that

1118
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,210
distinguishes, characterizes
all the centers and the Volvo,

1119
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,580
the treasurers souls.
Okay,

1120
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,580
but maybe we should stop here.

1121
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,710
We're going to talk about something so
much more serene purgatory next time.
