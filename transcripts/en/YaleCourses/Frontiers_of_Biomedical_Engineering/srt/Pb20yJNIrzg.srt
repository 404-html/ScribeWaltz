1
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,510
So what I'm going to talk about,
uh,

2
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,650
today and Thursday is, uh, two topics,

3
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,860
which what I hope to do is sort of bring
together some of the information that

4
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:27,090
we've been talking about over the
course of the term. And to do that,

5
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:29,730
I want to focus on two areas today,

6
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:34,320
talk about cancer and a big subject.

7
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,210
And so we'll just scratch the surface.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,170
But the main point that I want to make
is how some of the technologies that

9
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,690
we've been talking about
over the course of the term,

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,950
or having an impact on cancer,
a diagnosis and care,

11
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,860
and to sort of point to
some areas that were,

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,280
where they'll likely be more progress
and opportunities for progress in the

13
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:57,000
future. And then on Thursday
we'll do the same thing,

14
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:01,500
but talking about the subject
of artificial organs and
one that we've brushed on

15
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,690
a couple of times through the semester.

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,790
But just try to try to spend some
focus time, uh, on it, on, um, on,

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,530
uh, Thursday section meeting
on a Thursday afternoon.

18
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,640
Uh, we'll do a course review.
So I'll be there for each, uh,

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,140
for each of the sections.

20
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,590
And I'll just be leading a
discussion about what we've
covered in the course and,

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,900
and uh, what kinds of things
will be a on the final. Okay.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,040
Any questions?

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:32,870
Okay.

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,520
So, uh, you know, uh,

25
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,080
what's described here on this slide that
cancer is a deadly and unfortunately

26
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:41,720
not uncommon a disease.

27
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,590
And these are some statistics from 2006,
uh,

28
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:47,750
collected by the American cancer society.

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,080
And one of the things that we do fairly
well as a nation now is keep track of,

30
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,170
uh, of uh, cancer, uh, cases and progress.

31
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:02,171
And this has been an important part of
our learning about where cancers occur,

32
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,240
what are the causes and what
treatments work and what don't.

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,660
And the American cancer society has been
a big part of that effort to collect

34
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:13,460
information on where cancers
occur in the country, in what,

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,920
in what people and what age groups and to,

36
00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:20,900
and to provide that information for
people that are working on research for

37
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:23,900
cancer. So this just summarizes
some of that information.

38
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:27,080
For 2006 new cases of cancer,

39
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:31,160
you can see a million
over a million new cases,

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,270
deaths from cancer.
About,

41
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,570
about half a million and a roughly
equal between males and females.

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,610
And here's some common,
uh,

43
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,420
some common types of cancer occurring
in a female's of breast cancer in both

44
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:52,190
males and females, lung cancer and
you know, males only prostate cancer.

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,980
And so the statistics are alarming,
right?

46
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:57,860
If you look at the number of
deaths that are caused by cancer,

47
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:00,460
and if you want to
learn more sort of that,

48
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:03,880
I urge you to go to the American Cancer
Society website, which is listed here,

49
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,440
but just a few facts about cancer that
you probably know something about this.

50
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,610
It's now the most common cause of death
in the u s and that's true in many

51
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:16,840
developed countries.

52
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,020
Cancer and heart disease have been neck
and neck in terms of the number one

53
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:25,350
cause of deaths in developed
countries for many years now. And,

54
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,350
and it looks like a cancer is winning.
And we'll talk about that in a,

55
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,423
in a minute.

56
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,290
Cancers caused by new t mutations
in genes that control cell growth.

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,440
So you know that a cancer or formation
of a tumor is an unwanted or uncontrolled

58
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:43,910
growth of cells. Cell Division. Uh,

59
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,770
runs a muck and cells don't stop dividing
under circumstances where they're

60
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,604
supposed to.

61
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,790
And so you get a mass is formed in
that mass is it represents the unwanted

62
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,180
growth of cells,

63
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,950
the mutations that cause cancer
that caused these defects.

64
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:03,820
And cell growth can be either
inherited or environmental.

65
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,140
We know that there are things in
the environment that cause cancer.

66
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,500
Some viruses can cause cancers.
So the most,

67
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,030
one of the clearest links is
between a human papilloma virus,

68
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:17,750
a sexually transmitted disease and uh,

69
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,110
and cervical cancer in women.

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,300
And so there is a new vaccine
for HPV human papilloma virus,

71
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:30,301
and it's expected that this vaccine which
will prevent spread of the virus will

72
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:36,470
also significantly reduce cancer
cases. Um, other kinds of, uh,

73
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,220
viruses are linked to liver cancers.
For example,

74
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,200
sample chemicals can also, uh, in the
environment can also cause cancer.

75
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,280
And we'll talk more about
that in a minute. Uh,

76
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,160
but most cancers also involved
some, uh, some genetic, uh, changes,

77
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,050
uh, that can be either
acquired or inherited. And so,

78
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:59,740
you know,
also that a cancer can run in families,

79
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,580
the risk of certain kinds of cancers.
There's a genetic basis for that.

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,650
In the u s the lifetime risk of
cancer is one and two for men.

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,680
So half of men will have some kind of
a cancer and one in three for women.

82
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,220
And so that's pretty impressive.
A number.

83
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,630
Um, the age adjusted mortality rate for
cancer is about the same in the 21st

84
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:24,070
centuries.
It was 50 years ago.

85
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:28,680
That is the rate of death from cancer
hasn't changed very much in the last 50

86
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,190
years.
And this,

87
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:34,570
in spite of the fact that there's been
a lot of attention to cancer in learning

88
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:36,280
more about cancer and its causes,

89
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:40,420
the basic biology and in trying to
design new methods for diagnosing and

90
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,660
treating cancer, but overall
deaths haven't changed very much.

91
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:47,950
We've made progress in certain kinds
of tumors, uh, but, but not in others.

92
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,911
And this just,

93
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:53,911
I think reflects the fact that both
cancer is a heterogeneous disease.

94
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,800
You know, that it occurs in a
variety of sites throughout the body.

95
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,940
But in each of those sites, cancers can
be quite different. It's not one disease,

96
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,640
but it's a family of diseases. And
because of that, it's been hard to, uh,

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,120
to make progress in treatment because
all of them have slightly different

98
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,020
characteristics.

99
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,850
Yeah.

100
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,000
Uh, this just illustrates that
last point a little more clearly.

101
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,410
Changing US death rates by
cause from 1950 to 2003.

102
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,700
So over that period, deaths from
heart disease went down dramatically.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,250
Deaths from cerebrovascular diseases,

104
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:31,010
so deaths of the circulatory
system in the brain.

105
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,430
So this is mainly stroke and aneurysms
down dramatically deaths from infectious

106
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:39,890
diseases. We talked about
vaccines several weeks ago,

107
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,690
which has had a big impact on,
on mortality from infectious diseases.

108
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,880
Also down over that years, deaths from
cancer stays about the same. All right.

109
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,030
So, uh, so while we've
made great progress,

110
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:57,830
we're not yet at the point where we're
changing the outcomes from a cancer very

111
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:58,664
dramatically.

112
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,560
Okay.

113
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,050
I mentioned a few minutes ago that,
uh,

114
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,840
exposure to chemicals can cause
cancer and you know, this,

115
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:08,740
and one of the most well known,
uh,

116
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:13,230
exposures that's clearly a cause
of cancer is tobacco use. Uh,

117
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:18,090
so this is tobacco use, uh, mainly
thinking about cigarette smoking. Uh,

118
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:22,910
but, uh, the same thing could be true
of a, of any kind of tobacco use, uh,

119
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,920
smoking cigars or chewing tobacco also
causes cancer because the chemicals in a

120
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,410
cigarette smoke or in a
tobacco in particular, um, uh,

121
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:39,411
some of the tars that are associated with
a smoking cause cancer of the lung in

122
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:45,060
particular. And this was first noticed
by looking at epidemiological data.

123
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,290
We talked about public
health and epidemiology a few
weeks ago where you look at

124
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:53,520
how diseases appear in populations and
you try to figure out why things are

125
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,560
changing. Um, so here's,

126
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,790
as cigarettes were
consumed more in the US,

127
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,800
you can see the trend in cigarette
consumption going up over, um,

128
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,730
over a time from 1900 to 1950.

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,400
And then lagging behind that by
about a period of 30 years, uh,

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,370
is an a dramatic increase in lung cancer,
uh,

131
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,830
first among men and then among women.

132
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,670
And the reason for that is
because cigarette smoking
was initially more popular

133
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,460
among men than among women. Uh, but,

134
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,580
but advertising and the women's movement
changed that cigarette smoking became

135
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:33,450
something that everybody could do.

136
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:36,750
It was acceptable in polite
society for women to smoke.

137
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:40,080
And they were targeted by
manufacturers of cigarettes.

138
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,970
Special cigarettes were made for
women. Um, there's special in some way,

139
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:48,180
but not in their ability to cause cancer.
They're all the same.

140
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,950
And so female lung cancer still rise.

141
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:54,930
And you can see we've made some progress
in male lung cancer mainly by reducing

142
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:59,700
the number of smokers. Uh, but
that hasn't yet happened in uh,

143
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,020
in women.
So evidence first came from epidemiology,

144
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:08,310
but then after it was realized that there
was an association between cigarette

145
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,450
smoking and cancer,

146
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,140
then you can start to look more closely
and try to figure out what the molecular

147
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:14,070
cause of it is.

148
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,630
And we now know quite a lot about how
the chemicals in smoke caused these sorts

149
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:21,720
of malignant transformations
in cells that lead to cancer.

150
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,070
The evidence is pretty clear.

151
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,650
So the main point that exposure to
chemicals can cause, uh, cancer.

152
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,260
Uh, this, just to try to put in
perspective, uh, where cancer occurs,

153
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:39,180
what are the most frequent causes of
cancer that lead to death and in both men

154
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:42,720
and women? Lung cancer is
number one. After that,

155
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:47,670
it changes the top three and men being
lung, colon, and prostate in women,

156
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,210
lung,

157
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,210
breast and colon and accounting for just
those top three of the large majority

158
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:58,110
of cancers. Cancer of the
pancreas is much less common.

159
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,600
But because it's so difficult to detect,

160
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,110
and we'll talk about methods
of detection, uh, but um,

161
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,730
the pancreas is an organ
that's deep within your body
and it's hard to find when

162
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:10,360
things are going wrong with it.
Uh,

163
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,070
so because it's difficult to
detect cancer of the pancreas,

164
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,200
it very frequently leads to death.

165
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,920
And of course this is in the news now
because this is the kind of cancer that

166
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,150
Patrick Swayze has.

167
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,330
Life expectancy when you have a pancreatic
cancer is a life expectancy is very

168
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:30,270
low because it's usually an
advanced stage when it's discovered

169
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,270
cancer cells are different.

170
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,980
So what makes all these cancers
at different sites a similar is,

171
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,360
is the similar characteristics that
the cells that form cancers have.

172
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,960
And I mentioned already that one of the
things that characterizes cancer is that

173
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,990
cells divide abnormally.

174
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,060
They divide usually more rapidly.

175
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,080
We talked about several weeks ago when
we were talking about cell culture,

176
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,340
we talked about cells that you would
isolate from tissue and they would grow at

177
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:03,720
a rate of about by doubling their
number every day if you maintain them in

178
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:08,390
culture, cancer cells can grow much
faster than that. Uh, so they've,

179
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,600
they have mechanisms for,
for dividing very rapidly.

180
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,400
More importantly,

181
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:19,260
probably they don't stop proliferating
when they're supposed to write. You know,

182
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,670
from what we've talked about before,

183
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:24,930
that there are cells that are continually
dividing and reproducing within your

184
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:29,220
body cells in your intestinal tract.
For example, cells in the liver,

185
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,580
cells in the kidney continually
dividing cells in your skin,

186
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,350
but ordinarily your skin stays the
same size that it is because cells are

187
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:37,831
dividing.

188
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,820
But they know when to stop
and they stopped when they
reached the right density,

189
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,690
the right shape. They know where they're
supposed to be. Cancer cells don't.

190
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,890
They continue to divide even when they
get signals that they're supposed to stop

191
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:54,250
dividing. And so because
of this tumors form, right?

192
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,540
Abnormal growths,

193
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,180
the organ of origin a becomes
larger than it ordinarily would.

194
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,590
They generally don't respond to signals
that are provided by neighboring cells.

195
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,760
We talked about cell communication and
how important that was for the life of a

196
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:13,960
tissue that for your liver to be your
liver and your brain to be your brain.

197
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,820
They don't just have
the right cells there,

198
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,150
but they have cells that are communicating
in the right way and there's a loss

199
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:23,170
of that normal, uh, molecular
communication when you have cancer,

200
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,770
they don't differentiate normally
but tend to remain as immature.

201
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,370
Di differentiated are undifferentiated
cells. So what's this like?

202
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,650
This is like we talked about stem cells.

203
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,800
Stem cells are less mature
than, than uh, than uh,

204
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,290
differentiated tissue cells.
They grow rapidly.

205
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,550
Both stem cells,
which self renew and cancer cells,

206
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,000
they don't form mature types of cells.

207
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,740
And there's a lot of linkages now
known between stem cells and cancer.

208
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,630
And some people think that within any
individual tumor, there are cancer,

209
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:03,631
stem cells that really are the
most important ones to treat.

210
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,810
Because if you get rid of even the bulk
of cancer cells without getting rid of

211
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:10,690
these very few stem like cells in cancers,

212
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,850
tumors will regrow again.

213
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,050
So normal differentiation
like stem cells is, uh,

214
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,550
is a problem with cancer cells.

215
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,430
They don't adhere readily to other
cells and extra sailor matrix.

216
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:24,120
They do not become
specialized in dy. And, uh,

217
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,320
because cells in your skin are
continually going through not just birth,

218
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:31,300
not just growth of new cells,
but death.

219
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,430
There's skin cells that are dying and
being shed from your body all the time.

220
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,110
Cancer cells don't undergo those normal
processes of cell death that lead to

221
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,720
regulation of a tissue structure.

222
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,370
So if a cancer forms,

223
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:53,080
it tends to go through different
stages and that this cell, for example,

224
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:57,940
in this, um, in this, uh,
tissue is a premalignant cell.

225
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,410
If it becomes malignant, it we'll start
dividing and growing out of control.

226
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,690
And you can see that here,
that uh,

227
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,430
that tumor that forms at the initial site
or the site of the origin of a cancer

228
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,990
is called the primary tumor.
These tumors, if they grew,

229
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,210
um, would ordinarily stop at a
size of about one millimeter,
you know, very small,

230
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,580
you wouldn't even be able to notice them.

231
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,860
Maybe if they're only a
millimeter or so in size.

232
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,600
And they don't grow beyond that as a cell
mass because they can't get nutrients,

233
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,280
oxygen, glucose, the things that
the cell needs, amino acids,

234
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:37,120
the things that it needs in order to
produce new cells can't get in because

235
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:41,230
those are normally provided by the
bloodstream. And when the cells,

236
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,360
when a cell is just dividing out of
control, there's no blood supply, right?

237
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,850
So many people think that,
uh,

238
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,950
that tumor size would be limited.

239
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,690
Cancer wouldn't be such a problem
except for the fact that cancers at this

240
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:00,800
stage, as they moved from this
primary stage two invasive cancer,

241
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,580
they develop an ability to stimulate
the growth of blood vessels.

242
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,660
And so now you can see blood vessels
are growing into and through this tumor,

243
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,890
they develop their own blood supply and
they're able to get nutrients readily.

244
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,550
And this is when the growth of the
tumor really starts to take off.

245
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,230
So we'll talk about some therapies that
block this process of new tumor growth

246
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:22,520
called angiogenesis.

247
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,360
And many people think if you could block
that process selectively in tumors,

248
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,110
then you could halt all
tumors to a very small size.

249
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,530
That would not cause, uh, problems.

250
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,430
Okay.

251
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,180
A Sec.
Uh,

252
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,990
an additional stage after angiogenesis
that some tumors can go through is a

253
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:41,640
process called metastasis.

254
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,300
And that's where tumor cells actually
leave their site of origin and travel to

255
00:15:45,301 --> 00:15:49,230
other places in the body. And that's
shown schematically in this cartoon here,

256
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,630
a tumor cell entering the circulation,

257
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,910
it can flow through the circulation and
maybe get lodged at some distance site

258
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,350
and begin the process of tumor
formation at that distant site.

259
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,490
So this is obviously a bad thing,
uh,

260
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,480
because maybe you can treat the primary
tumor in a variety of different ways,

261
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,250
which we'll talk about in just a minute.

262
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,210
But once it begins to spread throughout
the body becomes much more difficult to

263
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:17,580
treat, right? You have not just one tumor,

264
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:21,690
but potentially hundreds or thousands of
tumors that are forming throughout the

265
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:22,524
body.

266
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,240
Okay.

267
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,240
So the treatment for tumors for cancer
depends very much on what stage it's at,

268
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:36,280
when it's identified.
And for every kind of cancer physicians,

269
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:41,281
oncologists have developed classification
methods for talking about to each

270
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:45,130
other about what stage the cancer is at.

271
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:49,660
And I'll just show you that in, um, in
an example of that in bladder cancer.

272
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,780
So you might have an initial stage here
which is called a t a and t is at the

273
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:59,470
tumor rating t for tumor.
So this is a,

274
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:02,590
this is a very small tumor that's
just confined to the lining.

275
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,090
When it gets larger, it's classified as
t one. When it gets up to stage t two,

276
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:11,770
it's starting to invade from the lining
of the bladder into the other tissues of

277
00:17:11,771 --> 00:17:14,260
the bladder.
T three t four.

278
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,020
By the time it's got the
stage [inaudible] it's,

279
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,620
it's occupying not only the
whole, uh, the whole, uh,

280
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,500
thickness of the wall of the bladder,

281
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,680
but it started to invade other tissues
like the prostate as well. All right.

282
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,170
And so you can see that if you have a
tumor that's at one of these early stages,

283
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,390
local therapy might work,

284
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,770
surgery or radiation or local
chemotherapy, which we'll talk about.

285
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,140
But as it begins to invade other organs,

286
00:17:41,141 --> 00:17:43,180
then it's becomes more difficult to treat.

287
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,473
Right?

288
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,820
And they can spread.
And I don't mean for you to,

289
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:51,090
tumors can spread and don't mean for
you to be able to see all this here.

290
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:55,410
But you can look at this.
These slides will be posted as a usual.

291
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,140
Not only can you classify the normal,

292
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,660
the the original site of the tumor,

293
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,190
and that's classifications of melanoma
from tee one up to t four and they're

294
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:09,990
defined here. But you can classify whether
it has spread locally to lymph nodes.

295
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,940
And that's these end stages here and
whether it has metastasized to different

296
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:15,690
sites.

297
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,690
And so ordinarily a physician
will classify a tumor
according to the tumor nodal

298
00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:22,044
involvement,

299
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,430
metastasis classification that's
appropriate for that kind of tumor.

300
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,420
And this allows physicians
to say exactly where your,

301
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,300
where your cancer is at in development.

302
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,250
And we know because we've been
treating cancer for a long time now,

303
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,810
you can select a treatment that's most
likely to work for the stage that it's at.

304
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,440
And so this all to say that diagnosing
specifically where a cancer is at in its

305
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:53,451
development within a patient is very
important for deciding what kind of a

306
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:56,820
treatment is likely to
lead to a good outcome.

307
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,330
So one of the things that biomedical
engineers have worked very diligently on

308
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:07,650
over the last 50 years or so is designing
new methods for cancer diagnosis.

309
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,830
And we've talked about some of these as
we've gone through the course and I just

310
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:11,940
want to highlight them here.

311
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,120
We talked about x rays and using x
ray radiation to look inside the body.

312
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:22,550
And mammography is a special kind of ray
imaging that's used to look just at the

313
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:28,200
breasts, uh, to see if there are
abnormal tissues within the breast.

314
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,650
And this shows a normal,
uh, Mami a mammogram.

315
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,940
And this shows an abnormal mammogram
with some kind of a dense deposit here

316
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,930
that's not normal.

317
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,720
And so mammography is used to
screen for breast cancer, um,

318
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,230
and it's a very important, uh, screen. And
now women when they reach a certain age,

319
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:51,231
are recommended to have mammography a
certain number of times per year or per

320
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,100
decade. Uh, just to try to
detect cancers at an early stage.

321
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,280
So this is an example of biomedical
engineering for diagnosis. Uh,

322
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,960
pap smears also done during
routine pelvic exams in women. Uh,

323
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,910
where a swab is used to remove some
cells from the cervical region.

324
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,210
And then you can look at these cells
under the microscope and here's what a

325
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,170
normal pap smear would look like.
You can see the sales are flat,

326
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,720
they have small nuclei, uh, not
a lot of protein. And so the, uh,

327
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,340
the, uh, sales don't stain very darkly,
uh, malignant cells. On the other hand,

328
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,510
cells that indicate there might be
cancer present have larger nuclei,

329
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:32,820
more intense staining,
abnormal shapes.

330
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,830
And so someone who looks at cells from
cervical pap smears all the time can

331
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:42,831
quickly tell if there's the danger that
there might be a tumor growing within a

332
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:45,060
patient who's had a smear like this.

333
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,240
Now this requires a visit to
office and a procedure. A,

334
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:53,590
wouldn't it be nice if there were blood
tests that you could do for cancer?

335
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:57,700
If all the technologies we talked about,
we talked about Eliza's for example,

336
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:01,420
in all the ways that we can look into the
blood to try to see what chemicals are

337
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:02,950
present there.
If you could,

338
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,480
if you could find chemical signatures of
cancer that could be detected in blood

339
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:11,260
or in urine or in some other fluid from
the body, that would be a great thing.

340
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,820
And unfortunately there are too many
examples of that yet we don't know how to

341
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:16,750
do that very well.

342
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,670
We do know for prostate cancer and for
certain other kinds of cancers, there's,

343
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,100
there are molecules that
you can detect in the blood.

344
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,720
In prostate cancer there's
a very particular molecule
called prostate specific

345
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:33,340
antigen PSA, which if the levels
of PSA rise in your blood,

346
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:36,820
that's a sign that there's something
going wrong in your prostate and you get a

347
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,800
more a thorough exam.

348
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,300
So blood tests are available but only
for certain kinds of cancers and they're

349
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,330
not widely available yet.
Although we would like for them to be.

350
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,280
So if you have a high, if you're a
male and you have an abnormally high,

351
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,430
a prostate specific antigen
level in your blood,

352
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:59,310
you might get a more thorough
examination and you might use an,

353
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,890
and your physician might use an
approach like ultrasound guided biopsy.

354
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,710
And here if you can see
in this diagram here,

355
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,840
this is a much less pleasant experience
than a blood test. Uh, but there's a,

356
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,700
um, there's a device that's
inserted through the rectum
up to close to where the

357
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:20,701
prostate is and this device has an
ultrasound probe on it so you can look by

358
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:24,460
ultrasound into the,
into this region of the body,

359
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,960
identify where the prostate is
and even where, uh, where, uh,

360
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:30,910
a growth on the prostate might be.

361
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,870
And then a needle comes out from this
device and takes a small sample of tissue

362
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,890
and this tissue is then taken to the
laboratory and looked at in the same way

363
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,870
that a pap smear might be looked at.

364
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:48,370
And we talked about using optical
microscopy or using optical instruments to

365
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:51,610
probe inside the body into
cavities that we can't see.

366
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,320
And there's lots of technology available
for this now, including a sigmoid,

367
00:22:56,321 --> 00:23:00,790
a scopes and colonoscopes,
which are fiber optic systems,

368
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,920
uh, that can be inserted into
the colon or, uh, and, and um,

369
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,070
and uh, can be, if
they're designed properly,

370
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,610
inserted very far up into the colon to
actually let you look through a lens at

371
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:17,140
what's happening on the
surface of the tissue.

372
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,320
And this has been a very important advance
in terms of identifying cancer of the

373
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,850
colon.
For example,

374
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,650
similar scopes are available to look in
the lung for a lung cancer and to look

375
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,530
in, um, in a variety of other, uh,

376
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,790
sites in the body to look for
cancer and other diseases. So, um,

377
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,890
so a lot of engineering technology has
been brought to bear on the problem of

378
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:44,620
diagnosing cancer and
diagnosing cancer early.

379
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,690
What do you do with a cancer
is, uh, is present? Well, the,

380
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,450
arguably the oldest form of
cancer therapy is surgery. Um,

381
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,040
and surgery is used for biopsy to
take small samples to see if a growth,

382
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:05,190
for example, is abnormal. If you have
an abnormal growth on your skin, the uh,

383
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,630
a surgeon might cut off some of that
tissue and send it to a laboratory for

384
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:13,130
analysis and, uh, to find
out if it's a cancer or not.

385
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,720
Also use for looking deeper in the
body surgery. His surgeries, uh,

386
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,610
used for prevention of cancer.

387
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:23,120
If you have abnormal gross
called polyps in the colon,

388
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,110
surgeon can remove those polyps and
prevent them from progressing into a more

389
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:31,820
serious disease. Polyps on their
own aren't necessarily a cancerous,

390
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,480
but they can develop into cancer.
There's an association with that.

391
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:40,160
And so why not remove them surgically
before they have the chance? Um,

392
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,960
and surgeries often remove,
used to remove local, uh,

393
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,470
tumors in the lung, in the brain,
the colon, uh, the prostate.

394
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,330
So, uh, surgery is a, is a well
established form of cancer treatment.

395
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,630
Radiation can also be
used to treat cancer.

396
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,900
And this relates to the subject of
imaging that we talked about several weeks

397
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:02,750
ago.

398
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,470
We talked about using electromagnetic
radiation because it can penetrate into

399
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,470
the body and using that to
take pictures of what's inside.

400
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,750
But we also talked about forms of
radiation that had biological effects.

401
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:17,360
We talked about ionizing radiation.
For example,

402
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,770
an ionizing radiation can
cause changes in the body,

403
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,240
right? So this is radiation
that's on the high frequency,

404
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,630
short wavelength end of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

405
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,770
So x rays or gamma rays,
um, high frequency,

406
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,970
small wavelength,

407
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,720
so they can penetrate through tissues
very easily and they can interact with

408
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:41,870
Adams and nuclei inside of the,

409
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,990
of the molecules inside your body.

410
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,410
So ionizing radiation,

411
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:53,240
these forms of high energy radiation have
biological effects and we talked about

412
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:57,850
one of those effects is that they
can cause the ejection or the, um,

413
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,880
a deviation of electrons
on Adam's within the skin.

414
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,920
And this,
these change,

415
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:08,030
these ionizations that occur as electrons
are ejected from Adam's within the

416
00:26:08,031 --> 00:26:10,280
skin can cause a cell damage.

417
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,390
This kind of ionization
is happening all the time.

418
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,800
You go out in the sun and radiation
impinges on your skin. It causes some, uh,

419
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,300
some, uh, damage.

420
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:25,430
There are forms of ionizing radiation
present at low levels in the,

421
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,120
in the, uh, in the environment around us.

422
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,350
And ordinarily that causes no problem
because the cells in your body are able to

423
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:34,370
repair damage.

424
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,400
You have repair mechanisms
either by producing new
cells or by repairing the DNA

425
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:44,190
that gets damaged in
cells. Uh, you can, uh,

426
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,230
you can recover from
the damage that happens,

427
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,790
but if radiation continues to
be delivered to that tissue,

428
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,120
you can overwhelm the body's
ability to repair itself.

429
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,980
And you can actually cause sections
of tissues or cells within sections of

430
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:02,430
tissues to die. And that's the
basis for radiation therapy.

431
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,120
So this graph, uh, which is, uh,

432
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,720
which describes an experiment
that was done many decades ago,

433
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,990
shows how radiation can
be used to kill cells.

434
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,520
So this axis here shows a dose of
radiation that's delivered to sales and

435
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:18,180
culture.

436
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,930
So radiation is focused on a petri
dish that contains cells and then you,

437
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,830
you expose them to some
amount of radiation.

438
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,400
So the dose of radiation is
going up as you move this way,

439
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,990
and then you look to see how many
cells survive that procedure,

440
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,720
how many cells survive
this dose of radiation.

441
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,340
So let's look at a dose of
six grays. Here. Gyi is a,

442
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:44,700
D is a radiation unit called the
gray at this dose of six graze.

443
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,350
If you move up the scale here,

444
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:51,530
you'll kill all but 0.01 fraction
or 0.1% of bone marrow cells.

445
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,930
So you would kill most of the bone marrow
cells that were exposed by radiation

446
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:00,250
of this kind. You would kill, uh,

447
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:05,260
about 90% of sales from the breast and
you was killed even less of these other

448
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,710
kinds of cells here.

449
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,660
So that illustrates another point that
cells have different sensitivities to

450
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,494
radiation.

451
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:19,310
And if you know something about the
type of cells you're trying to treat by

452
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:22,290
radiation, then you can
adjust the dose that you give.

453
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:25,390
So you're killing only the
ones that you want, right?

454
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,040
But some cells are always going to be
susceptible cells of the bone marrow,

455
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:33,740
for example, very
susceptible to radiation. Um,

456
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,860
so how do you,

457
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,600
how do you avoid that problem that
you want to kill cells of the tumor,

458
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,680
but you don't want to kill cells that
are also sensitive to radiation and other

459
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:44,514
parts of the body.

460
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:48,240
You do that by just focusing the
radiation on the site that you want.

461
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,510
You do it by localizing where
the radiation is delivered.

462
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,250
And so biomedical engineers and physicists
have developed methods for external

463
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:57,300
beam radiation.

464
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,050
And these are devices that look somewhat
like the imaging systems we talked

465
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:04,360
about several weeks ago,
but they're delivering high doses of,

466
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,270
of ionizing radiation.

467
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,530
And you can see that perhaps that this
thing is on a cradle that swings back and

468
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:15,150
forth and there are, uh, lenses
in here to focus the radiation.

469
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,950
And so the position can move it to
whatever site that he wants in three

470
00:29:19,951 --> 00:29:24,870
dimensions and focus the beam so it hits
only the tissue that you want to expose

471
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:26,190
to radiation.
Right?

472
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:31,520
And so these techniques depend very much
on computers and on mathematical models

473
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,790
of what the tissue looks
like inside your body.

474
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,850
They're guided by imaging methods,
uh,

475
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,330
but the idea is to deliver only
radiation at the site that you want to.

476
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,550
Can you do a perfect job?
No,

477
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,750
but you can do a pretty
good job in focusing the
radiation at the site that you

478
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:52,990
want. So this described a little bit
more in the chapter in your book.

479
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,400
Another way to get radiation delivered
only where you want is to put the

480
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:01,120
radiation source inside the
body in the location you want.

481
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,950
And that's called brachy therapy.

482
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,870
And this is an example of a prostate
tumor that's filled with what looked like

483
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:10,420
little stars here or a little bright dots.

484
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:14,260
Each one of these bright dots is a
small metal seed that's filled with a

485
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:15,490
radioactive material.

486
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,650
Those are implanted physically in the
tissue and then the tissue around it is

487
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,940
exposed to radiation.

488
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,250
It's a special kind of radiation that
only penetrates a certain depth in the

489
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:28,750
tissue.
And as it penetrates,

490
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,720
it delivers ionizing radiation
to all the cells around it.

491
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,120
And so you can see these, these, um,

492
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,820
these small seeds are arrayed throughout
the tissues so that you can treat it as

493
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:44,560
uniformly as possible. So
radiation can be used to, uh,

494
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,640
to uh, treat tumors. Uh,

495
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,740
another thing I wanted to show you on
this slide here is that some cells can be

496
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,440
made to be more sensitive to
radiation than they ordinarily are.

497
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:01,030
And that example shown here with
these human cells that have been, um,

498
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,260
that have been welded, they lack
the normal DNA repair mechanisms.

499
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,520
So cells that lack DNA repair mechanisms,

500
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:11,560
if you expose them to ionizing radiation,

501
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:16,480
they're much more sensitive because they
don't have the mechanisms to repair sub

502
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:19,050
lethal damage.
Right?

503
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,300
And so one important area of research
is trying to find drugs that you can

504
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:29,470
deliver that will accumulate in tumor
tissue to make them more sensitive to

505
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,130
radiation, which you then deliver
in the ways that I've described.

506
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:37,600
So there are a variety of different
approaches that are under study here for

507
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,580
delivering radiation more carefully,

508
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:44,581
more selectively to specific regions of
the body and to design drugs or other

509
00:31:45,191 --> 00:31:48,940
strategies to make tumors more
sensitive to the radiation you deliver.

510
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,830
You know, about chemotherapy. Again,

511
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:58,500
this is a slide that I don't
intend for you to, uh, to, uh,

512
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,360
be able to read a on your,
in your leisure.

513
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:06,361
You can look at the slide when it's
posted and just gives you some idea of the

514
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:11,680
breadth of knowledge that we now
have about chemotherapy drugs.

515
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:15,880
There are many different classes of drugs
that have been developed and studied

516
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:17,590
and employed for treating cancer.

517
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,550
And most of these drugs work in a similar
fashion by interfering with DNA or by

518
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:29,110
interfering with the mechanisms by which
cells repair DNA so that you can halt

519
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:33,400
cell growth, right? If you crosslink
all the DNA inside of a cell,

520
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,660
it can't synthesize any more DNA and
then it can't divide and proliferate.

521
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,750
And that's, that's the basis of action
for many of these, although not all.

522
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,330
So I'll let you look at
those at your leisure.

523
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:49,510
But one of the problems with chemotherapy
is that these drugs have effect not

524
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,490
only on tumor cells,
but they have affects on normal cells.

525
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:54,710
So if you deliver chemotherapy
throughout the body,

526
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,800
not only do you have an effect on
the tumor and effect that you want,

527
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,910
but you have an effect on other tissues.
In particular,

528
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:06,911
the kinds of tissues where cell growth
controlled cell growth is an important

529
00:33:06,921 --> 00:33:11,570
part of their physiology. So the
intestine, the bone marrow, your hair,

530
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,973
skin.

531
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,690
And so patients who have chemotherapy
often get digestive problems,

532
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:19,130
severe digestive problems,

533
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,390
they get anemia or infections because
they're not producing cells in their bone

534
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:24,224
marrow anymore.

535
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,520
They lose their hair because hair is
produced by cells that are dividing in the

536
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:28,911
skin.

537
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:32,930
They get rashes and other skin symptoms
because their skin isn't repairing and

538
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:35,810
remodeling and the normal
way. So you, you know this.

539
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,990
So one concept that has emerged over
the last 10 years or so is to deliver

540
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:45,170
chemotherapy drugs locally instead of
delivering them over the whole body.

541
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,240
And I gave you this example from my own
research lab a few weeks ago and we were

542
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:53,720
talking about drug delivery. But
just to remind you, here's a,

543
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,050
here's a situation where
there's a tumor in the brain.

544
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,880
And so this can be treated by surgery.
And in this case,

545
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,360
the surgeons were given
a drug delivery systems.

546
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,470
These were degradable polymer wafers
that were filled with high concentrations

547
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:13,580
of chemotherapy. So in the operating
room, after they remove the tumor,

548
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,340
they can place these drug
delivery systems in the brain.

549
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,520
The patient leaves the operating
room with most of the tumor removed.

550
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,820
And with high dose chemotherapy delivered
locally over a long period of time

551
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:26,750
after they leave the operating room.

552
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,740
So this should remind you of the brachy
therapy we talked about a few slides ago.

553
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,010
Instead of depositing a
dose of radiation in here,

554
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:39,490
we deposited a dose of drugs and deposited
in a way that these drugs could be

555
00:34:39,771 --> 00:34:44,630
released slowly over time and hopefully
locally kill any residual tumor cells

556
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,950
that are remaining.

557
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:51,650
One of the most impressive,
impressive,

558
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,670
important and exciting new developments
over the last five years has been the

559
00:34:55,671 --> 00:35:00,130
development of new chemotherapy agents
that work by mechanisms of action, uh,

560
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,210
that were not known previously.

561
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,040
And so this is an example of modern
biology and our understanding of cancer

562
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:12,041
biology in particular leading to the
design of drugs that are more specific to

563
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:18,890
cancers because they take advantage
of mechanisms that only cancer cells

564
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:21,140
typically use. All right. Uh,

565
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:24,050
so one of those is a drug called Gleevec.

566
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,130
And remember in the fourth week of
the class we've talked about cell

567
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:30,020
communication.

568
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,170
We talked about signal transduction and
how messages get from the outside of the

569
00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:35,870
cell into the inside of the cell.

570
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,830
And we talked about how important a class
of signaling molecules called tyrosene

571
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:45,831
kinases were to creating
intracellular signals.

572
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,090
Well,
it turns out that certain kinds of tumors,

573
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:53,010
you use a special tyrosene
kinase called BCR Abl,

574
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:58,790
and that that tyrosene kinase can be
inhibited by a drug that was designed to

575
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:00,540
inhibit it called Gleevec.

576
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,440
Now this is one of the first examples
of what's called rational drug design.

577
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,680
In that biologists had identified this
particular tyrosene kinase and they knew

578
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:15,171
what was involved in signaling inside
certain kinds of cancers in particular a

579
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:17,580
certain kind of a lymphoma.

580
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,170
And they studied this molecule in its
molecular detail and developed a drug now

581
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:31,191
call Gleevec that would interfere with
the action of that molecule and interfere

582
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:36,120
with the action of that molecule and not
all the other tyrosene kinases that are

583
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:40,170
important for healthy cell
life and the rest of your body.

584
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,680
So this drug prevents kinase activity.

585
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,830
It does it by blocking
the binding site for ATP.

586
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,320
Remember that ATP was a second messenger.

587
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:54,000
That kinase is used in order
to phosphorolate, uh, protein.

588
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,410
So this is a,

589
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,160
this is an exciting example because it's
the first one of the first examples of

590
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:04,161
rational design of a drug at a very
specific specific molecular target inside

591
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:08,580
tumors. Now unfortunately
it's, it's limited.

592
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,110
Gleevec is limited in its use to only
a couple of subclasses of tumors that

593
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:16,590
express this a tyrosine
kinase at high concentrations.

594
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,640
But I think the idea of it is one
that can be translated outside.

595
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,740
Another new drug that's been developed in
the last few years is called Herceptin.

596
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,710
Herceptin is unique in a
number of different ways.

597
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,700
One is that it's an antibody and we
talked about the role of antibodies in the

598
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:37,620
immune response several weeks ago and
we talked about how vaccines are often

599
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:41,490
designed in order to get your body to
produce antibodies to an infectious

600
00:37:41,491 --> 00:37:41,850
disease.

601
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,020
So you're familiar with the concept of
using antibodies to neutralize pathogens.

602
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Here's an antibody that was designed to
bind to a receptor that appears only on,

603
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,180
uh,
cells in breast cancer.

604
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:59,370
And this receptor is called
her too. It's a form of, um,

605
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,460
of a growth factor receptor
that is particularly highly
expressed in some kinds

606
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:08,550
of breast cancers. And if you
deliver this molecule Herceptin,

607
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,670
it's an antibody which binds to this
receptor and prevents its normal function

608
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,560
and its normal function is to
signal breast cancer cells to grow.

609
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,010
So when this antibody binds,

610
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:27,750
it shuts off that growth signal that
the breast tumor cell is getting,

611
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,610
uh,
from this receptor.

612
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,940
It also promotes the immune response
to the tumor because you can imagine if

613
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:37,150
this is a breast cancer cell that has
lots of these receptor molecules on the

614
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:39,490
surface and you now
you put in an antibody,

615
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:43,690
you deliver an antibody which gets coated
on the surface and now this surface is

616
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:47,560
tagged, this sale is tagged for
recognition by your immune system.

617
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,090
And the immune system can, um, can, uh,

618
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,290
develop a response to this tumor as well.

619
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,270
So these are both exciting new
potential therapies for cancer.

620
00:38:58,271 --> 00:39:00,370
They're real therapies for some cancer,

621
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:04,810
but point the way towards more broadly
applicable methods that might be used to

622
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,300
designing a chemotherapy agents.

623
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,100
The problem is that it takes a long time
and a lot of money and a lot of effort

624
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:18,460
in order to get from the point where you
design a new chemotherapy drug to the

625
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:20,080
point where it can be used in patients.

626
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:24,220
And so I thought I would end this lecture
by just reviewing a little bit about

627
00:39:24,221 --> 00:39:29,110
that process and try to get you a sense
for why in practical terms there haven't

628
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:34,111
been more drugs developed for a
cancer over the past several decades.

629
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,580
And the process occurs in steps and I'm
going to look at it over a timescale of

630
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:42,670
about 20 years, uh, about 20 years here.

631
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,740
And it involves both testing in
vitro testing, in test tubes,

632
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:48,640
in a laboratory,

633
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,530
testing often in cell cultures to look
for drugs that have properties that you

634
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:55,690
think might make them useful for cancer.

635
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:00,310
And usually from the time
that you think about a drug,

636
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:05,430
I have drug say drug x and I think it
might inhibit this signaling pathway in

637
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,410
colon cancer. Uh, so what do I do
first? I get some colon cancer cells.

638
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:12,790
I expose it to the drug.

639
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:17,620
I see if it works in culture and this is
all called the discovery phase, right?

640
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,270
The next stage I might do if I find that
my drug works well in cultured cells

641
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:26,320
and I'm starting to uncover the molecular
mechanisms of how it works is tested

642
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:27,154
in animals.

643
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,600
I might take animals that
have colon cancer and try
to treat them with the drug.

644
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:36,310
And this is still in a discovery and
this is a phase called animal testing.

645
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,790
Now you begin to refine your approach.

646
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,040
You begin to refine your approach such
that you're starting to test not only for

647
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:48,850
the activity in animals because you
find that yes, your drug x does,

648
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,420
does uh,
is an effective treatment for cancer.

649
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,420
But you're trying to think
about what's the optimal dose,

650
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,370
how much dose would I need at this work?

651
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:02,320
The same way in people and
you start testing different
aspects of it in animals,

652
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:04,240
in preparation for testing and people.

653
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:09,250
So that's called that first step
in vitro is called lead discovery.

654
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,000
My lead drug is x. This is a
promising lead that I'm following.

655
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,420
And in animal testing
you do lead optimization.

656
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,490
But all of this takes a long time.

657
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:22,000
Could take four years from
the point that you think, ah,

658
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,400
maybe this drug is good too.
Yes,

659
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,680
I've shown that it really
is effective in animals.

660
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,350
Then a process of clinical testing
happens and the clinical testing occurs in

661
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:37,280
phases and in order to do testing
clinically you have to be approved by the

662
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:40,250
government to do that.
And in this country,

663
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,650
an organization called the
Food and Drug Administration,

664
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:46,220
the FDA is the only one that can give
you approval to take this test and

665
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,930
experimental medicine and people,

666
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,680
and they do that because you file
an application called an I and D or

667
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:55,490
investigational new drug application
and they look at all the data you've

668
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:57,770
collected over the last four
years and they say, yes,

669
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,110
you've convinced us that
this looks like a good drug.

670
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,640
It looks like it'll be safe.

671
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:06,320
You can go ahead and start testing it in
people and you first do small studies.

672
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,370
You deliver to a few people,
usually not people that have disease,

673
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:14,450
but people that don't have disease and
you deliver it in small doses and you

674
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:18,470
slowly increase the amount of dose that
you give them and what you're looking

675
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:21,980
for here is not effectiveness of the drug,
but you're looking for safety.

676
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,820
Is it safe and at what dose do
I begin to see side effects.

677
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,380
And this allows you to narrow in the range
that you're going to use in people to

678
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,250
test this drug for its effectiveness.
That's called phase one.

679
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,260
Phase two,

680
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:41,240
you start to look in patients that
have the disease in a small number of

681
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:45,470
patients, uh, to just look to see
if the drug is effective or not.

682
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,070
Phase one, you're asking
whether it's safe. In phase two,

683
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,400
you're asking if it's effective in the
patients that you would like to use it in.

684
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,840
And you do that in a small number of
patients first just because this is the

685
00:42:56,841 --> 00:43:00,590
first time it's been used
to test effectiveness in
people and you're not quite

686
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:03,920
sure what's going to happen. And so you
do it in a small number of patients.

687
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:07,820
Just to show that it works the way that
you want and if it does work the way you

688
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:09,320
want,
you start phase three,

689
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,440
which is a very large clinical study that
is in the number of patients you need

690
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,010
to show that it is effective at
treating the kind of cancer you want.

691
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,450
How many patients are involved in studies
like this? What could be hundreds?

692
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:29,090
It could be thousands, depends on the
disease, how prevalent the disease is,

693
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:30,920
what the normal course of the disease is,

694
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,840
and how many patients you need to look
at in order to be absolutely sure that

695
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:39,050
you saw an effect that wasn't
just due to chance, right?

696
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,370
There's wasn't just due to chance,

697
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,940
and so these are very complicated
studies to do and hence very expensive.

698
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,860
Remember when we were
talking about vaccines,

699
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:50,060
we talked about a phase three study of
the polio vaccine that was invented by

700
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:53,570
Jonas Salk. How many patients were
involved in that clinical study?

701
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:57,080
Does anybody remember how many
patients were involved in that phase?

702
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:59,660
Three clinical study of the polio vaccine?

703
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,320
Who could remember that?

704
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,380
I remember 1.8 million a eight year
olds were involved in that study.

705
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:12,260
So clinical studies can be huge.
In the case of an infectious disease,

706
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:15,070
it's particularly large
number because you're,

707
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:19,850
you need to deliver it to enough people
to see a vaccine to see that you've

708
00:44:19,851 --> 00:44:22,280
changed the uh,
the,

709
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:27,260
the incidents of disease within
a population. In cancer trials,

710
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,470
they tend to be hundreds or thousands
in size. If this space retrial works,

711
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,940
then you're allowed to sell the drug.

712
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:38,190
The FDA gives you permission to sell
the drug and for se for physicians to

713
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:39,024
prescribe it.

714
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,200
But this study doesn't end there and
that all manufacturers of drugs are

715
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:47,430
required to keep track of what happens
as their drug is introduced into the

716
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,040
population.
This is called phase four.

717
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,710
As physicians start
using it to treat cancer,

718
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,980
they're required to look
at how these things work.

719
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:59,530
And you will have noticed
in the, in the, um,

720
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,550
newspaper over the past few years,

721
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,060
some very famous drugs that turned
out to have side effects that weren't

722
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:10,830
expected after they were released into
the general population that once it

723
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:15,120
starts being used by physicians all over
the country in many, many more patients,

724
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:18,540
sometimes rare side effects appear
that we didn't expect before.

725
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,300
And so one continues to do research
and study even after that. So the,

726
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:27,870
the challenge for drug companies is
that this takes a very long time.

727
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:32,871
It takes a lot of money and there's
lots of places where your drug can fail.

728
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:38,040
Right? My drug x, which I described as
going neatly through in vitro studies,

729
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:42,600
animal testing, clinical testing might
have stopped working at some stage.

730
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:45,780
I might have found some problem with it.
Safety,

731
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,030
when I started testing
it in human volunteers,

732
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,540
I might've found that it didn't work
as well in animals as I expected it to

733
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,370
based on in vitro studies.

734
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,810
And people estimate that
for every 10,000 compounds,

735
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,280
10,000 x x's that are
thought of in laboratories,

736
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,760
only one of them eventually
gets approved by the FDA.

737
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:11,100
So this is why I drug development costs
so much money in this country cause you

738
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:15,180
have to look at a lot of compounds and
test them pretty extensively to find the

739
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:17,730
one that's really useful
for treating disease.

740
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,660
And I don't think we want to change that
because this process of FDA approval

741
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,460
was introduced early in this century
when people were selling drugs out of the

742
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:30,270
back of covered wagons and uh,
moving from town to town,

743
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:33,120
they're called snake
oil salesman or, or, um,

744
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:37,530
other things and people could sell
anything they want it and claim that it

745
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:38,490
treated a disease.

746
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,290
Now we have a very highly refined system
for asking people that are going to

747
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:47,610
sell drugs to prove that they work.
That system costs a lot of money.

748
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:48,481
There are,

749
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:52,140
there are opportunities I think for
biomedical engineers to improve how this

750
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:55,830
works by designing vet better
methods for in vitro study,

751
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,850
by using techniques we talked about
like in cell culture early on, uh, to,

752
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,700
to use those techniques more efficiently
to discover and test properties of

753
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:06,360
drugs.

754
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:09,990
And so this is going to be an area
where I think there's lots of growth and

755
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:14,680
opportunities in the
future. Just in closing, um,

756
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:18,300
I, uh, just put this website up there.

757
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:20,670
It's from science magazine, which is, uh,

758
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,180
which is a very high
profile scientific journal.

759
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,280
They published a poster which
is available online, uh,

760
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,850
that talks about sort of
modern develops in cancer,

761
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,670
modern developments in cancer
diagnosis and treatment.

762
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:38,890
I put a few sort of snapshots from that
poster into the PowerPoint presentation,

763
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:39,910
which will be available.

764
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,990
But I encourage you to go to this website
and look at this information and you

765
00:47:43,991 --> 00:47:48,970
can find out more about what are the sort
of exciting pathways for the future in,

766
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,750
um, in, uh, biomedical
engineering and cancer treatment.

767
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,120
Great.
So I'll see you on Thursday.
