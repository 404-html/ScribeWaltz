1
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,370
This week we're going to talk about
cardiovascular physiology and, uh,

2
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:21,570
the cardiovascular system,
which includes the,

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,730
the blood, the blood
vessels and the heart. And,

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,540
um,
we're going to focus on several features.

5
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,000
This is obviously a big topic,

6
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,080
not only understanding the basic
physiology of the cardiovascular system,

7
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:41,250
but what can fail and the cardiovascular
system in disease. And of course,

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,310
cardiovascular disease is the number
one or two cause of deaths in a Western

9
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:51,690
world. And so it's a, it's a serious
and important topic for medicine.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,210
And it's also something that I realized,
uh,

11
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,110
you probably all know something about.
Um,

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,540
and so we're going to try to look at
things in a slightly different way.

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,990
Look at them the way that a,
an engineer,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,900
a biomedical engineer might look at
the cardiovascular system to try to

15
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,450
understand,
um,

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,870
the relationship in
particular between pressure,

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,000
blood pressure,

18
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,680
which is the force that moves blood
around through the circulatory system and

19
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:22,020
flow the actual movement of blood,

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,760
which is what's essential for distributing
oxygen and nutrients and everything

21
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:30,930
else that we, uh, that we, uh, that we
move around in our circulatory system.

22
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,220
So I'm going to talk briefly about the
anatomy of the heart and the circulatory

23
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:38,890
system. We'll start by thinking
about the whole level. Uh,

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,670
I'm going to talk in some
detail about, uh, about how, uh,

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,690
pressure differences generate flow in
starting with a very simple example and

26
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:53,970
building up to some of the complexity
that we have within our cardiovascular

27
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,690
systems.

28
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,110
And one of the most amazing things
about the cardiovascular system is its

29
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:03,111
ability to change the pattern of bloods
flow such that organs that need more

30
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,490
blood can get more blood,
right?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,140
It's not just that there's a static system
where blood is flowing throughout the

32
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,020
body and it flows at the same
rate everywhere, all the time.

33
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,120
It increases in one region and decreases
in another in response to physiological

34
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:26,050
need. And we'll talk about that sort
of engineering principle that the, uh,

35
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,210
that the cardiovascular system uses
to accomplish that. And then, um,

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,770
next week we'll talk about,
um,

37
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,620
well we'll talk in some detail this
Thursday about how the heart generates the

38
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:42,300
pressure that's needed to move the blood
and how you can create this flow, uh,

39
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,680
with a relatively simple, uh,
but a durable machine, the heart.

40
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,100
And,
uh,

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,100
and next Tuesday we'll talk about
cardiac conduction in electrophysiology.

42
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:57,300
How the, how the heart
regulates. It's, uh,

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,290
it's beating in order to generate
a orderly pattern of pressure,

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,330
uh,
a generation.

45
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,773
Okay.

46
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,370
So this is a cartoon of
the cardiovascular system,

47
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,520
not showing the blood
except by the colors here,

48
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:19,521
but showing the heart in the center
of this diagram is the heart and

49
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:20,971
surrounding.

50
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:25,971
It is sort of a schematic diagram like
you might see for a plumbing in a,

51
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:29,250
in a house,
but certainly not in anatomical detail.

52
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:34,251
This drawing isn't of how blood flows
from the heart to all the other regions of

53
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:38,880
the body. And let's just, now
I know that you, that you,

54
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,750
that you've seen diagrams like this
before, you understand the basic, uh,

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,860
connections between things, but let's
just go through them, uh, uh, briefly.

56
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,850
And you have to start somewhere
because this is a, a sick, it's a,

57
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:52,770
it's a closed system,
right?

58
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,830
You start at one point and you go around
and you come back to the beginning

59
00:03:55,831 --> 00:04:00,300
again. And um, so if we start in the,

60
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,850
in this side of the heart, this is
the left side of the heart, right?

61
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,610
And there are two chambers in
the left side of the heart,

62
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,830
the Atrium and the ventricle.

63
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,640
And you see that blood flows into the
left side of the heart in has come from

64
00:04:14,641 --> 00:04:18,540
the lungs. That blood has come from
the lungs. And so it's full of oxygen.

65
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,910
And in this diagram it's indicated as red.

66
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,940
And if you follow the arrows here,

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,770
the blood flows from the lungs into the
left atrium into the left ventricle and

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,710
out through a large
vessel called the aorta.

69
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,750
And so fairly simple,
uh,

70
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,330
so far two chambers in the heart blood
flows through these two chambers,

71
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,370
atrium first,
then ventricle and out through the aorta.

72
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:50,490
So if I was able to measure a flow
at this point here in the aorta,

73
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:57,030
I would measure the total rate of flow
of blood out of the heart and you'd

74
00:04:57,151 --> 00:05:00,520
measure that in in volume per minute.
All right,

75
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,130
in liters per minute,
let's say.

76
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,840
And all of the blood flow is coming
through this one vessel, right?

77
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,770
And so if I could,

78
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,580
if I could measure what the flow is
through the aorta over a period of time,

79
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,700
I would measure what's called the cardiac
output or the rate of flow that the

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,410
heart is producing, um,
in its function. Now,

81
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:27,570
because it's a closed
system, right? The, the,

82
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,790
the rate of flow has to be the
same anywhere in the cycle. Right?

83
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:35,791
If you imagine a simple a tube that
connects back to the two itself,

84
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,480
if I'm generating five
liters permitted a flow here,

85
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,400
I have to have five liters per minute
everywhere in the cycle. Right? Otherwise,

86
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,234
what would happen,

87
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:47,960
okay,

88
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,780
th th otherwise the volume of the
vessels would have to be expanding or

89
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:55,800
contracting at some point. If the
flow rate is different there, right.

90
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,140
It would have to be changing with if the
flow rates different and it doesn't do

91
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:01,840
that right.
And so it's this,

92
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:05,900
it's a steady state system where there's
a constant flow all throughout the

93
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,850
cycle. And we're going to
come back to this point,

94
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:10,520
but it's important to remember now.

95
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,680
Immediately after the blood comes out
in the aorta there an opportunity for it

96
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:16,940
to go somewhere else.
There's,

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,650
there's a branch point and that first
branch point is from the aorta into this,

98
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,910
what's shown is a fairly large vessel but
they're pretty small vessels actually.

99
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,590
These are the coronary arteries,

100
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,890
the arteries that actually bring blood
to the surface of the heart in order to

101
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:33,974
nourish it.

102
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:39,730
And you can imagine that
the heart is using a lot of,

103
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,800
it's using a lot of energy.
It's generating work.

104
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:46,340
That work is being transmitted into
pressure and flow of the blood.

105
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,090
And so it gets the energy
to do that, uh, from uh,

106
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,890
from nutrients, oxygen, glucose.
And so it needs a lot of blood flow.

107
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,940
And so it's in the best possible
position to get good blood flow, right?

108
00:06:58,941 --> 00:06:59,800
Cause it's getting,
it's,

109
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,620
it's getting its blood right off of
the aorta where flow is a maximum.

110
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,550
And we talked about stents last week
that are used to treat disease in these

111
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,800
blood vessels. And we'll
talk more of that, uh, as,

112
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,070
as we go through the next couple of weeks.

113
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,450
What I want you to focus on now is just
this phenomenon that the flow branches

114
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,120
here, all right, some of the,

115
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,480
some of the blood goes further down the
aorta and some of it goes through the

116
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,530
coronary arteries.

117
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,780
Now how much blood goes in which direction
is going to be one of the main things

118
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:36,200
we talk about, uh, in the rest
of the lecture today. But first,

119
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:40,010
let's just continue in our journey around
and you'll notice that this pattern

120
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,210
repeats that there are points
where the flow branches, right?

121
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,880
For example,
after the aorta,

122
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,110
some of the flow goes up
in a sending arteries.

123
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,650
This goes up above the heart
into the head, for example.

124
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,120
And so the carotid arteries, which carry
blood flow up to your brain are, uh,

125
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:03,650
are descendants of this branch here.
And those are important, right?

126
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,940
Blood to the brain is pretty important,
right?

127
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,170
And also blood goes down
through the abdominal aorta,

128
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,340
so it splits in two directions,
right down the abdominal aorta and,

129
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,510
and that blood goes to your legs and all
of your visceral organs that are below

130
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,700
the heart,
right?

131
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,900
And this pattern repeats itself
a pattern of flow branch,

132
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,760
branch, branch to ever smaller
branches so that you can serve, uh,

133
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,980
ever smaller regions of tissue.
Now the,

134
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,990
these vessels that carry oxygenated
blood are called arteries and they have

135
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,070
thick,
muscular walls.

136
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,380
They're generally a large diameter
centimeters. So there's a,

137
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,560
there's a table in your book that gives
you the diameters of different kinds of

138
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:53,561
vessels and they don't exchange
materials with their outside environment.

139
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,650
You can think of these as,

140
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,450
as conduits whose function is to carry
blood from the heart to a particular

141
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,740
Oregon, but not to exchange
nutrients, not to exchange oxygen.

142
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:09,270
They're just carrying the blood.
Eventually. If we looked, for example,

143
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:13,920
at the branch of this artery that goes
to the digestive tract, for example,

144
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,360
to the, uh, to the,

145
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,390
to the organs of the gut
where digestion takes place,

146
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,830
you have continual branching of these
arteries until they become very fine.

147
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,390
And those smallest conducting

148
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,370
pathways are called arterials,

149
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,810
small arteries or arterioles. Now they
have the same basic anatomy as an artery.

150
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,710
They have a muscular wall and we'll talk
about why that's important in a minute.

151
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,460
And they don't conduct any, any, any, uh,

152
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,790
any nutrients across their surface.
They're just smaller.

153
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,390
And eventually those arterials branch
into very fine vessels called capillaries.

154
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,980
And it's, Eh, it's in
these capillary beds,

155
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:06,240
which are illustrated here by these
little meshes where you have the smallest

156
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,380
diameter vessels.

157
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,290
They're feeding very particular regions
of tissue, not your whole intestine,

158
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,200
but only a very small
region of the intestine.

159
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,060
And they have thin walls that lack muscle.

160
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,990
They're not muscular walls,
and it's in these capillary beds.

161
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,760
That exchange of nutrients takes place.
It's in these capillary beds,

162
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:33,660
that exchange of oxygen,
carbon dioxide, sugar,

163
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,650
amino acids that takes
place in capillaries.

164
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,510
So capillaries are not muscular,
but they're able to, uh, transport,

165
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,680
uh, nutrients and molecules, right?

166
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,910
So what's happened as
we've gone from the aorta,

167
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,030
single vessel down to a capillary bed,
and there are many,

168
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:56,670
many capillary beds in
your body, right? Well,

169
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:59,070
if I could take a cross
section at any point,

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
a cross section of this,

171
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,150
then the total flow rate
into all the capillaries,

172
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:10,800
the total flow rate through all the
capillaries has to be the same as the flow

173
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:11,760
rate through the aorta.

174
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,760
But by this process of branching where
this total flow of five liters per minute

175
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:22,170
gets divided and divided and divided
by the time it gets to a capillary,

176
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,160
there's a very small vessel
carrying a very low flow rate,

177
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,160
a very small fraction of this,
five milliliters per minute,

178
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,930
but there's now millions of these
vessels all over your body. All right,

179
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,260
so the blood is not flowing at a
large flow rate through a big vessel.

180
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:41,130
It's flowing at a much smaller flow
rate through many, many vessels.

181
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,520
But the total has to add up to the total.
It goes in

182
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,910
a well,
you know the rest of the story,

183
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:51,930
the capillaries merge after
they leave the tissue area.

184
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:54,190
They merge into small veins.

185
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,120
Veins are collecting tubules for,
uh,

186
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,860
deoxygenated blood.

187
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,000
Now this is blood that has transported
all of its nutrients into the tissue that

188
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:07,570
it serves. So it doesn't
have a lot of oxygen anymore.

189
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,910
It has a lot of waste products.
Now,

190
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,720
the waste products that are generated
by these tissues during metabolism,

191
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,820
so it has a lot of carbon dioxide,

192
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,970
which is the end product
of glucose metabolism.

193
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,213
All right?

194
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,200
It has, uh, it has acids that
are generated from metabolism.

195
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:27,510
It has the end products
of nitrogen metabolism,

196
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:31,170
which is chiefly a urea
and ammonia and those,

197
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,440
and that blood is indicated
here as the Blue Line.

198
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,340
Now we usually show these
blue colored vessels,

199
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,390
usually show them as red and blue,
indicating, uh, lots of oxygen read,

200
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
not very much oxygen and blue,

201
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,550
but it's not just oxygen
that's changed right there.

202
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:48,930
The chemical composition
has changed dramatically.

203
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,440
There's a lot more carbon dioxide,
there's a lot more, uh, urea.

204
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,460
There's a lot more of other things
coming out of the, uh, of the,

205
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,713
through the veins,

206
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,460
these small veins called venules
merge to form larger veins.

207
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,460
Eventually very large
veins like the Vena Cava,

208
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,370
which come back to the
right side of the heart.

209
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,800
Okay.

210
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,100
The right side of the
heart is anatomically very
similar to the left side.

211
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,230
There's an atrium,
there's a ventricle,

212
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,073
okay.

213
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,240
And blood flows out of the ventricle
through the pulmonary artery to the lungs.

214
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,160
Now notice that there's something
different here than on this side of the

215
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:30,390
circulatory system.

216
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,210
The part where the blood is going
out to the rest of your body.

217
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,630
The artery contains oxygenated blood

218
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,330
on this side. Bless you. The, um,

219
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,470
the pulmonary artery is an artery.

220
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,910
It has the same features as a
systemic artery like the aorta.

221
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,330
It has a muscular wall, for example,
and doesn't transport nutrients.

222
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,750
So it looks like an artery,
but it carries deoxygenated blood.

223
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,180
Okay.

224
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,840
And it's carrying it only
one place back to the lungs.

225
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,430
And it's collected in the collected
on the other side of the lungs.

226
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:10,570
Now with oxygen and returns to
the point where we started. Okay.

227
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,530
So it's not just a,
it's not just a closed system,

228
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,590
it's too closed systems,
right?

229
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,620
It's too closed systems one that we're
going to call the system that's fed by

230
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:27,250
the left side of the heart where
oxygenated blood goes out to the whole

231
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:32,251
periphery of your body and is and is
collected back by the right side of your

232
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:37,780
heart. That's one closed
system. The second is, uh, is,

233
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,790
uh, the, the pulmonary vascular
system, which is, which is,

234
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,180
um, which is, uh,

235
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,280
the forces generated by the
right side of the heart. Uh,

236
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,840
the flow is generated by the right side
of the heart, flows only to the blood,

237
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,050
to the lungs, and oxygenated
blood comes back to the left side.

238
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:01,490
So it's sorta like a figure eight,
right? One loop, a second loop,

239
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,280
right? Uh, what's the,

240
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,110
if the rate of flow is five liters
per minute through the aorta,

241
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,880
what's the flow rate in the pulmonary
artery? There are two independent systems.

242
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,180
Is that right? So what's the rate
of flow in the pulmonary artery?

243
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,423
Yeah,

244
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,460
it has to be five liters per minute
because they're not independent, right?

245
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,670
They're, they're, they're really, I
described them as too close system.

246
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:34,020
It's really one closed system with
the, with a loop, right? With a loop.

247
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:36,570
So the flow has to be the same everywhere,

248
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,123
right?

249
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,210
The flow has to be the same everywhere.
Okay?

250
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,660
So let's talk about blood flow
in these vessels for a moment.

251
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:48,940
Now you have this picture of the overall,
uh,

252
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,270
of the overall composition
of the circulatory system.

253
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,330
Let's think about a very simple,

254
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,400
a very simple problem that engineers
have thought about for hundreds of years.

255
00:16:00,731 --> 00:16:04,600
Now it turns out to have a lot of
relevance in the cardiovascular system,

256
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:09,601
but has relevance everywhere has relevance
in terms of getting water to all the

257
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,150
faucets in this building.

258
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,750
This you have to solve the same problem
and that is generating enough pressure

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,320
to allow fluid to move
through a length of tubing,

260
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,913
right?

261
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,570
And so we'll think about a typical length
of tubing and we'll make it as simple

262
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,291
as possible.

263
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:34,291
It's a vessel that has a constant diameter
or radius and unknown length and and

264
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:39,880
fluid is going to flow in one end of this
vessel and it's going to flow out the

265
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:44,420
other. And this is called internal
flow through a tube. And uh,

266
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,430
turns out to be one of
the most well studied, uh,
problems in all of engineering.

267
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,380
I'm just going to tell you one aspect of
this that over a certain range of flow

268
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:57,790
rates over a certain range of flow rates.
So this isn't true all the time,

269
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,980
but it's going to be true most of the
time in our circulatory system that if I

270
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:07,981
try to generate a flow through this
tube and the flow again is going to be

271
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:11,500
measured in something like volume per
minute. So let's say a liter per minute,

272
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,940
then the pressure that I need
to produce the pressure drop,

273
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,470
meaning what's the pressure difference
from one side of the tube to the other?

274
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:21,900
Okay.

275
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,520
Right?
So I don't care about absolute pressure.

276
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,750
I only care about a difference in
pressure between one side and the other.

277
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,910
That that difference in pressure is
proportional to the rate of flow.

278
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,010
And that's what this equation says here.

279
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,610
If I knew what the pressure drop was,

280
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,920
the flow is proportional to that.

281
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,660
And the constant of proportionality
is this is this symbol are here,

282
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,610
the resistance to flow.

283
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,020
So we can say that Delta p,

284
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,670
the drop in pressure over the tubing
is equal to resistance times flow rate.

285
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,490
Delta p equals r times Q.

286
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,080
Delta P is a driving force.

287
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,403
Okay?

288
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,830
Pressure difference is a driving force.

289
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:13,831
It's what causes the flow and the flow
is what res what results from that.

290
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,940
So Delta p equals r Q.
Does that kind of equation look familiar?

291
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,350
Okay.

292
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,370
To anybody from their high school physics,
you ever seen a uh,

293
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,600
an equation like that?
Um,

294
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,670
Delta p equals r Q driving force.

295
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,593
Okay.

296
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,370
Is equal to some constant times a flow

297
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,140
right about ever seen.
Delta v Equals R.

298
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,830
Hi. Anybody know where
that equation comes from?

299
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,653
Yeah,

300
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,000
sorry. Circuits. It's the
float through an elect.

301
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,690
A flow through an electrical circuit.

302
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,620
What's the potential for a flow
through an electrical syrup. Okay.

303
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,040
It's a driving force. It's a voltage
driving force. You Hook up a battery,

304
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,790
you hook up a battery to a length of wire.
For example.

305
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,910
What flows is electrons
current and how much flows,

306
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,360
how much flows through a wire,
right?

307
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,590
How much throw it flows through a
circuit in response to a voltage change

308
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,340
depends on a property of the wire.
It's resistance,

309
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,160
right? Thicker wires, more cross
section have has less resistance.

310
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,330
You can flow more current through it.
Thinner wires less

311
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,790
right?
Right.

312
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,680
Takes more you float for given
driving force for given voltage,

313
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,910
less current flows. If you haven't
seen that before, don't worry about it.

314
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:59,330
If you have seen it, then hopefully this
will be useful and thinking about this,

315
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:05,680
which is the same thing that a pressure
drop produces a flow and how much flow

316
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:11,090
you produce for a given pressure
drop depends on a property called the

317
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:15,650
resistance. Now the resistance is a
property of the geometry of the vessel.

318
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,920
If I have a very, a vessel with a very
large diameter for a given pressure drop,

319
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:26,921
I can create a large flow for a vessel
with a small diameter for that same

320
00:20:27,861 --> 00:20:31,040
pressure drop, I get less flow. Right?

321
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:35,090
So imagine your um,
whatever your favorite beverage is.

322
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:39,020
Think about a milkshake because those are
difficult to draw three straws, right?

323
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:41,720
But if you're going to drink a
milkshake in your favorite flavor,

324
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,220
do you hope you get as a narrow
straw or a big thick straw?

325
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,370
You wouldn't,

326
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,860
you would not pick the narrowest dry if
you really like the milkshake because

327
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:54,310
you can only generate a certain
pressure drop with your mouth, right?

328
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,850
And if you generate that pressure drop,
you're not going to get much milkshake.

329
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,490
You're not going to get much flow.
But if I have a bigger tube,

330
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,500
same pressure drop, bigger flow,
more milkshake, right? Same thing.

331
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,930
And here the resistance,

332
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:12,610
it turns out we can for for
very simple vessels like this,

333
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,130
the,

334
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,130
the resistance can be related to the
geometry of the vessel that is like told

335
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:23,490
you what shape this vessel was,
how, how, what its diameter was.

336
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,610
And how long it is. You can calculate
what the resistance is from this formula.

337
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:30,220
Here are,
is equal to eight mew,

338
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,600
l over Pi r to the fourth.
Now you know what all these things are,

339
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,250
you know what Pi is? That's
uh, that's 3.14 pi is familiar.

340
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,510
Uh, r is the radius. L is
the length. What's mew?

341
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,440
Mew is a property of the
fluid and it's the viscosity.

342
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,730
Okay?

343
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,440
Nope.
Shakes have high viscosity.

344
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,050
Okay.

345
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,790
Water has a low viscosity.
So if you're going to drink water,

346
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,210
you're not so worried about
how big your Straw is.

347
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,770
You would accept a small straw, not just
because milkshakes are more delicious,

348
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,150
but because you don't need to generate
as much of a pressure drop to move water

349
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:13,450
as you do to move a milkshake cause
milkshakes. I'm a higher viscosity.

350
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,460
The viscosity of the blood is in
general a constant. It's a constant.

351
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:23,461
That is about three centipoise and you
can read in the book about units of

352
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,040
viscosity and how they're defined but it,

353
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,610
but it tells you something about the
forest that you need in order to cause the

354
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:33,760
fluid to flow.
Cause the fluid to flow.

355
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,200
So we're going to be dealing with fluids
in here that are basically constant in

356
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:42,790
their viscosity. Three blood is about
three times as viscous as water.

357
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,840
Why is blood more viscous than water?
Why is it harder to flow?

358
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,110
Do you think? It's largely
water, right? It's mostly water.

359
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:53,340
That's the major component.

360
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,060
Why isn't the viscosity of blood
the same as the viscosity of water?

361
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,490
Okay.

362
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,050
It has has molecules in
it and so that right?

363
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,270
That makes a difference.
It also has something else.

364
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:08,920
Okay.

365
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,280
50% of the volume of blood is cells,
right?

366
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,690
And and set an a, an a, an a, an
a concentrated solution of cells.

367
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:20,740
Like red blood cells is not
as easy to flow as a water is.

368
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:23,140
And so that's why water is more viscous.

369
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,460
But if you wanted to then think about how
much flow there is through this vessel.

370
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,870
And I told you what the dimensions were
and I told you that blood was flowing,

371
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,460
you could calculate are,

372
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,500
and then you would know everything
about flow through this vessel, right?

373
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,860
You would know if I have a
pressure drop of so many units,

374
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,160
this is the flow that would result.
How did Justin,

375
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,520
the interior surface of the
tube could make a difference.

376
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,040
Now it turns out for low flows,

377
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,720
surprisingly the surface of the
tube doesn't make a difference.

378
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:02,300
If the flow rate is below
a certain level that,

379
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,240
and you're thinking about what if
the surface of the tube is rough,

380
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,800
then fluid that's flowing
past that surface is going
to experience more friction

381
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,960
than if it was flowing past a very
smooth surface. At low flow rates,

382
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,170
the friction that occurs when a liquid
meets a solid is it's so high that fluid

383
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:26,180
at the surface doesn't really move at all.
For low flow rates.

384
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,730
Fluid that's right at the
surface doesn't move at all.

385
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:31,550
And so roughness doesn't matter
when you have no flow there.

386
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,060
But as the flow rate increases,
then roughness becomes more important.

387
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,080
So two things about it.
In our vascular systems,

388
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,080
the flow rates are generally low enough
that you don't have to worry about that.

389
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,840
And our, our, uh,

390
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:49,760
our vessels are all really
very similar in terms of their,

391
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,850
of their microscopic geometry and
that all of the blood vessels are,

392
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,420
are covered with a monolayer of
cells called endothelial cells,

393
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:00,560
uh,

394
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,360
that basically form a blanket over the
entire surface of the inside of the

395
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:06,230
circulatory system.

396
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:10,340
And so there's very little frictional
resistance to flow there. But that's,

397
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,360
it's a really good point.

398
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,480
Other questions? Okay. So this,

399
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,880
this equation sort of
makes sense, right? If you,

400
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,040
if you go on to study a
biomedical engineering,

401
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,380
you'll learn exactly where
this equation comes from and,

402
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,600
and you'd be able to derive it
yourself. But, uh, but for now,

403
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:32,760
just accept it and it,

404
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,970
it is true for almost all
the vessels in our body.

405
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:40,860
I'll almost an under all the circumstances
of human physiology and it tells us

406
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:45,210
that resistance varies with viscosity,
length and radius.

407
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,140
And it varies in an,

408
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:50,640
in an in kind of the way that you would
expect as viscosity of the fluid goes up,

409
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:54,960
resistance goes up.
As the length of the tube goes up,

410
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,730
resistance goes up,
right?

411
00:25:56,731 --> 00:25:59,520
Harder to pull through a long
straw than through a short straw.

412
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,320
And as the radius goes up,
resistance goes down,

413
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,510
right? Because the radius is in
the, is in the denominator here.

414
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:12,180
So its radius goes up,
the resistance goes down.

415
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,420
And remarkably the resistance goes
with the fourth power of the radius.

416
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,020
What does that mean?

417
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,410
That means a two fold increase in
radius leads to a 16 fold reduction.

418
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,720
16 is two to the fourth,
right? A 16 fold reduction in,

419
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,000
um, in, uh, resistance.

420
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,840
So resistance is of all the parameters,

421
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:43,290
resistance is most sensitive to radius.
Caitlin, did you have a question?

422
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,313
Yes.

423
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah. So yeah. So what, what's the unit
here? Well, let's, let's think about what,

424
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:54,600
what, what unit would you,
would you measure pressure in?

425
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,810
What's a unit of pressure?
Pascals is one

426
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,763
others

427
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,240
newtons per meter squared
or millimeter squared.

428
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:11,460
So it's forced per area is pressure.

429
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,260
There's a w what's a more commonly
those are, those are, those are those,

430
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,150
those are great. Uh, units, sorry.

431
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,280
Pounds per square inch
is another, a unit. Psi.

432
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,560
What's the pressure in the room here?

433
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,590
One atmosphere atmospheres
is another pressure.

434
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:36,380
So relative to atmospheric
pressure and if you, if you have a,

435
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,810
um, any, any others,

436
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,403
cool

437
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,670
millimeters of mercury, it turns out
that all of those are, are, are, are,

438
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,310
are proper units for, uh, for pressure.

439
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:50,950
And you could convert between one or
the other as long as you knew what the

440
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:52,600
conversion factor was between the,

441
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,040
we usually use atmospheres to
describe atmospheric pressure.

442
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,960
Physiologists usually use millimeters
of mercury to describe pressure in the

443
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:04,300
circulatory system,
millimeters of mercury.

444
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:08,170
So one atmosphere is 760
millimeters of mercury.

445
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,520
What are the blood pressures that are
relevant in your circulatory system?

446
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,480
How many millimeters
of mercury do you think

447
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,160
anybody know what their blood pressure is?

448
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,420
Hundred and 20 over 80.
What?

449
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,480
Don't tell you that 120 millimeters of
mercury over 80 millimeters of mercury.

450
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,660
And we're going to talk about
where those numbers are,

451
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,990
where those pressures actually
exist in a few minutes. But that's,

452
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:40,800
that's uh,

453
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,420
that's the range of pressures in your
circulatory system from zero millimeters

454
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:50,070
of mercury up to 120
millimeters of mercury roughly.

455
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,320
And we'll see you go outside
of that range. Sometimes.

456
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,940
Now these are pressures that are inside
our circulatory system, so they must be,

457
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,440
but they're only a fraction of an
atmosphere. How can that be right?

458
00:29:01,441 --> 00:29:05,340
An atmosphere is 760 millimeters of
mercury. That's the pressure in this room.

459
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,400
If your blood pressure is one 20 over 80
what does that mean?

460
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,770
Okay,

461
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:16,030
well pressure is a, we we only
care about differences in pressure.

462
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,800
It's relative pressure that matters,
not the absolute pressure.

463
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,640
So when you say that your,
your blood pressure is 120 over 80,

464
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:29,620
that means 120 millimeters of
mercury above atmospheric ADM,

465
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,520
80 millimeters of mercury
above atmospheric, right?

466
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:38,160
Otherwise our blood vessels would
collapse because we're surrounded by air.

467
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:38,770
That's,

468
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:43,770
that's 760 millimeters of mercury
that to inflate those vessels,

469
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,460
you have to be at pressures above that.

470
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,500
But since all we care about our pressure
differences than the pressure that you

471
00:29:50,501 --> 00:29:54,130
measure when you measure blood
pressure is pressure above atmospheric.

472
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:55,840
Okay.

473
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,550
To make sense. So, uh,

474
00:29:58,551 --> 00:30:01,070
so Delta p is in millimeters of mercury.

475
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,650
Q is in liters per minute.

476
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:09,550
So our is in units of millimeters
of mercury per liter per minute

477
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,880
or millimeters. All right?
It's in units of um,

478
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,350
if we just write this out,
millimeters of mercury.

479
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,240
Okay.

480
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,670
Equals r and this is liters per minute.

481
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,900
Yeah.

482
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,900
Then our must be in units of millimeters
of mercury per liter per minute.

483
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,810
Okay. So, um, so this resistance changes,

484
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:55,980
it changes with geometry.
The most sensitive thing
that changes is the radius.

485
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,900
And so imagine that if you had a
vessel that could change its radius,

486
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,260
that could become smaller or
could become larger, right?

487
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,620
Then that would be a vessel that
could regulate its resistance.

488
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,633
All right?

489
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,840
And so if that vessel was
faced with a pressure drop,

490
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,750
let's say a pressure drop
of 10 millimeters of mercury
from beginning to end of

491
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:22,740
this vessel here,

492
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,970
and it could change its radius,

493
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,730
then it could change the amount
of blood flow through it.

494
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,530
If it decreased its radius,
the rate of blood flow would go down.

495
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,140
Even though the pressure
drops stays the same.

496
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,240
And if it expanded its radius,
the rate of flow would go up,

497
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:47,970
even though the pressure drop remains
the same. Does that make sense?

498
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,950
So I mentioned before that
arteries, arterials, small arteries,

499
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,080
all arteries have muscular walls and
they have a special kind of muscle called

500
00:31:58,081 --> 00:31:59,100
smooth muscle,

501
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:02,910
which is arranged circumferentially
sort of wrapped around the vessel.

502
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,090
And that muscle can contract to constrict
the vessel or relax to dilate the

503
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:14,520
vessel. And so one feature of
arteries that makes them, uh,

504
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,040
important in, uh, in, uh,

505
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,680
physiology is that they
can change their diameter.

506
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:21,810
And when they changed their diameter,

507
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:25,680
they changed their resistance and they
changed the flow that goes through them.

508
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,590
Uh,
it add a fixed pressure drops.

509
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:33,510
So why is that important?
Well, let's say, um,

510
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,500
you, uh, you get up and
you start running, right?

511
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,840
The lecture's over. You're excited
to tell your friends about it.

512
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,550
So you get up and you run out of class.
So you went from, from resting to running.

513
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:48,680
Now all of a sudden your,
your muscles need more,

514
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,620
need more blood because
they're going to start,

515
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:55,640
they're going to start generating
work. And so the, the blood vet,

516
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,690
the arteries that feed your
muscles are going to contract,

517
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,990
are gonna Relax.
Diamond will get bigger,

518
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,320
the pressure available is the same.
They'll get more flow.

519
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,000
That flow has to come from somewhere.

520
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:12,170
So simultaneously other vessels
are constricting. Right?

521
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,700
And what would those vessels be?

522
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,090
We'll probably the vessels that go
to nonessential functions when you're

523
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:19,280
starting to run,
not your brain,

524
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,670
you want to keep blood flow to your brain
so you don't run into the wall, right?

525
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:27,740
But it might, you might, you might have
less flow going to your digestive organs.

526
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,290
So you'd stop digestion for
some period of slow it down, uh,

527
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,470
provide less blood flowed for that
purpose. Does that make sense?

528
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,400
Well, if we look at how
pressure varies through the,

529
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,890
through the circulatory system,

530
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:48,130
your blood pressure is generated by the
heart and blood pressure ranges between

531
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:52,070
120 and 80 millimeters of mercury.
And we're going to see this in a,

532
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:52,851
in a few minutes,

533
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:56,990
but those numbers represent the maximum
pressure and the minimum pressure during

534
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:57,824
a heartbeat.

535
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,510
The maximum pressure occurs when the
heart is actively contracting or beating.

536
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,260
We'll talk about that more,
um,

537
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:08,150
in a few minutes and we'll talk about
that in great detail on Thursday.

538
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,040
And then it drops when the
heart is relaxing. So blood
pressures generated in a,

539
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,870
in a cyclic fashion because of beating
of the heart contract, relax, contract,

540
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:21,710
relax. 120, 80, 120, 8,000, 20, 80.

541
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,180
And that pressure of 100
2080 gets transmitted to the
aorta and the pressure in

542
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:29,810
the aorta is roughly the same
as it is in the, in the, uh,

543
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:33,590
in the, uh, in the heart. Now why is that?

544
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:35,960
Why isn't there a pressure
drop through the aorta? Well,

545
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:38,690
there is a pressure drop through
the aorta, but it's very small.

546
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,970
And the reason it's small is that the
aorta is big, has a large diameter,

547
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:48,350
and so it's resistance is low,
it's resistance is low.

548
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:51,890
And so in order to generate
five liters per minute of flow,

549
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,010
you don't need much pressure in order
to even this whopping flow that goes to

550
00:34:57,591 --> 00:35:00,800
the aorta.
Because of the large size of the aorta,

551
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,770
you don't need much pressure
drop to generate that flow.

552
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,240
So if I measured pressure drop over the
aorta from the beginning to the end of

553
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:11,960
the aorta, I'd find that pressure
doesn't really change very much.

554
00:35:11,961 --> 00:35:14,060
And that's what's shown
in this diagram here.

555
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,970
As I moved from the beginning of
the [inaudible] or to the end,

556
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,120
there must be some drop in pressure has
to be otherwise blood wouldn't flow at

557
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:27,530
all. Um, but there's not very
much of a drop. Similarly,

558
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:28,700
the large arteries,

559
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,660
which still have large
diameters have low resistances,

560
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:36,860
doesn't take much pressure to move a
flow rate through those large arteries.

561
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,780
So over the large arteries,
there's not much pressure drop either.

562
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:41,160
So this would be the branches,

563
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,420
like the bread and the main branch that
goes to your arm, the branch that goes,

564
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,200
the carotids that goes up to your brain,

565
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,510
the branch that goes down your
leg called the femoral artery.

566
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,670
It's still large arteries,
large diameter,

567
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,270
not much pressure drop needed
to generate a large flow.

568
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,310
As we move to more branches,
smaller and smaller vessels.

569
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,140
It turns out at some point, and the point
at which this occurs is the arterials,

570
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,930
the diameter has gotten small enough
that the resistance becomes significant

571
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,340
compared to the flow rate.

572
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,410
The resistance becomes significant
compared to the flow rate. Now,

573
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,260
there's so many branches
that occurred before this.

574
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,580
There's so many branches that these
individual vessels aren't getting five

575
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:26,670
liters per minute, right? They're only
getting some small fraction of that.

576
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,910
There might be a thousand of
these arterials, let's say it.

577
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:33,960
So they're all getting one 1000th of
the maximum flow. So how could that,

578
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,450
how could that pressure drop be more?

579
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,460
How come they need a big pressure drop,
which is what's illustrated here.

580
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,880
It takes a substantial drop in pressure
in order to move this lower flow rate

581
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:52,320
through the smaller vessels.
How could that be? Well,

582
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,460
remember that the resistance changed
with the radius to the fourth power,

583
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,880
and that means that as
the radius goes down,

584
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:05,450
it's not a linear relationship between
the radius going down and the resistance

585
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:11,220
going up. It's a fourth power
relationship. So as it gets, small,

586
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,550
resistance starts to become very,
very high.

587
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,970
When you divide a flow between vessels,
that's kind of a linear process,

588
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:24,280
right? It goes two ways. It goes
four ways. It goes eight, you know?

589
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,290
Okay.

590
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:31,290
But this radius to the fourth power
starts to dominate when you get down to a

591
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:35,860
certain radius and it turns out that
that's at the level of the arterials.

592
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,820
So most of the pressure
drop on this side of your,

593
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,730
on this left side of the
cardiovascular system,

594
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:46,000
most of the pressure drop occurs
at the level of the arterials.

595
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,420
There's a significant pressure drop
through the arteries and then not much

596
00:37:49,421 --> 00:37:51,130
pressure drop it all through the veins.

597
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:57,220
The veins are are low pressure vessels,
generally large in diameter,

598
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,880
and not much resistance to flow. Now, why,

599
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,690
if you were going to
design a system like this,

600
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,530
is there any advantage to having the
largest pressure drop occur over the

601
00:38:08,531 --> 00:38:13,531
arterials or the largest relative
resistance occurring over the arterials?

602
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:18,010
Well, there's a huge advantage because
wherever the pressure drop occurs,

603
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,090
that's the place where you have
an opportunity to adjust the flow.

604
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,940
That's the place where you have the best
opportunity to adjust the flow because

605
00:38:27,941 --> 00:38:32,590
small changes in radius are going
to lead to large changes in relative

606
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:33,460
resistance,

607
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,873
right?

608
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,390
So it's at the, it's at the arterials
or the very smallest arteries that are,

609
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,440
that are supplying blood to our tissues
where we have the most control over flow

610
00:38:47,731 --> 00:38:48,564
rate.

611
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,140
Okay.

612
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,310
And that makes sense because sometimes
you're not making big movements in blood

613
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:58,240
flow, like saying I want
very little blood flow to my,

614
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,140
to my gut and a lot of blood flow
to my muscle. That's a big change.

615
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,530
You're making smaller
changes within a tissue.

616
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,130
Like I want more blood to go to the
region of my brain that's involved in

617
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:13,600
talking and less to the region of
my brain that's involved in, in um,

618
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,710
in reading,

619
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,253
right?

620
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,380
When you're talking versus re,
right?

621
00:39:19,381 --> 00:39:24,180
You want to regulate where the
blood flows on a more smaller scale,

622
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,560
on a scale of a tissue and it's arterials
which are branching within tissues

623
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,000
that have the capacity to do that

624
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,920
so that you could do something like this.

625
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:36,750
And let's say this is a very
imaginary situation, but I,

626
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:41,080
I drew it just for illustrative purposes.
Let's say that this was, uh, this was, uh,

627
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,590
uh, uh, an artery that
was feeding some tissue.

628
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:49,010
And so there was a blood
flow that's coming in here
and it splits five different

629
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:49,844
ways.

630
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:54,500
And so here are five different regions
of the tissue that are served by these

631
00:39:54,501 --> 00:39:58,400
arterials. Now I could draw
this, one of the nice things,

632
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:01,630
if you do know this analogy
between, between, uh,

633
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,750
this equation describing pressure drop
flow relationships and this equation

634
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:10,751
describing voltage current relationships
is that you could draw a diagram for

635
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,850
pressure flow relationships.

636
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:17,840
It looks just like a circuit diagram
because the equations are the same.

637
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,220
And that's what I've done here is taken
this anatomical picture cartoon and

638
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:31,661
converted it into an equivalent circuit
where I'm not thinking about flow of,

639
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:37,520
um, of um, electronics. Now our current,

640
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:38,690
I'm thinking about flow of fluid,

641
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,630
but I'm drawing a resistance
not as an electrical resistance,

642
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:45,680
but as a flow resistance as this
kind of a resistance, right?

643
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,490
And let's say that the blood is flowing
in at a rate of 100 milliliters per

644
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:50,090
minute,

645
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:54,560
and that the resistance here is one
unit and the resistance here on each of

646
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:59,210
these smaller segments is
smaller or higher, right?
These are, these are smaller.

647
00:40:59,211 --> 00:41:02,960
It branches into smaller vessels so they
have a higher resistance and it's five

648
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:07,790
units here and one unit here.
And the units are these, well,

649
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,220
if,
if all the resistances are the same,

650
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,730
then the of the blood that flows in here,

651
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,210
it's going to flow equally
through each one of these tubes.

652
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:18,640
Okay.

653
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,560
It's got to flow equally
three each one of those tubes.

654
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,610
And so basically this hundred milliliters
permitted to flow gets split five ways,

655
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,093
right?

656
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,490
MMM. The uh, you could do
this calculation yourself.

657
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,940
The pressure here is just one millimeter
of mercury and if you did this a

658
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,970
calculation,
it should work out okay.

659
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,140
The total resistance of this circuit with
one millimeter mercury gives you a 100

660
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:43,520
milliliters per minute of flow.

661
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,463
Yeah.

662
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,940
Okay. What if one of these
vessels changes its diameter?

663
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,060
One of these vessels changes its diameter.

664
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,570
Let's say it's this one and let's
say that it shrinks. It's diameter.

665
00:41:55,571 --> 00:41:57,010
So this resistance goes up.

666
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,970
It goes up here from from
five units to a hundred units.

667
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:03,790
So I made a big change in that,
right?

668
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:08,290
It goes up by a factor of 20 so that
would be about a factor of two difference

669
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:11,980
in radius because of the fourth power,
right?

670
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,650
If this one goes up to a hundred,

671
00:42:14,651 --> 00:42:18,430
now there's more resistance through
this particular vessel here and the same

672
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:21,010
resistance through these three.
So what happens,

673
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,050
let's blow goes through this vessel

674
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,300
and the same flow goes through the others.

675
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:29,710
Yeah.

676
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,040
So that the total flow now
is 89 milliliters per minute.

677
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,700
Now why did the total could,
you could understand sorta cause that's,

678
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,870
that's pretty obvious,
right?

679
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:44,820
Why when I decreased the radius and
increased the resistance of this vessel,

680
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,370
why less flow went through
it then through its partners?

681
00:42:47,371 --> 00:42:50,220
That kind of makes sense.
I've got a smaller vessel.

682
00:42:50,221 --> 00:42:53,970
So now I've got four large
vessels in one smaller one,

683
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,490
and if I feed them with
the same pressure drop,

684
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,340
more of the flow is going to go through
the big vessels cause there's least

685
00:42:59,341 --> 00:43:03,440
resistance there.
Fluid takes the path of least resistance.

686
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,230
Some goes through, but not as
much. Right, that makes sense.

687
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,440
But why does the overall flow
through the whole circuit change?

688
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,800
Why does the overall flow
through this whole thing change?

689
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,520
Well, because if any one of the vessels
in here increases its resistance,

690
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,600
it increases the overall resistance
of the aggregate of vessels. Right.

691
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:28,770
And if the pressure that I have available
is constant and it is the pressure I

692
00:43:28,841 --> 00:43:32,350
have available as constant, in this
example, it's one millimeter mercury.

693
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,740
Then when the whole thing
increases its resistance,

694
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:38,770
that means the flow rate through the
whole circuit has to go down as well.

695
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,380
So there's two things that
are really illustrated here.

696
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,700
One is that you could regulate in,

697
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,240
in in pathways that are competing
with each other for flow.

698
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,580
Then the relative resistance between equal
members determines how much flow goes

699
00:43:56,581 --> 00:44:00,990
to each vessel. Right. That's
one thing that's illustrated.

700
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,850
The other is that the whole,

701
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,810
the flow through this whole
piece of the circulatory system,

702
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:11,700
this whole part of the network depends
on the resistance of every single vessel

703
00:44:11,701 --> 00:44:12,534
within it.

704
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,200
And so one vessel changing its
resistance changes the whole thing.

705
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,490
And that's a feature of our
circulatory system, right?

706
00:44:21,491 --> 00:44:23,410
If I want more blood to go to the brain,

707
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:26,700
there's two ways to get more
blood to the brain. Well,

708
00:44:26,701 --> 00:44:30,460
there's more than two ways, but
two ways. As long as the pressure,

709
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,010
blood stays the same.

710
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,990
One way is to dilate the vessels of
the brain to create less resistance.

711
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,190
There. The other way is to constrict the
vessels somewhere else to create more

712
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:46,170
resistance there. Either one of those is
going to get me more flow to the brain.

713
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,480
And so it's a very,
because it's a closed system,

714
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,510
everything is interconnected and a
change in flow in one place can influence

715
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:58,740
flows throughout the whole system.

716
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,463
Makes Sense.

717
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,300
I want to go back to this
picture now and um, and uh,

718
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,350
talk about what we've learned in terms of
flows and now you can think about this.

719
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:16,400
And a little bit different way that if
there's flows going through here and here,

720
00:45:16,401 --> 00:45:19,940
how much goes each way,
each direction depends on,

721
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,200
depends on the relative resistance
between this vessel and this vessel.

722
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,030
Yes.
It depends.

723
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:29,120
It does depend on the relative size
between this vessel and this vessel,

724
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:34,240
but it depends on the relative resistance
of the whole network after it as well.

725
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:38,450
It depends on the whole resistance.
Even if you have a big tube here,

726
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,660
if it's feeding lots of very
constricted tubes down here,

727
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,160
the overall resistance that the fluid
experiences at this branch point is going

728
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,720
to be high in this direction.

729
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,563
Right.

730
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,330
The whole, the resistance of
the whole circuit matters.

731
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,090
Yeah.

732
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:56,923
Um,

733
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,200
so think about that and then let's now
think about what's driving this flow.

734
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,550
That is what's generating the pressure
and you know that what's generating the

735
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:13,580
pressure is the heart. That's
the only place where, uh,

736
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:16,910
pressure gets generated
within this closed system.

737
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,160
And the pressure that's
generated by the heart,

738
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,320
which is experienced by the aorta,

739
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,950
is what drives flow throughout
all of these vessels.

740
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:31,040
And the only opportunity that individual
vessels out here have to adjust how

741
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:34,220
much flow goes to them is
by changing their diameters,

742
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,780
which they do,
right?

743
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:41,460
The only way to change the overall
rate of flow is to change the overall

744
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:43,440
pressure drop,
which can only be done by the heart.

745
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,880
How does the heart work?
Uh, well let me just,

746
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:53,900
just start this and then we'll talk about
this in in much more detail next time.

747
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,350
Uh, this is a picture of the,
of the heart. Um, it sits,

748
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:02,700
you know about the size of your fist,
basically in the center of your chest,

749
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:05,250
but shifted a little bit
to the left hand side.

750
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:08,670
You can find out where your desired by
just putting a finger there and feeling

751
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,260
where you can feel the heartbeat.

752
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,770
It's fairly easy to define
the apex of the heart.

753
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,910
The tip of it sits up, sits a
downward like that. And the,

754
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:21,450
and the major vessels are near the
center line. So the tip is down here,

755
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:25,430
the major vessels or near the
center line, right? The um,

756
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,350
the heart has muscular walls. The
walls of the, of the heart are,

757
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:33,400
are called the myocardium.
Uh, muscle heart.

758
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,720
Myo is muscle cardium is hard
and there's muscular walls,

759
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,800
so it's a big muscle basically.

760
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,810
And there are blood
vessels on the surface.

761
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:48,220
And so this is the order coming up here
where this Arrow is. Here is the aorta.

762
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,810
This is the aortic arch.

763
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,620
And then goes down to the
abdomen and up to the brain.

764
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,040
And these are those coronary
vessels that I mentioned earlier.

765
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:02,041
The first branches off of the aorta are
to these coronary arteries which branch

766
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:03,950
over the surface of the heart.

767
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:07,450
And so now you can see this branching
pattern more clearly in one particular

768
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:11,170
tissue. Here's, um, here's a coronary
artery that blood flows through.

769
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,720
Here's a branch one goes more to the left,

770
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:17,680
one goes more down the center line
branches again, ranches again.

771
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:22,780
And by continuously branching you
define our smaller arteries, which,

772
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,360
which serve smaller regions of tissue.

773
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,730
These are blood vessels, uh,
provide nutrients to the,

774
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:34,930
to the muscle in the muscular walls of
the heart that there are inflows and

775
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:37,780
outflows. You know, this
is the aorta up here.

776
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,250
This is the Vena Cava,
which is bringing blood back down here,

777
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:45,010
that the heart has a right
side and a left side.

778
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,410
If I wasn't divided it into the
right side and the left side,

779
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:52,120
I can put a dotted line here where the
left ventricle and left Atrium are on

780
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:56,890
this side of the line and the right
ventricle and the right atrium are on the

781
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:57,820
other side of the line.

782
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,750
And what we'll see when we talk about
this more next time is that the left side

783
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:03,760
of the heart is, uh, is, uh,

784
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,480
is more muscular and slightly larger
than the right side of the heart,

785
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,390
even though they're generating
the same flow rate. Right?

786
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,020
The left side of the heart
is, uh, is uh, uh, larger.

787
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,660
If we reduce this down
to a simpler picture,

788
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:24,490
this is where I'm going to start
next time and take out the a anatomy,

789
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:27,270
uh, and, and replace it
with this cartoon. Uh,

790
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:31,060
you can see that there's a difference
between the thickness of the muscular

791
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:31,451
walls.

792
00:49:31,451 --> 00:49:35,470
The muscular walls on the left side of
the heart are slightly thicker than the

793
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:37,630
muscular walls on the
right side of the heart.

794
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:40,450
You don't see them in this diagram,
but if you looked at a real heart,

795
00:49:40,451 --> 00:49:41,650
you would see that that's true.

796
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,770
And that the right and the left side of
the heart are divided into two chambers,

797
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:47,530
atrium, ventricle,
atrium, right ventricle,

798
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,420
left ventricle, right ventricle,
right atrium, left atrium,

799
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,380
and that the inflows and the
outflows are guarded by valves.

800
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,810
And there are four valves
that are important here.

801
00:49:58,811 --> 00:50:03,280
There's a valve which is shown by this
sort of floppy structure here between the

802
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:04,810
left Atrium and the left ventricle.

803
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,500
There's another valve between
the left ventricle and the aorta.

804
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,810
Same thing on the other side.

805
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:14,500
There's a valve between the right atrium
and the right ventricle and between the

806
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:16,660
right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.

807
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:21,310
And what we're going to talk about next
time is how these valves function in

808
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:26,311
order to convert the work that's done by
the heart in generating pressure into a

809
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:31,210
directional flow.
That's what we'll start with next time.
