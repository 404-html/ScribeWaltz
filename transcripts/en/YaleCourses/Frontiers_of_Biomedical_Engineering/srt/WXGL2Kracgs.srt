1
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,610
This week we're going to talk about about
DNA technology and genetic engineering.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,940
And so this is chapter three of the book.
And uh,

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,890
some of this will be familiar to some
of you who've had biology in high school

4
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,130
or other places, you know,
something about Dna. In fact,

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,090
if you haven't had a biology class,
um, it's hard to be, you know,

6
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,620
alive in 2008 to not know something
about DNA. It's become such an important,

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,100
uh, important part of
our, uh, of our lives.

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,030
So I'm going to ask you to, um, to um,

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,410
indulge me while I go back
to the beginning and talk
about some things that you

10
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:52,110
know, but I'm going to go
through this pretty rapidly. Uh,

11
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:54,450
and I think the book has a
fairly good description of it.

12
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,000
So if you don't pick up
everything in the lecture,

13
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,560
hopefully you've read that beforehand,

14
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:02,610
you can go back to it afterwards and
read about things that didn't make sense.

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,210
So we'll talk about some chemistry today,
what DNA molecules are like,

16
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,920
why they have the behavior that they do.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,820
And you need to understand this in order
to understand how you manipulate DNA.

18
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,620
And so my goal today is to talk about
sort of the basics of the molecules.

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,570
They're chemistry,
the function of DNA in cells,

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,420
sort of the basic,
the basic side of that.

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,310
And then on Thursday we're going to
start talking about how to manipulate DNA

22
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,940
and get closer to using it
in biomedical engineering.

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,220
So DNA is a double helix.
You A, you know this,

24
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,240
the double helix was the structure of
DNA was discovered about the time that I

25
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:45,960
was born. And so it's been
known throughout your lifetimes.

26
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,490
You've always lived with it. But it's
really remarkable how fast, how far,

27
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,170
how fast we have come from just knowing
the structure of this molecule to being

28
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,810
able to manipulate it and
study it in great detail.

29
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,980
So I want to start by showing you this
cartoon that you already know about what

30
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:03,510
the structure of a double helix.

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,560
So it's a twisted ladder and there's a
couple of things to notice about this

32
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:08,760
familiar structure.

33
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,380
One is that there are two
backbones right here in the,

34
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:15,740
in the light blue.
So this would be the,

35
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:19,020
the upright parts of the ladder
that are twisted. And those,

36
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:23,160
those are two continuous strands that
wind around each other to form the double

37
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:23,881
helix.
Right?

38
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:27,720
So one thing to notice is this is this
part of the double helix that we'll call

39
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:31,110
the backbone. The backbone is
on the outside of the molecule,

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,980
like the up right struts of a
ladder on the outside of a ladder.

41
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,380
Right on the inside are the,

42
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,380
are the rungs or the struts
that hold the ladder together.

43
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,620
And there are several things that
you'll notice about the struts in this

44
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,840
particular cartoon.
Uh,

45
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:50,430
one is that there's four different colors
and so you can see red, blue, yellow,

46
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,670
green here, four different
colors. And that's all there are.

47
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:57,030
There aren't more than for that.
There are two colors per strut.

48
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,220
So what's linking the
two backbones together?

49
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,230
Our two colored segments that come from
the outside towards the middle and um,

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,380
that the color's occur only in
certain combinations. Red and green,

51
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,040
yellow and blue, that's all you
see. You don't see a red and yellow,

52
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,890
you don't see green and blue.
Right. And this is a feature of, of,

53
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:21,340
of DNA shown in this cartoon a form.
So if you can keep that,

54
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,640
that sort of schematic in mind,

55
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,640
it makes it a lot easier to
understand the detailed structure.

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,970
And that's what I want to do for the
first few minutes of the lecture here is

57
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:34,810
tell you a little bit about the details
of the structure and how molecules fit

58
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:39,460
into this. This image of DNA that's
already very familiar to you.

59
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,460
But the things that you need to know
are the things that are really listed on

60
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:45,160
this slide, right? You're going
to know more details about it.

61
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:49,160
They're not really colors right there,
chemicals but specific chemicals. Um,

62
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,780
and um,
but the pattern is the same.

63
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,070
So the molecules that really make up DNA
are nucleotides and DNA is a polymer of

64
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,930
nucleotides.

65
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,000
And a polymer is just a large molecule
that's made up of repeated units. Right?

66
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:10,840
And so we're familiar with polymers,
plastics in our daily life.

67
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,150
You know the chairs that you're
sitting on are made of a,

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,360
of a kind of a plastic polymer that is
basically an organic chemical that is

69
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,220
cross linked together.
Cross is not the right word,

70
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,580
that is chemically a bonded with repeat
units to make large molecules that when

71
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,510
you have a bunch of
large molecules together,

72
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:38,020
they have certain physical properties
like the solid property of the plastic

73
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,810
that you're sitting on.
Well,

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,770
nucleus nucleic acids of
which DNA as an example,

75
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,890
our polymers of nucleotides and so the
repeating unit in DNA is this structure

76
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,830
here. A nucleotide which
has three different regions.

77
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,820
There's a sugar,
a five carbon sugar,

78
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,650
which forms the core of the nucleotide
and attached to this five carbon sugar at

79
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:10,651
specific positions on the
sugar relative to this oxygen,

80
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,040
which is part of the sugar
ring is a phosphate group,

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,300
phosphate and an organic base.

82
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,030
And when these nucleotides get
polymerize to form a long DNA molecule,

83
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:28,480
they all get polymerized in exactly the
same way. The chemistry is the same,

84
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,690
is that the phosphate group
of one nucleotide gets
linked to the sugar group of

85
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,900
another nucleotide. And I'm going
to show you that in a few minutes.

86
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,190
So what's going to form the
backbone is this continual link,

87
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,900
phosphate, sugar, phosphate,
sugar, phosphate to sugar,

88
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,500
all linked together to form one long,
long molecule.

89
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,030
And what's hanging off of the side of
this long molecule that's formed by

90
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,470
polymerizing nucleotides are,
is this base unit.

91
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,420
So it's the phosphate in the end,
the pentose that make up the backbone,

92
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,950
they'd make up the upright
struts of the ladder.

93
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,120
And it's the basis that make up
the connecting struts, right?

94
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,710
So the basis or the colors, there
are four different, uh, uh, bases,

95
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,930
which I'll talk about in a moment.

96
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,710
We're going to talk about two
different nucleic acid molecules,

97
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,530
two different nucleic acid polymers.

98
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:32,100
One is DNA deoxyribonucleic acid,

99
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:34,380
the other is RNA ribonucleic acid.

100
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,150
And one of the differences between the
two is that the Pintos or the sugar that

101
00:06:39,151 --> 00:06:42,750
makes up DNA is deoxyribose shown here.

102
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,520
And the Pintos that makes up
RNA is ribos shown here, right?

103
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,370
So every pentose in a DNA
polymer is deoxyribose.

104
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,510
The phosphate is linked to
this carbon on the Pantos.

105
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,200
And notice it, there's a number on this
carbon, it's called the five prime carbon.

106
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,460
And this is a convention that organic
chemists use when they're describing

107
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,930
molecules like this,

108
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,220
they'd like to be able to refer to each
carbon separately so they can talk about

109
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:17,730
reactions with this molecule.
And so the number of the carbons,

110
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,110
and in this case this,
these pintos molecules,

111
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,380
whether it's ribose or Deoxyribose,
the carbons are numbered.

112
00:07:25,381 --> 00:07:29,190
The same one prime to prime,
three prime for prime, five prime.

113
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,800
Those are the five carbons
that make up the Pintos.

114
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,560
So I could refer to the four
prime carbon and you'd know,

115
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:37,920
I mean this one or the two prime
carbon, I, you know, I need this one.

116
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,610
The ones that are important to us or the
three prime carbon and the five prime

117
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:42,444
carbon.

118
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,830
And the reason for that is that the five
prime carbon is where the phosphate is

119
00:07:46,831 --> 00:07:50,110
attached.
And Nucleotide,

120
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:53,300
the phosphates always attached to
the five prime carbon. All right.

121
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,450
And the reason the three prime is
important is that when you polymerize two

122
00:07:58,451 --> 00:08:02,650
nucleotides together and a third
nucleotide and a fourth nucleotide,

123
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:06,160
when you polymerize nucleotides together,
they get polymerized.

124
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,540
The phosphate of one gets linked to
the three prime carbon of another.

125
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,413
Okay?

126
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,690
No. So this is important
because this molecule here,

127
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:20,860
deoxyribose is not the
same upside down as it is.

128
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:23,860
It's not symmetrical upside
down and right side up.

129
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,550
It's a different molecule because the
five prime carbons either pointed out per

130
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:31,660
pointed down. And so the
nucleotide has a directionality.

131
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,100
There's an up and a down to it and it's
going to turn out that the chain that's

132
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:39,490
formed by polymerizing,
these has a directionality as well.

133
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,780
And that's important in
defining the structure. Okay?

134
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,580
So these are the penthouses, this, uh,

135
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,380
and remember five prime and three prime
because that orients you with respect to

136
00:08:50,381 --> 00:08:54,370
what direction
the molecules facing.

137
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,520
Now the base is, uh, you and, and we,

138
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,120
you don't need to memorize the
structures of these. I'm going to,

139
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:04,320
I'm describing the whole molecule to
you in its sort of molecular detail and

140
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:08,010
then we're going to simplify it down to
a version that we can talk about more

141
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:10,950
easily,
but to give you all the detail,

142
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:15,120
there's two sort of classes
of bases that appear here. Uh,

143
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,170
one class is called the Purina and they
have to ring like structures and there

144
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,280
are two of them that are
going to be important to us.

145
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:26,730
One is Adenine and the
other is Guanine shown here.

146
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,530
And because saying adenine takes a long
time and saying Guanine takes a long

147
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:34,920
time, we're going to simplify it
by calling adenine and Guanine G.

148
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,183
All right.

149
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,140
The second class is the perimeter teams
and there's three of those that are

150
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:44,440
important. You're a sill,
thymine and cytosine,

151
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,830
which we're going to simplify
it by calling you t. And. C.

152
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,100
Yeah.

153
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,210
Now remember that there were four only
four different colors in the cartoon of

154
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:55,910
the DNA double helix that we talked about.

155
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,230
And I told you that those colors
are really represent the bases,

156
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,940
but there's five of them here.

157
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:03,940
Okay.

158
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,661
There's five,

159
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:09,160
because there's one of these
that's particular to RNA
only that appears in only

160
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:11,500
RNA and there's one of them
that appears in only DNA.

161
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,200
The one that appears only
in RNA is you're a sale.

162
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,560
The one that appears only in DNA is,
is timing.

163
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,790
And so in DNA there's only four colors.
There's only four bases.

164
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,630
CTG A and RNA.

165
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,660
There's four bases a g you see.
All right,

166
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,280
so you and t are interchangeable in the
sense that you appears where ti would

167
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:41,860
appear in uh, in a RNA. And t appears
where you would appear in DNA.

168
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,003
All right?

169
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,910
If I drew this altogether, and this
is one particular nucleic acid again,

170
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,630
now shown in more detail,
the all of the carbons of the,

171
00:10:53,631 --> 00:10:55,400
of the Pintos are shown here.

172
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,550
The phosphate is shown and a base is
shown in this particular base is Adenine.

173
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,130
This is ribos.

174
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,080
So this is a monomer or a single
unit from an RNA molecule.

175
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,820
You know that because it's ribos and
it's the particular molecule that has a,

176
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:15,080
as it's organic base,

177
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,330
we don't need to really talk about
all the molecular detail in order to

178
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:27,800
completely describe a DNA or an RNA
molecule because these structures repeat

179
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,150
themselves,
right?

180
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:33,500
Every unit in the backbone
of this ladder has the same

181
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,710
sugar unit,
the Saint Pintos.

182
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,570
It's either it's either RNA or
DNA and has ribose or deoxyribose.

183
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,310
So you don't need to
describe the whole thing.

184
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:47,030
You can just say it's RNA or DNA and
you know everything about the Pintos in

185
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,380
every molecule on the chain.

186
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,710
You don't need to say anything more
about the phosphate because they all have

187
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,500
the phosphate,
right.

188
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,730
And every set of these is
hooked together in the same way.

189
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,050
So the five prime carbon has a phosphate
off of it and that phosphate is linked

190
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:05,320
to the three prime carbon of the next one.
Right?

191
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,110
And they all have a base
hanging off the side.

192
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:12,190
So the only thing I need to say in order
to distinguish this particular part of

193
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:16,810
the chemistry of a DNA and RNA molecules
is say it's DNA or it's RNA and what

194
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:21,010
the base is, right? And that
tells, and if I told you that,

195
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,820
draw me a nucleotide from
RNA that has adenine,

196
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,190
you could go back to this picture
and you could draw the whole thing.

197
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,520
So you can just talk
about it in a simpler way.

198
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,200
You can say a polymer
of of DNA for example,

199
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
is four bases long.

200
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,820
That means it has four of these repeat
units and they go in the sequence from

201
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:46,990
five prime to three prime of a g t,
g.

202
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,160
And if I told you that a DNA sequence
went five prime to three prime a GTC TG,

203
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,210
you could, you could draw the whole thing
referring back to these notes, right?

204
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,080
In fact, you don't have to
draw it this complicated way.

205
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,570
You could just draw it as align,
right?

206
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,210
With a g t and g hanging off of it.

207
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,450
And you would know that that's a DNA
molecule for bases long that it, uh,

208
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,500
right now,
what does the line represent here?

209
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:17,050
This represents the upright stretch
because on the ladder that I showed you

210
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:20,100
before, it represents this
backbone that's shown by, that's,

211
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,910
that's formed by polymerizing.

212
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,590
The pentose is together through phosphates
always going five prime to three

213
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:27,730
prime,
five prime to three prime.

214
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:32,320
So I could take and draw a
line continually down the
molecule where my finger

215
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:36,340
was touching, right? My finger
would be touching a phosphate here.

216
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,070
The five prime carbon,
the four prime carbon,

217
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,200
the three prime carbon
and the next phosphate.

218
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,740
Yeah,

219
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,180
so the backbone is what? It's phosphate
carbon, carbon, carbon phosphate,

220
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:48,680
carbon carbon or carbon phosphate.

221
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,560
And it has this structure
hanging off the side.

222
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,020
Now DNA is a double helix and I've
only shown you one part of the Helix,

223
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:02,030
right? I've shown you one upright
strut and a base hanging off of it,

224
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,360
but it forms a double helix because
complimentary strands of DNA strongly

225
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:11,000
associate with one another and
that's a very stable structure.

226
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,600
And they do that because the basis
can interact with one another.

227
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:15,740
In particular ways,

228
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,420
and this you know about this was the
famous finding of Watson and Crick and

229
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:23,150
describing the structure of DNA.

230
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,200
And this is what this diagram shows you,

231
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,990
is the forces that hold these ducts,
these,

232
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,220
these individual strands of DNA
into a double stranded form.

233
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,810
And they,

234
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,840
the forces are occur because of hydrogen
bonding between complimentary pairs of

235
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:47,321
the basis and the coupler mentoree pairs
are adenine and thymine a and t and

236
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,960
Guanine and cytosine GC.
Now,

237
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:54,830
if read in the book you read about where
this big year is shown in the book,

238
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,120
you can understand more about why these
structures line up in the right way so

239
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:02,180
that the right molecular
elements are together to form

240
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,500
hydrogen bonding pairs between them.
Uh,

241
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,740
that's really beyond what I'll be asking
you to understand for the course. But,

242
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,350
but you can, you can understand
that if you read it, I'm sure

243
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,520
now it remember that,
um,

244
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,480
that I mean only appears in a
DNA and Duracell appears in RNA.

245
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,750
And so you're a cell can also form a
hydrogen binding pair with Adenine.

246
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:26,660
Okay.

247
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,690
So the whole structure of a
DNA molecule looks like this.

248
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,230
Going back to a more cartoon
version like I showed you before,

249
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,730
but adding some detail onto it.

250
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:38,750
Now there are two uprights struts of
the latter one shown in blue here.

251
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,890
The other show in black,

252
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,790
they are linked together by four
different colored segments indicated here,

253
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:49,850
not by colors now, but
by letters. It's DNA.

254
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:53,780
So it's [inaudible] and
they always occur in pairs.

255
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,190
Where before it was two colored pairs.
Now as two letter pairs, g c t a.

256
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,310
Okay.

257
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,930
The chains are different
now. They weren't,

258
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,630
they were colored the same.
The backbones were colored.

259
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:08,860
The same in the diagram there.

260
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:12,640
Color different here to indicate one
new difference that you know about now.

261
00:16:12,641 --> 00:16:14,110
And that's that there's an orientation,

262
00:16:14,111 --> 00:16:19,111
there's an up and down on the chain
and that's due to the asymmetry of the

263
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,400
nucleotides,

264
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,310
that there's a five prime to three prime
end and the way that they're linked

265
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:24,671
together.

266
00:16:24,671 --> 00:16:29,440
So this blue chain here goes from
five prime carbon all along the chain.

267
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:32,410
And there's a three prime
carbon left open at the bottom,

268
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,923
right.

269
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,070
So if I wanted it to link another
nucleotide to this DNA chain,

270
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,930
what would I attach here on the bottom,

271
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,220
I would have chat attached the phosphate
that's connected to the five prime

272
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:50,200
carbon of another nucleotide,
right? I would link this one.

273
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,500
All right.

274
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,390
Facing in this direction, I
would add onto this, right?

275
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,000
The other chain is facing
in the other direction.

276
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,730
The three prime carbon is up
to five prime carbon is down,

277
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,213
right?

278
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,700
And remember that this molecule,
let's look at the, at the,

279
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:14,050
at the blue one wouldn't be the same
if I turned it upside down, right?

280
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:19,300
It wouldn't be the same if I turned it
upside down because the carbons, the, the,

281
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,330
the rings here, the pentose
is, would all be turned over.

282
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,840
The chemistry would look different,
right?

283
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,030
And the sequence of basis
would look different.

284
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,343
The

285
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,080
corresponding half of the ladder
that corresponds to any given ladder,

286
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:43,571
let's say the black DNA molecule that
corresponds to the blue one is not just a

287
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,920
mirror image,
we call it the compliment.

288
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,910
We call it the compliment
and each strand of DNA,

289
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:59,060
each polymer of DNA that you could
make or you could draw has only one

290
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:04,110
compliment. And that compliment
has the following features. One,

291
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,660
it's chain is oriented in
the opposite direction,

292
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,430
okay?

293
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,440
Where this one goes,
five prime to three prime.

294
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:13,650
This one goes three prime to five prime.

295
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,710
It's oriented in the opposite direction
and it has the complimentary base pairs

296
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,110
at each position where there's an a here,

297
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:25,800
there's gotta be a t here where there's
a t here that's got to be an a here

298
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,140
where there's,
let's see here at g,

299
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,720
g a c and that's because you
have to satisfy this base
pair matching in order to

300
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:37,830
have hydrogen bonding in each of the
struts of the ladder in order to form a

301
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:38,910
stable structure,

302
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,743
right?

303
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,380
If I'm talking about two DNA strands
and they differ only in one or two base

304
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:50,130
pairs, they won't be exact complements
and they won't form this double helix.

305
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,263
Okay.

306
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,210
This, um, this notion of complimentary
strands is very important.

307
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,680
It's the way the DNA exists
inside the cells of your body.

308
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:07,460
It exists as in a double stranded form
where every strand is matched by its

309
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:11,810
compliment. And these,
these, uh, molecules of DNA,

310
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:14,920
very long molecules of DNA are,
uh,

311
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,960
are condensed and packaged within the
nucleus of every cell in your body.

312
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,950
Every cell in your body has
exactly the same DNA. That is,

313
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:28,700
if I could stretch out all the DNA
and look at the base pair sequence,

314
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,260
the sequence of basis along all
the DNA and your chromosomes,

315
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,210
they'd be identical in all the cells
may be different in each of us.

316
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,350
And that leads to the difference in the
diversity between people. All right,

317
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,340
and so you, you've heard about
the human genome project,

318
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:49,670
we'll talk about that a little bit later,
but the,

319
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:54,671
the goal of that was to take for
a typical human or for a typical,

320
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,700
in the case, the human genome project.
Maybe you're looking at fruit flies.

321
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,980
He went to look at all
the DNA in a fruit fly,

322
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,780
but to look at the sequence of base pairs
that makes up human DNA and write them

323
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:08,600
all out. Right. We'll
talk about that later.

324
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,090
This slide shows one important sort of
feature of the physical chemistry of DNA

325
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:17,660
that turns out to be very important for
all of the technology that is built on

326
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:18,494
DNA.

327
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,090
And it has to do with the nature of this
complimentary binding between double

328
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:28,010
stranded DNA and the fidelity of this,

329
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,490
of this base pair matching,
informing,

330
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,950
informing stable DNA molecules.

331
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,600
And I told you that the fidelity
is very high. What does that mean?

332
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,780
That only strands that have the exact
compliment can form double stranded DNA.

333
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,310
Because of that,

334
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:51,311
you can do the experiment and it's a
simple experiment is simple to understand

335
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:54,040
but,
but the concept is very important.

336
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,680
So I encourage you to think about
it and make sure you understand it,

337
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,040
is that if I took two double stranded DNA
molecules and I expose them to certain

338
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,950
conditions that caused them to denature,

339
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,710
that means it's native
structure falls apart,

340
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,350
nature native structure falls apart.

341
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,680
The native structure is this
double stranded structure here.

342
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,280
And if I heat it up slightly
and I add some bass,

343
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,080
so under slightly basic conditions,

344
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,040
these molecules will fall apart because
you've created conditions where the

345
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:28,660
hydrogen bonding is no longer favorable.
So they, they, they peel apart.

346
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,820
And so if I had a beaker sitting on the
table here and it contained a million

347
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,680
blue double stranded DNA molecules
and a million red double stranded DNA

348
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,600
molecules and I heated it
up and add a little base,

349
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,310
I'd soon have 4 million individual strands
just floating around in the solution

350
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,180
because I've broken up this hydrogen
bonding and the DNA molecules fall apart

351
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,670
and that's called denaturing DNA.

352
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,680
So that tells you something about the
physical chemistry of the molecule,

353
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:01,420
that it's these hydrogen bonds that hold
the double strands together and I can

354
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,000
break those down under certain conditions.

355
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,890
If I then if I then put it back
into its original condition,

356
00:22:08,891 --> 00:22:10,300
lower the heat,

357
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:15,130
say temperature back to body temperature
and reduce the Ph down to seven.

358
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:17,560
Again,
the molecules will re nature,

359
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:20,680
they will reform their natural structure.

360
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,930
And for DNA that means forming double
helixes. But they will do that in a,

361
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:27,400
in a very particular way.

362
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,150
And that only strands that exactly match,

363
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,070
we'll be able to reform their
native structure. Right?

364
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,120
So a blue strand here,

365
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:42,121
we'll never re nature with the red strand
because their sequences don't match

366
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,363
exactly.

367
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,680
Okay.

368
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:53,570
But a complimentary blue strand will
always rematch with its with its partner.

369
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,850
Right now this is the basis of a,
of a uh,

370
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,530
physical chemistry process
called hybridization.

371
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,770
And it turns out that this is how we can
identify specific DNA sequences and how

372
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:13,970
we can do things like DNA fingerprinting,
how we can clone molecules,

373
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
DNA molecules from one
organism to another.

374
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,970
Rely very heavily on this principle
of rename duration and hybridization.

375
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,460
And hybridization simply means that
DNA will rename chair and form a stable

376
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:32,720
double helix only with
its particular match.

377
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,500
Okay.

378
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,220
Only with the hybrid that it
is perfectly complimentary too.

379
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,600
That's something about
physical chemistry of Dna,

380
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,660
what it looks like and how
it behaves in a simple sense.

381
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,010
What I want to spend the rest of the time,
uh,

382
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:58,070
doing is talking about some of
the biological properties of DNA.

383
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,460
And again, I know this is something that's
familiar to most of you and so I uh,

384
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,440
indulge me just for the rest of
this lecture, I'll go through it.

385
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:10,490
I want to try to hit the points that I
think are important to remember because

386
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,790
they're going to be concepts that come
up again and again throughout the course.

387
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,190
And I want to make sure
that we're on the same page.

388
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,970
So this diagram at the top here is
a very familiar one to most of you.

389
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:24,971
It's sometimes called the central dogma
of molecular biology and it indicates

390
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:29,960
how information flows in
cells and indicates a lot
about the work that is cell

391
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:34,760
does in a maintaining and recreating
itself and maintaining its environment.

392
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,240
And that is that the
information needed to operate.

393
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:43,241
A cell is stored in its DNA and that
information gets put into action through a

394
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:46,670
process of biological
process called transcription,

395
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,880
where particular regions of DNA are
transcribed into RNA and that RNA is made

396
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:58,670
into proteins and proteins are the
working molecules of the cell are enzymes.

397
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,020
They're structural molecules,

398
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,920
they're proteins that exist
in the membrane that allow
things to go in and out

399
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:04,754
of a sale.

400
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,760
So really the working molecules of the
cell in every sense and RNA is converted

401
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:12,650
into protein by a process
called translation.

402
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,460
And here's another picture of it here
showing it a little bit more detail that

403
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:22,640
you have lots of DNA in each
of the cells in your body,

404
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,700
but you're not using all
that DNA at any one time.

405
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,440
Every cell in your body is only using a
fraction of the DNA that's available to

406
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:33,350
it.
Cells in your pancreas for example,

407
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:37,490
or making the protein insulin and
they're making that because you need this

408
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:37,881
protein.

409
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:41,300
Insulin is a hormone and it's important
for sugar metabolism in your body.

410
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,920
And so those cells in your
pancreas are making insulin.

411
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,490
That means the gene that encodes insulin,

412
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,090
the sequence of base
pairs that encode insulin.

413
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:56,180
And I'll talk about what that means
and coding insulin means in a minute,

414
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,390
but there's a gene that tells your body
what insulin looks like and that gets

415
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:03,950
trans greived.

416
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,270
Okay.

417
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,270
But only in those cells that make insulin
and it gets converted into a protein

418
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:14,270
insulin only in those cells that are
able to make the RNA that are able to

419
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:15,800
express the protein.
Right?

420
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,503
Okay.

421
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,270
Well, it turns out that proteins are
essential in driving this process too.

422
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,530
And in order to have DNA,
you have to make DNA.

423
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,840
And yourselves are continually making
DNA inside your body through a process of

424
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,240
DNA synthesis.
And that sin,

425
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,360
that synthesis is occurring because
of the presence of an enzyme,

426
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:42,860
a protein called DNA polymerase. And the
same way this process of transcription,

427
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:46,650
which is occurring in cells throughout
your body all the time is made possible

428
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:51,651
by a protein called RNA
polymerase that allows a RNA,

429
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,330
uh, to be made from a
DNA template. All right?

430
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,820
So it's not as simple as DNA going to
RNA going to protein because protein's

431
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:02,670
need to be present in order to
make these things happen as well,

432
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,323
right?

433
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,800
Let's talk about DNA synthesis
for a minute. So when a
cell divides in your body,

434
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:13,100
when cells of your intestine divide,
when cells of your skin divide,

435
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,140
and they're doing this all the time in
order for a cell to divide and form two

436
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:20,690
daughter cells,
we'll talk about that process next week.

437
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,400
But in order for that to happen,

438
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,550
the parents cell has to copy all of its
DNA in order to have enough DNA to pass

439
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:30,830
on to two daughter cells,
right?

440
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,530
And it does that through a
process of DNA synthesis.

441
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,370
And what happens is the
machinery of the cell,

442
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,430
largely this protein DNA polymerase is
able to open up the double stranded DNA

443
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,310
to denature it locally,
exposing two strands,

444
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,200
which it then makes,
allows to make copies of.

445
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,770
And what's shown here is what's
called a replication fork.

446
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,740
It's in DNA that's undergoing synthesis.

447
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,010
The DNA molecule here
has been spread apart,

448
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,730
opening up to single stranded Dnas,

449
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,860
which have complimentary base sequences
because they were double stranded DNA.

450
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,490
And then a new single stranded DNA is
formed on each one of these open single

451
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:20,534
strands.

452
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,710
And so DNA is replicated using one
strand of the DNA as a template,

453
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,283
right?

454
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,380
The result of this process,
if it's replication went down,

455
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:38,270
the whole length of the DNA would be to
form two identical double stranded DNA

456
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:39,860
molecules.
All right,

457
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,030
now the book talks about more detail
about this and you can read about it.

458
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,050
Polymerase needs a primer and that
turns out to be important. Um,

459
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,500
and a primer is a short RNA sequence or,

460
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,940
or a DNA sequence that, uh,
gets sort of the, the, um,

461
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,040
the process of replication jumpstarted.

462
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,550
And that's just because of the biological
properties of DNA polymerase at that

463
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:02,990
primers needed synthesis.

464
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:07,820
A Co always occurs in one direction and
that makes sense to you now because you

465
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:11,300
know there's a directionality and the
chemistry is different going one way and

466
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:14,600
the other and this DNA polymerase only
works on the chemistry going in one

467
00:29:14,601 --> 00:29:19,601
direction and that that and that the
correct a compliment is made because of

468
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:24,620
these principles of what Sin Crick base
pairing that we talked about before.

469
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,850
It's easy to know what nucleotide to put
in each position as you're going along

470
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:30,380
and pull it memorizing a new molecule

471
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,810
because of this process occurs this way.

472
00:29:34,811 --> 00:29:39,250
If a parent's cell replicates its DNA and
then passes them along to two daughter

473
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:43,750
cells, one of the daughter has
one strand from the parent,

474
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,600
the dark blue strand here.
For example,

475
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:50,410
the other daughter cell has the light
Blue Strand, the complimentary strand,

476
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,330
and each of the daughter cells has
a newly synthesized piece of DNA,

477
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,083
right?

478
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,850
So that's synthesis and that has to
happen in order for cells to replicate and

479
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:06,430
cell replication is happening
in your body all the time.

480
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,890
Transcription is also happening.

481
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Certain segments of DNA are
being converted into RNA
and whereas in replication

482
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,420
you have to copy the whole genome,
the whole, all of the chromosomes,

483
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:23,050
all of the DNA contained
in the chromosomes of the
cell in order to completely

484
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:23,890
replicate it.

485
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,060
Transcription only works on
particular sequences of DNA.

486
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,500
The w the DNA that encodes the proteins
that are important to the life of that

487
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,400
cell. A pancreas cell in
the pancreas for example,

488
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,480
needs to make insulin and so the
gene for insulin is transcribed and

489
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:45,481
transcription just means making a single
stranded RNA copy of a sequence of base

490
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:51,220
pairs in a DNA.

491
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,750
I told you that that's driven by
a protein called RNA polymerase.

492
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,820
RNA polymerase is smart.

493
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,880
It knows where it needs to go in order
to make the copy of RNA that's required.

494
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:10,050
It operates in a similar fashion to DNA
polymerase and that it denatures locally

495
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:12,670
or opens up the double stranded DNA,

496
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,210
but it's different in that it creates a
new polymer from the DNA template in the

497
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:24,820
language of RNA using RNA,
nucleotides and not DNA nucleotides.

498
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:29,650
And the end result of transcription
is not double stranded DNA.

499
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:34,890
It's single stranded RNA where the RNA
that's produced is called Messenger Rna.

500
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,650
Okay.

501
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,460
It's the transcribed
version of DNA.

502
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,600
Um,

503
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,600
and it's the exact complement
of a particular region of DNA.

504
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,030
Again, more details in your book
if you want to read that. Well,

505
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:58,000
what I said is not entirely true.
Um,

506
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,350
that used to be the way that we thought
about it, right? DNA goes to RNA,

507
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:03,790
goes to protein.
That's it.

508
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,990
And that is the way it happens in simple
organisms like bacteria and complex

509
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:12,040
organisms like humans. There's another
step that we're still only learning about.

510
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:16,420
Now. We know some parts of
it, we don't know all of it,
but it's very important in,

511
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,930
um, in the biological
operation of human cells.

512
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:24,970
And that step is RNA splicing
or processing of this RNA,

513
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,390
single stranded RNA that's
produced by transcription.

514
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,010
And we're going to talk more about this
as we go through some specific examples

515
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,920
of where RNA processing is important.
Um,

516
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,500
for now,

517
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,160
just think modifying your picture of
this sort of information flow through a

518
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:48,140
CELDT include another step that RNA is
produced by transcription from DNA double

519
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:53,141
stranded DNA goes to a single stranded
RNA molecule and that RNA is processed in

520
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:57,740
the cell in some way in order
to form message your RNA.

521
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,930
And one of the forms of
processing that happens, uh,

522
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,900
that's very important in human,
uh, in, in human, uh, gene, uh, uh,

523
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,930
expression is that some of the sections
of the DNA molecule are not really

524
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,990
necessary for describing the protein,

525
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,350
the regions that are necessary for
describing what the protein is like are

526
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,900
called Exxon's. The regions
that are not are called introns,

527
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,490
a section of DNA that is
responsible for encoding a gene.

528
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,530
Let's say it's the
insulin gene for example,

529
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:35,180
might be some stretch of DNA on a
certain chromosome inside yourselves,

530
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,600
inside the cells of the pancreas.
And if it was directly transcribed,

531
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:41,750
there'd be regions that are important
for making insulin and regions that are

532
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:42,584
not.

533
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,980
And those regions that are not are spliced
out during RNA processing to form the

534
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:52,880
Mrf a transcript that's
used to make the protein.

535
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,070
Now there are other kinds of processing
that can happen to RNA as well.

536
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:02,990
And again, I said this is, this is
really still an emerging science. Uh,

537
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:06,980
but this is one that's well known and you
could imagine that it's important if I

538
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:10,100
want to clone a gene from a human right,

539
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:12,290
if I want to clone the
gene for human insulin,

540
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:15,920
mean make many copies of the gene
that's responsible for making insulin.

541
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,420
I sh I need to know whether they're
introns, they are not right.

542
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,300
And if I'm going to
make insulin from this,

543
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:26,840
I have to know that I've got the
entrance spliced out correctly

544
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,130
so that that's something that will
come up in the lecture tomorrow.

545
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:35,480
So remember that concept and that revision
of this sort of classical picture.

546
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,810
Um, I don't want to go through this
in detail because I assumed that you,

547
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
you know, it. Plus,

548
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:44,840
I think it's a little bit easier to
read and have some time to digest.

549
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,080
But this process of translation
or conversion of messenger
RNA into protein is a

550
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:54,440
complicated biological process
that's occurring all the time.

551
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,610
Before we talked about how do you
know what messenger RNA to make,

552
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:03,080
how do you know what, what, what
RNA to copy from a DNA template.

553
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,540
Will you do that by this
Watson Crick base pairing?

554
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,050
So I know if I have a g c g a,

555
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,550
I know what messenger RNA to make from
that because I have to satisfy these base

556
00:35:13,551 --> 00:35:14,690
pairing rules.

557
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:19,340
It's more complicated in making
protein from an RNA strand.

558
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:23,150
And that complication is
called the genetic code.

559
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:29,020
And you know that you probably know that
a messenger RNA is read in three base

560
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,370
units called Code Ons.

561
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,360
And so this particular piece
of Messenger Rna is, uh,

562
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,330
is drawn in this cartoon
in three base pair units.

563
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,680
And that's because every three base pairs
describes an amino acid in a protein.

564
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:48,510
Okay.

565
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,510
While there are only four different
bases that make up either RNA or DNA,

566
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,410
and so the complexity of an
RNA polymer is limited, right?

567
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,610
It's only got one of four
possible choices at each position.

568
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:08,640
There are more than 20 amino acids that
make up the biological polymers called

569
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:09,474
proteins,

570
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,190
so there are 20 choices of each amino
acid at a position on a protein.

571
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,520
Why are there three bases in a coat on?

572
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:27,230
Because it takes three units where there's
only four choices at each position to

573
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:35,070
have at least 20 unique combinations,
right?

574
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,040
How many combinations
of Code Ons are there?

575
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:42,150
If there's three basis and four
possibilities at each base,

576
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,040
four times four times four,

577
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,413
right?

578
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,490
Four Times,
four times four possibilities.

579
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:54,790
Because I could have a g c
you hear a Gcu here Ajcu here.

580
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,100
Four Times four is 16 if I only had two
per code on, I wouldn't have enough.

581
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,700
Right? I'd only have 16
possible to based sequences.

582
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:07,400
That's not enough to
specify over 20 amino acids.

583
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,310
If I have three,

584
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,140
I have 16 times four or 64 possible
choices way more than enough.

585
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,163
Right.

586
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:22,050
That creates a problem in the genetic
code and that there's 64 possible

587
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:24,900
sequences,
but there's only 20 some amino acids.

588
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,210
So each amino acid can be
specified by more than one code on,

589
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:31,980
okay.

590
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,520
Right? There's, there's
combinations to spare.

591
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,530
There's 64 combinations of

592
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,990
three of three, uh, basis. Right?
And I only needed to describe 20.

593
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:47,880
So there's combinations,
despair. So if I look,

594
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,000
this table here shows you how,
uh,

595
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,580
how biological translation takes place.

596
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,790
Whenever a three bay
sequence is identified,

597
00:37:56,791 --> 00:38:01,020
say it's Gcu that
specifies and amino acid,

598
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,750
how would I, how would I know
what amino acid that is? Well,

599
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:08,250
I could look up this table
because somebody has figured
it out for you. Um, gee,

600
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:13,020
in the first position, see in
the second position, you in the

601
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,390
GC,

602
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:20,390
you g see you right here is alanine.

603
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,240
And that's the protein, the amino acid
that's in that position in the, um,

604
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,163
in the protein.

605
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,030
Okay?

606
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,540
So you could read through this sequence
and you could figure out what the

607
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,130
sequence of amino acids would be.

608
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:42,370
The genetic code is set to BG degenerate
because I can read in one direction.

609
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,590
I can read Gcu is Alanine,
for example,

610
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:49,670
from this table and if I see a Gcu,
I know it has to be Alanine.

611
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,360
If I have the protein and I want to say
what does the messenger RNA that produce

612
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:58,970
that protein looked like? I can't go
backwards because there's more than one.

613
00:38:59,690 --> 00:38:59,970
Okay.

614
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:04,390
Possibility for Alanine, right?

615
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:07,000
There's four of them right here,
Gcu,

616
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:12,030
GCC GCA GCG so I don't know
exactly what gene that came from.

617
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:14,170
I can't read backwards.

618
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,790
And that has to do with the
statistics of this, right?

619
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:22,990
There's just more sequences in a three
unit code on then I need for the amino

620
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:26,560
acids.
How does translation occur?

621
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:31,150
A biologically is shown in
this cartoon here and again,

622
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:32,680
you don't need to know
the details of this,

623
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:35,950
but if you're interested in knowing
what's the biological basis of the genetic

624
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:39,070
code, this is it that inside
cells in your body there are,

625
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,100
there are special RNA molecules called
transfer RNA and they are RNA molecules,

626
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:49,540
but they have at some
point in their lifespan,

627
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,340
they have amino acids attached to them.
Uh,

628
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,750
for example,
this transfer RNA has a unit here,

629
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:03,751
g a g at one end of the transfer RNA
molecule at the other end is attached to

630
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:05,410
the amino acid leucine

631
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,730
and your cells making transfer RNA.

632
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,240
If they make a transfer RNA
molecule that has g a g here,

633
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,060
they only put leucine at the other end

634
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:24,110
and that's the physical basis of the
genetic code because when a messenger RNA

635
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,730
sequence is being transcribed,

636
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,160
yeah,

637
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,990
one base pair,

638
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:35,050
one coat on at a time when the sequence
see you see appears in the Messenger

639
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:37,963
Rna.

640
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:43,180
That sequence see you see can only
bind with one particular three base

641
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,980
compliment, right? It has
to be the complement. G A G,

642
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,900
this is the [inaudible].
This is the anti code on,

643
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,130
there's only one anti code on that matches
this one and that anti code on it's

644
00:40:58,131 --> 00:41:03,050
always occurs in a molecule that has
losing attached to the other side.

645
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,840
It's a translation occurs by a special
kind of polymerization where these

646
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:15,480
transfer RNA A's operate by
Watson Crick base pairing.

647
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:17,170
Okay.

648
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,530
But they bring into
proximity and amino acid.

649
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,030
Okay.

650
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,470
So that instead of forming a new
polymer of a nucleic acid, a polymer,

651
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:32,050
a polymer of amino acids, is form a
pilar of amino acids is a protein.

652
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,140
Again,

653
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm just trying to highlight things you
already know a little bit about the book

654
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:39,880
describes the details.
Uh,

655
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,640
this isn't particularly important
for us to know, uh, here,

656
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:48,820
but that messenger RNA gets converted
into a protein of a specific composition

657
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,020
through a biological process
called translation is important.

658
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:55,970
Okay.

659
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,690
The last thing I want to talk about
today is control of gene expression and

660
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:02,240
control of gene expression
is a very big topic.

661
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,220
And so I'm going to show you one cartoon
to sort of tell you that it is a big

662
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:11,840
topic that's really important. And why
is control of gene expression important?

663
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:15,680
Well, I talked about earlier,
I've mentioned several times.

664
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,750
All the cells in my body,

665
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:22,751
all the cells in your body has essentially
the same genomic chromosomal DNA in

666
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:24,584
their nucleus.

667
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,030
If you looked at cells in my pancreas and
sales in my brain has cells in my skin.

668
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,530
They all have the same DNA,

669
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,900
but skin cells and brain
cells and pancreas cells
aren't doing the same things.

670
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,660
They don't look the same.
They don't behave the same.

671
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:40,970
They don't perform the same
biological functions. Why?

672
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,430
Because brain cells and pancreas cells
are expressing different proteins,

673
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:47,900
okay?

674
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,010
All the cells in your body have the
capability of making all the proteins that

675
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:55,460
you make,
but they're not all made in every cell.

676
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,490
Only cells of your pancreas make insulin.
For example,

677
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:04,160
only cells in your brain make the enzymes
that produce certain neurotransmitters

678
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,020
that are responsible for brain function.

679
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,360
How do cells in your brain know which
proteins they ought to be making and how

680
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:13,430
to cells in the pancreas know which
proteins they ought to be making?

681
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,390
They do that because they can
control the expression of genes,

682
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,080
okay?

683
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,080
Gene expression for us will mean the
same thing as production of a particular

684
00:43:25,751 --> 00:43:26,584
protein.

685
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:31,830
When a gene gets expressed that means
it's protein is produced and when we talk

686
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,050
about gene expression,

687
00:43:35,051 --> 00:43:38,050
then we're talking about this whole
sequence of events I just described,

688
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,980
transcription,
RNA processing,

689
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,400
translation to make the protein and so
all those things have to happen right in

690
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:50,770
an orderly fashion,
in enough quantity,

691
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,000
in order for a particular cell to make
a protein to make insulin, for example,

692
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,640
your cells of your pancreas have to be,
uh,

693
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:00,280
transcribing that gene
has to be processed,

694
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,130
has to be translated
into the protein insulin,

695
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,570
but that's not all right
that that protein, insolent,

696
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:12,630
that protein insulin is made in the
form of a long polypeptide that not,

697
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:17,500
that's not always the final version
of the protein. In fact, for insulin,

698
00:44:17,501 --> 00:44:20,650
it's not the final version of the
protein that comes out of translation.

699
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,300
There are more steps that have to happen
correctly in order for that insulin to

700
00:44:25,301 --> 00:44:26,320
become active.

701
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:31,830
Those steps are called post
translational modifications.

702
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,580
It's a long word that just means other
chemistry that happens on the molecule

703
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,020
after translation.

704
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:43,310
It turns out that the
kinds of post translational
modifications that human cells

705
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:46,470
are able to do are very complicated.

706
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,940
You can do many post-translational modify.

707
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:52,170
Your cells are capable of doing many
post translational modifications.

708
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:56,610
Bacteria or simple organisms
are not always capable of that.

709
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,180
Now that's going to be important
when we talk about making human gene,

710
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:05,210
making human proteins inside alternate
hosts like bacteria that they can't do

711
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:10,530
all the things that your cells can do.
So how is gene expression controlled?

712
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,900
It can be controlled in a variety of ways.

713
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,680
The most basic control
is by controlling wind.

714
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:20,681
Transcription happens when transcription
happens and it turns out that there's a

715
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:23,100
whole biology associated with this,

716
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,340
including molecules that are floating
around inside your cells called

717
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:30,270
transcription factors and their job.
There are other molecules that are,

718
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:35,190
that know about particular genes and what
some of the sequences and are able to

719
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:38,910
turn on those genes inside
cells to make them transcribed.

720
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:41,490
It requires RNA processing
to happen smoothly.

721
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:43,890
So if you can interfere
with RNA processing,

722
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,590
you can stop a gene from being expressed.

723
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,250
If you can interfere with this
any stage and RNA processing,

724
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:52,020
you can stop a gene from being expressed.

725
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:57,290
And this is a very hot topic in molecular
biology now and human therapeutics.

726
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:00,870
You've heard about RNA interference,
for example.

727
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:05,130
And that is the process of stopping this
to stop a gene from being expressed.

728
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,470
For example,
a gene that makes us cell cancerous.

729
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,360
I'd like to stop it from being expressed.

730
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,310
And you could interfere with a
translation by degrading messenger RNA.

731
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:14,911
For example,

732
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:18,000
if you had a way to specifically chew
up all the RNA molecules that are

733
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:21,090
responsible for making
a particular protein,

734
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:26,270
you could stop it from being expressed
even though your cell is trying to make

735
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:29,340
it.
So I want you to look at this picture,

736
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:32,510
read the little bit about gene expressed
control of gene expression that's in

737
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,060
the book. No, that it's a big topic
that we're not going to talk about it,

738
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:39,240
except we're going to talk about some
examples where GE birth control of gene

739
00:46:39,241 --> 00:46:43,920
expression can be exploited in order
to, uh, in order to treat a diseases,

740
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:45,960
for example.
So I'll see you on Thursday.
