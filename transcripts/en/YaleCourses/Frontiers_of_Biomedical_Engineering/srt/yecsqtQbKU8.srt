1
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,580
So today we're going to
continue, uh, to, uh,

2
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,760
talk about applications of
a biomedical engineering.

3
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:24,750
So it sort of a way to bring together
some of the concepts that we've talked

4
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:27,670
about over the last,
uh, over the last, uh,

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,750
several months and a Tuesday I
focused on applications in cancer.

6
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,620
And so we thought about how
imaging techniques, how, uh,

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,060
instruments that deliver
radiation, how, uh,

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,010
molecules and cells could be used to treat
cancer. And today we're going to, the,

9
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:48,600
the focus is going to be on,
on artificial materials.

10
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,380
So biomaterials, uh, which are
widely used in medicine now, uh,

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,470
and were produced largely through the
work of material scientists and chemical

12
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:03,270
engineers in biomedical engineers
over the last a hundred years or so.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,830
So we'll talk about
some of the, of the, uh,

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,770
difficulties with creating a material
that can be implanted in the body.

15
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:15,610
And we'll talk about some
of the applications of,
uh, of those materials. Uh,

16
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,440
particularly in artificial organs is
where I want to end up for the day.

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,190
So, uh, these are two pictures
from the text, uh, that I, uh,

18
00:01:26,191 --> 00:01:29,370
that I present this to show
you that the idea of using, uh,

19
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,430
artificial materials to replace tissues
that are lost for one reason or another

20
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:37,020
is not new.
And so I'm,

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,050
the one picture here shows a
remarkable discovery from a mummy,

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,830
uh,
that is something like 3000 years old.

23
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,290
And this particular mummy was a,

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,700
was a woman who had a toe that was
amputated for some reason and the toe was

25
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,670
replaced by a synthetic.
Um,

26
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,370
we're not a synthetic and natural
material fashion to look like a toe.

27
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,840
This is made of a wood.

28
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,470
And so just to acknowledge that people
have probably tried to use the materials

29
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:12,510
that were in the world around
them, uh, to replace, uh,

30
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,630
parts of the body that were lost to
trauma or disease for thousands of years.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,190
And, uh, we've gotten quite
good at it in some senses,

32
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,700
but there is still significant
problems left to solve.

33
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,680
And the other side of the slide here,

34
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,860
I wanted to show you what I think
is a remarkable, uh, material.

35
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:37,070
So this clear part here is a lens
that's actually implanted into the eye.

36
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,260
So it's like a contact lens,

37
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,290
but it's permanently placed in side
the eye over your natural lens.

38
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,270
And this is for people
that have very severe, uh,

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,350
difficulty envisioned because,
uh,

40
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:54,930
the properties of their
natural lens have changed.

41
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,100
And so you can put an artificial
materials, it's made of a polymer,

42
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,360
a inside the eye, and uh, it can stay
there for the rest of their lives,

43
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,630
restoring their vision to near normal
and requiring no other effort on their

44
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,150
part.

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,600
They don't have to put in the contact
lens every day because it's there inside

46
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:16,630
there eye all the time. So, uh,

47
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,660
so what kinds of materials are these
that we can use now to replace or restore

48
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,590
the function of, of, um,
of tissues that, that are,

49
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,270
that are damaged?
Well,

50
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:32,740
many of the materials that are used most
commonly in with the most success now

51
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:36,160
are polymers or plastics. And, uh, we,

52
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,880
we've talked about some
different aspects of,

53
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,500
of polymers in medicine
throughout the course here.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,620
What I wanted to show you
on this slide is, and again,

55
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:48,580
not that you would memorize or even
be able to read all the details here,

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,110
but there are a large number of different
synthetic materials that now are

57
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:56,620
produced and regularly used
in medical applications.

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,020
And polymers, as you
know, are, um, it's a,

59
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,990
uh, our manufactured products. They're,
most of them are, are, um, are, um,

60
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,980
made from, uh, products that are
derived from petroleum or oil.

61
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,720
They're organic molecules,

62
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:18,610
typically small units that are
polymerized together to form long chains.

63
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,540
And because the individual molecules
in a polymer are long chains,

64
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,150
when you put a bunch of
them together in a material,

65
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:30,151
they entangled together and they give
you a nice material properties so you're

66
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,880
not falling down to the ground now
because the plastic chairs that you're

67
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:37,270
sitting on are quite strong. And, uh,

68
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:41,810
this polymer material that makes up the
base of the chairs is able to support

69
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,610
your weight and, uh, and does it, uh,

70
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,550
very reliably for a long period of
time. Um, you also notice that uh, the,

71
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,260
these chairs, if they were made
out of wood, they'd be very heavy.

72
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,590
But these are quite light, right?
You can pick them up easily.

73
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:59,010
If they're made out of metal,
they would be much heavier. Uh,

74
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,670
they might be stronger but they would be,
but they would be much heavier.

75
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,480
And so one of the advantages of polymer
materials is that you can make things

76
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:12,400
that have quite a lot of strength
but are still fairly light, right?

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
That's one of the advantages of,
of polymer materials.

78
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,640
You can also change properties of the
polymers and that's one of the things that

79
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:23,260
engineers have learned how to do a with
quite a large degree of sophistication

80
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,360
over the last a hundred years or so.

81
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,900
So you can make many different kinds
of polymers now that dipper in the

82
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:32,620
chemistry of the monomers that are linked
together to make these long chains.

83
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,590
You can of course change
the length of the chain.

84
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:39,640
So you can make materials that are
made up of polymers that have very long

85
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,860
chains, are shorter chains.
And as you could imagine,

86
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,240
that changes properties like the material
property of elasticity that we talked

87
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,980
about a few weeks ago.

88
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,860
And we've discovered mainly through
a process of trial and error,

89
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,680
but that many of these materials
are biocompatible. That is,

90
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,870
you can put them in contact with
tissues of the body and the,

91
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:06,750
the side effects of implanting that
material or not severe. Now in a few, uh,

92
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,590
in a few slides I'm going to tell you
more about how the body responds to bio

93
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:11,424
materials.

94
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,640
And what you'll see is that the response
can be very mild to some materials that

95
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:21,110
are inert. It can be, uh, quite vigorous
to materials that aren't so a nerd.

96
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:26,111
And so one needs to select a material
that's appropriate for the application

97
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,010
that you want to use it for,

98
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,100
has the right properties for
the application and also has,

99
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,660
has the right extent of compatibility
in the tissue you want to use it in.

100
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,350
But this is just to show you kind of the
range of materials that can be used now

101
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,990
in some of the applications,
uh, in which they're used.

102
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:45,920
And we'll talk about that as we go
through the lecture today. Well,

103
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:50,921
one of the applications I've already
talked about last week was making,

104
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,720
uh,
tubes of polymers,

105
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,250
tubes of polymers that can be used to
replace the conduits through which blood

106
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,084
flow.

107
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,860
And this slide shows you some
examples of arterial graphs.

108
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,550
So synthetic materials that
are used to replace a segment,

109
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:08,720
let's say of the aorta.

110
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,090
And this might be needed because the
patient has had some kind of trauma where

111
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:18,980
their aorta has become ruptured, like
in a car accident for example. Uh,

112
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,090
it's a deep within your body.
So it has to,

113
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,810
we'd have to be a pretty significant
trauma in order to hurt your aorta.

114
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,340
But more commonly,

115
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,760
sometimes there are diseases of the
or a order where the wall of the order

116
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:31,820
becomes weak and um,
and uh,

117
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,620
causes what's called an aneurysm
or a weak spot in the, uh,

118
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,490
in the artery that can balloon out.

119
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,170
And obviously if that becomes so weak that
it bursts, that's a medical emergency.

120
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,420
So if you diagnose those early and up,

121
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:48,830
then you can replace that segment of
the aorta with a synthetic polymer.

122
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,050
And this has been done for decades.
Now.

123
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:54,410
There are several different materials
that can be used in this way.

124
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,610
And because the aorta is a,
is a large caliber vessel,

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,640
it stays patent.
That is,

126
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:06,040
the blood can flow through
continuously for many decades. And uh,

127
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,370
this is true for vessels that are larger
than say five millimeters in diameter.

128
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,560
But as the size goes down,

129
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,610
it becomes more difficult to use
synthetic materials in these applications.

130
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,750
So you can't use a synthetic material
like this in the coronary arteries,

131
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,010
for example,
of the heart.

132
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,390
And we talked about that several weeks
ago and I'll show you some pictures that

133
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:30,740
show you why that wouldn't work in
smaller diameter vessels in a few moments.

134
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,540
Well, most of the materials that are used
here were initially developed for other

135
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,100
purposes. The two most common
materials that are used in, in,

136
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,080
in conduits like this are Dacron,

137
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,250
which is a synthetic polymer
that was, uh, first, uh,

138
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,270
it's used for lots of things,
but it's made into clothing for example.

139
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,010
And a surgeon's like it because it's,
uh,

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,020
because it has properties,
you can sell it easily, right?

141
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:00,870
So you imagine that a material that's
going to be used in an application like

142
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:04,860
this, a surgeon has to be able to
sow into it, uh, fairly readily.

143
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:08,970
It has to be able to hold a suture and
that suture line has to make a neat

144
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,540
connection or a nasty Moses
with the native vessel.

145
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,070
And so surgeons being able to,

146
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,670
so in the mud into the material reliably
is obviously an important part of the

147
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:21,960
design and Dacron a tech style
has a nice property that way.

148
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,550
The other material that's used often is
a material you are familiar with called

149
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:30,810
Goretex and Gortex is basically Teflon.

150
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,820
It's Teflon that is treated in a
special way so that it becomes porous.

151
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,670
And you know, one of the properties
of Teflon, you use it as,

152
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,960
as cookware for example, because
things don't stick to it, right?

153
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,750
It's not as sticky polymer.
It's barely a nerd too,

154
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,250
particularly proteins that
might stick on the surface, uh,

155
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,260
but on its own it would not be porous
and so it wouldn't allow any molecules to

156
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:55,764
pass through.

157
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,880
Gortex on the other hand is fashioned
and his is a picture of Gortex at very

158
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:03,120
high magnification here.
So it has small pores in it,

159
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,420
pours that are so small that a droplet
of water can't pass through but molecules

160
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:14,310
of water can, right? That's
why Gortex is so useful as a,

161
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:18,240
as a material for uh,
for hiking for rain gear.

162
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,740
It allows water to evaporate through it
but doesn't allow drops of water to go

163
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:23,574
in.

164
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,700
So you can make a waterproof material
that still allows your body to sweat and

165
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,470
for vapers to come off your body.

166
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,730
But that's an allow water to go in
that same property makes it useful for

167
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,200
arterial graphs as well.

168
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,850
And there's some facts on this slide that
show you how many of these operations

169
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,220
that use these kinds of materials
are performed every year.

170
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,730
Another example of using a synthetic
materials like that is in the heart valve.

171
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,790
We talked about how heart valves
function several weeks ago.

172
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,200
We talked about how your heart becomes
very inefficient and it's pumping action

173
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,810
if the valves don't work properly.
And uh,

174
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,140
there are diseases of valves
that are not uncommon.

175
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,030
And so many people decades
ago died because it, you know,

176
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,780
relatively young ages because
their heart valves would start,

177
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,630
stop working and their heart,
even though it was beating properly,

178
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,200
could not deliver the flow rate
that was needed to sustain life.

179
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,470
So here's an early example
of a mechanical valve,

180
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,740
a totally synthetic material that
could be used to replace a heart valve.

181
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
Now this is a collar here,

182
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:31,980
which is made of a tech stall
that can be sewn in to the spot,

183
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:34,020
to the ring of tissue
where the heart valve goes.

184
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,850
So you can see that white material there,

185
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,600
there's a metal ring underneath
it and on both sides of this ring,

186
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:42,180
there's a cage,
a small cage on the bottom,

187
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,380
and a larger cage on the top right.
So the heart would be down here,

188
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,980
the ventricle would be
down below this here.

189
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,480
And so if there was pressure on this
side, it would force the ball up, right?

190
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,290
So when the pressure in the left
ventricle got to be higher than the aorta,

191
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,240
it would force the ball up and
then flow would go out, right?

192
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:08,410
Cause the ball sitting in this
position completely seals the opening.

193
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,260
But when the pressure
pushes the ball up than it,

194
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,120
than it opens up a pathway around it.

195
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,130
So blood can come out through
the sides and the ball goes up,

196
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:22,600
but it doesn't go away, right? Because
it's constrained by this cage on the top.

197
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,680
Now when the pressure here gets
higher than the pressure down here,

198
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,800
the ball falls back down and it reseals
so it does exactly what we wanted or

199
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,840
what we described a heart valve is doing.

200
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,200
That is opening up when the
pressure difference was right,

201
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,200
when the pressure was higher
in the ventricle and the aorta,

202
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,890
and then closing again when the pressure
in the aorta was higher than the

203
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,240
ventricle. Now the problem with this is
you remember how the normal valve opens?

204
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:51,910
It opens like, like a doorway, right?

205
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,020
The normal valve opens like a doorway
and so the, the part that's shut

206
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,550
totally opens and so there's a very clear
path for flow in this kind of a ball

207
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:05,470
valve.
The ball is still in the way.

208
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,750
And so the fluid has to go around the
ball in order to inject into the aorta.

209
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,370
For example, if this was an
aortic valve, uh, the, the, the,

210
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,950
and because it has to go around it,

211
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,570
if there's an obstacle to blood flow
creates an additional resistance.

212
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,561
So your,

213
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:28,270
your heart has to work harder in order
to overcome the resistance of the flow

214
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:33,190
going around this large ball that's in
the center. So it works well as a valve,

215
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,020
but it's not a very efficient valve and
that it requires your heart to work, uh,

216
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,730
to work more to get a certain flow
rate because it's blocking this ball is

217
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:45,490
blocking the center of the flow.
In addition,

218
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,940
you can imagine this ball slamming
up and then slamming back down,

219
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,470
up and down could cause mechanical
damage to the blood. And it does.

220
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,950
And blood consists not just
of water and molecules,

221
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:58,870
but sells like red blood cells.

222
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,570
And these cells are sensitive
to mechanical forces.

223
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,390
And so every time this
valve opens and closes,

224
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,020
it breaks a certain number of
blood cells. Right. And that's,

225
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:11,820
that's also something that you can
live with but isn't perfect, right?

226
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,900
The most, uh, a better
design was made. Um, in,

227
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:18,580
I think about the 1970s,

228
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,430
it's this valve that's shown
here in many ways it's similar.

229
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:24,550
It has the same kind of a tech
still ring and metal on the outside.

230
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:27,010
So now it's shown sort of sort of end on,

231
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:30,640
so you're looking through the valve
and what you don't see here are two,

232
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:35,290
what are called leaflets. These are
made of metal and they fold like this,

233
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,620
so close like this. And then
they open like that, right?

234
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,980
And so it's more like a swinging door
and also responds to pressure because it

235
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:47,020
can only open one way. It goes
like this, it won't go like that.

236
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,980
So it only opens in one direction in
response to a pressure drop. And then it,

237
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,313
and the other way.

238
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,640
And so this is now the most commonly used
design for a totally synthetic valve,

239
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:02,750
but still a popular valve that's used
are these two valves that are shown here.

240
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,310
This one is from a cow.

241
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,080
This one is from a pig and they're
natural valves that are recovered from the

242
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:10,940
animals and then they're treated,

243
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,950
they're cross linked with a chemical
so that they become permanent,

244
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,790
uh, structures, nonliving
structures, uh, now and uh,

245
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,440
these sort of biosynthetic valves,
uh,

246
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,060
what's called in the caption here.

247
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:29,720
A bioprosthesis prosthesis
just means replacement, right?

248
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:34,721
So this is derived from natural tissue
is an alternative to this mechanical

249
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,860
valve. And Physicians, we'll, uh,

250
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,760
we'll use one of these types of valves
or another depending on which of your

251
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:42,050
valves needs replacement,

252
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,410
what their own experiences with people
that have diseases like the ones they're

253
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,240
treating. And, but there are
these several options available.

254
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,341
So,
uh,

255
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:57,341
one of the problems when he put any
synthetic material or any material other

256
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,951
than your own tissues in contact with
blood is that you will start a process

257
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:07,940
called coagulation or blood clotting.
And of course,

258
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:12,470
this natural reaction is important to,

259
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,910
um, to our lives, right? If you,
if you damage a blood vessel,

260
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,680
the blood vessel becomes ruptured.

261
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,810
All of a sudden the blood is exposed to a
surface. It's not used to seeing, right?

262
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,990
You damage the blood vessel and instead
of the blood flowing through a nice tube

263
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:33,620
that has a very consistent
endothelial cell lining,

264
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,170
it's now exposed to the tissue outside,

265
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,700
right when the blood vessel gets ruptured
and when it's exposed to the tissue

266
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,534
outside,

267
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,780
a series of chemical reactions gets
initiated and that series of chemical

268
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,090
reactions is called the
coagulation cascade.

269
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,360
And it involves proteins that are also
enzymes that go from an inactive state to

270
00:16:55,491 --> 00:16:59,660
an active state. And this is
described in the book in some detail.

271
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,020
I'm not going to ask you questions
about the molecular details of this.

272
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:06,550
I want you to do to sort of
understand the concept that um,

273
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,620
that a protein in the blood gets activated
by exposure to a foreign surface and

274
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,540
it creates an activated enzyme,
which then activates another enzyme,

275
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:21,200
which activates another enzyme on,
through this network.

276
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:26,350
And the final result is that a molecule
in your blood called fibrinogen gets

277
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:32,570
converted into a cross
linked network called fibrin.

278
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,550
Okay?

279
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,170
So exposure to a foreign surface sets
off a series of chemical reactions.

280
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,250
The end result is that a natural protein
in your blood that's normally dissolved

281
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:48,251
and just flowing around in your blood
called fibrinogen gets cross linked into a

282
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,970
gel or a semi solid material,

283
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,030
and this is the formation of a clot.

284
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,120
Now when this reaction happens,

285
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,620
this cross linking of fibrinogen into
fibrin happens there usually cells that

286
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:05,730
are trapped there as well because these
crosslinking reactions occur in blood

287
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,780
and there's lots of blood that gets
cross linked into this network,

288
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,230
but you form a semi solid structural
material that seals off the area of the

289
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,470
blood vessel that's damaged,
right?

290
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,270
And so blood now stays within your
circulatory system, the bleeding stops,

291
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,320
and that that seal that gets made is
a chemically cross linked version of

292
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:34,800
fiboronectin. And you know it as
a blood clot, you cut yourself,

293
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:38,670
you see a clot later, it looks red
because it looks red, but it's solid.

294
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,130
It looks red because there's
blood cells trapped in it,

295
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:42,300
red blood cells trapped in it.

296
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,980
It's solid because the basis of it is
this cross linked network of proteins.

297
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,130
So this happens if you expose blood,

298
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,020
anytime you explodes exposed blood
to a foreign material, it happens.

299
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,540
If you put a heart valve,

300
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,950
an artificial heart valve
in the blood pathway,

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,650
this clotting reaction
will start to happen.

302
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,000
And that's what's shown in this slide
here. You can't see it too well,

303
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:11,160
but this surface would
ordinarily look smooth.

304
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,810
It doesn't look smooth because there
are proteins coagulate it on the surface

305
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:16,230
here.

306
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,280
These proteins have fibrin Nekton that
are being converted into a fibrin jail.

307
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,350
And there are also specialized
cells that also find these, uh,

308
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,520
these fiber networks and they
spread out to help form a barrier.

309
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,740
These cells are called platelets.
And you know,

310
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:34,500
platelets are also important
in blood clotting reactions.

311
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,800
So one of the problems with
every synthetic material
that's used to replace a

312
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:43,290
component of your circulatory system,
like a heart valve,

313
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
is that you form a thin layer of clot
on the surface of blood clot on the

314
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,320
surface.

315
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,670
Now what you hope is that that happens
within the first few hours of when the

316
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:58,671
heart valve is replaced
and then it doesn't happen
anymore because it becomes a

317
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:04,620
sort of natural biological surface now
and your body tolerates it all right.

318
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,540
So,
um,

319
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,950
but it required only this only happens
with certain kinds of materials.

320
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,110
And so that's one of the criteria for
selecting materials that are used as heart

321
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:19,680
valves is that they have to
be able to support sort of a,

322
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,730
a mild clotting reaction, right? A mile,

323
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,560
not a severe clotting reaction because
what happens if this clot keeps forming

324
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,450
on the surface,
the,

325
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,480
the clot gets thicker and thicker on
the surface and eventually since there's

326
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:40,551
blood flowing by pieces of that
clot could be expelled from or,

327
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:45,270
or, or, or detached from the surface of
the material and they would flow into your

328
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:48,760
blood. And if they float up
into your brain, for example,

329
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,320
they could clog smart,

330
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,670
smaller arteries inside your brain
and cut off blood flow to that region,

331
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,460
right?
That process is called embolism.

332
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,030
Embolism is when a small
particle is released into
your bloodstream and embolism

333
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:06,550
can cause all sorts of unwanted effects,
right?

334
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,960
So a bad heart valve might
give you a stroke in the brain.

335
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,200
Um, this is one kind of
reaction to a biomaterial.

336
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,990
These other two pictures show
you other kinds of reactions.

337
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:23,530
Here's a material labelled as m here
that's implanted under the skin.

338
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,450
And what you see is that after time,

339
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,720
this unusual layer of tissue forms,

340
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,020
this is called a part of
the foreign body reaction.

341
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:36,070
Your body tries to form us kind of scar
around the material and I'll show you

342
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:40,300
how that happens in a cartoon. And it just
a minute. And materials that are very,

343
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,050
uh, that are not so in
Nerd, uh, can cause, uh,

344
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,570
extensive cellular reactions like the
one I show on the bottom here, these,

345
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,100
these dots here are cells
from your inflammatory system,

346
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,720
their neutrophils and macrophages that
are collecting at the site of the foreign

347
00:21:58,721 --> 00:21:59,554
material.

348
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:03,760
The material here was a mash and you can
see where the fibers of the Mesh are,

349
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,650
where there's clear dots here,

350
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,980
but you can see there's lots
of cells that are recruited.

351
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,920
If you showed this to an
experienced pathologist,

352
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:16,540
he would say these cells are coming in
as part of the inflammatory response as

353
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:20,140
part of the unwanted
response to this material.

354
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,160
Every material produces a
different reaction when you
put it in the to the body

355
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:30,370
and the details of the reaction depend
on the chemistry of the material.

356
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:31,720
It's mechanical properties,

357
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,960
how its surface is treated if
the surface is rough or smooth,

358
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,180
and so from an engineering perspective,

359
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:40,750
those are all things that
we can potentially change.

360
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,070
So we can design materials hopefully
that minimize the response of the body to

361
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:45,880
it.

362
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,880
But in general you can't make the response
go away and the response appears to

363
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:53,200
have some general characteristics.

364
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,190
There's general ways that
your body responds to all
materials and those general

365
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:02,191
ways are shown in this cartoon and
that the in the first few minutes,

366
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,970
seconds or up to an hour,
when you put the material into the body,

367
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,400
it becomes coated with proteins. Now,
where do these proteins come from?

368
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,960
If this was a material that we
use in the in contact with blood,

369
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,710
those proteins probably came from
the blood. If this was a heart valve,

370
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:23,860
for example, then these proteins
probably came from the blood.

371
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,360
If you looked at the proteins,

372
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:30,220
they breed primarily the abundant proteins
that are naturally abundant in blood

373
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,780
like albumin, fibrinogen, other
kinds of proteins like that.

374
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,060
But protein absorption
happens very quickly.

375
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,140
Within the next few days,

376
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,380
cells will start to accumulate around
the material and it appears that what we

377
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:53,051
know now suggests that these cells are
recruited to the material because of the

378
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:59,711
proteins that are absorbed and you can
understand that you know that proteins

379
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:03,590
are surround all the cells in our body.

380
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,910
We talked about extra cellular matrix
and how there are concentrated gels of

381
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:10,460
proteins that surround almost every cell.

382
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,250
So sales like to stick to protein layers.

383
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,380
And if you have a material that's coated
with a protein, cells will stick to it.

384
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,690
Now the first cells that arrive and
that stick ourselves of the inflammatory

385
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:28,130
response and the inflammatory response
is the natural process of your body

386
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:32,930
responding to some potentially harmful,
uh,

387
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:33,883
event.

388
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,900
And these cells are moving
around in your body all the time.

389
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,990
They flow through your bloodstream,
they crawl through your tissues,

390
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,700
they're looking for something
potentially bad to happen.

391
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,420
And then when it does,
they tried to start the healing process.

392
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,410
And so these cells recognize that proteins
are attached to the material and they

393
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,210
begin to accumulate at this site here,

394
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,220
the first cells that
arrive are neutrophils. The
second set are macrophages.

395
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,940
Now those are the cells that I show
accumulating and high concentration around

396
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:09,830
this material here. And what they do
is they start the healing process.

397
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,900
And they do that in a variety of ways.

398
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,930
One is that they release enzymes that
tried to digest whatever is around and

399
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,210
they also send out signals to recruit
other kinds of cells to come in.

400
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:28,310
And that's what's shown in this second
stage here is that the cells condense

401
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:30,650
into a layer.

402
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,100
They form what are called giant cells,

403
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,050
which are basically macrophages that
fuse together to form a giant cell,

404
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:44,051
which in some circumstances can can
completely encapsulate this material and

405
00:25:44,451 --> 00:25:47,660
they send out signals to the
rest of your body that say,

406
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:51,290
something's going on here.
We need your help in healing.

407
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,240
Whatever is happening at this local site.
If,

408
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,890
if this was a splinter for example,
that you've got underneath your skin,

409
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,130
your body's response to it would be to
form a scar all the way around it and to

410
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:09,360
try to digest it,
right,

411
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,620
and if you've ever had to splinter
that you couldn't get out,

412
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,270
you might have waited for a few days
or a few weeks and eventually the

413
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,080
splintered gets covered with some kind
of a tissue and it comes up towards the

414
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,920
top of your skin and eventually
gets ejected from your body. Right?

415
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,580
That's one kind of a healing response.
That's natural.

416
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,410
If that splinter was too deep,

417
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,240
it would just get totally covered
with a scar scar all around it.

418
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,420
And this cells that are in the scar
tissue would be secreting enzymes and

419
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:44,280
digestive chemicals inside
trying to the splinter.

420
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,470
And if it was made of wood,

421
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,390
eventually it would dissolve and it
would completely disappear, right?

422
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:54,910
If it's made of a synthetic polymer that
doesn't respond or doesn't get digested

423
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:55,920
by those chemicals,

424
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,390
what happens is that a stable scar
forms around this material that never

425
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,253
disappears.

426
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:02,720
Okay.

427
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,170
And but the material is isolated
now from the rest of your body.

428
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,870
Now I mentioned that different materials
produce different levels of response

429
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:16,871
like this and some of the responses are
very mild in that you get very little

430
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:21,200
protein absorbed. You get very
few sales recruited to the site,

431
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,330
you'd get not a scar,

432
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:28,250
but maybe a thin layer of or tissue
that would form around the outside,

433
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,653
right?

434
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:34,220
So some responses are mild and those are
considered biocompatible and some are

435
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:37,430
more vigorous and those are
considered to be not so compatible,

436
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,180
right?

437
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,280
But it happens with almost
every material we know.

438
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,650
Let's talk for a few minutes about a
completely different kind of application.

439
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:47,041
And again,

440
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,930
this is one that I mentioned a few
weeks ago when we were talking about bio

441
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,340
mechanics. Um, and that
is replacement of the hip.

442
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,290
And so I just show you this, uh, this
drawing here to remind you of hip anatomy.

443
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,090
So the pelvic bones here,

444
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:03,930
which form a girdle at the
level of your waist and uh,

445
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,990
and there's a cup inside the pelvic
girdle called the Acetabulum.

446
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,470
And into that cup,

447
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:15,471
the head of the Femur fits in a ball and
socket joints so that your hip has all

448
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:21,990
the range of movement that we talked
about in class and in section a few weeks

449
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,250
ago. If there's a disease of this
bone and this needs to be replaced,

450
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,920
then the general procedure now is to
replace not only the part this, this, uh,

451
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,790
part of the hip that contains the,
the joint,

452
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,380
the ball, uh, but also to
replace the socket as well.

453
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,670
So you create a total hip replacement
where you've got a material that you put

454
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:49,440
into the socket and a material that
you put onto the femur to fit into that

455
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:50,274
socket.

456
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,250
Yeah,

457
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,540
I showed you this picture before
and this was a, this is a,

458
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,660
a design of a material like this.
You see a metal cup

459
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,680
that serves as the new acetabulum.

460
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,190
You see a metal ball that is attached to
the femur and this ball fits into this

461
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:10,934
socket.

462
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Now if you just had metal on metal and
you tried to move that metal ball inside

463
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:20,180
that socket, that doesn't, that
doesn't work so well, metal on metal,

464
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,070
there's some friction between these two.

465
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,040
If this was a motor and
you had metal on metal,

466
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,750
you put oil in between there to
lubricate, right? But this is not

467
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,050
possible in this situation.

468
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,610
So you put something else in there to
lubricate and the something else is this

469
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:40,610
white material.
It's a layer of polymer,

470
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:43,510
a thin of polymer that also forms a cup,

471
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,420
fits exactly into this acetabulum piece,

472
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,600
and the ball of the femur then is
gliding on this smooth polymer piece,

473
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,050
right?
Um,

474
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,440
these polymer pieces have been made of
a variety of different materials, um,

475
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,740
over the years,

476
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:04,360
a Teflon and now most of the pieces now
are made of high density polyethylene.

477
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,373
Bobby,

478
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,353
yeah.

479
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,320
Sorry. Not here, not hearing you.

480
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,170
Okay.

481
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,990
Modern hip replacements.
And I'll show you some,

482
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:19,610
some new designs now typically have
a lifetime of closer to 20 years.

483
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,710
Uh,
but um,

484
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,820
I'll tell you why many of them have
to be replaced after about 10 years.

485
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,540
The older design ones. So, um,

486
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,900
design has gotten better
over time with these.

487
00:30:32,901 --> 00:30:36,620
And I'll talk about some of the
ways that it's gotten better. Well,

488
00:30:36,621 --> 00:30:39,500
one of the problems is
that this piece here,

489
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:43,160
this ball of the theme or this
part is going to replace the hip,

490
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:47,700
has to be very firmly attached
to the rest of your, uh, to the,

491
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,360
to the rest of the bones
of your leg to your femur.

492
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,710
Because if you're standing on one leg,
all the weight of your body is really, uh,

493
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:58,040
is really being carried by
this piece of material here.

494
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,290
So that's why they're made out of metal.

495
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,790
Because metals are strong and relatively
light and you need a strong material.

496
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,400
Plastic wouldn't work in this setting,
right?

497
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:11,750
Plastic wouldn't work in this setting
because plastic is too elastic.

498
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,780
Um, at most plastics are two
elastic, whereas metal is,

499
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,410
uh, is a stiffer and can
hold your weight. Uh,

500
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:24,890
what you didn't see in that previous
picture is that there's a long piece here

501
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:29,891
that goes down into the bone and this
long piece that goes into the bone allows

502
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:35,300
you to fix the ball of the
femur to the rest of the femur.

503
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,570
And it's fixed because this P,

504
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:42,610
this metal part down here goes down
into the shaft of your femur and then is

505
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,963
held there.

506
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,620
So it's kind of like a long thick nail
that goes down into the length of the

507
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:49,250
bone.

508
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,250
And what you hope is that
that large surface area in
contact metal to bone holds

509
00:31:58,111 --> 00:32:01,770
the whole piece into place so
that the hip operates smoothly.

510
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,590
Now.
Um,

511
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,340
now one of the goals of this is
would be decrypted design that, uh,

512
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,250
that naturally integrates into your
bone and what's called on this, uh,

513
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:19,170
self locking mechanism. So what would
his self locking mechanism be like? Well,

514
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,390
maybe you put holes in this material,

515
00:32:21,391 --> 00:32:24,870
like the whole shown here so that
your bone could grow through it.

516
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,460
Okay.

517
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,730
As your bone heals around this implant,

518
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,920
what if bone could grow
through the material? Then
you'd have bone on both sides,

519
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:38,900
sort of locking it in. That would
be the perfect design, right?

520
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,590
That would be a, let's say not
perfect. That would be a good design.

521
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,980
The problem is that's going
to take some time, right?

522
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,090
That's going to take some time.

523
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:51,320
And so you want the person to be able
to stand up and walk and move around and

524
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:54,170
function in the period
before that happens.

525
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:59,350
And so what is usually done is that a
nother material is used to lock these

526
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:04,130
materials temporarily in place.
And that material is called bone cement.

527
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,260
It's a, it's a polymer that can be
polymerized when you shine light on it.

528
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,930
And it's not too dissimilar from the
materials that dentists use now to fill

529
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,810
cavities, right? If you
had a cavity filled,

530
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:21,860
and recently they put some
sort of a material into your,

531
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:24,560
into the cavity, and then they
shine a light on it, right?

532
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:28,070
They put on the goggles and they cover up
your face and they shine a light on it.

533
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,210
And the polymer that they put into the
cavity polymerizes and forms a hard

534
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:36,470
surface here, they put the polymer
all around the Acetabular Cup.

535
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,650
They put the polymer into the recess that
they push the bone into and then they

536
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,400
shine light on it so that it starts to,
um,

537
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,700
so that it polymerizes and hardened and
forms a very tough material that fixes

538
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,040
this thing in place.
That's called bone cement and the,

539
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,410
and the material is
polymethyl methacrylate.

540
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,853
Okay,

541
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,010
so you can see that this,

542
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:06,670
this now involves at least three
different kinds of materials, right?

543
00:34:06,671 --> 00:34:08,680
There's the metal that's
used to make the implant.

544
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,610
There's the polymer lining that's used
to lubricate the joint between the two

545
00:34:12,611 --> 00:34:15,860
metals and there's the other
kind of polymer, the Samantha,

546
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:20,590
it's used to fix this in place, uh, in
the, in contact with your natural bone.

547
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:24,910
Here's an implant that was removed from
a patient after, as Bobby mentioned,

548
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:26,110
after maybe 10 years,

549
00:34:26,111 --> 00:34:29,860
they found out that their hip wasn't
working so well anymore and they were

550
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:34,750
starting to get pain from their hip
joint or they weren't able to move it

551
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:38,200
through the whole range of motion that
they'd been able to move it through in

552
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,380
years past.
And in this particular case,

553
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,280
this joint was removed.
Here's the, here's the ball,

554
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:50,050
here's the Acetabular Cup where
there's no polymer anymore.

555
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,830
Where did the polymer go?
Um,

556
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,590
one of the problems with older
designs of these materials,

557
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:59,830
particularly when they use
Teflon and not polyethylene,

558
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,800
is that over time as you used your hip,

559
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,640
while there wasn't much friction between
the metal ball and the polyethylene or

560
00:35:09,971 --> 00:35:11,110
the Teflon Cup,

561
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:16,290
there was enough friction where the
Teflon would start to where it would start

562
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:20,470
to wear down and then we'd get thinner
and thinner over time and eventually,

563
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:25,180
as in this case with this particular
patient could totally disappear if it

564
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:26,014
disappeared,

565
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,020
then you've got metal on metal now harder
to move your hip probably causing pain

566
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,130
when you move it as well because the
pieces aren't lubricated as well.

567
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:41,280
In addition, what happens is that when
this metal is moving against the polymer,

568
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,690
it wears down,
but the polymer doesn't vanish.

569
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,850
It has to go somewhere, right? And what,

570
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:52,851
what most people think is happening is
that tiny particles of the Teflon or the

571
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:58,410
polyethylene are being created
locally, right? As where happens,

572
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,360
you're wearing down the material,

573
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,690
you're creating many small particles
of the material that are released,

574
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,900
and those particles then can
start an inflammatory response.

575
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,020
Your body will start to respond
to these small particles. And um,

576
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,580
and that can also cause
local inflammation,

577
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:22,120
can cause reactions of tissue,
which also lead to pain. All right,

578
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,940
so this is one of the biggest
problems in design of a, of hips.

579
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,900
One of the reasons they've gotten better
is that people have gotten better about

580
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:34,980
making materials that resist this kind
of where and that's why they last for 20

581
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:38,760
years now instead of 10 years
as they did in the past. Um,

582
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,800
and there are newer kinds of materials
that people are beginning to create and

583
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,510
they're new in a variety of ways.

584
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:50,250
One of the ways they're new is that they
don't require as much bone cement any

585
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:54,390
longer. So this Acetabular Cup,
for example, is made of a ceramic,

586
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:59,391
which is very porous and which sticks
to bone more naturally and more easily

587
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,860
than the old metal cups used to.

588
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,870
Another difference in this design is
instead of having a metal head which moves

589
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:10,230
against the uh, metal ball, which
moves against the polymer socket,

590
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,410
this one has a ceramic head and the
friction between ceramic and a polymer is

591
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:21,930
even less than the friction between
a, a, a metal and a polymer.

592
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,050
These are also much lighter.
Ceramics are lighter,

593
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,370
they're very strong and you can
create a joint that lasts even, uh,

594
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,420
even longer with materials
like this. So, um,

595
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:37,490
so continue engineer's are continuously
making improvements in the materials

596
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:42,120
that go into joints like this and they're
making improvements in the design to

597
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:45,900
make them easier for surgeons to implant.

598
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,420
And now a total hip replacement,

599
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,690
putting these pieces into a patient
takes only about an hour in the operating

600
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:55,110
room,

601
00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,030
which is remarkable given the amount
that has to happen during that time.

602
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,020
I want to quickly review
some other kinds of, uh,

603
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:07,830
of artificial materials and I'm going to
talk for just a minute about something

604
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:11,940
we talked about before. Uh,
dialysis for kidney failure.

605
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,050
It's an example of what's called
an extra corporeal blood treatment.

606
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,860
Meaning that blood extra means outside,

607
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:23,970
corporeal means body,
extra corporeal is outside the body.

608
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,170
You take the blood outside of the patient,
you pass it through a device,

609
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,000
the treatment device, and then it goes
back into the patient. And so you know,

610
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:36,910
you saw in a section what
a dialyzer unit looks like,

611
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,470
but it's an example of a treatment where
blood is passed through some kind of a

612
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:44,830
device. Something happens to the
blood, something good happens,

613
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:47,260
and then the blood is
returned to the patient. Um,

614
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,060
a dialyzer might look like this.

615
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:52,750
There's blood that comes into a chamber
and that blood throught flows through

616
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:57,070
many, many different hollow fibers.
So blood flowing through these fibers.

617
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,780
On the outside of the fibers,

618
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,690
you're flowing a second
solution called the dialysate.

619
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,650
And so molecules waste
molecules like urea,

620
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,580
which are inside the blood capillaries
diffuse out into the dialysate.

621
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,930
They're removed from the blood.

622
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,440
So blood with a high concentration
of urea comes in this side,

623
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,280
blood with lower Uriah comes out this
side and goes back to the patient.

624
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,900
And that urea is removed by the dialysate
that goes around the hollow fibers.

625
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:23,860
Well,

626
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,630
what if you change this design slightly
and ask it to do something different and

627
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:33,631
instead of just flowing in a solution of
céline or a balanced salt solution that

628
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,790
was designed to pull your
REIA out of the blood,

629
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,950
what if you put cells in the
area around these hollow fibers?

630
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,870
What if you put cells in and what if
they were cells from the pancreas for

631
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:47,704
example,

632
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:52,570
so now blood is flowing through this
hollow fiber just like before and on the

633
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:56,590
outside there's not just
a solution of of salt,

634
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,930
but there are cells from the pancreas.

635
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,340
And what if this membrane work
the same way it doesn't dialysis,

636
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:06,070
it allowed small molecular
weight molecules to go through.

637
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,380
Then if blood came in
and it had sugar in it,

638
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,280
that sugar would diffuse out into the,

639
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:16,060
into the fluid in the shell.
What we used to call the dialysate.

640
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,740
If blood sugar is high and these
are sales from the pancreas,

641
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,520
what do cells of the pancreas do when
they see high concentrations of blood

642
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,060
sugar?

643
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,060
They secrete insulin and that insulin
would be secreted and it would flow back

644
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,900
through the tube into the blood.

645
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,980
You could make potentially an artificial
pancreas this way that was used to

646
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:42,790
treat blood outside the body.
So a,

647
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,200
so a diabetic patient, blood comes
out, it goes through this device.

648
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,550
Glucose would stimulate the
cells to secrete insulin.

649
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,910
The insulin would go back into the blood
and the insulin would be returned to

650
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:58,630
the body. And if these
pancreas cells worked properly,

651
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,410
they would respond just like a normal
pancreas does. When sugar goes up,

652
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,230
insulin goes up, sugar goes
down, insulin goes down,

653
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,550
and it does that automatically because
the cells are responding to the glucose.

654
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:14,620
That would be very inconvenient.
It might be a good solution,

655
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:17,560
but it would be inconvenient
if you're a diet, had diabetes,

656
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:21,160
and you needed this all the time to be
taking the blood out of the body and you

657
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:24,370
have this device that you have
to carry around with you, right?

658
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:28,840
So what if you made it so
you could implant it totally
inside the body as well?

659
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,920
And that's what this show,
that's what's this diagram shows here.

660
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,290
Here's an example of that
dialysis, uh, unit, uh,

661
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,800
that is the dialysis like
unit, but it's made, uh,

662
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:45,920
to be very small.
You can see the shell.

663
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,810
The outside shell here is a clear
plastic, um, it's about the size of, uh,

664
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,320
of um, uh, smaller than a hockey puck,

665
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:56,540
but not a lot smaller than a hockey puck.

666
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,660
And there's a tube that comes
in that brings blood in,

667
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,040
there's a tube that comes out and brings
blood out and this tube goes in and

668
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:07,910
then it wraps around several times
inside and then it goes back out.

669
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,960
And that wrapped that, those, those, uh,

670
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,260
those coils of tubing that wrap around
inside are all surrounded by sales from

671
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:16,094
the pancreas.

672
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,470
If you hook this up inside the body such
that you have blood going in one side

673
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:22,670
and then coming out the other,

674
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,200
then you've created a device
that potentially could
treat diabetes automatically

675
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:32,060
and continuously as long as the
cells were alive inside this shell.

676
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,680
So this was in a design of a, what's
called a bio hybrid, uh, pancreas.

677
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,240
It's made of synthetic materials,

678
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:41,000
the kind of materials we've
been talking about polymers.

679
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,330
And it's filled with live cells that are
harvested from a pancreas now because,

680
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:51,050
because there's a material that
separates the cells from your body,

681
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,710
unlike in tissue engineering where we
wanted the cells to integrate into the

682
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:55,340
body.

683
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,960
Now there's a material that separates
the cells so I don't have to use cells

684
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,030
that are immunologically matched with
the patient right there separated.

685
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,380
I think I don't even
have to use human cells.

686
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,560
I could use cells from another animal as
long as they respond to shoot to sugar

687
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,600
and make insulin that
works in the patient.

688
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:18,620
And so you might be able to use cells
from a pig and create an artificial

689
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:20,690
pancreas that works in a person.
Now,

690
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,730
these designs were made almost 20 years
ago now and they work fairly well.

691
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,590
Uh, there are, there are several
problems that still have not been solved.

692
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,390
One is that the cells don't live forever.
We know from cell culture,

693
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:39,440
the problem with maintaining cells
outside the body and here you would like

694
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:44,000
cells that lasts for a very long period
of time and continue to secrete insulin.

695
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,280
Um,
so they don't last for,

696
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,840
for a long enough for this to be
an effective therapy in people yet

697
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,700
a device that is similar to that,
uh,

698
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,620
the same kind of idea is used to treat
patients that have severe liver disease.

699
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,550
Now you might be think about an
implantable device like that,

700
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,060
but unlike the, uh, the pancreas,

701
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,640
a device that replaced the
functions of your liver,

702
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:14,630
we talked about all the
different functions of your
liver to make an artificial

703
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:19,160
device like that pancreas that provided
all the functions of your liver would

704
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:21,800
need a lot of liver cells and
it would have to be pretty big.

705
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,640
So people aren't yet thinking about
an implantable device for liver.

706
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,500
What they do use it though is for as
a device to support the function of

707
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,480
patients. If this is a patient
who has a disease liver,

708
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,640
they're waiting for a liver transplant,

709
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:40,790
how can you keep them alive without a
functioning liver during the time when

710
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,620
they're waiting for a
transplant to arrive?

711
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,200
What some hospitals are now using our
devices in which pig liver cells are

712
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:53,400
suspended in a hollow fiber reactor,
very much like a dialysis unit.

713
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,060
And so the patient is on
something like dialysis,

714
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:00,900
but dialysis that not only
removes waste products, dialysis,

715
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:05,760
that provides liver function as well,
because inside this unit,

716
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,120
our liver cells are hepatocytes that are
performing all the functions that liver

717
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:14,640
inside your body would perform,
right?

718
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:19,641
So this is another example
of an artificial organ and
artificial organ that's

719
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:23,920
used, uh, in, in, um, uh,

720
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,490
many thousands of times
around the country.

721
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,490
Every day is this unit here called a heart
lung bypass or cardiopulmonary bypass

722
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,330
machine.

723
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:38,330
And this machine can replace the function
of your lungs and your heart during an

724
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:43,890
operation. So if a surgeons
need to operate on your heart,

725
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:48,150
they can hook you up to this machine.
Instead, they can stop your heart,

726
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,000
your own heart. And, uh,

727
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,810
then this machine will take over the
functions of both your hearts and your,

728
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,430
and your lungs. How does it do that?
It does that because there's a pump,

729
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,570
a mechanical pump,
there's blood being removed from the body.

730
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,010
And uh, from the venous side,
this is blood that needs oxygen.

731
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,020
It's being pumped at the normal cardiac
output through a device that oxygenates

732
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:17,850
it. So the pumps replace
the function of your heart.

733
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,090
The oxygenator replaces
the function of your lungs.

734
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,080
Blood is pumped through the oxygenator.
It goes from being oxygen,

735
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:29,520
poor carbon dioxide,
rich to being carbon dioxide,

736
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:33,000
poor oxygen rich and then
goes back into your body.

737
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:39,060
You can remain on a pump like
this for several hours while,

738
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:43,890
uh, while the surgeon, uh,
does a heart transplant,

739
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:48,150
replaces your heart while the while
the surgeon does a valve replacement,

740
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,840
while the surgeon replaces a
coronary artery, for example,

741
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,030
this machine can keep your,

742
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,930
can basically serve as an artificial
heart and lungs during surgery.

743
00:46:59,130 --> 00:46:59,963
Of course,

744
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,350
one of the things that you would like to
do is be able to do something like this,

745
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:09,620
but to totally replace the function of
the heart and have this is only valuable

746
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:15,180
when you're in the operating
room. It requires a, an extensive,

747
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,890
um, um, uh,

748
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:23,130
an extensive and talented team
to operate it, to keep you alive.

749
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,001
What would,

750
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:28,320
what has been a goal of biomedical
engineers for many decades is to design an

751
00:47:28,321 --> 00:47:31,960
artificial heart that could be totally
implanted and could replace the function

752
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:35,770
of your heart when your heart begins
to fail. And we're not there yet.

753
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:39,130
There are still, there are
still problems. And what this,

754
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,940
what this slide shows you is some of
the divine designs that have been tested

755
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:47,350
over time. This is an early design,
not have an artificial heart, but of a,

756
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,740
of a, of a, uh,

757
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,170
artificial ventricular assist device.

758
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:57,090
This is a device that's supposed to
give your ventricle and extra boost, uh,

759
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,031
when it needs it.

760
00:47:58,031 --> 00:48:01,870
If your heart is failing and your normal
cardiac muscle isn't able to create the

761
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:06,670
force to get, uh, your blood
pressure and flow up high enough. Uh,

762
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,620
you can read more about
this in the book. This, uh,

763
00:48:09,621 --> 00:48:13,870
these two are cartoons that show you
what was called the Jarvik heart,

764
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,160
the Jarvik seven heart,

765
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,960
which was implanted in a number of
patients and still used in some clinical

766
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:22,000
centers around the world.

767
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:27,180
When a patient own heart has failed and
they're waiting for a heart transplant,

768
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,170
the surgeons will sometimes
make the decision,

769
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,310
the patient is not going to live without
some kind of support for their heart

770
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:36,940
function.

771
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,140
So they'll put an artificial heart in
just to keep them alive during the period

772
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:44,780
when they're hopefully waiting
for a heart to come. Uh,

773
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,630
and this is the most recent of
those. This is the albacore, uh,

774
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,580
heart.
Uh,

775
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:54,610
this is made of the same kinds of
materials we've been talking about made of

776
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:57,980
polymers, a very smooth, reliable, uh,

777
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,750
pump in a very small form that
can be hooked up, uh, to uh,

778
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:06,010
your normal vasculature and take
over the function of the heart.

779
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:11,580
So many of the problems that have been
largely solved up to this point here is

780
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:16,651
to develop materials that could be in
continuous contact with blood and not have

781
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:21,340
the kinds of clotting or other
reactions that could, uh,

782
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:25,870
that could cause problems if you use
this kind of a device and a person,

783
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,140
those problems have not entirely,
but largely been solved.

784
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:32,920
The major problem with an artificial
heart now is how to power it.

785
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,940
That producing all this mechanical energy
that's required to pump blood and keep

786
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:42,340
your blood pressure high requires energy.

787
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:47,620
And so all of these hearts
have an external power source
with them. So there are,

788
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:52,960
there are cables that come from
inside the patient outside to a,

789
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,890
to a system of batteries
that power the heart.

790
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:02,290
And it's not possible yet to make that
power source small enough that it could

791
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,124
be,
uh,

792
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,720
conveniently either implanted or
worn by the patient for chronic use.

793
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,580
And that's one of the biggest problems
with the design of this particular

794
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:16,270
artificial organ now.
Okay.

795
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:21,330
So we'll meet this afternoon
in section a course review and,

796
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:26,050
uh, please come with questions.
I, as I mentioned, I'll
have some material prepared,

797
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:30,880
uh, to just describe what's covered that
we've covered in the last half of the

798
00:50:30,881 --> 00:50:33,640
course on the final
spin. A pleasure. Thanks.
