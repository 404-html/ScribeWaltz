1
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,213
Um,

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,920
so I'm going to continue talking
about a renal physiology today. Again,

3
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:19,250
this is covered in chapter nine.
You'll,

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,860
you will have noticed as you're reading
chapter nine that there's more covered

5
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,560
than just a renal physiology there.

6
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:30,210
It also talks about bio transformations
and the role of the liver in getting rid

7
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:34,680
of substances. So we're not going to
cover that part in class, but, uh, but I,

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,150
but I encourage you to read
it as a whole, uh, to get, uh,

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,990
a broader perspective of how kidney
function fits into the overall ability of

10
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:47,991
your body to maintain what we call
homeostasis or a constant environment,

11
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,370
which I talked about last time.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,440
One of the important elements of this
constant environment is to maintain

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,980
sodium, potassium, bicarbonate,

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,010
and the levels of other key molecules at
a constant level throughout the day and

15
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:07,580
throughout your life. And, uh,

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,850
it does that and you're able to do that
not by regulating how much you eat of

17
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,684
those things,

18
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,680
but the kidney does that
for you by sensing what
concentrations are in your body,

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,140
keeping what you need and getting
rid of what you don't need.

20
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,040
And we started talking about how the
kidney is able to accomplish this

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,450
remarkable, uh, task. And, um,

22
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,490
hopefully the main point I wanted to make
a in the last lecture was how grateful

23
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,770
you ought to be that your
kidneys do function properly.

24
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:39,530
Because as one of the results of
that is that you only have to, uh,

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,010
you only have to produce about a liter
or a liter and a half of urine per day to

26
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:44,970
get rid of all the,

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,180
all the waste products that are
produced by metabolism in your body.

28
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,040
Without that concentrating
ability of your kidney, I mean,

29
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:58,041
the ability of the kidney to produce a
urine that's very concentrated in waste

30
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,930
rather than dilute in waste,
uh,

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,550
you only have to relieve yourselves and
a liter and a half of fluid every day

32
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:09,060
instead of the hundred or so leaders
that you'd have to in the absence of that

33
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,470
ability to concentrate.

34
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,400
And that makes possible a lot of
the things that we enjoy in life,

35
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,070
like sitting through a 50
minute lecture. Right? So, uh,

36
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,010
what I want to talk about today is some
of how the, how the kidney does that.

37
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,040
And I'm going to go back a few
steps because I covered a lot.

38
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,190
I wanted to give you an overview at
the end of sort of the last half of the

39
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,160
lecture last time about
how the nephron functions.

40
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,210
And I'm going to go back now and step
through it a little bit more slowly and

41
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:39,600
talk about some of the
details. Now, the, the, the,

42
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,170
like the other systems we've talked about,
the brain,

43
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,720
the heart, the circulatory system, uh,

44
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,940
the kidney has a very sort of
rich and complex physiology,

45
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,980
which now we understand a fairly well.

46
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,260
And so we're only going to
scratch the surface of that.

47
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,040
And if you get excited about it, um,
there are ways for to learn more,

48
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,140
uh, in your time here at Yale
and certainly beyond. Okay.

49
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,510
So, uh, this is a picture that I showed
you before sorta to orient you again.

50
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,260
And I have this picture of a
kidney, uh, lying on its side,

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,090
right? And, uh, it's a layered structure.

52
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,440
The outer layer or the sort of shell
around the outside of the kidney.

53
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:26,200
This fibrous capsule,

54
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,590
which sort of distinguishes what's
inside the kidney from what's outside the

55
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:32,560
kidney.
The layer below that is called the cortex.

56
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,660
The inner layers that have these sort of
strike patients is called the Medulla.

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,320
And all of this comes together in this
region here called the renal pelvis.

58
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,750
This region where the renal artery enters
the renal vein leaves and the ureter

59
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,280
exits the kidney as well.
Okay?

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,670
So everything collects sort of at
what's at the bottom of this diagram,

61
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,590
but it would be on the, um, the uh,

62
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,540
insight or a medial surface of the kidney.
And it's in its anatomic position.

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,640
I mentioned last time that the
functional units of the kidney are this,

64
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,980
uh, this, uh, structure called a Nephron,

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,690
that each kidney has about a million of
these nephrons and that they're oriented

66
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,010
within these layers.

67
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,130
So a nephron is going to sit sort of on
this axis here going up and down in this

68
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,140
diagram. So that's the reason why
I turned this kidney on its side.

69
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,580
So when you look at the Nephron here,

70
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,080
you can think about it sitting in
this orientation, uh, in the kidney.

71
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,720
And of course the kidney has
this sort of curved structures.

72
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,800
So the nephrons are going
to sort of radiate out from
the central portion in, uh,

73
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,010
through the Medela and up into the cortex
with the Glomerulus near the cortex

74
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,190
and the loop of Henley
stretching down into the Medela.

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,370
I also, uh, mentioned several
features of the nephron.

76
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,130
One is the glomerulus
where the, uh, the, the,

77
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,720
the place where filtration takes place,

78
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,310
this tuft of capillaries
that surrounded by a capsule.

79
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,880
And so the capsule is there to catch
this filtrate that's produced by high

80
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:21,580
pressure inside the arterial system,

81
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,630
forcing some fluid out through
these leaky capillaries and the,

82
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,631
and the capsule called Bowman's capsule
is there to catch this fluid and started

83
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:34,510
on its way through this series of tubules.

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,880
And I talked about different
regions of the tubules,

85
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,350
the proximal convoluted tubule, proximal
because it's near the gum aerialists,

86
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,700
the loop of Henley,

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,320
this structure that stretches down through
the cortex into the Mandala and then

88
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:50,820
back up again. And the
distal convoluted Tubule, uh,

89
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,010
which is farther from the glomerulus
and empties into the collecting duct,

90
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,390
which then
moves down through the Cortex,

91
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:04,590
through the Medela and into this region
of the renal pelvis where all the

92
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:08,700
collecting ducts empty into the
ureter and then onto the bladder.

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,351
So,
uh,

94
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:15,351
so a filtrate of plasma is produced here
in the Glomerulus and as this filtrate

95
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:16,830
of plasma,

96
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,830
this fluid that is going to be urine at
some point moves through this series of

97
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,490
tubules. It gets, uh, it gets
processed, it gets modified,

98
00:06:26,491 --> 00:06:28,680
it gets changed and in particular,

99
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,980
the cells of these tubules are able to
reabsorb the molecules that you need.

100
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,160
They reabsorb a lot of water,
they reabsorb a lot of sodium,

101
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,200
potassium bicarbonate,
and they do that without reabsorbing.

102
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:47,500
A lot of the waste products you
don't need like urea. Okay. And, uh,

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,720
as you might guess,

104
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,750
given this configuration that there's
some interplay between the activities that

105
00:06:55,201 --> 00:07:00,090
happen at different parts of
the tubule. That is, if, if,

106
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,440
uh, sodium is being reabsorbed in
the proximal Tubule, which it is,

107
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,040
then that, where does
that sodium go? Right.

108
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,980
It's pumped out of the 2
billion into this space around.

109
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,890
Okay.

110
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,230
In the, into the space of the
kidney surrounding it. Nate,

111
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,980
would you mind getting the door
again? Sorry about that. Uh,

112
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,200
in sodium is going to accumulate out here.

113
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,270
Now where does that sodium go?

114
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:27,180
Well eventually it's going to go back
into the blood so there must be a lot of

115
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:30,240
blood vessels around there as well.
They're not shown in this diagram.

116
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:34,470
There'll be shown in the next one.
So this sodium leaves the leaves,

117
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:39,471
the leaves the urine through the walls
of the tubules and is reabsorbed back

118
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:45,390
into blood vessels. But that leaves
some sodium out here in this space.

119
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,290
And one of the really interesting
things about the kidney,

120
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:53,070
which we won't be about the Nephron in
particular that we won't be able to talk

121
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:58,071
about it in so much detail is how one
part of the tubule system uses the result

122
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:03,540
of the other in order to
establish gradients to produce
this concentrated urine.

123
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,370
We're not really going to talk about that,

124
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:09,690
but I wanted to mention it on
this diagram here, that there's a,

125
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,600
that there's a,

126
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,300
that there are real important reasons
why the tubules are arranged in the

127
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:17,100
anatomical pattern,
that they are.

128
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,030
An additional thing,
which I mentioned last time,

129
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:26,590
is that if you looked as
cell biologists did at the,

130
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,400
at the cells that make up
these linings of these tubules,

131
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,150
you'd find that they look different
in different parts of the nephron.

132
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,670
And this has to do with
their different functions.

133
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,730
Some are very good at reabsorbing sodium,

134
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:44,740
some are very good at reabsorbing water
and uh, some are good at other functions.

135
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:49,000
And so the function of each of these
groups of cells that make up different

136
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:53,350
portions of the Tubule, uh, is critical
for overall nephron function. And we'll,

137
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:53,980
we'll,

138
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,530
I'll say a little bit about that just to
give you a flavor for how that happens

139
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,540
without talking too
much about the details.

140
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,443
Okay.

141
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,090
So this shows, uh, a collection
of nephrons sort of in,

142
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,420
in a more complex arrangement.
I've got the kidney here,

143
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,860
so you can be reminded again that this
might be a structure that comes from here.

144
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,470
Uh, and then you can see several
nephrons in particular. There's, uh,

145
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:23,050
there's a lot of glow marea lie in
this picture where the nephron that's

146
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:27,040
associated with this goal. Marea listen,
this girl, Mary, let's aren't shown, uh,

147
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:31,780
so that we can focus on, on,
uh, just uh, just a few of them.

148
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,290
Uh,

149
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,980
but just to give you a sense for this
million nephrons that are arranged in the

150
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:38,860
kidney or they have their go
your light, I different, uh,

151
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,320
at different locations up and down,

152
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,390
they are surrounded by their proximal
and distal convoluted tubules and these

153
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:51,220
loops of Henley stretched down into the
[inaudible] region and then come back up.

154
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,830
And I wanted to use this more complicated
diagram to sort of illustrate the

155
00:09:56,831 --> 00:10:00,700
flow. How does fluid move
through this, through this, uh,

156
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,560
through one particular nephron within
this system here. And so I hope this,

157
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,040
uh, this comes out. Can you see the
red? Did you see the Red Arrow up here?

158
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,540
So that Red Arrow represents
arterial flow of blood.

159
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,060
And this is a branch of the renal artery,

160
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,050
which is serving this whole
collection of nephrons that are here.

161
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,350
And of course that vessel
branches at some point.

162
00:10:23,351 --> 00:10:25,450
And here I show a branch of a branch,

163
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,830
which is heading up towards these Gomera
lie up in this upper region of the

164
00:10:29,831 --> 00:10:31,360
Cortex,
right?

165
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,450
So blood is flowing through these
branches of the renal artery into the,

166
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,130
into the,
um,

167
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,410
the substance of the kidney and it flows
up into Oakland. Marion, let's here now,

168
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,450
because this is,
um,

169
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,010
this is not too distant
to branch from the aorta,

170
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,410
pressure is still high here.

171
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,920
You know that pressure remains pretty
high until you get down to the arterial

172
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,090
levels, right? We learned that
when we talked about the cert,

173
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,630
the circulatory system.
And so the pressure here is fairly high,

174
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,990
might be 70 or 80 millimeters of mercury.

175
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,630
And this is the pressure that
drives filtration in the Mary Lists.

176
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,330
So the Green Arrow,
which just appeared up here,

177
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,160
is supposed to indicate for
this goal, Mary Alice, right
there. Filtration happens.

178
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,910
Yeah.

179
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,150
And because of the pressure
drop in the [inaudible],

180
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,440
the low pressure in Bowman's space,
this space that surrounds it,

181
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,160
fluid is driven through the walls of
the capillary and collected outside.

182
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,620
And what is produced there is
really what I called last time,

183
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:47,621
an ultra filtrate of plasma that is the
urine or the filtrate that's going to

184
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:54,251
become end at this point
would be identical to plasma
in composition except all

185
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:59,500
the big items are removed.
All the large molecules,

186
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:02,710
all the cells are removed.
Other than that, it's identical.

187
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,430
So the concentration of sodium in
the field trade is the same as the

188
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:09,580
concentration of sodium and the
plasma concentration of urea,

189
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,170
same as concentration in the plasma
concentration of bicarbonate and so on.

190
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,290
As long as any molecule
that's below that cutoff,

191
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:21,100
it's going to have the same concentration
as it is in plasma. So there,

192
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,220
this green Arrow represents filtration.
From there,

193
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,100
the fluid moves through the
distal convoluted tubules,

194
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,640
which you can't really see here, but
it's up in this portion. The white,

195
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,650
if you can see on the uh,

196
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,500
here that some of these are
white and some of them are blue.

197
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,290
The white ones are the
proximal convoluted tubule,

198
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,760
but they're really not liking the diagram
before these, these convoluted tubules,

199
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,510
they're sort of mixed together,
right? They interact with one another,

200
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:47,890
uh,

201
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,760
that this filtrate goes
through the proximal convoluted
tubule down in the loop

202
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:55,330
of Henley. And now you can see, follow
these green arrows. It's moving down.

203
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,640
It takes a turn,
deepen them Adela,

204
00:12:57,641 --> 00:13:01,180
and starts coming back up again and um,

205
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,390
and heads back up to the
distal convoluted tubule.

206
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,150
Now we're not going to talk
about it at all in this class,

207
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,190
but if you go on to study, uh, physiology,

208
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:13,390
one of the most amazing things
about the Nephron is it's, uh,

209
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,410
is that this loop allows the nephron to
create a gradient of osmolarity within

210
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:25,210
the tissue,
outside the nephrons in the kidney.

211
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,800
And it's able to create a
concentration gradient of sodium,

212
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,860
basically a but of ions that it
can then use to reabsorb water.

213
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,860
So Austin was sitting
in the front last time,

214
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:42,250
mentioned that she thought Osmosis was an
important part of how the kidney works.

215
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:46,300
And it is osmotic forces
are how water concentration,

216
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,300
how water moves around in the kidney,

217
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,540
and the kidney is able to regulate how
concentrated or how dilute your urine is

218
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,100
by using osmotic gradients.

219
00:13:57,101 --> 00:14:01,630
And those osmotic gradients
are established in the
loop of Henley. And it's a,

220
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,550
it's, it's, it's really
a remarkable, um, uh,

221
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,910
a remarkable sort of biophysical,

222
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:10,390
a process that you'll learn about
if you study more renal physiology.

223
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,500
But there's a reason why the fluid goes
down and goes up and it's to establish

224
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:19,501
these gradients which the kidney uses
to concentrate or extract water from the

225
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,950
urine.
Uh,

226
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,040
this orange Arrow here represents the
flow going from the distal convoluted

227
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,580
tubule back into the collecting duct
and down through the collecting duct and

228
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:33,680
eventually into the
ureter. And so this, um,

229
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,840
is just a more complicated diagram
of what I've told you already.

230
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,720
Uh, and I encourage you to sort of walk
through it and look at all the parts that

231
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:48,310
you have a sense for how the anatomy
of the, uh, of the, uh, uh, kidney,

232
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,090
uh, works. This picture
I showed you before,

233
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:57,650
just to remind you of the first step
in producing urine is filtration.

234
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,200
And I've talked about
it several times now,

235
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:04,310
but there's this tuft of capillaries
which sits inside this capsule called

236
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:08,520
Bowman's capsule. Uh, there's
an artery which feeds, uh,

237
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,070
which feeds blood in,

238
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,600
called the afferent arterial
af af parent means towards,

239
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,940
so it's the,
uh,

240
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,840
it's the arterial that's carrying
blood towards the glomerulus.

241
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,460
And oops,
I went the wrong way somehow.

242
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,590
And the F Behrendt arterial,
which carries a, which carries

243
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,060
the blood out of the [inaudible],
right?

244
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:38,930
So now the flow rates here
would be different, right?

245
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,050
The blood that's flowing
through the [inaudible], the,

246
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,110
the amount of blood flowing through the
afferent arterial and the mouth flowing

247
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,610
through the f Faron deteriorate.

248
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,560
Arterial f ferret meaning away from our
different, because some fluids lost.

249
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,800
That's the amount that's
filtered into Bowman's space. Um,

250
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,130
and we talked about last time that these
are both arterials and that because

251
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:07,880
their arterials, they
can constrict or, or, or,

252
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,050
or reduce their diameters and expand,
dilate,

253
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,230
or expand their diameters.
And because of this,

254
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:18,140
if it constricts than
the pressure drop over,

255
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,330
that length of arterial
is going to change.

256
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,543
Right,

257
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,060
and having these two adjustable
resistances on both sides of the Golem

258
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,950
aerialists allows each nephron to
regulate what the pressure is in the fluid

259
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,870
inside the capillaries of the Glomerulus.
Now,

260
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:41,600
since it's pressure
inside these capillaries,

261
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,420
which is the driving force for filtration,

262
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:49,660
that means that each nephron has the
ability to adjust how much is filtered in

263
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:53,720
each column aerialists.

264
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,900
Now that if it were going to in a slide
or two going to talk about a concept

265
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:04,901
called the gold [inaudible] filtration
rate and that this is a concept that's

266
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:09,620
defined for your whole kidneys and the
goal American look, filtration rate,

267
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,630
we all have a glomerular filtration rate.

268
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:16,631
It's the rate at which filtrate is being
produced in all the Gulmarg ally of our

269
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,613
kidneys.

270
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,030
It's the rate at which the fluid that's
going to become urine is produced.

271
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:28,280
It's an important measure of how well
your kidney is functioning is how much

272
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,290
filtrate is producing per minute.

273
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,590
And what I want to emphasize
on this diagram here,

274
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:37,730
that another remarkable thing about the
function of the kidney is that each of

275
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:42,731
these individual million or 2 million
nephrons are able to adjust their

276
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:48,020
individual filtration rate by
changing the pressure within, uh,

277
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,680
within the goal.
Maryville is,

278
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,680
and of course this was a picture I showed
you last time of the actual filtration

279
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:55,514
membrane,

280
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,580
the surface of these capillaries where
this pressure drop acts and through which

281
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,290
large things are filtered out.

282
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,620
So here's, uh, uh,

283
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:11,350
a cartoon of the gold lists.

284
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,790
And this cartoon actually
shows, uh, several things. One,

285
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,580
it shows the, the, uh, the arteriole,

286
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:22,390
the afferent arterial that's coming in
and the efferent arterial is going out.

287
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:26,830
And so here's the Tuft of capillaries
that make up the [inaudible] and here's

288
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:31,630
Bowman's space which is ready to catch
the filtrate. And so this Arrow here,

289
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:34,570
this first Arrow represents the,
um,

290
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,630
the filtrate that's produced in
the Glomerulus of this particular,

291
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,970
uh, nephron. Now after that
filtrates produced it, it, it,

292
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,090
it starts to flow through the proximal
convoluted tubule and then through the

293
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:51,160
loop of Henley and the
distal convoluted tubule.

294
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:54,490
And eventually be the collecting
duct and as we know from last time,

295
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,860
several things can happen.

296
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,550
One is that molecules within this
fluid can be reabsorbed and if they're

297
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,830
reabsorbed they move out of the tubular
system and into back into blood.

298
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,940
And that's why there are blood vessels
surrounding all the nephrons in the

299
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:17,470
kidney so that there's so there's a
blood flow that's ready to catch these

300
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:19,750
molecules as their
reabsorbed from the tubules.

301
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,700
We also mentioned that there is some
special processes of secretion so that the

302
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:28,780
blood vessels in the kidney are smart
enough to detect some molecules and

303
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,510
secrete them actively into the,
into the urine,

304
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,650
and then whatever is not reabsorbed.

305
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Plus what's secreted is what ends up in
the urine after it flows through all the

306
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,264
tubules.

307
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,690
So what's different here is that instead
of showing the complex geometry of the

308
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:50,980
tubules, this just shows a tube which
is going to the bladder down here.

309
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,020
And this,

310
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,020
this diagram is simplified because I
wanted to just talk about one concept and

311
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:00,460
that's this glove Merial
or filtration rate.

312
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,940
The rate at which fluid is produced in
the [inaudible] of all of the kidneys.

313
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,350
Now, and the question is how would you
measure this glomerular filtration rate in

314
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,160
people? If it's an important measure of
kidney function, how would you measure it?

315
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,530
And it turns out that that physiologists
have learned how to measure it by

316
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:24,160
taking advantage of a particular
molecule called Inulin.

317
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,200
Inulin is a molecule that's not a normal
part of our diet. It's a polysaccharide,

318
00:20:29,201 --> 00:20:33,580
but it's a polysaccharide that is of of
sort of intermediate molecular weight.

319
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,370
I think it's about a thousand
or 2000 and molecular weight,

320
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,920
but your body doesn't
know how to digest it.

321
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,400
And so if you get inulin in your blood,

322
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,370
it just circulates and
isn't changed at all.

323
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,060
But it's small that it's
filtered in the glomerulus.

324
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,180
And so if there's Inulin in the blood,

325
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,720
then it gets filtered through the Glenn
Marya lists and ends up in the ultra

326
00:20:58,331 --> 00:20:59,164
filtrate.

327
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,750
Another remarkable property about
Inulin is that it's not reabsorbed.

328
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,680
There's no reason for your body to
reabsorb it because it's not something you

329
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:12,640
can really use. You don't need it
and it's not actively secreted.

330
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,730
So whatever gets filtered
ends up in the urine.

331
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,560
So this molecule turns out to be a
convenient tool that physicians can use to

332
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:27,340
measure your glove law filtration rate
in the event that they want to test your

333
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:31,900
kidney function. So how would you do that?
You would inject an an amount of, uh,

334
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:36,460
of Inulin into the blood and
you would measure how much,

335
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,760
um, how much, what's the
concentration of inulin in the plasma?

336
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,480
So you'd,

337
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,200
you would inject some amount of Inulin
and you'd measure how much of it is in

338
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:48,034
the plasma.

339
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,820
You then wait over some period of time
and you would collect the urine and you'd

340
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:58,750
measure how much of that inulin
appears in the urine. Now,

341
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,040
since Inulin is neither
reabsorbed nor secreted,

342
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,430
however many molecules of Inulin are
filtered at the Mary has to be the same as

343
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:13,570
the number of molecules
that enter the urine, right?

344
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,420
It's not reabsorbed,
it's not secreted.

345
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,890
So whatever number of molecules
enter here, they have to leave here.

346
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,700
So if I know the concentration
of Inulin in the urine,

347
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,300
I know how much urine is produced
over some period of time.

348
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,820
I know the concentration in the plasma.

349
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,180
Remember that one of the features of
this ultra filtrate is that it just cuts

350
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,920
off in molecular weight,
but whatever concentration,

351
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,170
if you're below that molecular way,

352
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,350
whatever concentration is in the plasma
is the same as the initial concentration

353
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,150
in the ultra filtrate.
And,

354
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,780
and so the plasma in
concentration is the same here.

355
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,220
So if I just do a simple
accounting for all the Inulin,

356
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,590
whatever the glomerular
filtration rate is,

357
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:04,390
times the concentration in the plasma has
to equal whatever the concentration in

358
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:08,230
the urine is times the, uh,
the rate of urine production.

359
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,540
I can measure in a person how much
you're in, they're producing per time.

360
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,200
You can measure the concentration
of insulin in the urine.

361
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,720
You can measure the
concentration in the blood,

362
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,990
and so you can calculate the
[inaudible] filtration rate. All right,

363
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,200
so this is a,

364
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,620
a method that takes advantage
of the unique properties
of this molecule in Ulan.

365
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,300
This is a, their physicians
use this general strategy.

366
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:38,560
In a variety of ways to measure flow
rates of things inside your body that are

367
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:40,090
difficult to measure directly.

368
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,260
And they do that by looking at what's
called a tracer molecule. In this case,

369
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:46,610
insulin is a tracer.

370
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,880
It's picked for its particular properties
that it's filtered freely and the Gold

371
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:54,110
Mary lists, but neither
reabsorbed, dark or are secreted.

372
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,400
And it allows you to calculate some uh,
um,

373
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:03,430
some physiological function sort of deep
inside your body so you can measure go

374
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:05,240
mango,
look filtration rate this way.

375
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,300
I've already showed you this
picture that shows uh, the,

376
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,550
the um, the, uh,

377
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,580
the vascular system of the kidney
sort of laid out in a line here.

378
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,830
So here's the renal artery branching into
f fair af Barrett arterials branching

379
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:28,310
into glomerular capillaries back into
[inaudible], arterioles and then, uh,

380
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,570
to the capillaries that surround the
tubules and the pressure dropped that are

381
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,560
associated with that.

382
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,740
And I show it just to remind you of
how the kidney could regulate its Mary

383
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,580
filtration rate by changing the diameters
of either the [inaudible] or the

384
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:47,150
afferent arterial,
changing the resistances,

385
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,560
changing the relative pressure
drops along the kidney vasculature.

386
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,770
And therefore regulating the
important level, which is here.

387
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,020
How much pressure is in the glove
aerialist to drive filtration, right? So,

388
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:03,470
um, I've talked about this
several times now and I,

389
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,650
I think if you study that
diagram and read the text,

390
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:08,780
hopefully that will make sense to you.

391
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:14,170
But it is this pressure is what
drives inside the Glove Marea list,

392
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:17,240
the flow of, uh, of, uh,

393
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,030
filtrate and the production of
filtrate that becomes urine.

394
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,880
So what happens after this point?

395
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,050
What happens are these two processes
that we've talked about that make the

396
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:30,880
kidney different from a simple filter.

397
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,100
Filtration is an important
part of its function.

398
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,700
That's easy to understand from solar
sort of an engineering perspective.

399
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,650
You produced this ultra filtrate and then
the kidney works very hard to recover

400
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,480
the molecules that you need so that you
don't have to produce a large volume of

401
00:25:46,481 --> 00:25:50,170
urine in order to get rid of the waste.
And it does that by two processes,

402
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,080
reabsorption and secretion,
which I've already mentioned.

403
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,700
And we're really going to focus
mainly on reabsorption, uh,

404
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:01,210
for the rest of the time here today.
And in reabsorbtion the key,

405
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,320
um,

406
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,320
the key elements of reabsorption are
reabsorption of water or return of much of

407
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:15,970
this volume of water that's filtered at
the glow Marios and recovery of saw utes

408
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,860
that are needed like sodium and
potassium and bicarbonate. Yeah.

409
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,330
This table just sort of tells you in
general what happens at different portions

410
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,310
of the,
of the uh,

411
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,790
nephron filtration happens
in Bowman's capsule.

412
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,470
I think I've said enough about that one.

413
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,270
Selective reabsorption happens in
all other elements of the Tubules,

414
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:43,890
the proximal,
the loop of Henley and the distal tubule.

415
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,290
And how does selective
reabsorption happens?

416
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:50,760
It happens by the physical processes
of diffusion or just the movement of

417
00:26:50,761 --> 00:26:53,370
molecules down concentration gradients.

418
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,280
And it also happens by active transport.

419
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,110
And we talked about active transport
earlier we talked for example,

420
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:03,090
when we were talking about
the action potential,

421
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:08,070
we talked about this active transport
system that's able to shuttle sodium and

422
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:10,500
potassium molecules across membranes.

423
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,340
So most cells in the body have this
active transport system called the sodium

424
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,510
potassium pump or the
sodium potassium ATPase.

425
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,410
It's main function is to bring
a sodium from inside the cell,

426
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:29,490
pump it out,

427
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:35,250
take potassium from outside the cell
and pump it in and as a result of the

428
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,750
action of this pump,

429
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,080
that's what creates this normal state
that you have high extracellular sodium

430
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:48,360
concentrations and high intracellular
potassium concentrations,

431
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,660
right?
If that pump wasn't working,

432
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:57,410
then sodium would diffuse from outside
to in because the concentration is higher

433
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:03,561
outside than inside and potassium would
diffuse from inside to out because the

434
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:06,630
concentration's higher
inside than outside.

435
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,340
Now this pump is driven by ATP.

436
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,100
ATP is a molecule.
It's one of the end product.

437
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,800
It's a molecule that's produced when we
metabolize sugars and get energy from

438
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:24,801
them and we store them in the form of
ATP and then the body uses ATP to do

439
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:28,650
things like operate this pump.

440
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,500
A lot of the ATP that you're using
right now in your body is being used to

441
00:28:36,321 --> 00:28:41,321
maintain the concentration of sodium high
outside yourselves and potassium high

442
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:45,590
inside yourselves. Why? Why are, why are
you spending so much energy doing that?

443
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,720
Why do you,
why would you?

444
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,290
Body has spent so much energy trying
to maintain these differences of ion

445
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,280
concentrations.

446
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,203
Remember Justin,

447
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,080
because these concentrations have
to exist for cellular functions like

448
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,370
yeah,

449
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,920
like the generation of action
potentials in the nervous system,

450
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,900
like the generation of action
potentials in the heart that that drive

451
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:21,640
contraction and beating of
the heart. Without these
differences of concentration,

452
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,800
you could neither send nerve impulses.
Your heart would not beat,

453
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,730
maintains life and lots of
the activities of life and,

454
00:29:30,731 --> 00:29:34,810
and so a lot of energy goes
into producing them in, in,

455
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,960
in those same kinds of processes are used
in the kidney to shuttle ions from one

456
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:44,530
place to another. Show you an example of
that in a minute. Reabsorption of water.

457
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,980
I tried to emphasize last time how
important reabsorption of water is because

458
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,970
you have to produce a lot of filtrate
in order to collect a lot of waste

459
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:55,960
products,
right?

460
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,740
You've got to produce a lot of filtrate
in order to get a lot of urea into the

461
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:04,390
urine. You don't want to lose that
much water because any water you lose,

462
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:08,320
you have to drink to
recover from. And, uh,

463
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:10,630
so reabsorption of water is,

464
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,010
it is a very important process
that happens in the kidney.

465
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,420
It happens in all the
tubular, uh, segments.

466
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,740
Secretion happens mainly in the distal
convoluted tubule. And as I mentioned,

467
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,330
we're not going to say
very much about that.

468
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,720
So if we were just able to look and take
one nephron and take that complicated

469
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:33,721
series of tubes that I showed you in
diagrams before and stretch it out while

470
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:38,500
it's still is functioning and then measure
as a function of distance along this

471
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:39,820
complicated to bill,

472
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,370
what's the concentration or relative
concentration of some of these key, uh,

473
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,970
molecules we're talking about?

474
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:49,960
What we would see is shown in this
diagram here and I mentioned the special

475
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,160
property of Inulin,

476
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,700
that it's neither reabsorbed or secreted
and that's shown here by this flat

477
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,470
line.
So whatever gets filtered

478
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,270
in the [inaudible] list,

479
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,640
that number of molecules remains in the
urine throughout its progress through

480
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:12,170
the Tubules,
right?

481
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,670
That's why you can use it as a tracer
to measure GFR because it's neither

482
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:19,280
reabsorbed in any of these
tubules north secreted.

483
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,790
So the number of molecules that
come out in the field trait,

484
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,070
that's the number that leave in the urine.

485
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,840
That's not true for glucose.

486
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,900
I mentioned yesterday that glucose is
not normally found in urine when it,

487
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,920
when you do find glucose in the urine
of an individual that indicates that

488
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:41,590
there's some disease process going on,

489
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,900
and that's because glucose is very
efficiently reabsorbed in the proximal

490
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:51,730
tubule. So if I just looked at
concentration within the filtrate,

491
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:54,190
within the urine,
through the proximal Tubule,

492
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,600
there'd be a lot of glucose here and that
concentration drops as we move through

493
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:02,550
the proximal tubule such that
there's no glucose in the filtrate.

494
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,900
By the time we get to the
end of the proximal Tubule,

495
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,330
that's one of the simpler cases that
glucose is just reabsorbed in the proximal

496
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:15,010
tubule. Sodium on the other hand
has a much more complicated, uh,

497
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,540
pattern that sodium concentration drops
as you move through the proximal tubule.

498
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,030
So a lot of that sodium is reabsorbed,

499
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,660
about two thirds of it is
reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.

500
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,880
Then if I looked over the loop
of Henley in the descending loop,

501
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,710
the loop that goes down,
actually sodium molecules come back in

502
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,150
and then sodium molecules go
back out in the ascending loop.

503
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,290
And this has to do with the establishment
of gradients of sodium that I

504
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,950
mentioned before in the
interstitial space, uh,

505
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,670
which allows the kidney to,
this represents those,

506
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,430
the sodium that's used to
create those gradients.

507
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,220
Those gradients are used
for water absorption.

508
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,470
And then most of the rest
of the kidney has, uh,

509
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,620
the rest of the sodium is cleaned up or
recovered in the distal tubule and the

510
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:11,540
collecting tubules, urea, she has
this pattern here a lot reabsorbed,

511
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,440
but then it comes back out again
and then it's reabsorbed finally.

512
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,890
Now some of these things are going to be
hard for you to understand why they go

513
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:19,940
in and out.

514
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,860
And it has to do with this complex
interplay that I mentioned before between

515
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,830
processes that are happening in
different parts of the Tubule,

516
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,280
establishing gradients that are then
used in different portions to, uh,

517
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,710
to aid in reabsorption.

518
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,703
Okay,

519
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,260
how do these things happen?
How is sodium, for example,

520
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:45,150
reabsorbed so efficiently
in the proximal tubule?

521
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,391
Well,

522
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:48,750
I'm going to give you a simple example
of that just so that you have a way of

523
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:50,100
thinking about the mechanism,

524
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,100
but you're going to remember that
there's more going on than just what I

525
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:57,330
described. But I imagine that
this is the proximal tubule cell,

526
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:02,390
a part of the tubule just after Bowman's
space where sodium concentration is

527
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,810
high inside the, uh, filtrate. Right?

528
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,420
What's the concentration of sodium in the
filtrate? Right after the [inaudible]?

529
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,890
It's the same as the
concentration in plasma,

530
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,803
right?

531
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,930
The same as the concentration in plasma.

532
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,320
What's the concentration of sodium
inside cells that line the tubule.

533
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,410
Okay.

534
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,110
Well, like all cells, these
have sodium potassium, uh,

535
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,340
okay.

536
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,020
Pumps. And so the concentration of
sodium inside these cells is low.

537
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,410
Okay.

538
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:41,120
The intracellular concentration of
sodium is low, high concentration here,

539
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:45,980
low concentration here. So if this
membrane is permeable to sodium,

540
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,730
it's going to diffuse
from inside to outside.

541
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:50,980
Okay.

542
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,980
What would it allow the sodium
diffuse through membranes?

543
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,983
Yeah.

544
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,490
Charged molecules don't diffuse
through membranes on their own,

545
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,970
not if it's just a lipid biolayer.
What allows sodium to diffuse?

546
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,760
What kinds of structures allow sodium
to diffuse through a lipid membrane.

547
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,830
Protein channels, ion
channels, sodium channels,

548
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:18,010
so there must be sodium channels
in these membranes and there are,

549
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,260
and it's the sodium moods through.

550
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,360
Now you have high sodium inside are
higher than before because sodium can leak

551
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:26,470
through these channels,

552
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:32,310
but you have on this other surface of
the cell you have a lot of these sodium

553
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:40,021
potassium pumps and the sodium potassium
pumps are constantly pumping sodium out

554
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,650
and bringing potassium in. Sodium out
potassium man and there's pumps here,

555
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:49,740
there's pumps here,
there's pumps here, right?

556
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,340
And so any molecules of sodium that enter
this side get efficiently pumped out

557
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:57,030
through the other side.

558
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:58,760
Okay.

559
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,920
The net effect of these two processes,

560
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,100
diffusion on this boundary and active
transport on this boundary is that sodium

561
00:36:06,651 --> 00:36:09,980
molecules move from inside
the tube to outside the tube.

562
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,640
Now if sodium concentration is high
here, where's it going to go? Well,

563
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:20,440
there are blood vessels up here and
they're going to reabsorb this sodium just

564
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:22,870
by simple diffusion processes as well.

565
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,830
So blood that's flowing through this
region is going to take all the extra

566
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:27,664
sodium away.

567
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:34,020
So the net effect here is that sodium
gets moved from in this filtrate,

568
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:40,450
this urine back into the blood.
Now the,

569
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,140
the property of these cells which
allows this to happen is that the sodium

570
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:51,730
potassium pumps are only on this surface.
They're not on this surface.

571
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:54,680
Okay.

572
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,190
The sodium potassium pumps are only on
this surface and not on this surface.

573
00:36:58,191 --> 00:36:59,150
On this surface,

574
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,100
just diffusion of sodium down its gradient
is the only thing that happens in on

575
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:08,660
this surface that sodium has moved
out into the interstitial space.

576
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,120
So this is one example of the kind of
properties that sells of the tubules use

577
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,100
in order to selectively move a particular
molecule from one side to the other.

578
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,380
What are the properties
that we talked about?

579
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,940
Membranes are leaky and brings our
leaky because they have channels.

580
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:30,941
Here's a leaky membrane here and membranes
have active transport systems that

581
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:34,430
move selectively ions from
one side to the other.

582
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,313
All right.

583
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,630
And that's um, this is an example
that shows how that works with sodium.

584
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,290
There are systems that work with all
of the ions that we've talked about,

585
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,370
not in exactly the same way but
with the same sorts of concepts.

586
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,323
Yeah.

587
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,670
I don't want to say too much about
this diagram. I just show that,

588
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,620
show it here so that, uh, you can,
you can look at it, uh, at, at your,

589
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,180
uh,
at your leisure.

590
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:06,200
That's what you would do
with your leisure time.

591
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:11,230
If you could study this diagram, which
just shows you something about, uh,

592
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,770
what kinds of transporters are,
are a functioning in different,

593
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,530
different cells of the proximal Tubule,
the uh,

594
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,240
ascending or descending limb
of, of a, of henleys loop,

595
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,700
the distal convoluted tubule,
the collecting duct.

596
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,630
And these are channels that allow for
selective movement of certain kinds of

597
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:33,650
molecules like sodium,
like glucose, uh, like, uh,

598
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,030
like a bicarbonate.
And,

599
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,720
and this table is a little
bit more complicated than
the one I showed you before,

600
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:44,770
but just to try to put it all
into perspective again, uh,

601
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,170
that the kidney because of
glomerular filtration produces,

602
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,510
produces, um, per 24 hours.

603
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,703
Um,

604
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,640
I didn't write out 26,000 milliequivalents
of sodium are filtered and almost all

605
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:05,210
of those are reabsorbed. Only a
few of them are ex greeted. Now,

606
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:08,570
if you happen to eat a lot more
salt on one day, what would happen?

607
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,070
You would filter more,

608
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,760
you would reabsorb a little less
and you would excrete that balance,

609
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,650
right?

610
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,450
You would filter more because you would
have eaten more salt than you needed. So,

611
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:23,150
so, so more sodium would appear
in your blood than normal.

612
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,160
The concentration will be slightly higher
in the plasma. You'd filter more of it,

613
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,690
you'd reabsorb less of it, and the
result would be, you would excrete more,

614
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,250
uh, the same thing with potassium
and with these other molecules here.

615
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,780
And interestingly,

616
00:39:38,781 --> 00:39:42,650
what this shows is the percentage of
these molecules that are reabsorbed.

617
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:46,430
And then in this table here shows you
what part of the tubular system that

618
00:39:46,431 --> 00:39:51,410
reabsorption takes place. So you could
think about that. Uh, if you wanted,

619
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,170
I want to just say one last word about
water balance. And this is just to, uh,

620
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,190
to uh, to illustrate, uh,

621
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,340
the concept of homeostasis that we've
been talking about for all these ions

622
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:08,320
before that you could think
of your body as a vessel, uh,

623
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,150
where their inputs and output for water.

624
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:16,190
The input is mainly the water that you
drink or that you take it in food because

625
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:20,690
some foods contain high quantities
of water to, for a normal individual,

626
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:25,130
you're going to take about 2.1 liters
of water in per day in food and drink.

627
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,510
You synthesize some water because some
of the chemical reactions that occur

628
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:33,290
during metabolism have
water as a byproduct, right?

629
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:35,990
Have waters of byproducts.
So you synthesize some water.

630
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:41,110
So your overall daily intake is
about 2.3 liters of water per day.

631
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,160
And you have to get rid of that water
because if you're taking in water and

632
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:50,660
you're not getting rid of it, then
you're expanding your volume, right?

633
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,020
And,
uh,

634
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,460
so you get rid of it in a variety of
ways about a liter and a half in urine,

635
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,590
almost a third of a leader through your
lungs because you breathe in air that's

636
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:04,860
relatively dry. You breathe out
air that's very humid. You know,

637
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,020
if you take a a glass plate and you
breathe out on it, it gets foggy, right?

638
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:12,170
You could see water condense
because your breath is much more,

639
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,750
has much more water in it,
the air around us.

640
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:17,090
So we lose actually quite a
lot of water that way. Uh,

641
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,740
through sweat and other activities,

642
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:22,880
you lose more water so that your
daily loss balances your daily intake.

643
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,910
Now what if you drink more water?
What if you drink? What if you're,

644
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,810
I know there's a lot of water
bottles in the room here.

645
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:32,690
A lot of you carry water around with
you and you drink water constantly

646
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,100
throughout day.
What happens?

647
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,303
Yeah,

648
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,450
you drink more water than this.
If you ingest 3.1 liters per water,

649
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:45,760
then you've got to lose
3.1.

650
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,640
You've got to lose 3.3 liters of water.

651
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,180
And normally what you lose in your
lungs and by sweat and other mechanisms,

652
00:41:52,181 --> 00:41:55,750
it doesn't change. What changes is the
amount that you, that you use in urine.

653
00:41:55,751 --> 00:41:57,010
So you're all familiar with this.

654
00:41:57,011 --> 00:42:01,620
If you drink more water one day than you
did the day before, you're going to, uh,

655
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,440
you're, you're going
to produce more urine.

656
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,860
Go to the bathroom more often.
I don't know another way
to say it. Well, I do know,

657
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,850
I don't want to say it any other
way. Uh, what, what if you,

658
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,100
what if instead of water,
you s you,

659
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,240
you decided on another
day not to eat any salt.

660
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,070
I can eat any salt during the day.

661
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:24,050
Okay.

662
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,883
What would happen?

663
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:29,460
Well,

664
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:34,460
you would need to maintain
your salt concentration high.

665
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,460
Needed to maintain the
salt concentration high.

666
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:38,510
Yeah,

667
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:42,440
your kidney has to lose a little
bit of salt. It can't recover 100%.

668
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:45,890
So if you ate no salt at all,
you can't recover 100% of it.

669
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:49,730
You're going to lose a little bit
of the salt through your urine. It,

670
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,010
it can't recover 100% of the salt.

671
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,980
So you can only lose a little
bit of salt through your urine.

672
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:55,880
Yeah.

673
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,000
Uh, and, but if you didn't eat any salt,

674
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,970
then your sodium concentration
is going to drop.

675
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,250
It would want to drop,
but your body won't allow that to happen.

676
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,020
The kidneys won't allow that to happen.

677
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,160
So if it notices that your sodium
concentration is going down,

678
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,220
but you're not bringing any salt,
more sodium men,

679
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,320
how else can it change the concentration?

680
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,730
It could decrease the volume of water
in your body so it could produce more

681
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,730
watery urine or urine with more watering.

682
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,260
So try this experiment.

683
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,650
Don't eat any salt means you
probably can't go to the dining hall,

684
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,410
but if you don't eat any salt for a day,

685
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,110
you will notice that you're
producing more urine.

686
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:42,300
If you weigh yourself in the morning,
you weigh yourself at night,

687
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:43,410
your weight will go down.

688
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,170
Okay?

689
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,170
Over the course of one day. That's
why it's easy to lose a pound or two.

690
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,810
You can do that by just
restricting salt in your diet.

691
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:54,760
But it's a nice example of how your
body and how the kidney in particular,

692
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:55,180
uh,

693
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:00,180
senses what concentrations are present
in your body and adjust what it can

694
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,570
depending on what you're eating in order
to maintain what's important and what's

695
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:09,070
important is the concentration
of extracellular sodium
has to be at the right

696
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:12,430
level so that your brain and
your heart can function properly.

697
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,463
Okay.

698
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,730
That's it for a renal physiology.

699
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:21,790
In the section this afternoon
we'll talk about dialysis.

700
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:27,030
Dialysis is the technology developed
by biomedical engineers over the last

701
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:31,150
century that allows people to live
without normal kidney function.

702
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:34,630
My performing some of these
essential functions outside the body.
