1
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,140
So this week we're gonna be talking about
the subject of tissue engineering and

2
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,140
it's covered directly in chapter 14,

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,670
but not in a lot of detail.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,020
And so I provided a couple
of other readings which um,

5
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,380
um, are listed here on this slide.
And these are in the, in the, uh,

6
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,560
in the lecture notes. If you go to
that folder, there's two papers,

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,130
one from 1993 and one from 2002.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,140
And so I would read them in that order,

9
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:47,760
read the one from 1993 and then the one
from 2002 and you'll see sort of how

10
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:48,361
this field,

11
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:53,361
which I'm going to describe today has
evolved over the last 15 years or so.

12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,310
And,
uh,

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,310
some of the challenges that were talked
about in this article from 1993 you'll

14
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:06,621
see are still present today is
turned out to be more difficult than,

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,260
uh, than biomedical engineers thought
to accomplish some of these things.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,970
And some of the things have gone faster.

17
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:15,000
We've made more progress than
we thought we would in 1993.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
So if you read those two papers,

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,090
read the the bit from chapter 14 about,
um,

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,030
about tissue engineering.
And then chapter 16.

21
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:28,560
I've also given you chapter 16 is about
bio materials and artificial organs,

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,700
but there might be some things in there
which are useful to you in, um, in uh,

23
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,190
understanding, uh, this subject as well.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,880
And a section we'll meet this Thursday
in the regular time and place.

25
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,310
So, um, so what's the motivation for, uh,

26
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,560
for tissue engineering and, um, this, uh,

27
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,210
slide has a lot of numbers on it and the
particular numbers are not important.

28
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,310
I've posted it in the notes for the
course so you can look at it, uh,

29
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,550
at your, at your leisure. But the, uh,

30
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,580
the main point here is that there are
many diseases that drugs cannot treat

31
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,790
effectively and their
diseases that are prevalent,

32
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,760
they don't occur in small numbers.
And that's why all the numbers are here.

33
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:21,560
So you can see how many incidences
there are of these different, uh,

34
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,260
of these different, uh, what
is labeled on this slide,

35
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:29,610
organ and tissue deficiencies.
For example, you know,

36
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:34,611
that a burns of the skin are quite common
and some burns are not severe enough

37
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:39,450
that they need any other treatment other
than maybe some antibiotic Lotion and

38
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,950
addressing while it heals. And
some burns are so, uh, so, uh,

39
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:47,090
severe or so extensive that they,
uh,

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,180
that they threaten the life of the
patient who has them. Uh, if you lose,

41
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,520
if you lose a nef of your skin,
uh,

42
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:59,130
you lose a lot of water
through that open area of skin,

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,240
you can become dehydrated, uh, to the
point where you can die of dehydration.

44
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,980
And so your skin is an important barrier
for keeping water inside your body.

45
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,750
And of course, your skin is a barrier for
keeping other things outside the body.

46
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:17,860
Toxins and in particular microorganisms,
viruses and bacteria.

47
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,140
And so your risk of infection is
tremendous if you have large burns over a

48
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:27,340
significant part of your body.
And there's no way to, uh,

49
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:32,341
that we currently know to speed up the
healing of skin fast enough that patients

50
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:37,450
that have severe skin skin
burns can survive that injury.

51
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,400
So what's done is that you
need a skin transplants,

52
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:42,911
right?

53
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:47,911
You need an preferably an autograft of
skin taking skin from one place in your

54
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,440
body and putting it into another,
right?

55
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,350
But if you have severe burns
over much of your body,

56
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:56,380
then there's no skin to graft,
right?

57
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,690
So you might take an aloe graft,

58
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,930
autograft is a graft from you,

59
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,950
from the individual to the individual
taking some of your tissue and moving them

60
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:08,680
to another location.
That's auto self graft.

61
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,700
Aloe graft is from a similar individual,
but not you.

62
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,910
Somebody who might be matched but not
perfectly matched immunologically to you.

63
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,410
And you get a graft from them.

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,430
So when you get a blood transfusion
from somebody that's not you,

65
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,240
but there's some matching that's gone
on to make sure that you're not going to

66
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:33,130
be incompatible with the blood.
That's an aloe graft. Xeno graft.

67
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,420
Zino x e n o is a graft between species.

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,810
So that would be a graph from
another species to too human,

69
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,920
for example, or between species.
So autograft, allograft, xenograft,

70
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:52,350
good words to know for our
discussion on tissue engineering. Um,

71
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,560
but you can imagine there's a limited
number of aloe grafts that his skin

72
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,590
transplants that are available
to treat a burns. And so,

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,640
and so not all the patients that need them
are able to get these kinds of graphs.

74
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:08,200
And so, uh, so life is threatened
in that situation. Not only burns,

75
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:09,700
but there are pressure sores.

76
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,810
What are commonly known as bed sores for
patients that have to spend significant

77
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,960
time in, uh, in a bed because of,

78
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,150
because of an accident.

79
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,930
Let's say they've had a spinal cord injury
and they have to spend a lot of time,

80
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,620
uh, recovering, uh, from that or
they can't move anymore on their own.

81
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,520
And they'll develop sores, which
are very difficult to heal. Um,

82
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,870
and diabetics, uh, because they, um,

83
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:38,500
because diabetes can affect,
uh,

84
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:43,360
the sensory nerves in your
extremities, uh, often get,

85
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,650
uh, sores in their extremities,
particularly in their feet or lower leg,

86
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,270
which don't heal very well,

87
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,320
partly because they can't
feel them as well anymore.

88
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:55,930
And so they become injured
and continue to get injured.

89
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,560
And partly because the process of
diabetes slows down healing in general.

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,030
These, they get ulcers or lesions
on their skin that don't heal.

91
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,130
And um, so just this top
category alone, lots of patients,

92
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,300
different indications,

93
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,350
not enough tissue to treat these
tissue deficiencies of the skin.

94
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,080
If you went down this list, you
would find, uh, many others as well.

95
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,100
So let me go down here.

96
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:27,101
We're going to talk about in some
detail the liver and when you get liver

97
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,350
disease,
that's severe enough.

98
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,820
The only medical option right
now is a liver transplant.

99
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,340
And we'll talk about why that's
the only option available for, uh,

100
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,610
for liver disease that
becomes very severe,

101
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,070
that could result from
some metabolic disorder,

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,430
from cirrhosis or from liver
cancer. Uh, but in that case, uh,

103
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,680
transplant is the only, it's
the only option. And, uh,

104
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:59,420
I'm sure you've all heard in the news
about cases where there is a patient,

105
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:04,420
often a child who has some, a disease
waiting for a transplant and calls,

106
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,080
we'll go out to the community.
Um, and uh, um, and uh,

107
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,880
this is a familiar,

108
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,330
a story in our society.

109
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,130
And the reason for that is because there
are a significant number of patients

110
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:23,690
that are in this category.
Not as many as in the case of skin,

111
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,280
but a significant number.

112
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,730
And there is something
like tens of thousands of
patients that are eligible for

113
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:34,580
liver transplants and waiting for them.
And why are they waiting?

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Because there's not enough donor organs
to satisfy the need of people that have

115
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,400
transplants.
And um,

116
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,140
and that's unlikely to change,

117
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,630
right? For a, uh, for a liver
transplant donor to become available.

118
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,140
Somebody has to die with a healthy liver.

119
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,490
They have to have consented to have
their organs used for another person,

120
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,790
and they have to be match immunologically
with a patient who's going to receive

121
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,340
the donor. And somehow those two
things have to come together,

122
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,020
right? And so all these
things have to work right?

123
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,230
In order for a liver donor
and a recipient to match,

124
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,820
they have to match not only biologically,

125
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,940
but it all has to match in
terms of timing as well.

126
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,640
And that's a complicated process.

127
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,280
So today if you go and look on
this, uh, on this website we've set,

128
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:42,730
we meaning we as a society have set up
organizations and procedures to try to

129
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,350
help with this matching process.

130
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,090
And so one of those is called the organ
procurement and transplantation network.

131
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,980
They keep track of all the patients that
are on lists waiting for organ organ.

132
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,640
They keep track of all the organs
that are going to come available and a

133
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:02,050
matching process occurs and you know,
and,

134
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:06,060
and computers are involved in all kinds
of the resources you would expect to be

135
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:10,620
involved in this thing. But if you look
for any particular kidney transplants,

136
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,980
there are currently, as
of yesterday, 75,000, uh,

137
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,770
individuals in the u us waiting
for, uh, waiting for a donor.

138
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:24,690
Kidneys in the liver there are 16,000.
So these are patients that today need a,

139
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,140
uh, uh, an organ donation there.

140
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:33,141
Physicians have decided that they're
too sick to respond to any other,

141
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,100
uh, treatment and they're just
waiting for an organ to appear.

142
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,930
We, I talked at the, in the very
first lecture you might remember,

143
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:44,880
I showed you this picture to talk about.

144
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,350
There's already very high
technology involved with this, uh,

145
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,880
with this medical effort.

146
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,090
And part of the technology are things
like this organ procurement network.

147
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,230
So this is,
you know,

148
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,670
run electronically on the Internet
using all of the high tech tools of

149
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:06,570
communication that we have in order to
connect physicians who are trying to

150
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:11,571
treat patients with physicians who find
that there's a donor available and by,

151
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,270
uh,

152
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,270
by other high tech industries like the
airlines who can quickly move Oregon's

153
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,110
from one place to another.

154
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,260
So if the donor of the Oregon died in
California and the recipient is here in

155
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:32,010
new haven, then you've got to get the
Oregon as quickly as possible from, uh,

156
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,090
from California to Connecticut and um,

157
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,090
and that that can be
done. Now sometimes. Um,

158
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,350
another technology which is embedded
in this is that some hours have to pass

159
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,890
right between when the organ is harvested
and the organ can be transplanted.

160
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,670
And so you need to be able to preserve
organs for that period however long that

161
00:10:56,311 --> 00:11:00,240
period is and you'd like to be able to
preserve them for a long period of time.

162
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,860
What if we could preserve donor kidneys
in the same way that we preserve blood?

163
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,700
So blood you,
many of you have gone when the,

164
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,200
when the Red Cross has has come
here looking for blood donations,

165
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,430
they take your blood,

166
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,610
they store it in a special way such that
it can be used up to three weeks past

167
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:26,031
the point when you donate it and that
creates many opportunities for your blood

168
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:30,030
to be useful in the same way if you
donated organs and there were ways to

169
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:34,380
preserve the organs, that would
be make them more useful as well.

170
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,640
And so there's that whole technology
behind this that I wanted to at least

171
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:40,110
describe to you in words.

172
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,830
And you could think about biomedical
engineers are currently working around the

173
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:47,610
world on better ways to preserve organs,
but it's a difficult problem,

174
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,920
can be accomplished in blood and certain
kinds of blood cells can be partially

175
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,760
accomplished with some tissues like skin
cannot really be done with livers or

176
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,940
kidneys at yet.
But there's a great need for that.

177
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,600
Um, why I wanted to say a little bit
more about why you have to take this

178
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,630
extraordinary measure of transplant,
uh,

179
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:14,340
to treat diseases like liver failure.
Uh,

180
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,380
when a liver becomes so
diseased that it cannot,

181
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,290
um, than it cannot recover
its function on its own. Uh,

182
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,970
lots of things go wrong.

183
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,150
And this chart is a table of some of the
functions which are happening every day

184
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,260
in your liver.

185
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,390
And the liver is an
important endocrine organ.

186
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,190
We talked about the endocrine system.
It makes hormones like IGF one,

187
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,070
it activates a vitamin D,

188
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,240
which functions as a hormone is an
important for structure of your bones.

189
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,360
It produces the hormones that are used
in your thyroid gland and many other

190
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,690
hormones. And so if your liver
starts to die, you start to lose.

191
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,370
The ability to produce those hormones.

192
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,630
And you can imagine then that lots of
things in your endocrine system start to

193
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:09,280
go wrong. The liver also produces
many of the clotting factors.

194
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,400
These are proteins that are
needed for clotting blood.

195
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,520
If you have an injury and
if the liver starts to die,

196
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:19,270
you're not making as many of these.
You can have a bleeding disorder.

197
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,700
It makes plasma proteins like albumin,
which have many functions in the body.

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It makes bile acids and bile acids are
very important as an excretory organ for

199
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:36,040
getting rid of molecules that the kidney
is not able to eliminate into urine.

200
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,690
And I could go on down the list.

201
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,920
I put it here just to say that when
your kidneys, when your liver fails, uh,

202
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,050
thousands of things start to go wrong.

203
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,500
And you could imagine treating any
one of these with drugs, right? If,

204
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:53,710
uh, if you know the problem is, uh,

205
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,370
is activation of vitamin D,
You could take vitamin D,

206
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,210
You could take pre activated vitamin D.
If it was a thyroid hormone,

207
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:05,770
you could take a thyroid hormone, right?
If it was any one of these things,

208
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,890
there might be a medical solution for it,

209
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,320
but when it's this whole list of things
because your whole Oregon is failing,

210
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,670
you can't support that
function with drugs alone.

211
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,030
It's just too many things
going wrong at once.

212
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,920
So drug therapies are usually used for
treating something where we understand

213
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:34,000
what the molecule is involved is and
where there's only one or two molecules

214
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:37,210
that are involved, you know, so
it's some metabolic disorder.

215
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:42,190
You're not making a particular molecule
that you need and so you take it in the

216
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:47,140
form of a pill or you have
an enzyme that's not working
properly and so you take

217
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,530
injections of that enzyme.
Or in the case of cancer,

218
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,390
there's a single drug which can
eliminate the unwanted cells in cancer,

219
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,460
right? These are areas where
drug therapy works. Gene therapy,

220
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,290
which we talked about a little bit, works
in other kinds of situations, right?

221
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,620
Where you're missing an element of a
cellular process like insisting fibrosis,

222
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,060
for example,

223
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:19,390
your lungs and other tissues are missing
a membrane protein that's important and

224
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:23,600
transport of chloride
across your lung epithelium.

225
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:29,540
Now you can't just take that protein
because it won't get inserted into the

226
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,890
cells in the right way.

227
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,760
We talked about membranes and how
proteins are inserted in membranes and you

228
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:38,960
can't just give the patient that membrane
protein and have it restored to the

229
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:40,550
right location in the cell.

230
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,150
But because it's only one
thing that's going wrong,

231
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,860
you can think about treating this with
gene therapy by giving those cells that

232
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,030
are missing the protein,

233
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:55,060
a gene that allows them to produce that
protein on their own and to correctly

234
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:57,770
inserted into the membrane.

235
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,770
So gene therapy as possible to think
about in diseases like cystic fibrosis and

236
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:06,890
some diseases of the liver and other
organs as well. But in general,

237
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,770
there are diseases that are
caused by a single gene defect.

238
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,750
When we're thinking about liver failing,
lots of things are going wrong.

239
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,970
Many genes involved,
right?

240
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,950
And so gene therapy isn't really thinkable
in that situation where the whole

241
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,570
Oregon is starting to fail.

242
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,940
And so whole organ transplantation
is the only, is the only, um,

243
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,140
current solution, a
surgical solution for, uh,

244
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:37,640
for problems like heart failure,
kidney failure, liver failure,

245
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,090
where the whole Oregon
is starting to fail.

246
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,650
The motivation then for tissue engineering
is to try to think about another way

247
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:53,681
to treat these diseases where you would
somehow manufacture or create a tissue

248
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,320
in the laboratory that could substitute
for the transplanted tissue from another

249
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,210
patient.
All right?

250
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,420
So the idea is to try to make synthetic
or semisynthetic tissues that could take

251
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:17,660
over the function of a failing liver,
a failing kidney failing blood vessel,

252
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,550
a failing heart,
right?

253
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,120
And it is intended to treat these diseases
that are too complex to think about,

254
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,140
complex in the number of
things that are going wrong.

255
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,800
Too Complex to treat with any of the other
therapies we've talked about over the

256
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:36,020
course of the, uh, of our time here.

257
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,790
So this is a field that
was really, um, um,

258
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,360
has ancient roots and those ancient
ruins are discussed in your,

259
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,920
in your book.

260
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,160
But the idea of engineering tissues was
only developed relatively recently and,

261
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,770
uh,
first defined really in the 1980s.

262
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,670
And so that first paper I gave you
to read by Langer in Vacanti, um,

263
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,750
is a really considered one of the first
most influential scientific papers in

264
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:09,390
this, uh, in this growing field.

265
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,840
And here's one definition of
what tissue engineering is.

266
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,500
I told you what the goals of
it are kind of in broad terms,

267
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,250
but it's the application of principles
and methods of engineering and life

268
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:23,760
sciences toward fundamental
understanding of structure, function,

269
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:26,670
relationships in normal and
pathologic mammalian tissues.

270
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,470
That's not the more interesting part to
me. The more interesting part to me is,

271
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,620
and the development of
biological substitutes to
restore main tain or improve

272
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:37,530
tissue function.

273
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,640
So why is it only in the 1980s that
people started thinking about this?

274
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,000
And there's really two reasons and one
is an engineering reason abroad reason.

275
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,280
And the other is a sort of life
science and biology. Reason, uh,

276
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,310
that we had come to the point in the
1980s were a lot of the biology that we've

277
00:18:55,681 --> 00:19:00,681
talked about now was fairly well known
in particular the the biology of cells in

278
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:06,180
culture of taking cells
out of organs and tissues,

279
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:07,620
maintaining them in culture,

280
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,210
getting them to do the things we wanted
to do in culture was fairly well known

281
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:15,060
by the 1980s.
It's a fairly mature technology.

282
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:19,920
And so one could think about using
cell culture techniques to produce

283
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,350
complicated structures. And the
other is an engineering, uh,

284
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,700
in engineering, uh, advance.

285
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,150
And that is that we had developed by the,
uh,

286
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:35,570
by the 1980s enough understanding of
artificial bio materials that we could

287
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:40,920
start to create materials
that had unique properties,

288
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,750
which made them good candidates for use
and the kinds of applications I'll talk

289
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,150
about.
So the innovations or the,

290
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,610
or the kind of foundations
of tissue engineering, our,

291
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:56,611
our ability to culture cells and to do
that reliably reproducibly to understand

292
00:19:57,001 --> 00:20:00,540
what cells are going to do when we
maintain them outside the body and our

293
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:05,100
ability to build materials
that are biocompatible,

294
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,130
that can be implanted into people and
that can serve as scaffolds for a new

295
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:13,290
tissue.
And I'll say more about what that means.

296
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,910
So just to try to put this
in more concrete terms,

297
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:22,911
here's two examples of
how you might artificially
engineer a tissue or two kinds

298
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:27,150
of applications that people might
think about in a heart that's failing.

299
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,550
And I use this as example because we know
a lot about the cardiovascular system

300
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:36,960
now. And so you'll understand both of
these examples we talked about. Uh,

301
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,260
we talked about the important function
of the blood vessels of the heart,

302
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,550
the coronary arteries,

303
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,030
and we also talked a little bit
about how these vessels become,

304
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,930
can become diseased in, uh,
in life, uh, particularly, uh,

305
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,370
for, um, for patients in the sixth
or seventh decade of their life.

306
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,530
And so th this vessel might
become diseased through a
process of atherosclerosis.

307
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,120
The lumen becomes narrowed such
that blood no longer flows,

308
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:07,150
the resistance gets too
high for blood to flow well.

309
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,040
So you'd like to replace this artery and
the only thing that the artery has to

310
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:16,330
do is carry blood from one place to the
other. So really all you need is a tube.

311
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,800
All right.

312
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,610
And so people have tried for years to
use different kinds of tubes to replace

313
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:25,360
this section. The operations
called a cardiac bypass, right?

314
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,520
And so a surgeon will go in, he will
remove this disease section of tissue,

315
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,640
or he'll just put a,
a bypass around it.

316
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,630
That is a tube that goes from this
location and connects to this location.

317
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,180
So like a bypass on the highway,

318
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,080
it's a clear route that allows you to
get around a route that's no longer

319
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:46,540
passable.
Well,

320
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,570
these vessels carry a lot of blood and
they have to be very reliable vessels

321
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,330
because they need to carry blood all the
time because your heart is constantly

322
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,480
working. It needs a constant,
reliable source of blood.

323
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,870
And so the best substitute
for this is a natural one.

324
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,520
And so one of the most
successful operations here is
to take a blood vessel from

325
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:10,150
somewhere else in the patient's
body and use it to create a bypass,

326
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,830
right? And, and you'd
like it to be an artery.

327
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,470
And so bypasses can be made.

328
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:22,280
There's another artery that's nearby
called the internal mammary artery that

329
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:27,010
that surgeons could take. You can take it
from the tissue sort of near the heart.

330
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:30,910
It doesn't really serve as important to
function and you can bypass it in here.

331
00:22:30,911 --> 00:22:35,320
And now you have a new artery in place
to, uh, to continue to flow blood.

332
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,250
That works. But what if you have
more than one site of blockage?

333
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,480
What if you have a blockage here and a
blockage here and a blockage over here

334
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:46,570
and a blockage over here.
So you need multiple bypasses.

335
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,910
You don't have enough
arteries in order to do that.

336
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,650
So then the surgeon will go and take the
saphenous vein from your leg. It's a,

337
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:58,390
it's a large vein in your leg that returns
blood that's flowed down to your leg

338
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,830
back up to the Vena Cava,

339
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,120
and there are enough other veins in your
leg that you can lose that vein without

340
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:05,680
any loss of function in your leg.

341
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,870
They can now take the vein and cut it
up into segments and use that to bypass

342
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:14,320
all these segments of
artery that are clogged.

343
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,270
And that works as well. But veins aren't
the same as arteries. You remember that?

344
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,100
And if you take a vein which
has a different anatomical
structure and put it in

345
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:28,480
the position of an artery that is exposed
to the high pressures that you know

346
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:31,480
already occur there,
sometimes that works,

347
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,510
sometimes the vessel changes and remodels
and adapts so that it functions and

348
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,630
sometimes it doesn't.

349
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,230
And sometimes those veins also become
diseased and they no longer serve as an

350
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:48,880
effective bypass, right? So
then what do you do? Right?

351
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,540
If both of those options fail,

352
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,770
you can try to use synthetic materials
and synthetic materials are used to

353
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:58,540
replace blood vessels in in many
parts of the body. If you're,

354
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,340
if you have an aorta that has an aneurysm,

355
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,680
a surgeon can put a synthetic piece of
basically dacron a synthetic material and

356
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:13,220
it will serve as a functional
aorta and do a very nice job.

357
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,080
But it turns out that we know from
experience now that that only works if the

358
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,710
vessel is big enough
because for big vessels,

359
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,470
all of these kinds of synthetic
materials that we make,

360
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,980
while they might have the right mechanical
properties to serve as an aorta,

361
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,510
they're not biological.

362
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:35,290
And so blood will clot when it
hits that unnatural surface.

363
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,150
And it's okay if blood clots on the
surface of a big artery because it's big

364
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:46,151
enough that you could have a lining
of a clot here along the inside,

365
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,713
right.

366
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,790
And it would still be enough diameter
to flow if it's a small artery and it

367
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,610
clots blood doesn't
pass through any longer.

368
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,810
And we know now that the limit of what
one can do with synthetic materials is

369
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:02,780
about half a millimeter to a millimeter.

370
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,480
And that's the size of
these coronary arteries.

371
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,490
So you can't use
synthetic materials there.

372
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,230
So what we'd like to do is grow
and artery outside the body.

373
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:14,590
Okay?

374
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,590
What if we could do that by taking the
synthetic material and growing on it?

375
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,910
Aligning of natural cells.

376
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:23,820
Okay.

377
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,230
The synthetic material would provide
the mechanical properties needed,

378
00:25:28,231 --> 00:25:33,231
so for it to function as an artery and
if we grow natural arterial endothelial

379
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:36,210
cells all over the surface of this,

380
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,910
the blood wouldn't know that
it's a synthetic material.

381
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,480
It would only see the cells which
are forming the natural barrier,

382
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,040
the natural wall of a blood vessel.

383
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,810
So that's tissue engineering and example
of tissue engineering to create an

384
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:54,300
artificial artery to use in bypass.

385
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:57,690
And I'm going to talk more
about the details of where
we are in that process and

386
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:01,170
what the obstacles are. Next, on Thursday,

387
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,940
let's say you didn't get there
in time in a particular patient,

388
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:09,180
they didn't have a bypass in time.
So they have a blockage,

389
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,300
they have a myocardial infarction or a
heart attack because the blood becomes

390
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:15,990
compromised to some area.

391
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:20,160
This area of the heart doesn't
get blood for some period of time.

392
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:24,090
And so this tissue in the
wall of the heart dies.

393
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,400
Now in general, uh, if that happens, uh,

394
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,930
there's only a limited ability of your
heart tissue to heal after you have a

395
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:34,764
heart attack.

396
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,030
A scar is formed here and this part of
the heart doesn't function in the same

397
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,390
way that it did before.
Remember how it functions is it has to,

398
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,660
it has to transmit electrical signals
and it has to contract in response to

399
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:51,720
those electrical signals. And it has
to do that with a regular frequency.

400
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:56,340
So it has to both conduct the electrical
signal and contract. And this, uh,

401
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,600
this, uh, damaged cardiac muscle
doesn't do that anymore. Well,

402
00:27:00,601 --> 00:27:02,040
sometimes that's okay.

403
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,850
You might not need all of your cardiac
muscle to be functioning in order to have

404
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:07,590
a reasonably efficient heartbeat.

405
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:12,510
But sometimes the area of this is so
large that it compromises the ability of

406
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:16,560
your heart to deliver the cardiac
output. You need to stay alive. Right.

407
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,780
Uh, so what if you could make
an artificial cardiac muscle,

408
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,071
right?

409
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:28,071
What if you could take some kind of a
material and grow cardiac muscle cells on

410
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:34,170
it and grow them in such a way
that they filled up this material

411
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,290
and they started to function like heart.
That is they,

412
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,650
they functioned in the right electrical
way and they functioned in the right

413
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:44,550
mechanical way.

414
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Then maybe a physician could come in and
just so this patch that you've created

415
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:53,130
outside the body into place on the tissue

416
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,880
and maybe that patch would start to
function like that part of the heart wall.

417
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,450
That didn't function.

418
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,500
Okay.

419
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,000
Okay. Now where would the cells
come from that you did that with?

420
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,870
We think about this particular
application. We're going to create a,

421
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,490
we're going to create a patch for
repairing a myocardial defects.

422
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,600
Right. Where would the cells come
from? What would be your first choice?

423
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,030
Okay.

424
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,500
Of cells that you wanted,
that you use for this

425
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,633
jasmine

426
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,900
from the heart.
From what heart?

427
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,520
Yeah,

428
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,810
from the patient's own heart.

429
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:41,550
What if you could take a small biopsy of
tissue from somewhere else in the heart?

430
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,790
You could take a small sample of those
cells and you could take them outside the

431
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,050
and grow them in culture.
Well,

432
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:53,340
this is where our ability to culture
cells comes in very handy because we can

433
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:56,280
take a small sample,
isolate the cells we want,

434
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,490
propagate them in culture until
we had millions of those cells,

435
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,840
put them into the patch, put the
patch back into the patient. Now,

436
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:09,110
now the patient has an auto graft of cells
but placed in the right configuration

437
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:14,460
so that they function as a tissue.
What are the problems with that?

438
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,860
What's the problem with that?

439
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,963
Okay,

440
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,270
so if the, if the disease was
too big, you couldn't do that.

441
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:28,210
Why couldn't you do that? Because you
couldn't grow and upsells you think or

442
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,530
yeah mate. So you might, there might be
some practical limits to it, but you're,

443
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:41,050
you're getting close to what the
real problem with that would be.

444
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,990
You're getting close to what the
real problem with that would be.

445
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:47,250
Think about the timing of it.

446
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,680
How long would it take you to take this
biopsy and grow the cells and make a new

447
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,640
Ar? Artificial? Probably
would take weeks to do.

448
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,770
And could the patient survive those
weeks while you're making the, uh,

449
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:06,300
the, uh, the, the, the tissue
engineered solution? Maybe,

450
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:10,320
maybe not. It would depend on
how extensive the, the, the, um,

451
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,060
the failure of the heart was
as, as, as Justin described.

452
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,350
Right? So what would be
another solution to that? Well,

453
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:24,120
let's not take cells from the patient,
but let's create a bank of heart cells.

454
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,000
Right?
And that might be possible,

455
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:28,980
but you have to be able
to preserve heart cells.

456
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:33,600
You have to have a bank of cells with
all the right immunological markers

457
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,260
labeled.

458
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,440
You have to have them in enough quantity
that they'd be available rapidly.

459
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,460
And so there's problems with that, right?
But maybe you could do it that way.

460
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,670
Maybe you could use stem cells

461
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,270
and we talked about stem cells before
and some of their capabilities.

462
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,450
But one of the real advantages of what
people think of as using stem cells to

463
00:30:56,301 --> 00:31:00,530
treat diseases in adults is just
exactly what we're talking about here.

464
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,780
Being able to create an environment or
an engineering solution in which stem

465
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,950
cells could be used to
create functional tissue,

466
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,690
right?
In this case,

467
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:16,340
you'd want stem cells that could very
quickly become cardiac muscle cells that

468
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,040
could be differentiated in
the cardiac muscle cells,

469
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,540
and ideally you'd want stem cells
from the same person, right?

470
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:26,060
You'd like to isolate them
from the same person somehow.

471
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,480
Okay.

472
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,910
Or from a or from a
donor that was matched,

473
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,660
but you're starting to see both
the opportunity, I hope and the,

474
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,860
and the problems that have to be solved
and creating these new solutions.

475
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,860
I list on this slide a few
of the characteristics of
a tissue engineering that

476
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:47,550
we're going to talk about. Uh,
not in quite this organized a way,

477
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,410
but I hope that by the end of the week,

478
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:51,390
you'll be able to look back
at this list and say, Oh,

479
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:55,020
I understand what that characteristic
means in terms of what we're trying to

480
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:56,580
accomplish in tissue engineering.

481
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,720
The first is what I've been
talking up about up to this point,

482
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:05,520
the tissue engineering really represents
kind of a modern or contemporary

483
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,680
logical extension of conventional
medical. And surgical practices, right?

484
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:13,470
If we're going to make an
engineered tissue, in many cases,

485
00:32:13,471 --> 00:32:16,710
we're going to give them to a surgeon and
they're going to do what they know how

486
00:32:16,711 --> 00:32:19,680
to do, which is replace an
organ or a tissue, right?

487
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:24,681
So you're just giving another resource
to surgeons to do what they know how to

488
00:32:24,781 --> 00:32:25,614
do already.

489
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,210
And we're using it to extend medical
practices to diseases that cannot be

490
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:33,600
treated by drugs or gene therapy
or other kinds of medicine.

491
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,830
What I want to talk about,
uh,

492
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,230
for most of the rest of the time today
is this second bullet here that tissue

493
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:43,280
engineering and vaults control
or regulation of normal
healing processes that if

494
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:46,430
we want to understand and
use tissue engineering,

495
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,960
we need to know something about how the
body heals itself and take advantage of

496
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:54,590
those natural mechanisms
of tissue regeneration.

497
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,510
And we'll talk over the course of the
next two lectures about tissue engineering

498
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:00,170
as a,

499
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:04,730
as an attempt to replace the
sailor component of disease
tissues where it's drug

500
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:05,121
therapy.

501
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:09,560
We're thinking about the molecular
component and now we're replacing cells,

502
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,810
um, that it uses cellular processes
sometimes to control drug delivery.

503
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:19,340
We'll talk about how you could use tissue
engineering as a drug delivery system

504
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,960
and that a tissue engineering produces
new models for the study of human

505
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,180
physiology. I won't say anything
more about that this week.

506
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:30,380
So let me just say that now that what
if you could produce heart tissue like

507
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:31,820
this for transplantation?

508
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:37,160
Another use for it would be if I can
make this tissue outside the body that

509
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:38,660
behaves like the human heart,

510
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:44,170
I can use it to study how the human heart
works outside the body in a much more

511
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:49,100
reliable way or a much more sophisticated
way than I could with ordinary cell

512
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:53,210
cultures. Because now you not
only have the cells of the heart,

513
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:56,660
but you have the cells of
the heart arranged in the
right kind of configuration.

514
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,250
So I could understand, I could use it
to understand how the heart develops.

515
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,030
I could,

516
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,360
I could expose it to different drugs
and ask what are the toxicities of these

517
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:09,560
drugs to the normal heart without
doing it in patients, without,

518
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:14,270
and with doing it in a system where I
have a lot of control and a lot of ability

519
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,100
to look inside and see what's
happening. All right. Um,

520
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,050
so let me go back to this point.
Now.

521
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,950
Tissue engineering involves control or
regulation of the normal healing process

522
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,120
and we're all familiar with at least some
aspects of healing because you've all

523
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:31,570
had a cut in the skin,
uh,

524
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,700
that has maybe caused you some distress
in the short term. Maybe it was a,

525
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,070
a cut that was deep enough and this
shows you the structure of the skin.

526
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,070
Here's the outer layer
of the skin here that um,

527
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,070
that forms this sort
of thick barrier layer,

528
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:51,071
the epidermis that things can't
penetrate water can't penetrate easily.

529
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,130
You put water on top of your skin.
It, it beads up there, right?

530
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,730
It doesn't get absorbed. Likewise,
water inside doesn't come out.

531
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,140
That's why you don't get dehydrated and
micro organisms can't go through, right?

532
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:05,450
Because of this barrier underneath is a,

533
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:09,770
is a more connective tissue layer called
the dermis. And inside this Dermis,

534
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:14,270
there's cells that are producing an
extra cellular matrix of Collagen.

535
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:19,070
Largely. We talked about extracellular
matrices several weeks ago.

536
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,960
And within that, and within
that a collagenous matrix,
there are blood vessels,

537
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,380
arteries, red here, veins blue,

538
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,480
and those blood vessels bring
blood to the skin to provide,

539
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,280
uh, um, oxygen and to get rid of
carbon dioxide in these cells,

540
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,970
in your living skin.
So you get a cut in this tissue.

541
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:46,410
And what happens if it's a
deep enough cut? You Bleed and,

542
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,580
uh, you gotta do something
to stop the bleeding, right?
You've had this and so you,

543
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,880
you put some pressure on and you wait
for clotting to occur, but you've,

544
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,140
but you've disrupted these vessels,
right?

545
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:59,730
You'd disrupted these vessels.

546
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:04,140
They have clotted so that the clot is
formed inside these vessels so that the

547
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:08,550
bleeding stops and usually a clot forms
at the surface. And if you look at this,

548
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:12,190
after you've got the bleeding to
stop, you have a red looking, uh,

549
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,080
you have a red looking area, right?
It looks different from your skin.

550
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,320
That's the beginning of the healing
process is that your body has coagulated

551
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:26,130
blood at that site to replace
the tissue that's been lost,

552
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,370
right? So you'll have a red, uh,

553
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:33,690
you'll have a red spot there that turns
into a reddish looking scab, right?

554
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,250
That's your body responding
to stop the immediate insult,

555
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,540
the bleeding and to fill up the space
of this tissue that's been damaged.

556
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:46,680
Cuts too big.
This can't happen.

557
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:49,530
You can't just put pressure on it
and stop it. And so what do you do?

558
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,810
You go to the emergency room,
you get some stitches,

559
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,010
they bring the sides of that
wound back together with stitches.

560
00:36:56,011 --> 00:37:00,000
They hold it closed and the
same thing happens, but in
a smaller space now, right?

561
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,110
Cause they've just brought the tissue
together so that your body could produce

562
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:04,944
this,
uh,

563
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:10,070
this provisional tissue
and the provisional tissue
at the beginning is just a

564
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:14,130
blood clot.
After that point,

565
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,680
many things start happening
within the skin. Uh, and uh,

566
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:22,681
a complex process of cells sending out
signals and cells responding to signals

567
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,670
in a coordinated unregulated way occurs.

568
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,880
And what this diagram shows is some little
fingers of tissue entering into this

569
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,810
coagulated provisional matrix
that was formed by the blood clot.

570
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,880
And these cells are initially
cells that are called fibroblasts,

571
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,170
which live in the dermis.
And normally they're just sitting there,

572
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,880
sort of an acquirer,
essence state,

573
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,150
not reproducing very rapidly
making college in providing
matrix to keep up sort

574
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:56,550
of the normal structure of your skin.
But when there's an injury,

575
00:37:56,551 --> 00:38:00,510
they get turned on and they
migrate into the wound.

576
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,650
They migrate into this provisional
matrix and they start changing it.

577
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,630
They start digesting the clot
and they start making new,

578
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,970
extra cellular matrix of Collagen.

579
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,100
And they do that so that there can be
a pathway for these blood vessels to

580
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:22,101
regrow the blood vessels need to regrow
renourish the skin so that you can start

581
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:26,610
to get the normal composition back,
the normal cellular components.

582
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,040
And you'll see these blood vessels,
uh,

583
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:34,100
starting to form sprouts that enter into
this provisional matrix all now you've

584
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:40,660
watched the process of a scar
healing on your own, um, body,

585
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:44,290
and you've seen the stages that it
goes through. It will, it will, uh,

586
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,000
go from the red appearance to a,

587
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,800
to a dollar red and eventually
become a white, you know, or, uh,

588
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,180
it doesn't look red at all.

589
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:57,390
And after some period of time you won't
even see where the cut was it all right.

590
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,820
The end process of this
fiber blasts coming in,

591
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:05,821
replacing remodeling the matrix of blood
vessels regrowing back in establishing

592
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:10,940
new cells from the epidermis start to
grow in over this matrix in the end first

593
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:12,010
they'll grow over the top.

594
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:17,010
And so you might see a little bump here
and eventually the whole tissue through

595
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:20,350
this elegant self regulated
process heals itself.

596
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,930
So you can't see where the cut was.

597
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,500
We've all had that experience and probably
we've also had the experience where

598
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:29,920
we got a worst cut, right? And,

599
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,640
and it didn't end up looking right,
right.

600
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,490
You might still have a scar from
some cut that you got on, uh,

601
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,400
on your hand or your arm where
the, where it was too severe. Now,

602
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:40,750
what happened there?

603
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,530
The same process of remodeling happened,

604
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,940
but it happened in a more aggressive or
more vigorous way because the signals

605
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:52,960
that control this, we're
large. It was a large wound,

606
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:57,910
big problem. Lots of sales got
activated, they made a lot of Collagen.

607
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,490
They may, they remodeled this, this
provisional matrix very aggressively. Why?

608
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,640
So that you could heal and so that you
wouldn't have a wound here that was open

609
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,860
to infections or loss of
blood or loss of water.

610
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,380
Your body knows how to respond to very
severe injuries are more severe than we

611
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:21,040
usually encounter in our lives and the
result is you'll get a scar from that

612
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,410
because the response was too aggressive.
Right?

613
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,780
Our ancestors who lived much
more dangerous lives than we did,

614
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,280
who might get attacked by a lion or a
bear needed to have a very aggressive

615
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:36,580
healing response so they didn't
die if they got attacked.

616
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,980
Under some circumstances,

617
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,970
we don't get attacked by lions or
bears so often anymore and so we don't

618
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:47,710
necessarily need that
aggressive a healing response.

619
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:52,390
We might like a gentler healing response
that leads to a better functional,

620
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,660
okay, that doesn't have
a scar, for example.

621
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,310
So how can you control
healing in that case? Well,

622
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,390
uh,

623
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:06,390
one of the ideas of tissue engineering
is to provide materials that would guide

624
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:09,910
or regulate or change that
natural response of healing.

625
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,470
So you have a wound and the wound is
going to heal on its own in some way,

626
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,620
but you would like it to heal in a way
that you control so that the outcome is

627
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,500
more to your liking. Now maybe the
outcome is that it heals much faster.

628
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,620
Maybe the outcome is that
it heals without a scar.

629
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,540
Maybe the outcome is that it heals
and new kinds of cells are, are, are,

630
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:36,570
are woven into the tissue in place
of the ones that were there formerly.

631
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,793
All right,

632
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:43,420
so maybe this wound was created by a
surgeon who removed the cancer here and

633
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:48,980
you're trying to replace the cancer
cells with normal cells. All right,

634
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,070
so what are the options in terms
of doing this? Well, what is it?

635
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:55,010
You could put the material in here and uh,

636
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,040
and the material goes into the wound
and that material has some function and

637
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:03,530
maybe that it serves as a
better provisional matrix,

638
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,560
then the clot would have and better means
what maybe it regulates how cells grow

639
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:14,990
in or how cells attach or how cells
synthesize Collagen after they enter.

640
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,280
So maybe you could design a material that
changes the healing response locally.

641
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,750
That's, that's one of the, that's one
way that you might engineer a tissue.

642
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,630
Now here,
I haven't put any cell cultures in.

643
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,960
I've just put in a fancy material
that I designed. All right,

644
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,620
we'll talk about what those
might be a little bit later.

645
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,970
Or maybe you don't need a material at all,

646
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,400
but maybe you could
replace this with cells.

647
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,240
So maybe I could just take cells may be
recovered or harvested from some other

648
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:50,600
place in the patient.

649
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,620
Maybe these are skin cells that I got
from a normal location and I put them back

650
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:59,540
into a wound in order to speed up the
process of healing at that site. Right?

651
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,310
Maybe their stem cells that came from
somewhere, but maybe they're just cells.

652
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:10,330
But oftentimes the best combination
seems to be to put cells in together with

653
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:11,660
some material.

654
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,060
And here the material might function
in a couple of different ways.

655
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,140
It might function in this way we talked
about here by giving signals to the

656
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:25,940
normal tissue to regulate the healing
response that's going to occur anyhow.

657
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,230
And that,

658
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:32,230
and that material might contain cells
that you have derived somehow that you

659
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,610
want to hold in that site.

660
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,710
You want to hold locally and provide an
environment where they can grow and take

661
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:42,200
over the function of the tissue,
right?

662
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:47,990
So these are some sort of schematic ways
to think about how one might use tissue

663
00:43:47,991 --> 00:43:52,130
engineering to control the normal
healing process. And I've shown this,

664
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:54,800
I've given you examples of this, that, uh,

665
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,410
where I motivated it with
thinking about the skin,

666
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,640
but this doesn't have to be the skin,
right? This could be a your liver.

667
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:08,240
Maybe I put the material into your
liver, uh, that allows it to regenerate.

668
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,550
Maybe I'd put liver cells derived from
some other source back into the liver.

669
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,950
And they take over the
function of the liver.

670
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:20,420
Maybe I put materials on cells and
create a new liver tissue, right?

671
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:24,110
So you could extend this idea
to almost any tissue or organ.

672
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:29,630
Here's an example of that.
And, and um, where, uh,

673
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:34,280
just a material is used to, uh,
to guide the healing process. And,

674
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:39,320
and I think this is conceptually a very
simple idea and one that that works to

675
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:40,944
some extent.

676
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,070
So this is a nerve and so proximal
means closer to the brain.

677
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,760
So maybe this is a nerve in your leg and
it's got severed by some kind of injury

678
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:54,090
or it got crushed and somehow the
nerve is damaged in this region here.

679
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,290
So this nerve is sending sensory
signals from the distal part,

680
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,210
backup the nerve into the brain.

681
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,500
It's sending motor signals down from
the brain to the more distal regions.

682
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:09,690
If this tissue, if this nerve
gets damaged by trauma somehow,

683
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,650
um, then you're not going to get
sensory signals sent through it.

684
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:15,750
You're not going to get motor signals.
So you can't feel,

685
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,130
you can't move in all of the tissue
that's distiller downstream of that.

686
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,900
Um, of that site. So how do you,
how would you repair that? Well,

687
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:29,901
it turns out that surgeons know that if
it's a small region and they go back in

688
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:33,570
and they take the damaged ends of the
nerves and they put them back together,

689
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,000
you will recover much of the function
of that nerve. Maybe not 100%,

690
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,220
but if they do it quickly
and they do it well,

691
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:46,430
that these cells will regrow
the connections that are
lost in this section of

692
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:51,240
trauma and you will over a period of time
begin to feel in that tissue again and

693
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:55,470
you'll be able to, to move, right. If the,

694
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,680
if the damage is too big,

695
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,500
you can't physically bring
them back together. Right?

696
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,360
Your leg is a fixed length and if
at the DC area damage is too big,

697
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:08,100
you can't bring these
tissues back together.

698
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,880
They found that you can use an autograft
that is take a nerve from somewhere

699
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:12,540
else.

700
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:16,590
If I cut the nerve out of another spot
and then put it in this region in between

701
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,560
the two ends,
the nerves will regrow again.

702
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,370
Problem with that is you don't have a
lot of nerves that you're not using.

703
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:25,950
And so in order to repair this nerve,

704
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:27,900
you had to sacrifice a
nerve somewhere else.

705
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,200
So maybe you could do that
same thing with the material.

706
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,920
So what would the material look like?
The material might look like this,

707
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:39,921
and this is just a cylindrical
cuff and it's a complete cylinder.

708
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,990
It's shown as a cutout here
just so that you can see inside,

709
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,170
but it's a complete cylinder that's hollow
and you put one end of the nerve into

710
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,280
one end and one of the
nerve and the other,

711
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,350
and now you've placed these
nerves not in physical contact,

712
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:58,770
but you've created a compartment
through which they can communicate.

713
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,320
So you don't have this end of
the nerve dangling out in space.

714
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,560
And this end of the nerve dangling
out in space. And remember,

715
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,520
it's not going to be a nice picture like
this where the nerve is existing on its

716
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:12,090
own,

717
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,480
but there's muscles and blood vessels
and other kinds of things around in this

718
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,010
area.
Right?

719
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,910
And by putting a channel
with the nerve in both ends,

720
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,220
you've isolated the area of the nerve.

721
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:25,830
You want to regenerate from
all the rest of the tissue.

722
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,390
Does that make sense? And you hope that
you get some regrowth through here.

723
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:34,720
And what, uh, what scientists have
found that is it, that you do this,

724
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:39,610
you will get some regrowth. You don't
get complete regrowth of a thick nerve,

725
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,800
but you get a thin nerve with less fibers,
less nerve tissue,

726
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,540
less function, but you get
some recovery. So it works.

727
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,180
And we've known for about 20
years or so that it works,

728
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,490
but it doesn't work well enough. So
how could I make it better? Well,

729
00:47:57,491 --> 00:48:00,580
one way you could make it better
is by changing the material.

730
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,530
Maybe the properties of
the material weren't right.

731
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,920
Maybe the cuff on the outside
is to impermeable and you'd
like to have molecules

732
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:13,060
exchanging in some way, right? Maybe
it's not permeable enough, right?

733
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:14,650
And so you need to regulate it that way.

734
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,120
But maybe you don't want a nerve cuff
that's filled with just air or just water.

735
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,370
But maybe you'd like,
uh,

736
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:25,470
maybe you'd like a nerve conduit that's
filled with a material that promotes the

737
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,900
growth and reconnection of these fibers.

738
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:34,590
Maybe you'd like some kind of a gel
in there that nerves could regenerate

739
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:35,524
through.

740
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,730
And so the obvious place to go for that
is to use the kinds of materials that

741
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:44,731
the body uses for repairing
tissues and fill up this channel,

742
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:50,340
not just with water or sailing
or some kind of a solution,

743
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:54,460
but fill it up with an extra cellular
matrix like the kind of extra cellular

744
00:48:54,461 --> 00:48:56,380
matrix we talked about weeks ago,

745
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,500
that all of your tissues have the
supporting Gel likes structure formed from

746
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:07,300
proteins and carbohydrates that are
secreted by cells and through which cells

747
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:09,610
normally grow and live.

748
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,790
And so taking natural proteins like
collagen forming gels out of them and

749
00:49:14,861 --> 00:49:19,660
putting these gels inside the material
increases the number of fibers that crow

750
00:49:19,661 --> 00:49:21,250
across a gap like that.

751
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,700
So this is just an example
of a simple example.

752
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:29,790
No sales involved here of a material
that's designed in order to enhance the

753
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:35,071
healing of a wound and how one might
engineer properties of that material.

754
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,000
To make it better at supporting
the healing function.

755
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,040
So that's what I wanted to say about
tissue engineering, tissue engineering,

756
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:48,740
and vaults control, or regulation
of the normal healing process.

757
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,120
But I want you to keep that
in mind as we go through. Uh,

758
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:56,930
the examples that we'll talk about
in, uh, Thursdays, uh, lecture.

759
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,320
I'm going to stop there, uh, questions.

760
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,560
See you on Thursday.
