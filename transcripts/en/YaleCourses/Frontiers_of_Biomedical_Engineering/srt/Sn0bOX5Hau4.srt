1
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,060
This is, this is a course, a,

2
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,720
a version of which I've taught almost
every year for the last 20 years.

3
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,270
And it evolves a little bit every a year.

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,380
I think I get a little bit better at it.
Uh,

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,090
so hopefully you'll get some
advantage from that experience.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,020
But the idea is to try to present
to you sort of what's exciting about

7
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:32,190
biomedical engineering,

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,340
the ways that one can take science and
mathematics and apply that to improve

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,930
human health. And so, I'm not working
alone here, but we have three, uh,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,050
teaching fellows who are affiliated with
the course, two of which are here today.

11
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:48,960
Yen, a [inaudible] is back there. Young,

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,900
raise your hand higher so
everyone can see yen. Uh,

13
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,370
worked on the course last year.

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,140
And so she's the senior of the teaching
fellows that are working on the course

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,240
this year. Surge Kobes is in
the back. Um, and he'll be, uh,

16
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,830
the second teaching fellow,

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,330
I should mention that yen is a phd student
in biomedical engineering. And, uh,

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,010
surge is an MD phd student who's getting
his phd in biomedical engineering.

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,060
The third, a teaching fellow, uh, couldn't
make it today. His name is Michael. Look,

20
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:22,560
and I'll introduce him to you, uh,
when he, uh, when he's available.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,500
So this is the, the,
the goal, uh, for, uh,

22
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,800
my first lecture today to try to
answer these questions. And, uh,

23
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,040
you might have already noticed that,
uh,

24
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:39,960
I'm using the classes Vitu server.
Uh, so the syllabus is there.

25
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,790
I'm going to go over the
syllabus a little bit later,

26
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,500
but the syllabus is available online.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,680
The first reading is available online
and I'll talk more about the readings at

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,150
when I get to that.
A portion of the lecture here,

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,170
and I'm going to post powerpoints
for all the lectures, hopefully, uh,

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,790
at least the day before. Uh, the lecture
takes place. So I posted this last night.

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,450
Some students find that they,
um,

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,180
benefit from printing out the powerpoints
and then they can just take their

33
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:11,100
notes along with the slides as I go. And
that's one way to do it. But, uh, but, uh,

34
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,850
feel free to do it, uh, whatever way works
for you. But those should be available.

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,210
So the questions I want to try to
answer it today are what is biomedical

36
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:19,044
engineering?

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,430
So why would you be interested in
spending a semester learning about this

38
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,460
subject? I'll talk about who will
benefit from the course and uh,

39
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:32,310
a little bit about, uh,
sort of the detail, uh, uh,

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,880
subject matter that we'll cover
in the course of this semester.

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,700
So to answer the question,
what is biomedical engineering?

42
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:46,701
We're going to spend time on that today
and we'll spend time on a Thursday and I

43
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:49,380
want to approach it from a
couple of different angles.

44
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,320
One is by just showing you
a series of pictures, uh,

45
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,510
which you might recognize and talk about
why this is an example of biomedical

46
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,730
engineering.
And so this is one that probably you all,

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,070
you all know what it is when you see it.
It's a familiar looking image.

48
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,820
It's something that probably we all have
some personal experience with, right?

49
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,260
This is a chest x Ray, uh, that would
be taken in your doctor's office,

50
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,730
for example, or a or a radiologist's
office. And it is a, a,

51
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,900
a good example of biomedical engineering.
And that it takes a physical principle.

52
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,560
That is how do x rays interact
with the tissues of your body.

53
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,720
And it uses that physics,

54
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:33,040
that physical principle to develop a
picture of what's inside your body.

55
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,020
So to look inside and see things that you
couldn't see without this, uh, device.

56
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,140
And, uh, you'll recognize some
of the parts of the image.

57
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:46,000
You can see the rib cage here, the bones.
You can see the heart is this large,

58
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,530
uh, bright object down here. If
you're, um, if you're, um, uh,

59
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,930
have good eyesight from the
distance that you're at,

60
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:57,040
you can see the vessels leading out of
the, out of the heart and into the lungs.

61
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:01,630
And the lungs are these darker
spaces within the rib cage.

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,350
And physicians over the years of having
this instrument have learned how to be

63
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:10,330
very sophisticated about looking at these
pictures and diagnosing when something

64
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:13,120
is wrong inside the chest of,
for example.

65
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,850
So this is an example of
biomedical engineering,

66
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:18,820
one that is well integrated
into our society.

67
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,030
To the point that we've probably all
got a picture like this somewhere, uh,

68
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,140
in our past and where we understand the
physical principles that allow us to,

69
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,403
to use it.

70
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,240
We've gotten over the last
two decades in particular,

71
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,390
very sophisticated about taking
pictures inside the body,

72
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,870
allowing doctors to look inside the body
and predict things about our internal

73
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:44,470
physiology,
uh,

74
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:48,370
that they couldn't predict just by looking
at us or putting their hands on us.

75
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,290
And this image on the top here
is another example of a, uh,

76
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,650
of an imaging technique.

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,800
This is a positron emission tomograph
or pet image and is taken by using

78
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,260
radionuclides and injecting them into you.

79
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,730
So radioactive chemicals that interact
with tissues in your body in a specific

80
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:09,790
way. And you can see where
those radioactive chemicals go.

81
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,110
And it allows us to look not just at the
anatomy of what's going on inside your

82
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,340
body like an x ray does,
but to look at the chemistry,

83
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,430
the biochemistry of what's
happening inside a particular
organ or tissue in your

84
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:26,650
body. In this case, these
are pictures of the brain.

85
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,010
And this has been an exceptionally
important technique in understanding how

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,440
molecules like neurotransmitters affect
disease and how they change in certain

87
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,960
disease states in people.
And we'll,

88
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,740
we'll talk about this as another
example of biomedical engineering.

89
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,150
This advanced methods for
imaging inside the body. Well,

90
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:52,990
this third picture you can't
probably see too much about,

91
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,620
but you probably recognize what it is,
right? What, where was this picture taken?

92
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,360
What kind of a space was it taken in?
Um,

93
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,820
somebody said, oh, are are operating room.
And that's right. This is a picture in,

94
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:10,080
in an operating room and operating rooms.

95
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:12,360
If you went into any operating
room around the country,

96
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:17,380
you would see lots of examples of
instruments that are used to help, uh,

97
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:20,970
surgeons, uh, anesthesiologists, uh,

98
00:06:20,971 --> 00:06:24,360
to keep the patient alive and healthy
during the course of a surgery.

99
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,040
And this particular one, uh, down here,
this portion here is a heart lung machine.

100
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,200
And this is a machine that can take over
the function of a patient's heart and

101
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:38,790
lungs during the period
when they're undergoing open
heart surgery. For example,

102
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,770
if they're having a coronary artery bypass
or they're having a heart transplant,

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,840
then there's some period at which their
normal heart, their heart is stopped.

104
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,640
And this machine assumes the functions
of their heart. And this is an,

105
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,100
I think an obvious example
of biomedical engineering,

106
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:59,790
building a machine that can replace
the function of one of your organs even

107
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,910
temporarily. For example,
uh, during an operation,

108
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,880
this is another familiar picture.

109
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:11,020
It I purposely picked one that looks sort
of old fashioned compared to the usual

110
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,120
way you see this,
which might be on the nightly news.

111
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:16,090
You see a bleep going across the screen
to indicate that they've got their

112
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:20,780
finger on the pulse of what's happening.
Or you see it at TV shows like er, uh,

113
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,590
you see these images on
computer screens all the time.

114
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,270
It's an example of an EKG or
ECG and electrocardiograph.

115
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,560
It's a machine that also looks inside
your body but looks inside in a,

116
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:36,930
in a different kind of way rather than
by forming an image or a picture. Uh,

117
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,080
you put electrodes on the surface of
the body and measure the electrical

118
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:44,770
potential as a function
of position on the body.

119
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,520
And it turns out that the electrical
potential or electricity that you can

120
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:53,050
measure on the surface of the body
reflects things that are happening deeper

121
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:55,600
inside,
like the beating of your heart.

122
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,590
And if you put the electrodes in the right
position and you measure in the right

123
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:00,190
way,

124
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,190
you can detect the electrical activity
of the heart and record it on a strip

125
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:09,460
recorder like this one shown here
or display it on a computer. Uh,

126
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,770
and so this is another example of,

127
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,830
of biomedical engineering where you can
look at the function of a heart in a

128
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:22,381
living person and a physician
who's experienced it looking
at fees and a machine

129
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:25,870
that works well with those two things,

130
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:30,871
you can diagnose a lot of things that
are happening inside a heart and we'll

131
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,340
talk about that about
halfway through the course.

132
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,290
Okay.

133
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,140
This picture might be
less, uh, familiar to you,

134
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:42,340
but you probably all know that we have
developed over the last hundred years or

135
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:42,520
so,

136
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,520
the ability to take cells out of a
person or sells out of an animal and keep

137
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:52,090
those isolated cells alive in
culture for extended periods of time.

138
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,150
So this technology is called
cell culture technology.

139
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,410
We're going to spend quite a bit of time
talking about it during the third week

140
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:02,820
of the course and uh,
by taking cells from the skin,

141
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:03,690
for example,

142
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:07,860
or sales from your blood or cells from
the bone marrow and keeping them alive

143
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,491
and culture.

144
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:12,960
We've been able to study how human
cells work and learn a lot about the

145
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,240
functioning of human organism.

146
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,770
We've also learned how to
not only keep cells alive,

147
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:23,220
but in certain cases make them
replicate outside the body.

148
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:28,020
So maybe you could take a few skin cells
and keep them in culture in the right

149
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:32,460
way and replicate them so that you get
many millions of stem cells after a piece

150
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,450
of skin cells after several weeks or so.
Now,

151
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,480
one of the new technologies that's
evolving that we're going to talk about,

152
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,020
uh,

153
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,880
in the last half of the course is taking
cells that have been propagated in this

154
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,881
way outside the body and encouraging
them to form new tissues.

155
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,690
And this is one example of that.
This is actually artificial skin.

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,370
It's in this petri dish. Here is a
thin membrane. It's a polymer scaffold.

157
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,470
And on that polymer scaffold,

158
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,480
scientists have placed some skin
cells and they've allowed it to grow.

159
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,280
And if you maintain it in the right way,

160
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:15,330
this polymer scaffold together with
the skin cells will grow into skin.

161
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,080
And you can use this tissue engineered
skin to treat a patient who's had severe

162
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:26,760
burns, for example, or a diabetic
who's developed ulcers that won't heal.

163
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,510
And so this is an example of a
technology that's just emerging now.

164
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:34,230
It's certainly going to
impact you in your lifetime.

165
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,830
And we'll talk about how it works
and what the, uh, what the, uh,

166
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,310
what the current state of
the art is there. This, uh,

167
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,370
device held here is, uh, really, uh,

168
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,550
made of mainly plastic
and a little bit of metal.

169
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,670
It's a fully implantable artificial heart.

170
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:59,150
And it was introduced about a
seven or eight years ago now.

171
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,940
It was implanted into the first patient,
uh,

172
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,970
a gentleman in Kentucky and he
stayed alive for a period of time,

173
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,411
uh,

174
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:12,411
with this device replacing his heart and
a development of an artificial heart.

175
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,231
Again,

176
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:17,820
another example of biomedical engineering
is something that people have been

177
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:20,550
trying to accomplish for decades now.

178
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,740
And this is the closest that we've come
and there are many advantages of this

179
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:30,040
particular artificial heart and it's,
and it's an important innovation in, uh,

180
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,350
in several different ways.

181
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,160
And we're going to talk about this whole
science of building artificial organs,

182
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,900
uh, devices that are made out of totally
synthetic components to replace the

183
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,660
function of your natural organs.

184
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,940
And the artificial heart is
a good example of that. Well,

185
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:52,941
this picture on the bottom here is a
really just a series of colored dots.

186
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,330
Um, some are yellow, some
are red, and some are green.

187
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,210
Does anybody know what this is?
You've seen pictures like this.

188
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,830
Okay.

189
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,070
It's,

190
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,070
it's an example of a technology
called a gene chip that allows you to,

191
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:12,170
on each one of these spots,
there is DNA for example,

192
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,870
that's specific for a
particular gene in your, um,

193
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,850
in your genome,
in the human genome for example.

194
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:25,330
And by incubating a small sample of
fluid from a patient on a gene chip like

195
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:29,420
this, where every one of these
dots represents a different gene.

196
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,960
You can see by looking at the
pattern of colors on this chip,

197
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,650
which genes are being expressed and which
genes are not being expressed in that

198
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:40,970
particular individual.

199
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:46,070
So it lets you do a profile of not
just the genes that you possess,

200
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:46,821
for example,

201
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:51,821
but what genes are actually being used
to make proteins in the cells that

202
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,100
surround the fluid where
this was collected.

203
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,280
And so this has been a
remarkable innovation.

204
00:12:58,281 --> 00:13:03,080
It's another example of
biomedical engineering
technology that allows us to look

205
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,540
at what's happening inside an individual,

206
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:10,541
a patient in a totally different way
than we were before by looking to see not

207
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,110
just what genes you carry,

208
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:16,820
but what genes are being used at
particular times in your life. And,

209
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,760
and this is mainly a research tool now,

210
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,080
but there's lots of reasons to believe
that this is going to change the way that

211
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,970
a physicians practice medicine by allowing
them to diagnose or predict what's

212
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:32,120
going to happen to you in ways
that they can't currently.

213
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,180
And so we'll talk about technologies
like this, where they're at,

214
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,740
what the scientific basis of it
is and how they might be useful.

215
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,710
Okay.

216
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,970
This is an airplane. What does that
have to do with biomedical engineering?

217
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,280
Well, you could stretch
it and say that, say it.

218
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,390
An example of engineering to improve human
health is getting them from one place

219
00:13:55,671 --> 00:14:00,590
to another. Uh, but that would be more
of a stretch that I'm going to make a,

220
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:05,510
but it turns out that technologies like
airplanes which were developed in the

221
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,950
last century have become integral
parts of medicine. Uh, for example, uh,

222
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,450
you all know that some,

223
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,900
the only treatment for some diseases
is to get an organ transplant.

224
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:20,110
So a kidney transplant or a liver
transplant is the only life extending,

225
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,410
uh, intervention that can be
done for some kinds of diseases.

226
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,370
And transplants require donors.

227
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,760
And the donor organ is usually not at
the same physical location that the

228
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,730
recipient is.
Right?

229
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,920
And so jets like this one have become
very important in connecting donors to

230
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:46,280
recipients. A team of surgeons is working
to harvest and Oregon at one site,

231
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:50,720
while another team of surgeons is working
to prepare the recipient at another

232
00:14:50,721 --> 00:14:54,560
site. And the Oregon has flown
there. Now why does that happen?

233
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:58,130
Because you have to get the Oregon
from one place to another fast, right?

234
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,280
The Oregon has to get from one
place to another very rapidly,

235
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:03,140
and this is the fastest way to do it.
Well,

236
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:07,430
what if we could develop ways using
engineering techniques to the extend the

237
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:11,480
life of an organ so it didn't have
to get where it went so quickly,

238
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,700
then that would open up lots of more
possibilities for organ transplantation

239
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,630
than are known now.

240
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,710
Or what if we could figure out ways to
avoid organ transplantation entirely?

241
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,890
What if we could just take a few
cells from that donor Oregon,

242
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,000
shipped them to the site,
grow a new Oregon at the site,
and then implanted there.

243
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,740
And these are examples of biomedical
engineering of the future that expand on

244
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,270
what we currently use,

245
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,710
which involves to no small
extent technology like this.

246
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,983
Uh,

247
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,600
I would guess that probably 30 to
50% of you do this every day. Uh,

248
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:52,370
you put a piece of plastic
that's synthetic piece of
plastic into your eye. Uh,

249
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:52,591
yeah.

250
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:57,591
To improve your vision and contact lens
technology has changed dramatically from

251
00:15:58,021 --> 00:16:01,740
the time that I was born to the,
to, to the time that you were born.

252
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:05,090
And the contact lenses you use today are
much different than the ones that would

253
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:08,730
have been used 30 years ago. And this
is biomedical engineering as well.

254
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,820
Engineers who are developing new
materials, materials that can be,

255
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:12,840
if you think about it,

256
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,470
there's not very many things that you
would want to put in your eye and that you

257
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:19,680
would feel comfortable putting into
your eye. So this is a very safe,

258
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:22,980
a very inert material.
What gives it those properties?

259
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,690
What makes it so safe to put in one of
the most sensitive places in your body?

260
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,670
Sort of in contact with your eye?

261
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,900
Why do you have confidence putting it in
contact with one of the most important

262
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,790
organs of your body, uh, because
you trust biomedical engineers, uh,

263
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:43,230
to have done a good job in designing these
things. And we'll talk about how, uh,

264
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,030
bio materials are designed and tested
and what makes a material the properties

265
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:51,210
of a material that you could use
as a contact lens. What are the,

266
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,100
what are the properties
that it needs to have?

267
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,863
Oops.

268
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,020
Uh,
this is an example of an artificial hip.

269
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,100
We've learned a lot about the
mechanics of how humans work as,

270
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,070
as organisms over the
last hundred years or so,

271
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:17,760
how we work as sort of physical objects
that have to obey the laws of physics

272
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:18,600
that you know about.

273
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,440
We live in a gravitational field and
that affects our day to day life.

274
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:27,150
And if you have a hip pain or a
hip that's diseased in some way,

275
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,200
and you can't stand up against that
gravitational field in the same way,

276
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:34,740
that severely limits what
you can do in the world.

277
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,670
And so biomedical engineers have been
working for many years on how to design

278
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,430
replacement parts for uh,
for uh,

279
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:45,720
joints like the hip and the artificial
hip is the most well developed of those.

280
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:49,650
We'll talk about this in some detail and
you can imagine that there that there

281
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:53,610
are many requirements that a
device like this has to make,

282
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,210
has to meet in order for it
to be a good artificial hip.

283
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,590
And we'll talk about those and how the
design of these has changed over the

284
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,360
years in what we can expect in the future.
And lastly, up here is a picture of a,

285
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,700
of a much smaller device.
This is actually a,

286
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,530
an artificial heart valve that is made of,

287
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,730
of plastics and metal and can
replace the valve inside your heart.

288
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,930
And um, valvular disease is
not uncommon in the world. Uh,

289
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:23,730
we'll,
we'll talk about that a little bit.

290
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,540
We'll talk about how your normal valve
function inside your heart and how your

291
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,560
heart couldn't work in the way that it
did if it didn't have valves that were

292
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,190
doing a very complex operation many,
many times a day.

293
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,580
And then we'll talk about how you can
build something to replace a complicated

294
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,020
small part in the body like that.

295
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,640
Yeah.

296
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,160
Well let's take a step back for a minute.

297
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,790
That's sort of one way of looking at
biomedical engineering by looking at sort

298
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,480
of the things that you know about that
have been the result of the work of

299
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,720
biomedical engineers and talk more
generally. So what is engineering?

300
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,160
What do engineers do?

301
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,630
What makes engineering different
than other fields of study?

302
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:07,440
What makes it unique so that we have a
school of engineering at Yale that's,

303
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,680
that's separate from
science and the humanities.

304
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,030
Any thoughts?
Yeah,

305
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,490
it's much more hands on you.
You're actually in the [inaudible],

306
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,760
they're doing things I,

307
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,730
and many of the things I showed you where
things that were built right that were,

308
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,050
that were built from, uh, parts.
That's a, that's a good description.

309
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,220
What makes it different from science?
Science can be hands on.

310
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,590
We might be down at the lake,
you know,

311
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,910
picking up algae and studying
them or something that would,

312
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:48,250
that would be kind of hands on.
But what's different?

313
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,750
What would make you an engineer?

314
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,720
Yeah,
that's in here.

315
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,950
You design.

316
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:59,970
So scientists observe and try to
describe an engineer's tried to design.

317
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:03,090
They take those descriptions and that
science that's known and they try to

318
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:06,480
design new things.
And so if you look at a dictionary,

319
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:09,510
it has words like this that
you're designing things.

320
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:12,690
Or another way to say that is that
you're trying to apply science.

321
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,250
You're looking at applications.

322
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,870
So we're trying to take scientific
information and make something new.

323
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,470
And the other thing about it is that you
could make lots of things that are new,

324
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,380
but generally you think of engineers
is making things that are not just new,

325
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:30,360
but they're useful, that they do
something that needs to be done, uh,

326
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:34,230
and that they do something
that improves life, right?

327
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,450
The quality of life of people.

328
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,940
And so here's a brief and a very biased,

329
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:46,020
a history of engineering.
It's short. Uh, but, um,

330
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,890
engineering became a discipline and
about the middle of the 18 hundreds,

331
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,100
lots of universities started
teaching engineering as a discipline,

332
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:58,630
including Yale in 1852,
around that time, uh,

333
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,420
this might've been the first course
that was offered in engineering in the

334
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:06,350
country, was taught at Yale in, uh,
in civil engineering in 1852. And,

335
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:08,770
and even Yale students don't know this,

336
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:11,470
what a long distinguished history
of engineering that they're,

337
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,720
their own institution has.
In fact,

338
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:18,070
the first phd degree in engineering
was awarded to a fellow named j Willard

339
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,070
Gibbs at Yale in 1863 for a thesis he
did on how gears work or something.

340
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:25,030
I forget exactly what the details are,

341
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:28,510
but have you heard of Gibbs
is a name that rings a bell.

342
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:33,550
Where'd you hear about Gibbs from?
Sorry.

343
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,700
Yeah, g Gibbs. Free Energy.

344
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,650
That annoying concept that you had to
try to master in chemistry at some point,

345
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:46,390
but, but Gibbs is really the, the father
of, uh, of, uh, of, uh, modern, uh,

346
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,160
physical chemistry. And um,
and uh, was one of the most,

347
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:56,050
uh, um, most famous scientist
of the 19th century.

348
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,240
And got the first phd in
engineering here at Yale.

349
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,810
And then from these
beginnings, uh, engineers,

350
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,810
a transformed life in the 20th century.

351
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,590
So a lot of things started in the
20th century and became commonplace.

352
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:11,740
Things like electricity,
having electricity delivered to your home.

353
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:14,680
So you had to have ways to generate
electricity and to carry it from point to

354
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:15,310
point.

355
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,210
And it was engineers that did that built
bridges and roads and we couldn't and

356
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,830
automobiles and uh,

357
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:24,850
and so we can get from one
place to another relatively
quickly because of that,

358
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:29,290
because there are air planes that were
also developed by engineers in that

359
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,760
century, in that century. Uh,

360
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:34,420
we designed a lot of new materials
that could be used to build things that

361
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,920
couldn't have been done otherwise.

362
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,730
Things like steel and polymers or
plastics and ceramics and of course,

363
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:42,664
computers,

364
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,110
which has progressed remarkably due to
the work of engineers in your lifetime

365
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:50,440
till now, uh, you can carry
around a, a cell phone,

366
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:54,820
which would have been unthinkable,
uh, even, uh, even 30 years ago.

367
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,020
So a engineer's in the 20th century
have transformed our society.

368
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,890
One of the other things that happened
during the 20th century is that human life

369
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:06,760
expectancy increased dramatically.
People started living a lot longer.

370
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,570
And so what I plot on this graph
here is as a function of time,

371
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,070
years dates, uh, life expectancy
as a function of time.

372
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,360
And um, what, uh,

373
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,520
you'll see here is that about for the
period before sort of a 1700 or so human

374
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,000
life expectancy was less
than 40 years of age.

375
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,870
So that means a person that was born
in that year could expect to live on

376
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:35,590
average about 40 years.
That was the expected lifespan.

377
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:41,080
And the expected lifespan has increased
dramatically in the last couple of

378
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,750
hundred years till now. For people
that were born when you were born,

379
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:47,270
you can expect to live,
to be 80 years old,

380
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,570
a doubling in a lifespan,
fairly dramatic.

381
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,340
So what's responsible for that?

382
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,630
Why are people living longer than
they did just a few hundred years ago?

383
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,720
Well,
there's a clue here on the slide.

384
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,760
I indicated a couple of points here
where if we looked in the year 1665 in

385
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:08,600
London, you could ask the question.
Another way to ask the question,

386
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:12,260
why are people living so long is to
ask the question, why do people die?

387
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,240
And in 1665,

388
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:19,090
93% of the people that died in that
year died of infectious diseases, right?

389
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,200
Uh, in contrast, if you look
at a US city 10 years ago,

390
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:28,280
in 1997, for example, uh,
then people still died,

391
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,520
but they didn't die predominantly
from infectious diseases.

392
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,850
They died from other thing.
Only 4% died from infectious diseases.

393
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,110
So one of the reasons there's a huge
increase in lifespan is because people

394
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,620
aren't dying of things that
they would have in prior years.

395
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,420
So why the change in why the
change in infectious diseases?

396
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,860
Why did I focus on that one?

397
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:53,861
What makes it so much better to be alive
now in terms of your likelihood to die

398
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,740
of an infectious disease than
it did in London in 1665?

399
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,740
Yes,
but what specifically

400
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,910
drugs like antibiotics,
penicillin, arithromycin. Again,

401
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,050
something else you've probably all
had experience with and you think,

402
00:25:14,051 --> 00:25:18,430
well that's, that's not
biomedical engineering. That's,
that's science. That's a,

403
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,600
somebody discovering a molecule that
kills microorganisms. And that's true.

404
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,590
It is science.

405
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,970
But in order for that to go from being
a science that works in a laboratory or

406
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:32,200
in one hospital to being penicillin,
which could be used all over the world,

407
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:34,990
you've got to be able to make it
in tremendously large quantities.

408
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,520
And that's the work of
biomedical engineers making
penicillin in the kinds of

409
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:43,540
quantities that you need so that a dose
could be available for everyone in the

410
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,260
world if they got infected. And
to make it, not just in abundance,

411
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:50,890
but make it cheaply enough that
everyone could afford it. Right?

412
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,310
So if you can make a 100 tons of the drug,

413
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:57,630
but it costs $100,000 a gram,
um,

414
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,840
that might not be a useful drug because
nobody could afford to use it. Right?

415
00:26:01,841 --> 00:26:06,430
And so it's the work of
biomedical engineers really
to take these innovations in

416
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,670
science like drugs and make them useful.

417
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,610
Make them so that everybody
can take advantage of it.

418
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,180
And you also mentioned vaccines and we're
going to talk a lot in the middle part

419
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:19,420
of the course about vaccines
and the engineering of immunity.

420
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:23,410
How do you engineer what happens in our
immune system in order to protect us

421
00:26:23,411 --> 00:26:25,120
from diseases? And, um,

422
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,630
that's another example of an area
where biomedical engineers have made

423
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,280
tremendous contributions.

424
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,870
So just to go a little bit
further with that point,

425
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,340
if you looked at the causes of death in
London in 1665, here's a list that I,

426
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,910
that I, uh, that I got from a, from
a source that was written at that.

427
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,790
And um, I don't even understand
what some of these things are,

428
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,850
but the ones in green are,
uh,

429
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,830
are infectious diseases there
infectious causes of disease,

430
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,420
a spotted fever and purples,
uh, for example, which, uh,

431
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,310
which we call a measles, um, was, uh,

432
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,780
was a significant cause of death
as well as the plague. Right?

433
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,700
Which we don't have any more.
Thank, thank goodness. Um,

434
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,660
but people died,

435
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,010
typically have either infectious
diseases or they died during childbirth,

436
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,140
or they might've died at old age, which
would have been a 50 or so at that time.

437
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,410
In contrast today, because we have
antibiotics and we have vaccines,

438
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:27,260
people don't die of
infectious diseases as often.

439
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,600
They live much longer lives and they
live, uh, to die of something else.

440
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,600
Right. And the leading
causes of death, uh,

441
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:40,160
currently haven't changed very much
since 1997 when this data was published,

442
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,340
but they die of heart
disease and cancer primarily.

443
00:27:43,341 --> 00:27:45,650
Those are the number one
and two causes of death.

444
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,950
And we're going to talk a lot about how
one can use the technology that we have

445
00:27:50,991 --> 00:27:55,700
now to treat these kinds of diseases
like cancer and heart disease.

446
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,690
But why do you think these are
the number one and two now?

447
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:05,290
How come these have risen above
infectious diseases over the,

448
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,670
over the last several hundred years?

449
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,620
Why is cancer one of the
leading killers in the US now,

450
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:18,800
but wasn't even on the charts in 1665?
Yeah.

451
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,033
Okay.

452
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,250
So it could be that the, that, that,
that, uh, what's your name? So,

453
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,820
so Justin said it could be new things
that are around and you're exposed to

454
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:37,270
stuff we weren't exposed to before. And
that's true. Our environment has changed.

455
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,610
The world has become industrialized,
right?

456
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:43,180
We're exposed to things that might cause
cancer where we weren't exposed to them

457
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:47,770
before. And so, um, and
so that might be a reason.

458
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,300
Yeah. Yeah. In 1665,

459
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,190
they weren't diagnosing cancer.
Right.

460
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:56,920
It was easy to tell somebody
had an infectious disease. Uh,

461
00:28:56,921 --> 00:29:00,100
but you might not have known that they
had cancer at that time and they just

462
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:04,600
died and we didn't have the same methods
of diagnosis, uh, that we do now.

463
00:29:04,601 --> 00:29:07,570
So maybe it was just not diagnosed then.
Yeah.

464
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,000
People are living longer and so now they
have more opportunity to get cancer.

465
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,350
Right.
The longer you live,

466
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,800
the more opportunity you have to
acquire a disease like cancer,

467
00:29:19,811 --> 00:29:24,260
which often is an
accumulation of, of, of, um,

468
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,280
defects that occur over
a long period of time.

469
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,730
And so we're going to talk about
about a cancer, for example,

470
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,100
how cancer diagnosis has improved.
Uh,

471
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,340
what are some of the causes of cancer
and the environment around us and how can

472
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:40,180
we protect ourselves from it? And we'll
talk about treatments for it as well.

473
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,680
And disease. Why, why is
cardiovascular disease on the top

474
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,480
obesity or generally our diets are
different than they were in 1665.

475
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:56,290
Uh, we eat different kinds of things and
many people think that that's what has

476
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:59,800
contributed to, uh, to
much more heart disease.

477
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,710
But it could also be that it
wasn't as easily diagnosed then.

478
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,770
So people were dying of old age and
that was really heart disease that was

479
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:10,000
killing them. They just didn't
know. Um, uh, so there, so it's a,

480
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:13,390
it's a multifactorial.
We'll talk about that.

481
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,280
And I just wanted to show you this last
graph for this last set of statistics to

482
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:22,750
go from causes of death in the u
s to causes of death in the world.

483
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,730
To illustrate that what happens in
the world around us in the U s isn't

484
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:30,760
necessarily the same as what happens
in other places around the world.

485
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:31,930
In other places.

486
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:35,740
Infectious disease is a much bigger
part of their life and a much,

487
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:40,060
much greater risk of death from infectious
diseases and parasitic diseases if

488
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:44,770
you live in places other than the
US or western Europe for example.

489
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,950
And so the problem of infectious disease
prevention and treatment isn't solved

490
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,330
yet. Uh, we, you know this, right?

491
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,190
And so there's plenty of room to still
innovate in that way to develop new

492
00:30:57,191 --> 00:31:02,191
methods that could protect
against diseases like aids
or diseases like malaria

493
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,830
that, uh, that we don't
have problems with here,

494
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:08,920
but they do in many parts of the world.
And so we'll talk about that.

495
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,620
I mentioned, uh, the,

496
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,680
the book for the course and
the book is a book that, uh,

497
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,370
that I've written.
It's not published yet.

498
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:23,350
And so I'm going to put chapters from
the book, uh, that are fairly final form.

499
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:26,380
And I think you'll find them easy to read,
but you don't have to buy it.

500
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,840
It's going to be posted on the Internet.

501
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,450
And I'll post chapters sort
of advance of the readings.

502
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:36,340
And if you looked on the classes server
you saw chapter one and chapter one

503
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:40,480
describes some of the sort of organization
of biomedical engineering into,

504
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,180
into sub disciplines,
which I've listed here.

505
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,130
And so we're going to talk about
thinking about the body as an,

506
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,080
as a,
as a system,

507
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,560
as a system that can be understood the
same way a motor could be understood or a

508
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:54,940
computer that could be understood.

509
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,980
And that study is systems physiology
and that's an important sub division of

510
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:01,120
biomedical engineering.

511
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,330
We'll talk about instrumentation a
little bit and I've mentioned this,

512
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:08,680
things like the EKG machine and the heart
lung machine or instruments that are

513
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:13,570
designed to either keep patients
alive or to allow you to,

514
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,450
um, thank you, allow you to, um,

515
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:23,980
wasn't what I thought or allow you to, uh,

516
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,490
to monitor their function over time.
We'll talk about imaging,

517
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:30,700
which I mentioned biomechanics
or the study of, of,

518
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,770
of humans is mechanical objects.

519
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,580
We'll talk about a field which is growing
now called biomolecular engineering.

520
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,650
And, uh, that is, uh,

521
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,710
is the design of bio materials or new
materials that can be implanted in the

522
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,960
body.
It's new ways of drug delivery.

523
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,860
It's this whole field of tissue
engineering that I mentioned earlier.

524
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,480
We'll talk about artificial organs and
we'll talk about systems biology or, uh,

525
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,650
thinking about,
um,

526
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,270
how to acquire information from things
like gene chips and use that information

527
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:03,450
to understand what's happening in a
complex organism like you. Now I've,

528
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:05,570
I've highlighted three
of these in blue here,

529
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,190
imaging mechanics and biomolecular
engineering because if you go on to study

530
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,740
biomedical engineering
here at Yale Anyway,

531
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,910
these are the things that you
might pick a to emphasize on.

532
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,970
These are the things that we do best
and where we have advanced coursework

533
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,530
available in these three categories.
And so I'm going to emphasize these three,

534
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,980
but we'll talk about all of these
subjects as we go through the course.

535
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,980
The syllabus is posted online.

536
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:34,200
I've just copied it here so you
could take a look at it. Uh,

537
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,070
so week one we're at trying
to talk about this question.

538
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,510
What is biomedical engineering?

539
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,250
There's some chapters here for reading
chapters one, two, and four I list,

540
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,080
I've only posted chapter one,

541
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:47,750
which basically reviews the
things I've talked about today.

542
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,370
Chapters two and four are really reviews
of things that you probably already

543
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:55,520
know something about.
So their reviews of basic chemistry,

544
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,870
so chemical concepts that are important
for us to all understand as we move

545
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,540
forward. And uh, review of, um,

546
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,550
of proteins and
biochemistry. Uh, basically,

547
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,160
so I'm going to post
those online. Uh, and,

548
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:13,500
and we're not going to talk about them
directly in the lectures, but there,

549
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:14,510
there is a resource.

550
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,010
So if we read about something like
Ph and you've forgotten what Ph is,

551
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,940
you can go back to chapter two,
which is posted and you can read about Ph.

552
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:26,240
And I try to take you through sort
of what you need to know in order to

553
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:27,950
understand the rest of
the course material.

554
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,950
And if you've forgotten about proteins
and what their structure is like,

555
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:33,100
you can go to chapter
four and read sort of a,

556
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:38,090
a brief review of protein
biochemistry, um, in,

557
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,570
in the section this week. I'll talk about
the section meetings in just a moment,

558
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,750
but there's no required
section meeting this week.

559
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,150
During this section
times I'll be available.

560
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,170
If you feel like you want to read chapters
two and four and then come and ask

561
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:51,771
questions,

562
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:56,390
sort of a tutorial on these topics of
chemistry and biochemistry a then I'll be

563
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:58,670
available to talk about
that during that time.

564
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,870
We'll start with week two talking
about genetic engineering, what's DNA,

565
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:04,130
how can it be manipulated,

566
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,910
how is our ability to manipulate DNA
led to things like gene therapy, which,

567
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,560
which can now be done in people.
And uh, so we'll talk about that.

568
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,060
And that's what chapter three is about.

569
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,030
We'll talk about cell culture
engineering during a week. Four,

570
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,580
how do you maintain cells in culture?
What are the limits of this?

571
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:22,220
How can you use cultured
cells to do things?

572
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,120
And how do engineers build new things
out of cultured cells is going to be a

573
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,430
subject we talk about throughout
the rest of the course.

574
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,050
And the chapter is listed here.
So I think that's enough.

575
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:36,530
You can follow along with the syllabus
and see sort of what the topics are each

576
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,720
week, what the reading assignment
is to do before the lecture. Uh,

577
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,670
in order to get the
most out of the lecture.

578
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:45,930
Now each week we have a section
meeting required section. They're all,

579
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:48,120
all the sections meet
on Thursday afternoon.

580
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,130
And the idea of the section is to sort
of amplify on some subject we've talked

581
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:57,030
about during the week and we do this in
the undergraduate biomedical engineering

582
00:35:57,031 --> 00:36:01,800
laboratory in the Malone building so
that we can do demonstrations and sort of

583
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:06,600
hands on projects to really get a little
bit deeper into the subject that we're

584
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:07,434
considering.

585
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,340
And so in the first week we run a
section called from strawberries to gene

586
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:14,880
therapy where we talk
about DNA extract DNA.

587
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,920
You can play with the DNA of a,

588
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:21,150
of an organism and we can think about
how to use DNA for other purposes.

589
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,141
In week three,

590
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:25,350
you'll actually do some cell culture
in the laboratory and look at cultured

591
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,420
cells and learn how to manipulate,

592
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:31,350
do some manipulations on cells in
culture and so on. Throughout the weeks,

593
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,300
we have a one hour section that's
designed to give you some more detailed

594
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:40,110
experience, some hands on experience with
some of the topics we're talking about.

595
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,530
There are no lab reports that are due.

596
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,660
There's some times will
be homework assignments,

597
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,140
which sort of build on what
we've done during the section a,

598
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:52,950
but it's not a lab in that sense that
it's a long experience in the afternoon or

599
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:57,090
that requires any detailed reports.
Uh, but it is a required in,

600
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,010
I think an important part of the course.

601
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,400
There's a midterm exam halfway
through and a final exam at the end,

602
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,030
and there's a term paper which is
due near the end of the course.

603
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,940
So this just, uh, just say a
little bit more about the sections.

604
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:16,410
There's three sections we have online,
uh, discussion section sign up.

605
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:20,340
Has Anybody tried to do that yet?
Just so they know that it's available.

606
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,470
So it was supposed to be
available from day one.

607
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,880
You can sign up for a section that
fits your schedule. And these,

608
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,360
this is sort of the list of things
that we'll go through in this section.

609
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:30,690
Meetings, grading, uh,

610
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,670
30% of the grade is for the midterm,
30% for the final.

611
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,070
And so the final is not cumulative.

612
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:40,740
The final covers only things
for the last half of the course.

613
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:44,880
So it's really just like a, uh,
a, uh, covers half the course,

614
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:47,940
but it's given during the final
exam period. There's a term paper,

615
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,010
which I'll talk more
about as the weeks go on.

616
00:37:50,011 --> 00:37:54,210
That's also worth 30% of the grade and
you'll have weekly approximately weekly

617
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:59,100
homework assignments that are,
that are, um, that account
for 10% of your grade. Uh,

618
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,290
but they have an impact beyond the 10%.

619
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:03,490
Because if you can do the homework
and you understand the homework,

620
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:06,660
you're going to have no problem
with the exams. Uh, so, um,

621
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,830
so I encourage you to spend more time
than they're waiting would suggest.

622
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,950
So how do you get an a? So in the
course it's very simple. Uh, you,

623
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:21,170
uh, you do the reading before
class, you come to class and, uh,

624
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:22,200
you do the homework.

625
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,940
And I guarantee if you do those three
things throughout the course that you'll

626
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:29,230
do well in the course. And, and I've,

627
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,880
I've said this almost every time I've
given the course and nobody has ever told

628
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:36,010
me that I'm wrong. And so do these
three things. If you don't get an a,

629
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:40,720
then you can come back and
talk to me about it later. Um,

630
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:45,040
the assignment for the next class
is to do problem two of chapter one,

631
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,560
which I've repeated right here. So, um,

632
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,280
and that's to think beyond
what I've talked about in
terms of what is biomedical

633
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:52,540
engineering,
uh,

634
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,810
to think a little bit more
about biomedical engineering
projects that you've

635
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:58,840
encountered in your life or that
you have some experience with.

636
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,200
And then to think beyond what information
I've given you in the chapter in this

637
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,680
lecture to say,

638
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:10,620
what products of biomedical engineering
do you expect to become routine in the

639
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:12,460
next 50 years?

640
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,610
So spend 10 or 15 minutes thinking about
this and write it down and bring your

641
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:22,300
responses to class, uh, in the next
period. And we'll talk about that.

642
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,783
And,
uh,

643
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,510
so at the end here of this first lecture
where I've gone some way and trying to

644
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:33,550
tell you what biomedical
engineering is about,

645
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:38,320
I thought it would try to relate it
in a different sort of way. And you,

646
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:43,150
you've, you've heard this, this poem,
right? London Bridge is falling down.

647
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,000
Everybody's heard this poem,
you played the game.

648
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,710
I don't know if there's video games now
if people play games like this where a

649
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,440
London Bridge is falling down, but,
uh, this is a picture of London Bridge.

650
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:56,500
It's an interesting bridge, which is
important in the history of London.

651
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:01,090
Bridges have really changed our society
and allowed us to get from one place to

652
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:05,740
another in ways that we couldn't
have gotten to easily before.

653
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,890
One of the interesting things about London
bridge is that it's now no longer in

654
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:12,820
London. It's an Arizona. You can
see a palm tree here. But when they,

655
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,380
when they reconstructed London Bridge,

656
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:18,040
they moved the old London Bridge
to Arizona. Some guy bought it.

657
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,770
That must be an interesting story,
but, um, but I just have it here.

658
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,630
Uh, and I think the, the, the poem tells
you something about engineering, right?

659
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:33,550
If you go through the a and the problems
of engineering and in bridge building,

660
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:38,380
we're well advanced in understanding what
are the problems with building bridges

661
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:40,780
and how do we overcome them.
For example,

662
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,870
one thing that could happen is that
you build it up with wooden clay.

663
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,140
You pick the wrong material
for a bridge and it,

664
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,760
it will not stand up to the forces of
nature, right? They will wash away.

665
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,120
And so you've got to pick the right
materials in order to build a bridge.

666
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,560
So you pick a better material like iron
and steel that makes a better bridge.

667
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:02,540
We know that now because we have
experienced with bridges, uh,

668
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,010
but still your bridge might fail.
It might fail for a different region.

669
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,090
It might bend and bow. That is,
it's not the forces of nature,

670
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,960
like the movement of the river. That's
not, that's knocking the bridge down,

671
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:17,320
but it's just the failure of
these materials over time, right?

672
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:21,460
That they don't last as long as they
might. And so you build it with a,

673
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:26,020
with a material like silver and gold
and then you encounter the problems of

674
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,400
society,
right,

675
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,490
that your bridge might get stolen because
somebody thinks they have a better use

676
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,950
for silver and gold,
then you're a bridge.

677
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,720
And I would say that in biomedical
engineering largely we're,

678
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,610
we're still at the stage where we're
trying to understand how things work and

679
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:44,810
how they fail and what materials are
the right ones were maybe where civil

680
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:48,110
engineering and bridge building
was a hundred years ago.

681
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,980
And that makes it for me a very exciting
time to study this because the problems

682
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:56,981
aren't solved in the way that bridge
building is largely a solved problem.

683
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:01,460
Now the problems like the
artificial heart are still unsolved.

684
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,020
There's still room for innovation,

685
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,780
still room to learn from
what hasn't worked before,

686
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,690
to learn from science and
to design something better.

687
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,410
And so one of by purposes of
this course is to get you,

688
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,480
whether you study biomedical
engineering after this,

689
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:19,481
are not excited about the subject so that
you start thinking about how you could

690
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,860
innovate in this area where lots of
problems are still left to solve.

691
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,890
So I'll see you on Thursday,
hopefully.
