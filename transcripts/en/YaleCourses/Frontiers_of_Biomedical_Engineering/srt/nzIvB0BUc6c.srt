1
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,530
So today we're going to continue to
talk about a cardiac physiology in

2
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,950
particular, the electrophysiology
of the heart, which is,

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,850
which is quite interesting and
important to, uh, heart function.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,040
And also one of the,
uh,

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,550
it turns out that one of the
most important diagnostic
measurements that can be

6
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:31,360
made, uh, is, uh,

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,000
through a device that was designed by
biomedical engineers called an electric

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:35,834
cardiograph.

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,650
And so we'll talk about today sort of
the origins of electrical activity in the

10
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:45,120
heart, the role that this
electrical activity plays in
the function of the heart.

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,320
And then finally,

12
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:51,000
how we'll talk a little bit about how
one can measure that electrical activity,

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,970
which comes from cells in the heart,

14
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:58,590
sort of deep inside your body but can be
measured with electrodes on the surface

15
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,424
of your body.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,020
And you'll get some more experience with
making those measurements in a section

17
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:08,290
on Thursday afternoon. So this is, uh,

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,380
I apologize,
a rather complicated diagram,

19
00:01:11,381 --> 00:01:16,150
but I wanted to show you a picture
that would give you a sense for,

20
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,980
uh, sort of, uh,

21
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,010
where the electrical potential
that all cells have comes from.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,200
And you know that cells are bathed in an
extracellular fluid and that that extra

23
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:33,430
cellular fluid contains molecules
including ions are charged molecules.

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,210
In fact, the extra cellular fluid
is very rich in a particular ions,

25
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:42,520
sodium and has lesser
amounts of other ions.

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,690
Uh,

27
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:48,690
potassium and calcium are the three most
important in the electrical activity of

28
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:52,990
membranes, sodium, potassium and calcium.

29
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,300
So the extra cellular space,

30
00:01:55,301 --> 00:02:00,160
which is up on the top here is filled
with those ions in particular has a high

31
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,050
concentration of sodium.

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,950
The intracellular space are inside the
cell also is a water rich environment and

33
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,700
also has ions.

34
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,900
But the ion composition inside the
cell is different than the composition

35
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:18,520
outside the cell in that the sodium
concentration is relatively low.

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,200
And so this chart here shows you for a
typical cell sodium concentration might

37
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:28,201
be 15 millimolar while the extracellular
sodium concentration is 145 millimolar.

38
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,221
Okay,

39
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:35,221
so almost 10 fold higher sodium ion
concentration outside the cell than inside

40
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:36,250
the cell.

41
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,450
Well now you know from what you know about
the structure of lipid membranes that

42
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:44,500
charged molecules,
even though they're small charged ions,

43
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:47,140
like sodium cannot penetrate
through a lipid biolayer.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,920
So there's no way for sodium to
get through this lipid bi layer.

45
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,850
So even though there's a very
large difference in concentration,

46
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,700
okay,

47
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,270
uh,

48
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,170
these molecules of sodium on the outside
can't diffuse inside because they can't

49
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:05,710
permeate through the
Lipid biolayer right now,

50
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,090
cal or potassium notice has a very
high concentration inside the cell,

51
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:14,830
120 millimolar, and outside the
cell, the concentration is low,

52
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,060
4.5 millimolar. So again, a big
difference in potassium concentration,

53
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:23,200
but going in the opposite direction,
if the membrane was permeable,

54
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,070
sodium would diffuse in and
potassium would diffuse out,

55
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,020
but it can't through a
plane. Lipid biolayer well,

56
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:35,940
you also know that cell membranes
are not just lipid bilayers.

57
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,900
They have proteins inserted in them.

58
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:42,640
And we talked about proteins that serve
as as receptors, right? For example,

59
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:45,760
the insulin receptor that
binds to insulin. All right.

60
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,930
And we talked about signal transduction
through those receptors a few weeks ago.

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,970
We also talked briefly about the fact
that some of these proteins are transport

62
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,971
proteins and their role
in the cell membrane is to
allow molecules that the cell

63
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:05,371
needs to come in or to go out and the
glucose transporter is an example of that,

64
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:06,880
right?

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,340
So the only way that glucose can get
inside cells to provide a substrate for a

66
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,090
metabolism is because there
are specialized proteins
in the membrane that allow

67
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:19,000
glucose to cross in the same way.

68
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:24,001
They're a specialized proteins that allow
ions to cross and these proteins come

69
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,660
in two varieties.

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,950
Some are active transport
proteins like this one,

71
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:34,390
which is called the sodium potassium
pump and it's actually a little machine

72
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,430
that sits inside the cell membrane.

73
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:41,431
It's a protein base machine and its job
is to pump a pump sodium out of the cell

74
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,620
and potassium into the cell.
Sodium goes out, potassium goes in,

75
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,140
and it's, it's moving those molecules
against their concentration gradients.

76
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,220
And so energy is required for that to
happen. It doesn't happen spontaneously.

77
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,840
You can't move molecules.

78
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,740
Molecules don't spontaneously moved from
regions of low concentration to high

79
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:07,510
concentration. So it requires energy
and it gets its energy from ATP.

80
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,560
So this is called the sodium potassium
pump and, and it's ubiquitous in,

81
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,570
in cells throughout the body and it's
how cells maintain this low sodium

82
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:25,270
concentration and high
potassium concentration
inside is because of they have

83
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:29,320
these little machines in their membranes
that are continually uh, pumping, uh,

84
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:32,320
sodium and potassium in.
Does that make sense?

85
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,570
And so it's the action of this pump
that causes these differences in ions to

86
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,404
occur.

87
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,780
There are other proteins that serve as
channels and you can think of these as

88
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:45,400
very specialized pores,

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,520
pores in the membrane that allow ions
to pass through and they're selective at

90
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,680
this one is a potassium channel.
And so if it is open,

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,590
it allows potassium to pass through.

92
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,150
It only allows passive transport.
It's not a machine like the other one,

93
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,661
it's just a,

94
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:10,661
it's just a portal or a hole that
allows potassium to move down its

95
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:15,350
concentration gradient.
So if this potassium channel is open,

96
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,460
then potassium will naturally move
and it will move from high to low

97
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,540
concentration.
That is,

98
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:25,541
it'll move from inside the
cell to out if sodium has,

99
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,510
if there's a channel per sodium and it
happens to be open and that's what this

100
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,410
is showing here.

101
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,610
A channel with the lid off
means the channel is open,

102
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,620
then sodium can pass from its high
concentration to low concentration or from

103
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,760
the extra cellular space to the
intracellular space, right? So the,

104
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:49,910
the sale is in a dynamic equilibrium that,
and it's sort of,

105
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,660
it's sort of steady state,
its natural state.

106
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,840
There is this active machine
that's pumping sodium out
and potassium in and then

107
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:05,450
there are these pores that when they
exist and when they're open are letting

108
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,550
these molecules to leak
back the other way.

109
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,890
So the pump always has to be operating
because the leak is always happening.

110
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,383
Does that make sense?

111
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,370
Because you have these differences
in ion concentrations across the cell

112
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:26,510
membrane,
these and you have the,

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,960
the the flux of molecules continuously
across the membrane in that,

114
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,260
what I've shown here are channels
that are, they have a lid on them.

115
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:39,590
So there's some times open
and sometimes closed, right?

116
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:41,000
They can be both open and closed,

117
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,160
but every cell in your body at a given
time is going to have lots of potassium

118
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:49,550
channels that are open and lots
of sodium channels that are open.

119
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,630
Okay.

120
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,890
There just some that are open all
the time. And because of that,

121
00:07:55,891 --> 00:08:00,080
there's a continual leakage of potassium
out of the cell and it continual

122
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,760
leakage of sodium into the cell.
Well,

123
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,050
if ions are moving
across the cell membrane,

124
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,410
ions are charged molecules and
that movement is a current, right?

125
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,320
You usually think of currencies, movements
of electrons, but movements of ions of,

126
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,540
of positively charged
ions is also current.

127
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,010
So there's a continual current flow
across the membrane and that continual

128
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:26,700
current flow causes a potential
difference across the membrane.

129
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,140
Now a membrane that's at rest that is
in its resting state is going to have a

130
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:37,110
given number of channels of sodium
and potassium that are open.

131
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:42,150
And so there'll be a given current of
sodium that's flowing in and given certain

132
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,940
certain, uh, uh, um,

133
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,580
current of potassium that's flowing out.

134
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,200
And that's being compensated
by the activity of this pump,

135
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,210
right? But this current flow
creates a potential or voltage.

136
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,810
So just like a battery because
these currents are flowing.

137
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,160
If I measured the electrical potential
on both sides of these men, uh, of these,

138
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,100
uh, of this membrane, I would
get a voltage difference.

139
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,540
And it turns out that for most cells
that voltage differences negative,

140
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,180
the inside of the cell is
slightly negative compared to the,

141
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,200
to the outside of the cell and it's
in the range of minus 60 to minus 90

142
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:22,860
millivolts. Okay, so that's the backdrop.

143
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,860
That's what you should think of as sort
of the resting state of a membrane.

144
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,920
It has these channels in it,
it exists in this,

145
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,190
in this a fluid environment where there's
high sodium outside high potassium

146
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:37,860
inside current flows,
membrane potential generated

147
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,070
to make it more complicated.

148
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,400
There are certain of these ion channels
that exist in open and closed states and

149
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:55,311
those open and closed states are regulated
by the voltage across the membrane.

150
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,620
And here's one called the voltage
dependent sodium channel and the resting

151
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,740
state.
When the membrane voltage is,

152
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:09,300
let's say minus 90 millivolts,
the channel is closed.

153
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,250
And so this channel does not
allow for sodium to enter.

154
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,070
If it opens,

155
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,680
sodium now can enter through these new
channels and if there are a lot of these

156
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,040
voltage gated channels on
the surface and the and the,

157
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,490
and they sense a change in
voltage and they all open,

158
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,230
one can have a dramatic change in the
currents that flow through the membrane

159
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,880
and hence the dramatic change
in membrane potential. Okay.

160
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,090
Now that's exactly what happens
when we have an action potential.

161
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:45,480
And I show you this diagram that I
showed you a few weeks ago when we were

162
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:50,481
talking about the nervous system and how
it communicates and I explained it in

163
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,740
sort of a superficial way then,

164
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,220
but now you can understand it a little
better if you think about it in terms of

165
00:10:56,221 --> 00:11:01,221
these of the membrane and the membrane
having channels that allow sodium and

166
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:03,150
potassium to flow.

167
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,010
So under resting condition they have
a population of channels that's always

168
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:11,310
allowing sodium and potassium to
flow that creates the potential.

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,560
And then they have special channels that
open when the voltage is disturbed in

170
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:17,394
some way.

171
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:23,030
And so here we're looking at a trace of
membrane voltage of membrane potential

172
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,174
in time.

173
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,410
And so imagine that you're very small
and you're sitting on the surface of this

174
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:28,981
membrane,

175
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:32,910
but you have special shoes on that measure
the voltage or something so you can

176
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,320
experience the voltage,

177
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,600
the potential drop across the membrane
by just standing on this membrane and

178
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,160
you're standing there
in the resting state.

179
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:45,360
So you're watching sodium and potassium
go by because of their normal fluxes and

180
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:48,690
the potential that you
measure is say minus,

181
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,000
I showed here is about minus 75
millivolts. Now something happens,

182
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,060
there's some disturbance
in the membrane near you,

183
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,430
not right where you're standing,
but near you.

184
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:04,690
There's a disturbance and that
disturbance might be a number of events,

185
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,470
but what we've thought about so far is
that there's a neurotransmitter that that

186
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,420
binds somewhere upstream of you that's
in neurotransmitter that binds to a

187
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:17,080
receptor and it creates a
change in membrane potential,

188
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,190
a small change in membrane potential,
but you feel it

189
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,640
when you feel it at your site.

190
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,350
There's also these voltage sensitive
sodium channels that exist in the membrane

191
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:34,330
around you. And they go from the
closed state to the open state

192
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,270
in response to this small disturbance,
some new channels open.

193
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,310
These happened to be sodium channels.

194
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,360
They open a lot of them open because
there's a lot of them on your cell because

195
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:49,570
your cell is designed
to respond to voltages.

196
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,670
So it has a lot of
these kinds of channels.

197
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,400
Now what happens when all
these new sodium channels open,

198
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,230
there's a rush of sodium from
outside the cell to inside the cell.

199
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,170
Sodium is positively charged.

200
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,000
You get a rush of current going
by you and that rush of current,

201
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:09,803
MMM

202
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,140
depolarizes the membrane.
Remember I said the neck,

203
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,530
the membrane was had a negative potential.

204
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,140
It's more negative on
the inside than outside,

205
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,700
but all of a sudden you've opened all
these sodium channels and a rush of sodium

206
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:28,870
goes in a rush of positively
charged molecules, go into the cell,

207
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,700
make the inside of the cell less
negative because you're adding a lot more

208
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,150
positive charge to it.
That event is called deep polarization.

209
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,020
And if you were standing on the
cell with your magic boots that were

210
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,480
electrically active,
somehow you would,

211
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,050
you would experience this dramatic
change in membrane potential.

212
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,370
The membrane becoming a lot
less negatively charged,

213
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,470
even positively charged.

214
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,130
And that's do totally to this rush of
sodium through these new channels that

215
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:01,560
have opened. Well, there's a
second set of channels called uh,

216
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,040
called potassium voltage gated
potassium channels that also opened,

217
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,230
but they're slower than
the sodium channels.

218
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,540
And when they open they allow a lot more
potassium to rush the other way because

219
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,730
remember potassium is high
insight on low outside.

220
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,940
So first you get a rush of
current going in one direction,

221
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,280
then you get a rush of
current going in the other.

222
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,200
And what that causes in terms of membrane
potential is a rapid depolarization

223
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,180
and then a rapid repolarization and
these channels eventually close again and

224
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:33,070
the membrane returns to its resting state.

225
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,670
If you don't understand all the
details of that, that's fine.

226
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:42,030
It's described in the book
and also described in other
membrane physiology books

227
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:43,510
that you could,
you could go to.

228
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,670
It's not important that you
understand all the details,

229
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,870
but do you have a sense for
what's happening is that
within this small region of

230
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:54,080
the cell membrane we on, there was
some kind of a small disturbance.

231
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,380
It opened all these voltage gated
channels caused rushes of current,

232
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,430
which changed the membrane potential.

233
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,990
And that is in this case what I've
described to you as an action potential,

234
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,880
a small change here causes a
large change at my local site.

235
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,520
And then I pass that on this way,
right?

236
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:17,300
Because I'm now standing at the site
where there's a huge disturbance in

237
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:21,620
membrane potential and that's going to
cause some current to flow a little bit

238
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,360
to flow downstream.

239
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,160
And that little bit that flows downstream
is going to cause the voltage gated

240
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:32,510
channels here to open an action
potential to be generated at this site.

241
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,870
And if you follow that line of thinking
than an initial disturbance over here

242
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,050
creates a massive membrane potential here,
which moves to here,

243
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:42,670
which moves to here,
which moves to here.

244
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,450
And that's an action potential
being transmitted down in neuron.

245
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,953
Right.

246
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,813
Makes Sense.

247
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,360
So that's what we talked about when
we're talking about the nervous system.

248
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:56,330
We were talking about information
flowing from dendrites,

249
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,430
dendrites that have, uh,
receptors for neurotransmitters,

250
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,660
those receptors for neurotransmitters
causing a small membrane disturbance,

251
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,710
which then gets converted
into an action potential.

252
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,890
And that action potential moves down
the Axon saying this direction to that

253
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:16,514
direction.

254
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,113
Okay,

255
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,210
why doesn't it move back?
Why does it only move in one direction?

256
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,810
What turns out is very
interesting physiology that
when, when these membrane, uh,

257
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,010
when these voltage gated
membrane channels get opened,

258
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,010
they become, uh, they become, uh,

259
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,850
incapable of being reactivated
for some period of time.

260
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,350
So the voltage gated sodium channels open,

261
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,970
they close, and then they can't be
opened again for some period of time,

262
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,380
just a few milliseconds,

263
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,860
but long enough for the action potential
to pass them out of their region.

264
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,620
Okay?

265
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,780
So that you don't get
currents that flow like,

266
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,910
or action potentials that flow like this.

267
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:04,930
They only flow in one direction
because these channels need to recover.

268
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,133
Okay.

269
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,600
But, but you understand now a little bit
more about why action potentials flowed

270
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:15,770
down, uh, down axons. And
when they reach these Termini,

271
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:19,850
the accident x, the Axon
Termini, what do they do? This,

272
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,370
this sudden change in membrane potential,

273
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:27,371
activates a new process and
that new process is release
of neurotransmitter from

274
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,424
the synapse.

275
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,860
That neurotransmitter then
activates another cell
generating an action potential,

276
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,170
sending it down its Axon and so on.

277
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,500
Okay.

278
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,730
And so in the nervous system,

279
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:42,810
messages pass from
neurotransmitter to action,

280
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:47,190
potential neurotransmitter
action, potential
neurotransmitter action potential.

281
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,940
And because there might be many
neurons impinging on one particular one

282
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:58,980
particular neuron that I'm interested in
and some are sending positive messages,

283
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:03,390
some are sending negative messages,
sending these little disturbances, right?

284
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,440
Whether this axon generates
an action potential or not,

285
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:12,441
depends on the sum total of the small
disturbances that is receiving at any one

286
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:17,070
time.
And so neurons can integrate information,

287
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,253
right?

288
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,770
And that information is acquired from
all the neurotransmitters that are

289
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:27,771
impinging on the dendrites that cause
small disturbances that may or may not add

290
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:30,660
up to the large disturbance,
which becomes an action potential.

291
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,850
You go on to study neuroscience or just
physiology, you'll learn more about this.

292
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,780
Uh, but, but I think you can probably
understand the basic concept.

293
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,880
So in the action potential on a neuron,

294
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:45,720
we were thinking about his cell that
had a receiving end that receives

295
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:47,190
neurotransmitter inputs,

296
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,400
that that causes membrane potentials to
change that somehow decides to initiate

297
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,640
an action potential.

298
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:57,480
And then action potential flows very
rapidly down this specialized process

299
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:01,530
called an Axon, reaching the axon
terminal [inaudible] and then, uh,

300
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,200
and then neurotransmitters
are released to the next sale.

301
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,800
Heart cells are the same
in that they contain these,

302
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,630
uh, they contain these
special voltage gated, um,

303
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,210
uh, membrane channels. These,

304
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,950
these voltage gated ion channels that
allow for an action potential to form.

305
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,390
They're capable of doing an action
potential because they have these voltage

306
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:31,390
gated sodium and potassium channels.

307
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:32,760
Okay.

308
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,260
So because of that,

309
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,750
okay,

310
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,750
heart muscle cells fall into the same
category as nervous of neurons and that

311
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:44,330
they're in the general category
called excitable cells.

312
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,290
They're excitable cells means they're
capable of making an action potential.

313
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,180
And to have an action potential,

314
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:54,830
they need to have these specialized
voltage gated ion channels in their

315
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,610
membranes.
So Cardiac myocytes have that.

316
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,330
They also have actin and Myosin,
their muscle cells,

317
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:03,710
and they're capable of contracting.

318
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,260
Okay.

319
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,340
They're capable of contracting,

320
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:09,310
meaning that this myocyte
here can shorten itself.

321
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:14,980
It can make itself shorter by contracting,
just like a muscle,

322
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,200
a whole muscle contracts. Um, and um,

323
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,130
so that's different than neurons,
right? So they have this capacity to,

324
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:24,700
to transmit action potentials.

325
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:27,610
They have this capacity to
contract now in muscle cells,

326
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:29,650
as we'll see in a few minutes,
those things are linked.

327
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,760
When a muscle cell experiences an
action potential, it doesn't do it.

328
00:20:33,761 --> 00:20:34,810
A nerve cell does,

329
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:38,470
which is passed that information along
to another cell via neurotransmitters.

330
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,180
Instead,
it contracts

331
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,050
experiences the action
potential and it contracts.

332
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,790
It also passes along the action potential,

333
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,810
but it doesn't do that through a
chemical synapse. Like in neurons.

334
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,460
It does it through an electrical synapse
and that these cells are very tightly

335
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,510
welded together.

336
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,860
Okay.

337
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,050
Remember we talked about
in nerve nervous system,

338
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,790
the two cells don't physically touch.

339
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,230
There's a space in between them that's
called the synapse and it's over this

340
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,070
synapse,
that neurotransmitter's act.

341
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,350
They're released from the
presynaptic cell and they,

342
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,740
and they create a change
in the post synaptic cell,

343
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:20,030
but cardiac myocytes are
basically welded together.

344
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,050
And in fact there are special junctions
called gap junctions in between them

345
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:26,510
that allow the easy flow of current.

346
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,910
And so if an action potential flows
through this myocyte from this end to the

347
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:34,450
other, it doesn't have to, it can, it,

348
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,910
it basically flows straight into the
next cell because they're directly

349
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:38,840
electrically coupled.

350
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,780
And so if an action potential arises
and comes from this direction, it, it,

351
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,930
it flows very quickly down this membrane.

352
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,190
It causes this cell to contract,
it flows right into the next cell,

353
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:56,330
causing this cell to contract
flows right into the next cell.

354
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,150
Okay.

355
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,480
Causing it to contract.
And so in cardiac muscle,

356
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,820
wherever the action potential starts,

357
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,990
it contracts first.

358
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,620
Then the action potential flows
into the neighboring cells.

359
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,770
They can tract neighboring cells,
they can traction.

360
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,640
So you can think about
the cardiac myocardium,

361
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,890
the sheet that I showed you last time,

362
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:24,480
the muscular walls of the heart as being
sort of a sheet of these cells that are

363
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:28,530
all connected to each other and if I
start an action potential in one space,

364
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,650
it's going to flow over the surface and
as it flows over the surface cells will

365
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:36,180
be contracting right behind it.
Right?

366
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,950
So electrical flow followed
immediately by contraction locally.

367
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,040
Does that make sense? Will you
could imagine that this, this,

368
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,630
now this because they're directly
electrically coupled signals can pass very

369
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:53,190
quickly over the surface of the heart.

370
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,920
That can pass very quickly
from one to another.

371
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:58,470
So I just need to start an
action potential in one place.

372
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,180
It'll be propagated everywhere, but
I might like to control that. Right?

373
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:07,500
Because I'd like to have the heartbeat
function in this controlled fashion we

374
00:23:07,501 --> 00:23:08,610
were talking about last time.

375
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:13,611
And so how does the heart solve this
problem of control of how this wave of

376
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:18,450
action potential moves over
the surface of the heart?

377
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,290
Yeah.

378
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:25,290
What does that through a specialized
group of pathways that are collectively

379
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:29,830
called the cardiac conduction system.
And this is a terrible diagram.

380
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,540
I'm going to show you the next one.

381
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,170
I'll show you a little bit better than
the next one so you'll see it, but,

382
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:38,530
but imagine too, so just look at
the surface here. This is the heart,

383
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:43,330
the left ventricle, the left atrium,
the right ventricle, the right atrium.

384
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,830
And there's this pathway.

385
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:49,831
There's the heart has something like a
nervous system and that this black region

386
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:54,500
here is a pathway that's
called the cardiac conduction
system and it consists of

387
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,940
several important points.

388
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,020
The first is called the
sinoatrial node or essay node,

389
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,340
and it's in the right atrium. The
sinoatrial node is in the right atrium.

390
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,870
Uh, the next point is the
atrial ventricular node,

391
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,160
which sits on a fibrous
substance called the Septum,

392
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:18,320
which separates the atria from the
ventricles. Okay. So, so you know,

393
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:20,300
the hardest kind of tilted to one side,
right?

394
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:23,600
It's not straight up and down so that
the atria are up here and the ventricles

395
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:26,750
are down here. There's a, there's
a, there's a Septum in between.

396
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,470
And that's where this Aav node sits
and it turns out that this Septum is

397
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,910
electrically insulating.

398
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,020
And so if a action potential,

399
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,990
a wave of action potential gets
generated up in the atrium,

400
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,020
it stops when it hits the center,
the Septum,

401
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:47,150
it doesn't move directly
to the ventricles.

402
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,890
So the muscles of the Atrium and the
muscles of the ventricle are electrically

403
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:52,724
isolated.

404
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,070
The only point of connection between
them is this specialized fiber pathway

405
00:24:58,071 --> 00:24:59,750
called the Ab node.

406
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:06,010
And that Aav node leads into a series
of branching fibers that are called the

407
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:11,360
Perkin g system per Kinji
fibers down here, Pur,

408
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:15,410
k, I, N, g, e, and um, and these,

409
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,240
these are fibers that very rapidly
conduct action potentials are electrical

410
00:25:20,241 --> 00:25:21,074
signals.

411
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:22,710
Okay?

412
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,430
Okay.

413
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,900
What I want you to see in this slide is
to notice that while all of these cells

414
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,100
are excitable, they have
the property of, of uh,

415
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:35,520
of generating and sustaining
an action potential.

416
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,770
They're excitable that
an action potential,

417
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:42,690
it can be generated in though the
shape of the action potential varies in

418
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:43,351
different cells.

419
00:25:43,351 --> 00:25:47,790
And that's all this diagram shows you
and you don't need to know the details,

420
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:52,320
but notice that some things are
different. For example, in the essay node,

421
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,440
it's a very slow rise of potential
followed by a slow fall and then a much

422
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:03,900
slower rise again compared to
ventricular muscle, for example,

423
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,000
that has a very rapid uptake,

424
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:10,770
a sustained depolarisation phase,

425
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,400
and then a rapid repolarization
back to baseline.

426
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,550
So there are differences in
the ways that these things, uh,

427
00:26:17,551 --> 00:26:20,220
undergo action potentials.
What do you think that's based on?

428
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,810
What's different about these cells?

429
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,280
Okay,

430
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,330
well, if the action potential is the
result of these voltage gated channels,

431
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:31,380
that must mean that ventricular muscle
cells have a different set of voltage

432
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,660
gated channels than essay node cells.

433
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:39,530
And they might have totally different
molecules that are doing the transport or

434
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:43,230
they might just have different numbers
of these molecules in their membranes.

435
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,000
But that's the difference in physiology.

436
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,180
What we're going to get to by the end
here is I'm going to try to convince you

437
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,070
that this,
this,

438
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,790
these changes that are occurring
in individual myocytes,

439
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:02,030
this rush of current that underlies the
action potential generation is what we

440
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:06,480
measure when we measure an EKG.

441
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,860
That what you're measuring is sort
of the sum of all of these electrical

442
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:18,231
potentials that are occurring as your
heartbeat changes in electrical pin

443
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,321
because your,

444
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:22,650
your heart cells are all experiencing
changes in electrical potential.

445
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,320
And because your body is basically a
salt solution which conducts electricity,

446
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,270
that you can measure those changes in
electrical potential happening in cells in

447
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:38,170
the heart by having electrodes just
on the surface of your skin. Okay?

448
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,640
And so the EKG arises from all of these
action potentials that are happening

449
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:48,060
within all of the thousands
of cells within your heart.

450
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,240
This diagram is a little
easier to understand. It
had more words than I liked,

451
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:54,960
so I blocked some of them out.
Uh,

452
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:57,840
but the other ones are things that
we've already talked about before.

453
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:02,280
The essay node is now familiar to you.
The sinoatrial node,

454
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,140
the node, this specialized
bundle of his which carries,

455
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,740
uh, which carries, um, uh, potential, uh,

456
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,840
action potentials very quickly from the
Ab node down to the Perkin g system and

457
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:20,190
the Perkin g system, which, uh, which
branches throughout the ventricular wall.

458
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,950
So how does is a heartbeat regulated?

459
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,720
It turns out that some of these cells are
capable of generating their own action

460
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:29,650
potentials.
They don't need to be distilled,

461
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,710
mutilated by some outside disturbance.

462
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,710
They generate an action
potential on their own. And the,

463
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:39,711
and the most famous of these is the
essay node up here and the essay node.

464
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:43,470
If you look at it, here's the
action potential in the essay node.

465
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,310
Deep polarization repolarization.
Now look what happens here. The, the,

466
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,250
the s the cell when most membranes
we've talked about are at resting state

467
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,570
resting state such that their membrane
potential stays constant until is

468
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,610
disturbed by something from outside.

469
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,770
This cell actually is change
slowly changing its membrane
potential on its own.

470
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,480
And it does that with a very,
uh,

471
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:13,730
with a very consistent frequency such
that at some point this slow rise of

472
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:16,380
action potential is going to,

473
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,410
this slow rise of membrane potential is
going to go high enough that it causes

474
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:24,990
its own disturbance and causes
its own action potential.

475
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,760
This is called a self propagating
action potential cells,

476
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:32,220
like cells of the SCA node,
they're capable of doing this,

477
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:36,660
have special properties of
their, um, of their ion channels.

478
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,900
But the end result is that the essay
node is just making potentials on a very

479
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:45,030
regular basis.
And if you measured,

480
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,060
if you put an electrode or if you shrunk
yourself and you had your magic boots

481
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:50,710
and you could stand on the essay node,

482
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,420
you would measure an action potential
about, uh, 60 times a minute.

483
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,890
Once a second. The essay node is
just creating an action potential.

484
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,830
Now when it creates that action potential,
what happens?

485
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,750
It disturbs the cells that are
around it, right? When the,

486
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,480
when the essay node creates
an action potential,

487
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,550
it causes a voltage disturbance in the
cells around it and they start making

488
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:20,020
action potentials. And starting
from this source in the essay node,

489
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,110
a wave of action potential starts to
move over the atrium over the atria.

490
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,330
First,
the right and then the left.

491
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,830
And what happens as this wave of action
potential spreads over the Atria,

492
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,390
what happens? What else do
muscle cells do? They contract.

493
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,140
And so a self propagating action potential
in the essay node induces an action

494
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:51,540
potential wave that spreads over
the Atria, the atria contract,

495
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,480
and they can tract,
if you watched them,

496
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:56,280
they can tract from the
region of the essay.

497
00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:58,740
Note out to the right
slightly before the left,

498
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,850
but it passes pretty fast over these
relatively small surface areas.

499
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,550
Now remember that there's a Septum in
between the atria and the ventricles.

500
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:08,810
So the, so the, the,

501
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,020
the this action potential wave would
stop and not go down to the ventricle

502
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,150
except for the Aav node.

503
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,770
When the action potential comes down,
these pathways,

504
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,310
these specialized pathways
from the essay note,

505
00:31:23,311 --> 00:31:27,480
it reaches the Ab node and the Ab node
has another special property in that when

506
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:31,230
it's stimulated to make an
action potential, it hesitates.

507
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,520
It hesitates for a fraction of a second.

508
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,010
And then it starts its own action
potential. So it receives the disturbance,

509
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,650
it waits, and then it makes
its own action potential.

510
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,060
And so what happens when you start
to put the picture together? Now,

511
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,880
essay node action, potential wave
of action potential of the Atria,

512
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:55,740
contraction of the Atria, ab
node gets the signal, waits,

513
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,020
generates an action potential,

514
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:01,530
and that action potential
quickly propagates down
through the bundle of his and

515
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:04,290
the Perkin g system.
And what do they do?

516
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,470
They carry this action potential
down into the ventricles.

517
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,920
They start action
potentials in the ventricle,

518
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,970
which then pass as a wave
over the ventricular muscle.

519
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,360
And after that wave of action potentials
comes contraction and ventricular

520
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:24,510
contraction.
Now why does the Ab node wait?

521
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:31,230
It weights in order to
control the heartbeat in the
way that we described last

522
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:36,231
time so that you want the atria to
contract and deliver their blood to the

523
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:39,980
ventricles before the
ventricle starts to contract.

524
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,910
You want the ventricle to wait until
it's filled up with blood from the atrial

525
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:46,640
contraction and then start to contract.

526
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,940
And so the AB node provides
that separation in time
of the atrial contractions

527
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:56,760
and the ventricle to contractions. Now,
how would you like the Ben Trick it?

528
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,020
Now remember when the ventricle
contracts, it's a big contraction, right?

529
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,540
And wants to force
blood in what direction?

530
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,750
Up Out of the top right.

531
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:09,650
That's where the pulmonary artery and the
aorta are there member from the model,

532
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:14,651
they're up at the top of the heart and
so you would like for this muscle to very

533
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:19,751
effectively eject blood out
of the ventricular chambers
and into these two large

534
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:23,120
vessels.
You all have roommates.

535
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,643
True.

536
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,410
I don't know if you all share
toothpaste with your roommates,

537
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:33,411
but if you do then some fraction of you
probably about half are irritated with

538
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:36,720
your roommates because they grab
the toothpaste tube at the top.

539
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,520
You might have brothers
and sisters who do this,

540
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:41,640
they grab it near the top and they squeeze
it cause they only care about getting

541
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:45,300
their little toothpaste out.
Right? And so you get this.

542
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,110
That's not an effective way
to get toothpaste out, right?

543
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:52,050
Squeezing it from the top because some
of the energy goes down into the bottom

544
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:55,500
and forces this toothpaste down here.
And the thing gets all out of shape.

545
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,960
What if you wanted to,

546
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:03,230
what if you wanted to get all of the
toothpaste out of the tube on one squeeze?

547
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:04,643
How would you do it?

548
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,130
Yeah,

549
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,520
you, you go from the bottom up, right?

550
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,550
You start squeezing from the bottom
and you'd squeeze it up. And,

551
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,980
and if you were good at this and
you could practice this at home,

552
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,350
you could get toothpaste and you
could see how much of the, how,

553
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,280
what fraction you can get out
with a single squeeze. And you,

554
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:24,610
I think you'd find your best is to start
from the bottom and squeeze sort of

555
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:28,210
systematically going up. And that's
what the heart does. And that's why the,

556
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:32,320
this Perkin g system is here to rapidly
conduct sig alerts from the essay,

557
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:36,670
know down to the base of the ventricle
and really start to contraction down here

558
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,830
so that the contraction
starts at the, uh, at the, uh,

559
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,570
at the bottom and squeezes up
and the blood is propelled out.

560
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,480
Okay.

561
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,480
So one of the roles of the Perkin g
system is to carry this potential into the

562
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:58,200
ventricles in a way that provides maximum
benefit from the contraction of the

563
00:34:58,201 --> 00:34:59,160
cells that result.

564
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,173
Okay.

565
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,040
Now a couple of other things that
are interesting to know here.

566
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:06,600
One is it the essay node is not,

567
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:10,380
the only is not the only collection of
cells in the heart that are capable of

568
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:12,780
generating their own action potentials.
Actually,

569
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,170
the Ab node is also capable of
generating the action potential,

570
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,660
and so are the cells
in the Perkin g system.

571
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,590
They all can generate action potentials,
but it turns out that the essay,

572
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:26,610
no does it the fastest.
It does it at about 60 beats per minute.

573
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,480
The AAV node does it.

574
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:32,310
It maybe 40 beats per minute
and the Perkin g fibers do it.

575
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,270
It even a lower rate than that.
So what does that mean?

576
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,180
It means if the essay node
is functioning properly,

577
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:43,740
the Ab node doesn't matter what it's
doing in terms of automatic generation of

578
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:48,570
potentials because that potential that
was first generated by the essay note

579
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,520
arrives at the Aav node before it
generates its own potential, right?

580
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:59,010
So who determines the heart rate?
The fastest beating, automatic sell.

581
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:01,530
And those are generally in the essay node.
What happens if,

582
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,680
if you have a disease in your
essay node and it stops functioning

583
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,120
than the Aav node will take over it
because it's no longer being stimulated by

584
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:16,290
the essay nodes, action potential
and the wave that results,

585
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,840
it will start beating,
but the heart will beat slower.

586
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,620
It will be at 40 beats per minute,
let's say.

587
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,960
And if you had some disease there and that
didn't work any more than the Perkins,

588
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:28,610
he says so. So the, the
heart has sort of a,

589
00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:33,611
a fail safe system built in such that
if this automatic beat generator fails,

590
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,070
there are inferior,

591
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:43,250
not such good quality but still capable
be generators further down the line.

592
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,600
Often those, uh, the Ab node itself,

593
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,020
you're not going to be able to function
the same way because you're not going to

594
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:55,380
get the same cardiac output because your
heart isn't beating fast enough, right?

595
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,220
And so, uh, there are ways
to treat that now and the,

596
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,780
and the most common way of treating
that is by putting a pacemaker into the

597
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:04,530
heart.

598
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,280
And the pacemaker is a device designed
by biomedical engineers about the size of

599
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:11,580
a hockey puck, but now even smaller
than that, that sits in your chest.

600
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,050
And it basically does what
the essay notice supposed
to do generates a potential

601
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,940
with a very regular period.

602
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,570
And there's a wire that goes from the,

603
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:24,720
this artificial device into your heart,

604
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,780
into the atrial muscle and sits there and
stimulates the tissue around the essay

605
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:35,250
node, uh, to replace its function,
right? So that's how a pacemaker works.

606
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,570
And this technology has evolved to the
point where there's sort of wireless, uh,

607
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:42,120
you can, you can send signals
in, you can change the rate,

608
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:45,240
you can reprogram the pacemaker without
having to take it out and actually

609
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:46,470
physically reprogram it.

610
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,770
So these are quite sophisticated
engineering devices now.

611
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,130
Um, I said something about action
potentials and ion currents. I'm,

612
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,020
I'm not gonna say anything
more about that. Um,

613
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,390
now I will say that in,

614
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,250
in neurons what is important
in a propagation of an
action potential is sodium

615
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,320
and potassium. But in muscle
cells, calcium is also a
much more important player.

616
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,090
And the reason that calcium is a much
more important player is as you will learn

617
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,620
if you study more physiology,
calcium is the most important,

618
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,100
Ian in terms of initiating contraction.

619
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,230
And so movement of calcium around
muscle cells is very important.

620
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,260
And this just shows, uh, shows an
action potential in for example,

621
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:38,190
of ventricular cell. It has
this rapid upstroke, this, uh,

622
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,500
this plateau in depolarization
in this recovery.

623
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,880
So this might be an action potential you'd
record from a ventricular muscle cell.

624
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,300
And if at the same time you were recording
this action potential and you were

625
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,130
also measuring contraction.

626
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:56,250
So think of this measurement as how
much contraction the cell has done.

627
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,750
At this point,
it's in its resting state.

628
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:03,400
And this points in his most contracted
state than the contraction follows the

629
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:07,840
action potential by about a
hundred milliseconds. Right?

630
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:12,370
So as the contraction happens,
as the action potential happens,

631
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,300
the contraction happens about a hundred,
150 milliseconds after that,

632
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,540
the maximum response. But these
things are coupled, right?

633
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,120
But they're not simultaneous.

634
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,660
Okay.

635
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,493
MMM.

636
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,250
Okay.

637
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,750
I think, um, I've, uh, covered
what's shown in this slide here.

638
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,570
This is just a simpler version
of what we've talked about.

639
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:38,830
Generation of the cysts of the signal in
the essay node movement to the Avm node,

640
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,430
hesitation and then movement of
this signal down the, um, the,

641
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:47,350
the Septum in between the left and the
right ventricle through the Perkin g

642
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:51,910
system and the heartbeat being
generated in this, uh, in this, uh,

643
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:55,300
in this regular anatomical pattern.

644
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:00,510
And that happens because these specialized
tissues are able to conduct signal's

645
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:03,820
very rapidly.
And you can see here in this slide,

646
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,870
this is how fast to signal the velocity
of an action potential being propagated

647
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:11,020
through different tissues.
It goes very rapidly through pathways,

648
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:12,040
like through the atrium,

649
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,820
through the bundle of hist and very
rapidly through the Perkin g system.

650
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:20,260
And that's why the signal gets transmitted
so rapidly from the Ab node down to

651
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:21,670
the base of the heart.

652
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:24,880
Yeah.

653
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,180
These,

654
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,740
these diagrams are in the powerpoints
which are posted and I just encourage you

655
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:32,860
to look at them together with reading
the chapter and hopefully that will help

656
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:36,100
you to understand this process,

657
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,280
which brings us back to thinking at the
end about what I've talked about several

658
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,120
times during the lecture.

659
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,500
That is that you can measure something
about the physiology of the heart by

660
00:40:47,501 --> 00:40:49,870
measuring all of this electrical activity.

661
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,470
And one way to measure it would be to put
electrodes directly into the heart and

662
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,730
physically put them right near the site
of action and measure exactly what's

663
00:41:00,731 --> 00:41:01,870
happening.
And that could be,

664
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:06,490
you could get a very detailed picture of
what's happening in the heart that way

665
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,720
and that can be done. Uh, but that's
uh, that's an invasive process.

666
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:14,770
Their cardiologists that do that,
they do this every day on people.

667
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,930
They put a catheter into your heart,

668
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:21,760
a catheter that goes through one of the
vessels and artery in your leg. It's,

669
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:25,630
it's uh,
it's pushed up into the heart.

670
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:28,990
And then there are recording electrodes
on the end and they can image measure

671
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,650
electrical activity directly in
the heart at different locations.

672
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,590
That's called cardiac catheterization
and cardiac electrophysiology.

673
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:40,760
And it's widely used to, uh, to
diagnose disease in the heart.

674
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:44,390
That's usually not the first thing you
do because that's an invasive procedure,

675
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:48,860
right? What is important about
EKG is that it's noninvasive.

676
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,790
You can do it without entering the
body by just measuring something that's

677
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:53,900
happening on the surface.

678
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:57,680
And you can do it very simply by placing
electrodes at different positions on

679
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,840
the body.
And you've all seen a,

680
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:03,980
a diagram like this that shows
a typical trace of an EKG.

681
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,980
It's measured in millivolts here.

682
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,020
It's a relatively small potential, right?
Because, because there's some distance,

683
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:12,471
you know,

684
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:16,130
the potentials that were
actually generated in the
heart are tens of millivolts,

685
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,610
but you're measuring at a distance away.
And so that signal has been attenuated.

686
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:23,510
You're only measuring fractions of
a millivolt. Um, at the surface,

687
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,780
but what you see is a little bump followed
by a followed by a delay followed by

688
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:35,801
a very big wave followed by a delay
followed by one and sometimes two smaller

689
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,980
waves. Right? This is the
signal that you see, um,

690
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,860
that you've seen on a,

691
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:47,390
on a screens by patient's
beds and countless movies
and television shows, right?

692
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,430
What does, what do these represent? Well,

693
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:51,320
they're called by letters of the alphabet.

694
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:55,610
This one's called the p
wave that represents the
activity caused during atrial

695
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:56,444
contraction.

696
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,590
So all of those currents
that are generated during
atrial contractions show up

697
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,770
as a p wave.
The QRS complex,

698
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,450
this very big signal here is
contraction of the ventricle.

699
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,650
And so what does this represent here?
The distance between the p wave and the,

700
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,690
and the QRS wave.

701
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,250
This represents the delay in signal
transmitting through the Ab node.

702
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,450
So if you're ab node was not functioning,
you'd expect that to shorten,

703
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,900
right?
That that lag would shorten.

704
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:32,110
And you'd also expect that your cardiac
performance would not be so good because

705
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:35,510
you don't have this delay. Then
the venture coal is, is, uh,

706
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,520
is contracting before it's fully filled
by the atrial contractions, right?

707
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,880
And you can diagnose that perhaps somebody
comes in, they're short of breath,

708
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:48,170
they're having trouble, uh, uh, they don't
know what it is. You measure their EKG,

709
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:49,940
you see that there,
this,

710
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:54,230
this is shortened and you know that
there's a problem with their cardiac

711
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,600
conduction system in
particular with the Ab node.

712
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,170
That's how physicians use these
tools. Uh, the t wave is re polar is,

713
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,780
is,
is repolarization of the ventricles.

714
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,020
So this is that this is the return of
all of this current back into the cell

715
00:44:11,601 --> 00:44:14,450
after this massive depolarization.
And the you wave,

716
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:18,710
which is only very rarely seen,
represents a relaxation of the muscles,

717
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:23,230
the papillary muscles inside, which
controls some of the valve function. Uh,

718
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,140
but, um, um,

719
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,590
we'll talk about this more in a
section. Uh, if you've had a full,

720
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,070
you'll know that they put many
electrodes on your, on your body.

721
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,330
They put a full electrocardiograph would
take a 12 electrodes and some of them

722
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:43,650
are placed on your limbs and some of
them are placed around your chest,

723
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,750
sort of wrapped around
your chest in a fashion.

724
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,570
And the reason for doing
that is that you can,

725
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,210
if you put several electrodes,

726
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,380
then you could look at the potential
difference that's generated by looking at

727
00:44:55,381 --> 00:45:00,030
any two of those electrodes.
And if I have one up here and one up here,

728
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,100
and I look at the voltage difference here,

729
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:05,640
it might not be the same as the voltage
difference measure between here and here.

730
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,380
And why is that?
Because your heart is oriented in space.

731
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:14,380
It's a three dimensional object and all
of these cells are at particular three

732
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:17,460
dimensional positions inside
this three dimensional object.

733
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,830
And as these currents happen,

734
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,950
they happen in a very
spatially oriented way.

735
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,530
And so the potential difference I
measure at a distance here and here for

736
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:29,970
example,
is different.

737
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,960
And it's sort of like looking at the
heart from different vantage points,

738
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:36,050
right?

739
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,050
Looking at the electrical activity of
the heart from different vantage points.

740
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:42,770
And so one of the things
that cardiologists have
learned how to do is how to

741
00:45:42,771 --> 00:45:47,420
look at potentials that are generated
from different spatial locations and

742
00:45:47,421 --> 00:45:51,770
correlate that with things
that are happening over the
complex geography of the

743
00:45:51,771 --> 00:45:54,780
heart. So why do you have
more than one electrode?

744
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:57,530
It's so you can look at the heart
from sort of different angles.

745
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:01,820
Okay. Okay. Questions?

746
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,500
Good.
See you on Thursday.
