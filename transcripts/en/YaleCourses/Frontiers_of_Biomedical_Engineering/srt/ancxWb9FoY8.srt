1
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:12,620
Uh,

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,680
so today we're going to continue talking
about the subject of biomechanics on,

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,130
uh,

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,130
on Tuesday we talked about their
properties of materials and,

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,330
uh, particularly alas disty and
viscosity and Bisco elasticy city.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,600
Uh, so you know, something about
how biological materials behave,

7
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:35,220
at least in terms of how they respond
in terms of deaf formations to, uh,

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,910
forces. And certainly there's
a lot more to learn about that.

9
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,460
But we covered the
basics on Tuesday today.

10
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:45,720
Want to talk about how
organisms move and how they,

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,620
um,

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,620
how they move through a physical world
where they have to obey the laws of

13
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:52,650
physics.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:57,650
And this is one important
role of biomechanics to
sort of understand if you're

15
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:01,830
thinking about human
biomechanics, how humans, uh,

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,760
perform as sort of mechanical machines.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,260
And so that's one important role
of biomechanics. How organisms,

18
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,700
not just humans, but all
kinds of organisms function
in an engineering sense.

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,150
And a big part of that is how they have,

20
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,240
how they survive and not only survive
but prosper in a world where they have to

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,010
obey the laws of physics.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,400
And it's interesting to try to understand
this because if we understood sort of

23
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:34,290
how the human machine works,
for example,

24
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:39,030
under normal conditions you can think
about how can I enhance performance in

25
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:43,110
certain, uh, in certain conditions.
And that, uh, of course is a,

26
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:48,111
is a big part of sort of
exercise physiology is
understanding how humans work

27
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,000
as,
as biomechanical machines.

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,780
So what we're going to talk about today
with the example I want to use as just

29
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,781
an example of this is motion in
biological systems in particular,

30
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,170
uh,

31
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,170
motion that humans can't do on their own
flying motions that we do all the time.

32
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,530
Uh,
walking and I,

33
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:13,531
I kind of motion that we do occasionally
some of us swimming and think about how

34
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:17,910
you would apply what you know about
physics to understanding those, uh,

35
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,110
those processes.

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,460
So why in general do organisms
have an ability to move?

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,340
Think about organisms like us
or organisms like bacteria,

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,890
all, it's a, it's a,

39
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:35,520
it's one of the essential
ingredients of life.

40
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,390
One of the ways that we recognize that
things are alive is because they're able

41
00:02:39,391 --> 00:02:43,380
to move from one spot to another.
So why is motion so important?

42
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,260
Why is motion important in the life
of a, of a microorganism, uh, a,

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,510
a, a protozoa or a bacteria that swimming
allowed to run in the ocean? Why?

44
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:01,360
Why should it move? Yeah.
Define nutrients to eat, right?

45
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,170
To find the nutrients are substrates
that are essential to its, to its growth.

46
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:08,410
And if you think about the movements that
you make during the course of the day,

47
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:13,330
how many of them are emoted by
motivated by your need for food, right?

48
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,950
So that you move in order to find things
that you can eat, right? And that's,

49
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,300
that's one reason why living organisms
move. Why else do they move? Justin?

50
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,790
To avoid danger,

51
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,570
to get out of harm's way if you're a
microorganism won't be dangerous to you,

52
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:32,680
is often chemicals. There
might be chemicals around
you that are toxic to you.

53
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,690
And so you'll swim to get away from
those chemicals, right? If your, um,

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,790
if you're a a,
a rabbit in the woods,

55
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,370
you might be running to get
away from a fox or I'll, I'll,

56
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,030
I'll wolf or something that's going
to eat you. Um, if you're a human,

57
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:50,590
you might run out of prospect street
to avoid getting hit by a bus. Right?

58
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,090
That's, that's a good use of motion,
uh, for self preservation. Right?

59
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,720
Um, what one, one more key reason why,

60
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,620
why a animals

61
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,053
move

62
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,590
essential for propagation of the species,
not just survival of the organism.

63
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:16,880
Okay.

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,750
Justin, to reproduce, they move
to reproduce, to get together. Uh,

65
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,790
and that might be some of the
reasons why you move every day. Uh,

66
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,940
but it's certainly in the, in
the animal world, in general,

67
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,620
Movement for finding mates
for reproduction is an
essential part of it. So,

68
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,320
so easy to see why movement is critical
for not just the life of a micro

69
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,600
organism, not just the life
of a multicellular organism,

70
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:45,100
but for survival of the
species as well. So, uh,

71
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,140
movement requires force and we're going
to think about forces in particular the

72
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:57,131
forces that an organism needs to
develop somehow or generate in order to

73
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:59,840
overcome forces that resist motion.

74
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,510
So just some elementary physics here,

75
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,990
which most of you probably
remember from high school physics,

76
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,030
is that if an object,
the object here is this green oval,

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,220
if it's going to be moving with a
constant speed, what does that mean?

78
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,280
Moving with a constant speed
means not accelerating.

79
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,570
So there has to be some force applied
in order to create the motion,

80
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,730
but the forces must balance, right?
So the overall forces acting are zero,

81
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,600
right?
For an object that's not accelerating.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,640
The sum of the forces is zero, right?
Because the acceleration is zero.

83
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,850
So if we think about this green object
moving to the right to the left,

84
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,313
to the

85
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,060
what does it for you to your left,
um,

86
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,750
then there must be a forest that's
creating the motion to the, to the left.

87
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,320
And that force is just big enough to
overcome the resistance to motion.

88
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,093
Okay?

89
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,450
That force is equally balanced
with whatever forest resist motion.

90
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,510
And of course the force that resists
motion is going to be different if you're

91
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:09,020
an organism that's trying to fly than
if you're an organism that's trying to

92
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:12,800
move along the ground than if you're
an organism is trying to swim, right?

93
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:16,490
So what we're going to think about today
are the forces that resist that motion

94
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:21,410
and how and how, um, how organisms
overcome that resistance.

95
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,350
So if we think about flight first,

96
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,380
then the situation is a
little bit more complicated.

97
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,870
What's the force that creates motion?
Well,

98
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,660
there's gotta be some propulsive
force that's moving us,

99
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,920
that's moving the organism
forward or to the left here.

100
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,980
There has to be some propulsive
force and that opposes the Mo,

101
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,650
the forest that resist that motion.
And that force is drag.

102
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,790
It's drag on the object
that's flying through the air.

103
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,810
And that drag comes from the interaction
of the surface of that object with the

104
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:57,200
air. It has to move air out of
the way in order to move ahead.

105
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,530
So in order to move with a constant speed,

106
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,140
there has to be a force that's
pushing it to the right.

107
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,890
And that force has to be exactly
opposite to the drag force,

108
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,750
which is resisting that movement.

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,250
And that drag force comes from
displacement of air, right?

110
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:16,640
The friction of air.
And you've experienced this drag force.

111
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,570
If you are driving in a car and you
stick your hand out the open window,

112
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,230
you can feel the force that's
pushing your arm backward.

113
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,570
In order for you to hold
your arms straight out,

114
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,830
you have to apply a force in the forward
direction that's directly opposed to

115
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,550
the forest that's from the air
that's pushing your arm back.

116
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,080
As the car goes faster,
takes more forced to move ahead,

117
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,560
right? Takes more forced
to hold it steady, right?

118
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,600
And so the amount of force that you need
to apply varies with the speed that you

119
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:52,510
go, right? The faster the car is going,

120
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:55,900
the more force you have to apply
to hold your arm out steady.

121
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,270
The faster a bird flies,

122
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,200
the more force it has to apply in order
to overcome this drag force that's

123
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:07,090
opposing, it's forward motion, right?
So that's the, that's the dynamics.

124
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:10,510
That's the force balance in
the horizontal direction.

125
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,920
Propulsive floors overcoming the
drag force, right? You know what?

126
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:18,160
It also depends on shape, right?
If you hold your arm out this way,

127
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,730
you hold your arm out this way you
feel a different force from the air.

128
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,721
All right,

129
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:27,721
so the shape or the profile of the
object that's in this field also matters,

130
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,440
right? Keep that in mind as
well. If you're going to fly,

131
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:35,560
there's another force you have to
overcome and that's the force of gravity.

132
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,990
That's the force of gravity that is
pulling you down towards the earth.

133
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,700
So to overcome that force,
that constant force,

134
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,870
there has to be a force that's moving up.
And if you're going to make,

135
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,030
if you're going to
maintain a constant height,

136
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,570
yeah,

137
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,260
right? A zero velocity and down with was
what you'd need to maintain. Thanks Nate.

138
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,460
I constant height. Then you'd have to
have a force that's lifting you up.

139
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:06,930
That's exactly opposite to the force of
gravity, right? So if you're going to fly,

140
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:10,170
you have to, you have to have
that upward force as well.

141
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,420
So what kinds of objects can fly?
Planes can fly.

142
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,450
This is a picture of an old
fashioned plane. Maybe you've,

143
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,470
maybe you've written on a plane that
has a propeller on it, maybe not,

144
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,710
but it's a little bit easier to describe,
uh,

145
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,780
this way that the forward force that
overcomes drag is provide provided by a

146
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:34,860
propeller that spins and creates
a force in the forward direction.

147
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,650
So in order to move at a
constant velocity, depending
on what that velocity is,

148
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,690
you have to overcome a certain amount of
drag and the propeller spins at a speed

149
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:49,360
that will provide that forced
to move forward. All right,

150
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:52,600
so that seems if not a
complete description,

151
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:56,170
that seems like a pretty adequate
description of how you move ahead, right?

152
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,230
But how do you get off the ground
and maintain off the ground?

153
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,760
It maintain your height off the ground.
In order to do that,

154
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:07,540
you have to overcome this constant force
of gravity, which is pulling you back.

155
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,100
That's the main problem with flight,

156
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,370
overcoming the force of gravity and in
airplanes that's done through design of

157
00:10:15,371 --> 00:10:20,371
wings and a typical sort of air
foil or wing design is shown here.

158
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,460
What happens is it's
using this flow of air,

159
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:29,080
this constant flow of air over the
body, over the wings. For example,

160
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,100
by changing the shape so that there's
more surface area on top of the wing than

161
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:34,000
there is on the bottom.

162
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:39,130
You change the relative velocities that
air can move over the wing on over the

163
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:41,200
top of the wing versus over
the bottom of the wing,

164
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,410
you create a flow separation or a
disturbance here where the pressure drops

165
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,690
relative to the pressure
and the ambient air,

166
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,170
the pressure drops because of
this turbulent air flow pattern.

167
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,830
If there's less pressure
here than there is down here,

168
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,870
you get a force acting up.
Pressure is force per area, right?

169
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,200
So if there's a difference in
pressures from top to bottom,

170
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,960
more pressure on the bottom
and there isn't a top,

171
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:15,961
you'll have a lift force going up and so
you can fly if that lift force is large

172
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:21,730
enough to overcome or at least
balance the force of gravity. Right?

173
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,840
Does that make sense?

174
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,980
And you can imagine that that
lift forest varies with speed,

175
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:28,630
that you're moving through the air.
For example,

176
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:32,080
there's a critical speed you have to
reach before you get enough lift to take

177
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:36,400
off. And that I lift force
depends on the design of the, uh,

178
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:41,430
the exact shape of the wings or the air
foil certainly depends on their size,

179
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,010
right?
If I've got bigger wings and pressures,

180
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:49,810
what's moving me force is
pressure per area. Bigger wings,

181
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,510
more force up. All right, so the,

182
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:56,200
the basic physics here is
fairly straight forward.

183
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,830
Although implementing this,
you know, it took some time.

184
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,070
People have been trying to fly as long
as there were people watching birds.

185
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,910
Right?

186
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,860
But it took a while for us to figure out
how to implement this and to implement

187
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,510
it as reliably as we can.
Now.

188
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,560
So how do birds do this?
How do birds fly? Well,

189
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,520
the birds don't have stationary
wings typically. Right?

190
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,710
Although their wings can be stationary.

191
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:26,830
If you watch a hawk or
an eagle or a large bird,

192
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,570
they glide for a lot of their
flight once they're airborne,

193
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,670
right? There's a few, if you
watch, my office overlooks
the Grove Street cemetery.

194
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:39,640
There's some hawks that live in the,
in the cemetery.

195
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,600
Must be a good place for
hawks. Um, but uh, they,

196
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:46,420
they take off and then they
glide for long periods.

197
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:49,240
They can circle and there's very
little motion of their wings.

198
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,590
They're basically doing,

199
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,830
they're taking advantage of the forward
thrust that they've created and they're

200
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:59,320
coasting,
but their wings are doing this.

201
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,860
So they're holding their wings in a
position that creates an air foil,

202
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:05,260
creates the pressure drop to move them up,

203
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,990
but to take off or to create this
forward thrust, they move their wings,

204
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,400
right?
They don't have propellers,

205
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,110
so they use their wings to create thrust
by sort of pushing them against the air

206
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,640
backwards, right? Creating a forward
thrust, which overcomes the drag.

207
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,830
Yet their wings are shaped like an
air foil. So they create thrust,

208
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,670
they bring them back into the air
foil position, they get lift, right?

209
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:34,240
So it's more complicated than what I'm
describing, but you can see, you know,

210
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:37,810
beating your wings like this,
creating thrust in one direction,

211
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,410
holding them in a position where you
create lift and then varying between those

212
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:45,940
two things. You can both move forward
and supply the lift you need to overcome.

213
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:49,540
The force of gravity.
If you watch different kinds of birds,

214
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,060
you'll see that they execute
different kinds of patterns.

215
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,560
And they do that because
they're different, right?

216
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,710
Some birds are smaller than
others, some are, some are bigger,

217
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,710
some have different shaped wings,
different shaped bodies.

218
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,950
And so their particular motion is that
adapted to the physics of their body and

219
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:14,260
their need to move it through the air.
So,

220
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,220
um, I talked a bit about wing size. Right?

221
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:22,150
Wing size is one thing that you could
use in an airplane, for example,

222
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:26,680
bigger wings, more upward
lift, bigger wings of course,

223
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:30,010
heavier. So it's, if it's heavier,

224
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:32,410
it's going to require a bigger engine,
right?

225
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,350
So that you can get the thrust
needed to move at a certain velocity.

226
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,780
But if you look at birds have different
sizes or flying animals of any kind of

227
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:41,561
different sizes,

228
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,740
you'll notice that there's a correlation
between the size of the winning and the

229
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,840
size of the animal.
The bigger the bird,

230
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:50,770
typically the bigger the wings
for just that reason. Bigger,

231
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,550
heavier needs more lift in
order to get up into the air.

232
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,020
Uh,

233
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,020
you also notice other kinds of adaptions
that birds that have big wings,

234
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:06,260
big bodies also tend to have strong legs,
right?

235
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,970
Little birds,
isn't it?

236
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:10,880
Amazing little birds you see
perched on a tree limb or something.

237
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:15,590
Very small legs, right? Big Birds, hawks,

238
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,390
falcons, eagles, strong legs. Why
would a big bird needs strong legs?

239
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,840
Sorry. Without, they use,

240
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,620
they actually pick up pray and
things. And so they use them for, uh,

241
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,410
for acquiring food. That's, that's, that's
a good reason. Yeah. Why, why for flow?

242
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,930
Do they need them for flight? Yeah,
they need to be able to lift off.

243
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,130
And so to get that initial,

244
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,950
maybe they get some boost from
their legs in the lift off phase,

245
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:46,340
some forward thrust and some
upward lift just from the,

246
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,860
just from the muscular
structure of their legs.

247
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,100
And they're not always in flight,
right?

248
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:57,080
They need to land sometimes and
they land on their legs typically.

249
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,740
Right. And if you're going to bring
a big object down to the ground,

250
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,510
there's going to be some
force involved with that.

251
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:07,460
You need large legs in order
to survive that force. Right.

252
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,610
And so just giving you some examples of
how the physical structure of animals is

253
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,160
adapted to their function.

254
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,030
And a lot of it is their function
as mechanical objects, right?

255
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,610
It's a familiar concept,
but one can,

256
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,700
one can sort of break it
apart and interesting,

257
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:29,810
kind of a bird is shown here.
A hummingbird,

258
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,130
you ever watched a hummingbird?
Hummingbirds do something
that's really amazing.

259
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:34,964
They hover,

260
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,660
which means they can stay up in the
air without having any forward thrust.

261
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,590
I mean when I was talking
about the airplane example
or even the bird example I

262
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:50,591
was talking about using the forward motion
supplied by thrust in order to create

263
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:55,100
the pressure drop that brings you up.
But if you stop moving forward,

264
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,520
that pressure drop disappears.
You go down, right?

265
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,060
So forward motion is required for an
airplane to stay up in the air for a bird.

266
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:09,170
Most birds to stay up in
the air, hummingbirds can
hover, which is a remarkable,

267
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,850
uh,
physical achievement.

268
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,080
And they do that because they can actually
turn their wings in both directions.

269
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:16,400
They can turn them upside down.

270
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:20,510
And that's shown in this diagram here
that they can make the wing go backward

271
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:24,730
and forward and turn it right side up
and upside down so they can create a

272
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:29,731
motion where they're creating no net
forward thrust or backward thrust,

273
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,470
but always creating lift because
they're changing the position or the

274
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:38,840
orientation of their wings.

275
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,950
And a more complicated than that.
If you're interested,

276
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,810
I'm sure you can find information on it,

277
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,680
but again they can do this because they
have specially designed wings that can

278
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:51,720
flip over during their motion.

279
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,410
They have the muscles that allow them
to make this kind of emotion and they're

280
00:17:55,411 --> 00:18:00,411
fairly small so they don't need much lift
force in order to keep them a loft to

281
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,670
overcome the problem of gravity.

282
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,740
So hummingbirds can hover because they
generate lift in both the upstroke and

283
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:10,590
the downstroke.
So as long as their wings are in motion,

284
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,490
they're constantly creating lift
and so they stay off the ground.

285
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,310
Okay.
That's something about a flight,

286
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,500
which is interesting and I think maybe
the simplest one to to think about cause

287
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:28,040
one can break down the forces
that are involved fairly easily.

288
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,800
Let's think about walking
and running or a mode.

289
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:38,450
Nobody flew here this morning.
You've got here to class somehow.

290
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,530
How did you get here? Um,
most of you probably walked.

291
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,270
Maybe some of you ran. Uh, but uh,
most of you probably walked. Why?

292
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,550
Of all the,
of all the choices that you had,

293
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:54,551
why did you walk instead of slithering
on the ground or crawling or running?

294
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,150
Why did, why did you walk?
Why did you make that choice?

295
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,310
You might not even thought about it.
You probably didn't get to the room,

296
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,290
to the door of your room and say,
should I crawl, slither, run or walk?

297
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:14,610
You probably just started walking.
Why was that your first choice,

298
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,703
Justin?

299
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,040
It comes naturally.

300
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:23,600
And why do you think that's your natural
motion for moving along the surface of

301
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:28,280
the earth? Why is that your
natural, your natural choice?

302
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,250
Why have you decided even
without thinking about it,

303
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,650
that that's your normal mode of motion?

304
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,403
Yeah,

305
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,250
it's the easiest. It's
the least resistance. It's
the most efficient, right?

306
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,700
It's the most efficient way to
move from one place to another.

307
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,420
And it's efficiency. That's important.
Now, how would you define efficiency here?

308
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,320
How much energy did you need to
expand to get from your room to here?

309
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,850
And how can you get from your room to
hear minimizing the amount of energy that

310
00:19:57,851 --> 00:20:01,870
you spend? That's the, that's the
subconscious decision that you make.

311
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:04,050
And the answer is that you walk,
right?

312
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,690
And so what force are you
overcoming when you're walking here?

313
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,580
What's the force that opposes your motion?
You know,

314
00:20:12,581 --> 00:20:15,850
the forest to create your motion is the
movement of the muscles of your leg and

315
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:18,670
your skeleton, right? So like
rocking back and forth like this.

316
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:22,300
I'm using my muscles to
create motion side to side.

317
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,210
And you use a similar
strategy when you walk.

318
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,080
But what force am I
overcoming when I do this?

319
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,660
Or what force did you have to
overcome in order to get here?

320
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,760
While you're not there is a drag
force cause you're moving through air.

321
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:41,380
So just like, just
like, um, a flying bird,

322
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,290
you're experiencing drag
from the atmosphere,

323
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:49,291
but it turns out that that's not as
large as the frictional of your body

324
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:53,220
touching the ground. Right?
And so when you walked,

325
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,240
you probably didn't walk like with your
feet on the ground because that would

326
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:00,430
take a lot of energy, you know, try it,

327
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:03,280
try walking back home with your
feet constantly on the ground.

328
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,460
That takes a lot more
energy than picking them up.

329
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,720
But you pay a price for picking them up,
right?

330
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:14,200
And then now you're introducing
another problem, actually two problems.

331
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,560
And that when you pick up a foot,
you have to overcome gravity.

332
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,150
So you're using some of your motion to
go in the wrong direction instead of

333
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:26,380
moving towards class, you're moving
up, right? You're picking your leg up,

334
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,280
which is not getting you any
closer to where you want to be,

335
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,710
but you pick it up in order to release
it from the frictional forces that are,

336
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,650
um, that are holding it back. Right.

337
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,380
The frictional forces that resist motion.

338
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,920
So how do you walk then?

339
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,680
You don't walk with your feet
constantly in contact with the ground.

340
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,840
Although that would be easier in a sense,

341
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,360
because if your feet
are both on the ground,

342
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,770
balance is not so hard once you
lift the foot off the ground.

343
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:59,140
The other problem that
introduces is balance.

344
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,920
And it's much harder for me
to stay stationary on one
leg than it is on two legs

345
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,730
because gravity's acting on my body
and trying to pull me back down again.

346
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,730
So an additional problem arises with this
lifting up of one foot and that is the

347
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:18,310
problem of balance.
And how do we solve that?

348
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:21,130
We solved that by controlling our muscles,

349
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,630
the muscles that move us from side
to side maybe, but that takes energy.

350
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,220
So I want to move forward.
And the easiest way is to walk.

351
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,280
And you probably didn't think about
it when you were walking here today,

352
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,510
but you're doing a fairly
complicated set of operations, right?

353
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:42,160
You're lifting one foot off the ground
to avoid gravity and you're letting it

354
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:46,960
swing forward. The heel of your
forward foot hits the ground,

355
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,000
your foot then moves the
toe of your back foot,

356
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:55,720
leaves the ground swings forward,
heel strike,

357
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,250
toe lift, swing, heel strike, toe lift,

358
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:03,130
swing one foot's always on
the ground when you walk,

359
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,620
you don't think about it,

360
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,000
but it's a fairly complicated motion
that you can do automatically now.

361
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:13,930
But if you do think about it,
when you're walking to your next class,

362
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,650
you'll notice that one foot is always on
the ground and that helps you solve the

363
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:22,480
problem of balance. All right? That
helps you solve the problem of balance.

364
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,350
What else happens when you're,
uh, when you're doing this motion,

365
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,690
and you might not notice it at all,

366
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,900
but your pelvis is actually undergoing
a fairly complicated set of movements.

367
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,530
I'm going to exaggerate it
so you can't laugh, right?

368
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,590
But if you watch somebody else walk or
you put your hands on your pelvic bone,

369
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:46,640
the pelvic bone is,

370
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:51,380
this is this sort of girdle that
both of your hips are connected too,

371
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,970
right? You've seen it on a
skeleton and when I lift up my leg,

372
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,460
then I'm tilting my pelvis up,
right?

373
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:01,130
I'm tilting this site up in order
to get the leg off the ground.

374
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,890
I'm also bending my knee a little bit
to make my leg shorter and I'm moving my

375
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:09,770
foot in order to allow
when the toe lifts off,

376
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:11,720
allow it to swing without
hitting the ground.

377
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,310
You don't want to hit the
ground because of friction.

378
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,660
That would be a waste of energy.

379
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:21,230
You want to lift it just enough so that
you clear the ground and you do that by

380
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:26,390
tilting your pelvis up and by bending
your knee a little and manipulating your

381
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:31,040
foot, you let that leg
swing forward, the toe hits,

382
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,610
and now you're doing something else with
your pelvis and that you're going like

383
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:37,640
this, right? You're not only
lifting up to get it off the ground.

384
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:40,610
And then up on the other side,
you're also twisting it like this.

385
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,650
So your pelvis twists your pelvis
tilt and it actually undergoes,

386
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,860
if you could put a sort of,
I'm exaggerating it,

387
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,380
maybe not as much as others could,

388
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:56,090
but I'm trying to exaggerate that your
hips sort of go through a figure eight

389
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,860
kind of motion as you're moving forward.

390
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:02,570
It's a fairly complicated motion that
you do without even thinking about it

391
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:06,590
because you've done a lot of walking
and you've learned how to do it very

392
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:10,600
efficiently. All right,
this is makes sense.

393
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,980
So if you look at the
efficiency of walking,

394
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,590
um,
you are creating forward motion.

395
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:25,120
You're creating it in
opposition to friction.

396
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,620
You're doing it by lifting a foot off
the ground, freeing it from friction,

397
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:33,310
swinging it forward. The cost is
you had spent some energy going up,

398
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,730
you spend some energy going up,

399
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,100
and then you recover that
energy when you come back down.

400
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,790
What's energy called that
you store as you move up?

401
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:45,950
Potential energy.

402
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:50,210
And so one of the other things that
happens if you notice somebody walking,

403
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,700
and it's hard to notice if you just see
me walking like this, maybe you can,

404
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:59,360
but my head is actually moving up and
down when I walk because my center of

405
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:04,040
gravity is rising and falling as I pick
my leg off the ground and let it swing.

406
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,730
And you can't see that so easily
when you're watching a whole,

407
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,620
but have you ever seen somebody walk
with a fence in front of them and you see

408
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,200
their head and it moves
up and down a little bit?

409
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,640
So there's an entire conversion there
between potential energy when I'm up and

410
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,800
kinetic energy when I'm down,
right?

411
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:23,450
So I can exaggerate it that
way too if I walk funny. Um,

412
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:28,760
that you're putting some of your
energy into potential energy,

413
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,890
creating potential
energy with your muscles,

414
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,140
and then recovering that
when you come back down.

415
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,970
But the more of that you have to do,
the more energy it takes.

416
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,420
And so these moat movements of
the pelvis I mentioned before,

417
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,990
sort of smooth out this up and down
movement so you're not wasting so much

418
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:50,730
energy going up and down.
You're mainly going forward,

419
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,683
right?

420
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,870
So if you walked,

421
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,700
did anybody walk here with somebody
walk by yourself or did you walk him?

422
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Anybody walking in a pair.

423
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,370
Okay.

424
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:07,490
Nobody wants to admit they
walked with him. Well,

425
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,320
have you ever walked with somebody else?

426
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,570
Did you ever notice that sometimes
when you're walking with somebody else,

427
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,740
they want to go faster than you or
they want to go slower than you.

428
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,730
Okay.

429
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,900
Why is that? Why do some people
walk more slowly than others?

430
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,230
Okay.

431
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,480
Why do some people walk
more quickly than others?

432
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,210
Their legs are longer,
so their bodies are shaped differently.

433
00:27:37,211 --> 00:27:41,530
So they've figured out how to make
their walking efficient for them.

434
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,000
Right.

435
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,720
And that means they figured out how to
do this motion with their body and the

436
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:48,250
most efficient way.
Now,

437
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:53,020
why would longer legs make it more
efficient to move faster? Well,

438
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,100
cause when you swing your leg you get
a bigger bang for the buck, right?

439
00:27:57,101 --> 00:28:00,760
You get farther with one stride.
That's part of it.

440
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,590
The other part is that your leg,
when it's in this swing motion,

441
00:28:05,591 --> 00:28:10,000
behaves like another object. You've
probably studied in physics. The pendulum.

442
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:11,910
Okay.

443
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,040
Right.
You've seen pendulums that swing.

444
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:19,860
You noticed that the timing of pendulums.
Anybody have a metronome?

445
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:21,980
Yeah.

446
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,750
Metronomes are pendulums like that too,
that have an adjustable weight.

447
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,420
Right? If you move the
weight one way or the other,

448
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:34,421
then the pendulum starts swinging at a
different frequency and depending on the

449
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,210
length and weight of
your leg as a pendulum,

450
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,300
it has a natural frequency
at which it wants to swing

451
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,290
as a natural frequency at
which it wants to swing.

452
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,980
If I want to walk with
the least energy possible,

453
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,870
I want to just let my leg swing. I don't
want to put any energy into it, right?

454
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,920
I'll put some energy into lifting it
off the ground, but once I lifted off,

455
00:28:57,921 --> 00:29:02,150
it's back here. What if I can just
let it go and it swings forward?

456
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,740
That's the most efficient motion
and that motion would have a timing.

457
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:10,250
That depends on the size of your body
and the length of your leg and the weight

458
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:13,580
of your leg and all the
other characteristics that
are particular to you.

459
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,570
If I want to walk slower
than my natural state,

460
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,410
I have to slow something down,
right?

461
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:24,830
So my leg might swing forward
fast with a certain distance.

462
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,730
In order for me to move slower,
I have to actually slow down my leg.

463
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,990
I have to slow down the swing forward.
That takes energy.

464
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,480
It takes muscles to slow down.

465
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,650
And so sometimes that you feel like if
you're walking more slowly than you want

466
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:44,470
to, that it's actually taking more
energy than it should. Likewise,

467
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:46,660
if you have to walk faster
than your normal pace,

468
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,190
it will seem like and will be that you're
using more energy than you would like

469
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:52,024
to.

470
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,343
Yeah,

471
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:00,750
so walking has an efficiency. You
can change your speed. Of course.

472
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:05,160
You've learned how to do that.
But if you plot on a graph like this one,

473
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:10,161
this is a graph for a typical
person who's walking on a flat,

474
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,780
uh,
outdoor surface.

475
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,850
And what it shows is the Blue Line there
shows the efficiency or how much energy

476
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:20,310
you use as a function of speed of walking,

477
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,030
how much energy uses a function of speed,
right?

478
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,710
So there's a flat part at the beginning,

479
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,250
not too much different if I'm
below two miles an hour walking,

480
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,520
it takes about the same amount of energy,
right?

481
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,910
It takes about the same amount of
energy, but as, but as speed goes up,

482
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:38,490
the energy consumption goes up.
Do you have to walk faster,

483
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:40,020
faster than your natural stride?

484
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,400
And so you're using more energy maybe
to swing your leg forward faster so that

485
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:47,850
you can walk. You might even,
if you start walking fast,

486
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,100
try this on your way to the next class or,
or tried to rob,

487
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,790
walk with somebody and watch
them as you walk faster,

488
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,640
your heads going up and down
more, right? You're, you're,

489
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,200
you're taking advantage of this potential
kinetic transition to get more speed.

490
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,370
But the cost of that is that you're
moving your body up and down more.

491
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,560
And so that is less efficient cause
movement up and down. It's wasted,

492
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,320
right? At a certain point, you see the
Blue Line goes up and up and up and,

493
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:21,300
and it's, it's exponential. If
you, it starts to look exponential.

494
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,690
If you continue to try to
walk faster and faster,

495
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,390
it's going to eventually start
to become really uncomfortable.

496
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,630
Yeah.

497
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,280
And you're naturally going to want to
switch to a different form of motion and

498
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:38,110
that's running. Now. You can avoid that,

499
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,870
right? And you could try this yourself,
try walking faster and faster and faster.

500
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:47,440
And don't let yourself run.
Just walk faster and faster.

501
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:50,980
And pretty soon you're doing that crazy
kind of walk that Olympic fast walkers

502
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:55,270
do. Right. That feels very unnatural. Uh,

503
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,330
you might get a lot of speed, but it
feels very unnatural. I'm not, you know,

504
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:05,140
you're kind of, can anybody
do it? You've seen it. Uh,

505
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,390
but you,
you're moving up and down a lot.

506
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,020
Your pelvis is doing a
very unusual pattern,

507
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,310
not the subtle movements that
it does during a normal walking,

508
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:19,210
but it's moving a lot more and that's
what you notice. The fast walkers,

509
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:23,950
they're moving from side to side. Their
pelvis is really moving a lot, right?

510
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:29,790
It becomes quite inefficient
because you're wasting
energy and in fact your body

511
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:33,430
is telling you to make the
transition from walking into running.

512
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,370
If I want to move this at this speed,

513
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,470
it's more efficient for me to run and
that's what this graph shows you as well.

514
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,610
If you extended the walking line up a
little bit at a speed of about five miles

515
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:47,270
per hour, running becomes
more efficient than walking

516
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,310
and you can feel that transition.
If you try to walk fast,

517
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:58,010
there will become a point at about five
miles per hour when you're going to want

518
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:02,750
to start to run because that will feel
like a more efficient way for your body

519
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:06,260
to move. Now, what is it that
causes that mechanically,

520
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:10,580
that transition to take place? What's
different about running than walking?

521
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,451
Well,

522
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:15,260
one of the things that's different is
that you don't always have one foot on the

523
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:16,190
ground when you're running

524
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,270
back to you watch somebody
run or you run yourself.

525
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,590
You'll know that for a lot
of the time you're only,

526
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,840
you're not no foot's on the ground.

527
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,310
There's no time that both feet are
on the ground, right? One foot hits,

528
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:33,530
you sort of bounce off of it,
you bounce off the other one,

529
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:37,280
you bounce off the other one,
you're sort of hopping off one foot,

530
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,720
tried to do that slow. It's
really hard. Why is that hard?

531
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,370
Because it's hard to balance on one foot.
It's impossible to balance on no feet,

532
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,030
right when you are standing still,

533
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,740
but as your speed increases,
you create, you create inertia,

534
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,630
you create forward motion and that
forward motion or inertia stabilizes your

535
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:03,980
body. It makes balance
less of an issue, right?

536
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:06,170
If you're moving forward
at five miles an hour,

537
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,910
you're not worried about sideways motion
so much because you have this forward

538
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:15,740
motion which is going to continue to carry
you forward and balance isn't so much

539
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:19,610
of a problem anymore and
so you can sacrifice.

540
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,960
Having both feet on the ground.

541
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,160
You can even sacrifice having any foot
on the ground for some period and you'll

542
00:34:25,161 --> 00:34:28,790
just fly
and you'll fly forward.

543
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,410
No balance is required so you're
not spending any energy on balance.

544
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,080
Alright, so running is sort of like flight
in a way only. It's very short flight.

545
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,880
It's like flying and hopping,
hopping on one foot.

546
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,780
Also at that speed when you're
moving at five miles an hour,

547
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:51,830
if you see somebody that's
running particularly an
experienced runner and what

548
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,860
makes experienced runners better
than inexperienced runners,

549
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,010
they've become more efficient at doing
this running motion. And so they can,

550
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,490
they can, they can move it
fast, speeds very efficiently.

551
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,340
And one of the things you'll
notice in very efficient,

552
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:08,900
fast runners are good runners,

553
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,330
is that there's very little up
and down motion of their head.

554
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,370
Even though they're hopping and flying,
they're not moving up and down very much.

555
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,380
They've learned how to do this without
moving very much in the gravitational

556
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:23,540
field, keeping their center
of gravity about the same,

557
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,220
which allows them to convert all of
their energy into forward motion.

558
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,973
Just makes sense.

559
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,840
There's another peculiar thing on this
slide and it's the black line cycling,

560
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,480
and if I told you that you had to move
this afternoon at 12 miles per hour to

561
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:55,911
get from here to somewhere else in
new haven in a couple of minutes,

562
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,200
most of you,
if you had the choice,

563
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:02,130
would choose to use a bicycle to do
that rather than walking and running,

564
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,120
particularly in new, you had to move
that fast, you'd pick a bicycle,

565
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,280
and so it won't be surprising for you to
see that cycling is much more efficient

566
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:14,910
at higher speeds than either
walking or running, right?

567
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,560
So if I want to move 12 miles an hour,

568
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,640
cycling is much more efficient than
running walking's not even shown here

569
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:25,140
because it would be so much less
efficient. On the other hand,

570
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,770
it doesn't make obvious
sense, right? Because you are,

571
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,940
you're going to agree to move fast,
not with your,

572
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,380
not only with your body,
but with another thing as well,

573
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,800
which adds weight, right? Even even a,

574
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:45,690
even a very lightweight
bicycle weighs 30 pounds.

575
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,570
So you're adding 30 pounds to your weight,

576
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,380
but you would gladly do that if you knew
you had to move fast because you know

577
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:53,430
it's going to be more efficient.

578
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:57,640
Why is cycling so much more
efficient than running? Well,

579
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,230
one for one reason is when you're cycling,
you're sort of in a constant profile.

580
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:04,680
You're moving your legs, but your center
of gravity stays relatively uniform.

581
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,970
Your center of gravity stays relatively
uniform, very little up and down.

582
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,350
So all of your motion,

583
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,190
all of your energy that's created by your
legs is converted into forward motion.

584
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,580
The other thing you know is
that now you have a mechanical,

585
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,650
you have a machine that's going to convert
the energy of your legs efficiently

586
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:24,210
into motion of a wheel.

587
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,060
And that wheel overcomes friction very
efficiently by actually using friction.

588
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:35,390
It's friction between the wheel and the
ground that keeps the bicycle stable and

589
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,990
allows it to generate high speeds.
Alright?

590
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:43,890
So this machine allows you to overcome
the problems of friction and gravity,

591
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,560
uh, very, uh, very smoothly.

592
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,160
And so cycling is a much
more efficient activity.

593
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:53,580
A Lot's been written about
the biomechanics of cycling.

594
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:58,060
If you're interested in learning
more about that? Well, I want to, uh,

595
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,970
talk about, uh, swimming. Another
mode that we, uh, that we, uh,

596
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,830
use not every day. Some of you might
swim every day. Most people don't.

597
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,770
Microorganisms that live in the ocean,
fish that live in water, of course,

598
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:18,771
swim all the time and swimming as their
primary motive motion and they swim to

599
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:24,810
get food, get away from danger,
reproduce all of those things.

600
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,320
So what's the major problem that you
have to overcome when you swim? Well,

601
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:34,560
it's friction or drag.
It's the same problem really,

602
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,000
that all movement has to overcome,

603
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,200
but we're not thinking so much
about friction on the earth.

604
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:45,190
Now we're thinking more about the drag
force that's created from moving through

605
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:46,024
a fluid.

606
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,450
It's a bigger problem now because
the fluid is viscous, right?

607
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,930
Air has a relatively low bus viscosity.

608
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:00,070
You know what this Gossett he has from
Tuesday's lecture air has a relatively

609
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:04,760
low viscosity.
Water has an higher viscosity,

610
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,520
molasses or honey has an
even higher viscosity,

611
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,270
but it's harder to move through water
than it is through air because it's

612
00:39:11,271 --> 00:39:11,720
thicker.

613
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:16,720
It's harder to slip the plains of
packets of water past each other.

614
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,940
To go back to the description,
I gave you a viscosity last time,

615
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,780
and in fact,
if you're going to swim,

616
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,850
if you're going to swim
at a constant velocity,

617
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:29,210
then you have to create a
propulsive force moving forward.

618
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:34,420
That is exactly opposite to the drag
force that is created by moving at that

619
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:39,320
velocity. And just like the example
of putting your arms out in the,

620
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,650
of a moving vehicle,
which I don't recommend,

621
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,143
right?

622
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,100
Sorry, I'm using it as an example
because we've all done it,

623
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,740
but I don't recommend
experiments of that kind.

624
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,270
Imagine that you were putting
your hand out in water.

625
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,620
The same kind of thing would
happen, right? Only the
force would be even greater,

626
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,190
right?

627
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,190
The force would be even greater because
of the greater viscosity of the water.

628
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,740
Um,

629
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,010
so you have to create a bigger propulsive
force and over to overcome this drag.

630
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,520
And that's what fish have to do. That's
what microorganisms that swim have to do.

631
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Most microorganisms that swim for a
living or most fish that swim for a living

632
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,210
have evolved mechanisms to
move quickly through water by,

633
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,130
uh,
by reducing their profile.

634
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,960
So fish often have streamlined
shapes. They might be flat, right?

635
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:34,810
They look like flat plates,
sometimes some kinds of fish.

636
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,450
So that's an easier shape.

637
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:41,470
A more streamlined shape creates less
drag as it moves through water than a

638
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:45,310
bulky shape, like a
cube or a sphere, right?

639
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,080
So streamlining or shape is an adaptation
that animals can use in order to move

640
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:52,210
faster. You know this, if you swim,

641
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,020
if you want to swim and just
glide through the water, right?

642
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:59,680
Push off from the side and just glide.
If you go like this,

643
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,510
you're not going to collide very far.

644
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,750
If you put your hands in front of yourself
or down at your side and make your

645
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:08,320
body more streamlined, you're
going to go a long ways, right?

646
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,240
So streamlining helps,

647
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,660
it turns out that there's a very simple
relationship between the drag force and

648
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:21,661
the velocity that you move forward for
objects that are spiritual or roughly

649
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:26,350
spiritual. And, um, I
show that equation here.

650
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,090
The drag force is equal to six Pi Times
the speed or the velocity that you're

651
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:34,430
moving times the viscosity times the size.

652
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,260
And here the size would be the
radius of the sphere, right?

653
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:41,420
This equation applies to spheres,

654
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,370
so it applies very well to
objects like microorganisms,

655
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,070
like bacteria that aren't
entirely spiritual,

656
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,230
but they're not too different
from spiritual either.

657
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,300
And if I am this bacterium and I
want to move with a constant speed,

658
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,980
I have to create a force that exactly
overcomes this drag force that's created.

659
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,370
And that drag force depends on speed.
To move faster,

660
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,390
I have to overcome a bigger drag force.
I have to create more propulsive force,

661
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:13,250
right? Just like the airplane,
a fish, the same thing.

662
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,410
In order for it to move
forward at a certain speed,

663
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,070
it has to overcome the drag force.
And it does that by moving its muscles,

664
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:22,670
by moving its flippers and thins
to create a propulsive force.

665
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:27,860
I what I did here is a simple calculation
between different kinds of swimmers,

666
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:32,840
swimmers that are basically different
in their size, uh, for a bacterium.

667
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,290
Okay?

668
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:39,000
It's very small.
It's size is 0.01 centimeter.

669
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,990
That's about one micron.
So a very small object. Um,

670
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,990
I asked the question how much,
how much,

671
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,900
um,
if I asked the question,

672
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,010
how much drag force is created
for it to move at a certain speed?

673
00:42:57,011 --> 00:43:01,690
And what was a reasonable speed? I picked
a speed of 10 body lengths per second.

674
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:03,860
Okay.

675
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,860
10 body lengths per second would be a
speed of 0.01 centimeter per second.

676
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,960
So just multiply this by 10 per second,
right?

677
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,410
And the viscosity of
water is 0.01, um, uh,

678
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,020
one centipoise or 0.01 gram
per centimeter per second.

679
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,300
So if you knew these factors,
you knew how big the bacterium was,

680
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:28,520
you knew the viscosity of the
meeting and it's going through,

681
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,500
you knew how fast it was going to move.

682
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,560
You could plug into this equation
and calculate the drag force.

683
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,950
So if you calculate the drag force,

684
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:41,630
that's how much force that object has
to be generating in order to move,

685
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,820
right? You could do the same thing
for a fish. Now fish is bigger.

686
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,400
It's say lots of different sizes of fish.

687
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:53,660
But let's say a 10 centimeter fish moving
through the same medium moves 10 body

688
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:57,140
lengths per second, that would be
a hundred centimeters per second.

689
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:58,963
Okay.

690
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:04,140
And a Yale student who wants to swim
might have a size of about 170 centimeters

691
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:10,410
larger than the fish or the bacterium
to move 10 body lengths per second that

692
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:14,530
can, I converted that to miles per
hour. That's about half a mile per hour.

693
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:15,820
Okay.

694
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,850
I don't know. I'm not a
swimmer. Is that fast?

695
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,673
Okay.

696
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:25,410
Sounds fast as much. It's, it's
slower than you normally walk, right?

697
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:27,970
But you can't swim it as
fast as you can walk. Uh,

698
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,170
so let's just use that as an estimate and
it's moving through the same viscosity.

699
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,610
So one of the things I asked you to do
in the homework for next week is to take

700
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:37,020
this data and,

701
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:41,670
and sort of consider what life
is like for a swimming bacteria,

702
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,190
for a swimming fish, for
swimming, Yale student,

703
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,890
just with, with these factors
in mind, their sizes, viscosity,

704
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:53,940
the meeting the same and their speeds
of motion a somewhat different.

705
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:57,660
So you'll have a chance
to think about this, um,

706
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:01,740
quantitatively for next time and
we'll come back to it in section.

707
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,580
I want to finish by talking about another
element to biomechanics that I hope

708
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,690
where I'm able to talk a little bit
more about a couple of weeks from now.

709
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,510
And that's the issue of
design in biomechanics.

710
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,440
And one of the main issues of design
and biomechanics is the design of

711
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:24,441
artificial artificial replacements for
joints like the hip and artificial hip

712
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,580
replacements have now been
around for hundreds of years.

713
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:34,710
We are quite skilled at making
artificial hip replacements.

714
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:37,080
Surgeons are quite skilled at doing them.

715
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,940
A surgeon who does a lot
of hip replacements can do
an operation like this and

716
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:44,520
about an hour that includes, uh, you know,

717
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:47,010
taking your diseased hip out,

718
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:52,550
putting an artificial hip back in and
getting you to the postop all in about an

719
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,260
hour.
And it's a pretty remarkable,

720
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,230
a pretty remarkable achievement
from the surgical side.

721
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,770
I want to show you a little bit about
how these work from the biomedical

722
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:06,150
engineering side. And to do that, I
first wanted to show you the hip joint,

723
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:09,180
which you might've seen so before,
but this is a skeleton.

724
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,330
This is half of the pelvis
I was talking about before.

725
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:14,820
It's motion during walking.
You see half of it here.

726
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:18,780
So this is the person's midline.
This is the right hip, the pelvis,

727
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,070
the crest there. If you, if you put your
own fingers on the sides of your hips,

728
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:27,390
you can feel the bone that sort of
sticks out at the top about where my belt

729
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:30,480
lies here.
That's the crest of the Ilium,

730
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:34,500
or one of the bones that makes up the
pelvis for the experiment you're going to

731
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:35,850
do while you're going to your next class,

732
00:46:35,851 --> 00:46:38,580
where you think about how your pelvis
moves. Keep your fingers there.

733
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,410
That will be convenient and
silly if you walk that way. Uh,

734
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:47,430
but the hip is connected right
below that, right? And you can feel,

735
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,400
if you feel down a little bit
from the crest of your Ilium,

736
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:55,401
you can feel this part of a long bone
called the femur that makes up the thigh,

737
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,280
right? It's the bone of your, of
your, uh, the upper part of your leg.

738
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:04,140
And that bone extends down
to your knee this way,

739
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,760
and it connects to your
pelvis this way through a, uh,

740
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,300
through a structure that's a continuous
structure of the bone called the femoral

741
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:14,160
neck and the femoral head.

742
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:17,670
And what it looks like
is a neck and a head.

743
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:22,850
The head being sort of a ball and the
ball of the femur fits into a cup in the

744
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:28,170
pelvis and it is this
ball moving in this cup,

745
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:31,260
which gives your hip, it's
range of motion, right?

746
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,430
In your hip has a
remarkable range of motion.

747
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:37,120
You can move it all different sorts of
ways, not just forward and backward,

748
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,250
but you can move it to the side,
right?

749
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:44,330
And it's a ball moving in a cup
that creates all of this, uh,

750
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,820
versatility of motion, right? You can
swing it around different ways. Well,

751
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:50,980
when this joint gets diseased,

752
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,530
movement becomes much more difficult. And
in general, it's a degenerative disease,

753
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,220
uh, that the, the bones and the
cartilage start to break down.

754
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,960
And so now this cup and, and, uh,

755
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,650
ball don't move so
smoothly over one another.

756
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,340
And when they don't move smoothly
over another, they generate friction.

757
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:16,810
They generate pain, right?

758
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:21,280
And so degenerating hips caused can
cause tremendous amounts of pain, uh,

759
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,480
for, uh, people.

760
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,730
So what's in between these two
in this is just a skeleton,

761
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:30,970
so there's nothing in between these two,
but in our hips,

762
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,310
what is it that lubricates the
space between the hip of the,

763
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:41,080
the, the, the cup in the pelvis
and the ball of the femur?

764
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,790
What lubricates that space?

765
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,210
There's some fluid there,

766
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,670
but the main thing that lubricates it is
a protective layer of cartilage or soft,

767
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:57,190
uh, soft skeletal material,
not bone, but it's soft,

768
00:48:57,191 --> 00:49:00,070
spongy material that
lubricates between bones.

769
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,160
And that can break down in
diseases like arthritis. Well,

770
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:05,560
this is what an artificial hip looks like.

771
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,590
It's the modern hip is
composed of two parts.

772
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,800
There's a cup which goes into your pelvis
that replaces the normal structures

773
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,350
into which the theme or goes.

774
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:22,530
So it replaces the cartilage and the
bony structure around the pelvis and the

775
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,720
end of the Femur,
the neck.

776
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:30,721
And the head are replaced by a piece of
metal and the metal sets in the metal

777
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:34,930
ball of the femur.
Artificial femurs sets in the cup of the,

778
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,490
of the pelvis.

779
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,050
Now what lubricates it now is
not Cartlidge but a polymer.

780
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:45,850
Because if you had a metal cup and a
metal theme or going in metal on metal,

781
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,640
even if it was very smooth metal,
that's not,

782
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,250
there's friction associated
with that motion.

783
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,000
But if you put a polymer in particular,
what what are used most often now is,

784
00:49:56,001 --> 00:50:01,001
is high density polyethylene
or something like Teflon.

785
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,260
A metal ball slides very
easily over a Teflon Cup,

786
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:09,100
particularly if their machine to fit
together precisely. And so that's what,

787
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,290
that's what,
uh,

788
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,980
is used currently and what allows
normal motion to be restored.

789
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,570
Now the problem,

790
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,890
the main problem here is how to get
this ball and this neck attached to the

791
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:25,390
femur. Because if you think about
it, why is it metal? It's metal.

792
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:27,560
Because if you're standing on one leg,

793
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,410
all of the weight of your
body is on that one leg.

794
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,250
The whole weight of your body is on the
femur the whole way that the body is

795
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:35,720
actually right here.

796
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:37,070
Okay?

797
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:40,190
Right. The whole weight of your
body is on this very small,

798
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,570
depends on the integrity of that
very small piece of material.

799
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,830
And what we learned last time is that
materials have elasticy city, right?

800
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,630
You don't want something
that bends a lot there.

801
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:53,840
You want something that's strong that
doesn't bend even when there's a high

802
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:55,010
stress applied to it,

803
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:59,990
like the stress of the weight of your
body and metals are really the materials

804
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:03,980
that best can supply that
kind of mechanical strength,

805
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,580
that kind of resistance to
bending resistance to fracture.

806
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:10,310
So the problem is how to get this on here.

807
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,320
The way that that solved currently is to
have the neck and the ball of the femur

808
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:17,570
attached to a much longer piece of metal.

809
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,610
When you get an artificial hip than this
part of the new replacement femur goes

810
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:24,380
down into the bone of your leg,

811
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,540
okay.

812
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:31,190
Inserted into the bone so
that it's more stable, right?

813
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:36,191
There's all of this metal into your
bone to sort of stabilize it because the

814
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:41,060
last thing you want or what you
want to achieve is for this,

815
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:46,090
this part of the Femur to move without
any slippage with the rest of your femur.

816
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:51,240
Okay. I'm going to come back
to this, uh, this concept, uh,

817
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,790
later and talk more when we
talk about artificial organs,

818
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:55,830
about how artificial hips are made.

819
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:01,010
But I wanted you to at least have a
picture of how this particular piece of

820
00:52:01,261 --> 00:52:04,530
biomedical engineering works.
We'll see it's section this afternoon.
