1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,760
Okay. Well, this week we're going to
talk about biomedical imaging and,

2
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,950
uh, you know, from the first
lecture, as I mentioned,

3
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:23,970
that one of the biggest advances in
biomedical engineering was the development

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,420
of,
of systems for looking inside the body.

5
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,670
And that's what we're going
to talk about, uh, this week,

6
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:32,670
sort of what's the physics behind some
of these systems? How do they work,

7
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,930
what are their limitations,

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,920
and what are the opportunities that
each of them present? And again,

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,330
like almost every week's subject, uh,
this one could take up a whole course.

10
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,170
In fact,
there's,

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,400
there's three or four
courses on biomedical imaging
that are offered here at

12
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,730
Yale. So we're just going to scratch
the scratch the surface of it.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,910
But what I hope to do is give you some
sense for how these different modes of

14
00:00:56,071 --> 00:01:00,810
imaging work, why they work, why they
allow you to see inside the human body,

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,920
and then what the limitations of
each particular technology is.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,050
So these are the kinds of questions that
I hope we'll be able to answer by the

17
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:12,570
end of this lecture. Next
lecture, what is an image?

18
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:16,800
Most of you could answer that probably
now, but images come in different forms.

19
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,960
And why is imaging so important to
medicine? You probably already know, uh,

20
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:25,650
either from what you've read in the
past or from your own experience.

21
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:29,940
Most of us have had at some point by
the time you're as old as you are,

22
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:34,080
you've had an image taken of your
body of medical imaging, usually an x.

23
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,180
Um, and uh, so you know, something about
why it's so important, but we'll try to,

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,590
to, to amplify on what you already
know, what technologies are available.

25
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,670
And so we're going to survey the different
techniques that can be used and that

26
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:52,650
are used most commonly. It's a very
rapidly developing field. And, uh,

27
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:56,790
almost every year there are new
innovations in imaging, new, uh,

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,440
sometimes even new methods
that are introduced. Um, and,

29
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,560
um, that, that changed the way
we can see inside the body.

30
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:08,520
And so I'm going to talk about sort
of a snapshot of what's available now.

31
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,570
And as I said,

32
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:13,800
illustrate or talk about what some of
the problems are or challenges with each.

33
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:16,170
What are the limitations in particular?

34
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,030
So in image is a visual
representation of um,

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,900
can you get the door again? Sorry. Uh,

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,480
it's become a routine thing for us.

37
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,340
A visual representation of some
measurable, a property of a person,

38
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:35,220
an object or a phenomenon. We're going
to be thinking about medical imaging.

39
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:39,870
So we're going to be thinking
mainly about images of people and,

40
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,490
and images can be formed and displayed in,
in different ways depending on,

41
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,780
um, on properties of the
object and properties of the
imaging system that you're

42
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,270
using,
that you're using to create the image.

43
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,060
And so you're familiar with
certain kinds of images.

44
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:57,650
You've all probably taken a
photograph with a camera. Uh,

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,170
photography has changed dramatically
since, uh, since you were born, right?

46
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:07,000
It used to be all on film and now
it's almost all on, uh, on digital.

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,900
And, um, so these are different
ways of capturing the same thing.

48
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:13,960
A photograph is a representation
of what you can see.

49
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,860
It's a representation of how visible
light reflects off of objects.

50
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,630
And so you see the outlines of the objects
and their colors and their textures.

51
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,160
Uh, but it's basically a representation
of how visible light is interacting with

52
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,360
some object.

53
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,430
An x ray on the other hand shows you
something that you can't see on your own.

54
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,440
It allows you to see inside the body,

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,990
and this is because it's
not using visible light,

56
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,680
which bounces off of objects like us,

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,670
but it's using x-ray radiation,
which is able to penetrate the body.

58
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,660
And so by taking a picture of how these,
uh,

59
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,740
these particular form of
electromagnetic radiation called x,

60
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,680
by taking a picture of how it
penetrates through the body,

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,250
you can get an image that represents
something about what's inside.

62
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,840
And the challenge is to know because
you understand the physics of the

63
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,060
radiation,
in this case x rays,

64
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,850
and you understand the equipment
that's used to collect the image,

65
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,220
you should be able to be able to
interpret from your understanding of those

66
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:22,720
things, what it is that you're seeing
inside the body. And of course,

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,680
television is a different kind of
image, uh, presented in a different way.

68
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,850
But another image of something that we
can already see. So two kinds of imaging,

69
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:35,560
really images that represent to us,
maybe not exactly the way we see it,

70
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:39,580
but things that we can see and
images that represent to us,

71
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:44,030
things we can't see, but put it in
a form that we can interpret, right?

72
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,700
And so that's just what this says here,
that uh,

73
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,690
that some images you're just trying to
collect and record what it is that you

74
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:56,740
can see so that you can look back at it
later and remind yourself of what it was

75
00:04:56,741 --> 00:05:01,600
that you saw. Others, other imaging
systems are really transducers,

76
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,081
right?

77
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:05,170
They're converting something that you
can't see into something that you can.

78
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,800
We talked about transduction,
uh,

79
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,700
several weeks ago now when we talked
about cell communication and the, the,

80
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,020
uh, the concept of transduction converting
one kind of a signal into another.

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,251
In this case,

82
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:23,251
converting a signal that measure something
you can't see but converts it into

83
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:29,020
something that you can see.
So d to understand this,

84
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:32,440
I have to review for you something
that most of you probably already know,

85
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:36,340
at least at some level.
And that's the electromagnetic spectrum.

86
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,610
And this is a representation of the
variation in properties of electromagnetic

87
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:47,671
radiation and certain
forms of electromagnetic
radiation are apparent to us

88
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:52,910
because our, our retinas can
detect it. And that's the,

89
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,360
the visible part of the spectrum,
which I've shown here.

90
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,630
Now what this shows is
the entire electromagnetic
spectrum arranged on a scale

91
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,820
from very short wavelength
up to very long wave length.

92
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,650
And these are in centimeters.

93
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,890
The visible part of the spectrum
is around a micron or so,

94
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,440
or slightly less than a
micron, right? It's, uh,

95
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
it's around 400 nanometers to 700
nanometers is the visible spectrum.

96
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,120
Now,
why is this the visible spectrum?

97
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,660
Because when radiation with
this wavelength hits your eye,

98
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,810
it makes a change in the cells inside
your eye and allows your retina to make an

99
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,870
image.
All right?

100
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,120
So it's only light of those particular
wavelengths that can interact

101
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:42,410
productively with this particular special
biological object called the retina.

102
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,380
And that's all the light that we can see.

103
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,540
But there's electromagnetic radiation
of all different wave lengths outside of

104
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,800
the visible spectrum.
In fact,

105
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:55,550
one of the things you should notice here
is that the visible spectrum is only a

106
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:59,870
small piece of the entire spectrum
of electromagnetic radiation.

107
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,960
And you know this already,
there are longer wave length,

108
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,560
there's longer wavelength
radiation called infrared.

109
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,960
So it has wavelengths that are
longer than the, um, then the,

110
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,440
in the visible spectrum,
you can't see these, right?

111
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,840
But some cameras can see infrared,
right? That's how if you,

112
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,160
when you,
um,

113
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,750
when you watch the films from the war in
Iraq where they have these sort of heat

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,280
heat, uh, visualization goggles,
they're looking at infrared,

115
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,830
infrared wave lengths.

116
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,880
So there's something in the goggles that
is sensitive to infrared light and it

117
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:41,340
converts it into visible wavelengths,
which you can see. All right.

118
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,370
Have you ever seen satellite pictures,
uh, where, uh, they used to do this? Uh,

119
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:50,990
oil companies or electric companies would
take a picture of neighborhoods from

120
00:07:50,991 --> 00:07:52,610
the sky,
right?

121
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,870
Infrared and infrared radiation
is associated with heated objects.

122
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,030
So the higher the
temperature of an object,

123
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,330
the more infrared radiation of
a higher wavelength it emits.

124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,950
So if you take a picture of a neighborhood
at night using an infrared camera,

125
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,100
you can see how much heat is being
emitted from all the different houses.

126
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,880
And you can identify ones that don't
have enough insulation, for example,

127
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,700
or ones that are wasting heat because
they're admitting it at a higher

128
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,730
temperature.
So these are some examples of,

129
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,530
of using a wave length that are, I can't
detect, but getting information from it.

130
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,730
You also are familiar with
ultraviolet radiation.

131
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,390
So these are wavelengths that are shorter,
shorter than the visible spectrum,

132
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:41,450
shorter than the shorter than the
part of the spectrum that you can see.

133
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,580
But you can experience the effects of
electro of ultraviolet radiation, right?

134
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:51,320
If you're out in the sun too long, your
skin turns red, right? You get a sunburn.

135
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,770
That's because your skin
absorbs ultraviolet.

136
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,980
Radiation created a change in
the cells of your skin, right?

137
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:03,450
Different biological effect.
You're seeing it in a sense, right?

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,080
You're only seeing it where the sun hit,
not where your body was in shadow.

139
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,880
All right? But you can detect
that radiation that way. Um,

140
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,180
so if we look at the whole spectrum,
I'm going to go back a slide now,

141
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,830
and this was arranged with the,
with the long wave lengths up at this end,

142
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,290
the short wave lengths down at this end.

143
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,000
The other picture is arranged
in just the opposite way, uh,

144
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,020
with the long wave lengths down at
this end. Radio waves, microwaves,

145
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,620
infrared waves,
the visible spectrum,

146
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,350
ultraviolet x Ray and Gamma Ray.

147
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,680
So these are long wave lengths proceeding
to shorter wavelengths as the wave

148
00:09:42,881 --> 00:09:46,410
length changes. So does the
frequency, they're inversely related.

149
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
So as the wave length goes down,
the frequency goes up

150
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,100
and the frequency is related to how
much energy these waves contain.

151
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,420
And so the short wave length
x rays and gamma rays, uh,

152
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:02,910
carry high amounts of energy,
right?

153
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,310
Ultraviolet rays carry more
energy than visible res.

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,140
So frequency goes up as
wavelength goes down.

155
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,080
And so does the energy of
the, uh, of the, um, of the,

156
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,570
of the, uh, radiation.

157
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,900
This diagram here shows you
roughly how big is the wavelength.

158
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,030
So for radio waves,

159
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:31,620
these are very long waves that are the
size of buildings or bigger than people.

160
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,110
Microwaves are shorter.

161
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,650
They're the size of an insect
infrared waves shorter than that,

162
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,560
the size of a pin point,
the visible raise,

163
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,010
the ones that are retina can
detect are about the size of cells.

164
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,570
Bacteria for example, or
protozoa, ultraviolet rays,

165
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,220
the size of molecules.

166
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,630
And then x rays and gamma
rays are submolecular.

167
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,370
There's sub subatomic in size.

168
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,300
And because of that they have special
properties and that they can actually

169
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,330
change Adams when when x rays and gamma
rays are absorbed into materials because

170
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:12,750
they're wave lengths are smaller than
the wave lengths of Adams or nuclei,

171
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,630
they can actually interact
with Adams and nuclei.

172
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,730
And one of the things that x rays and
gamma rays can do that other raise don't,

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,430
is ionize an object.

174
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,970
They can actually inject electrons
from the atoms inside of a material and

175
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:34,560
create ions. And the eye is that
they create are often reactive.

176
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,440
And this is what makes, uh,
these, uh, shortwave length,

177
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:45,441
high energy forms of radiation
biologically hazardous
because they are in the

178
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:52,770
category called ionizing radiation.
When they hit your body,

179
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,890
they can produce changes in particular
produce atoms or ions from Adams.

180
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,550
These ions can further react.

181
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,570
Sometimes they even react with DNA inside
cells and can cause mutations in DNA

182
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:12,610
as a result of chemical reactions
that occur. And because of this,

183
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,640
we want to limit the exposure of our
bodies to things like x rays and gamma

184
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:23,020
rays. I'm going to talk about in the
course of the lecture today and tomorrow,

185
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,640
many of the ways that x rays and gamma
rays are useful for medical imaging.

186
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,860
And that's not surprising because I
already said these are short wavelength,

187
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,550
high energy forms of radiation. They can
penetrate through objects fairly easily.

188
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,210
So things that penetrate are
useful for imaging what's inside,

189
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,890
but the disadvantage of their
penetration is that they can also create

190
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,470
okay

191
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,130
ions in biological damage. So we'll
keep that in mind as we go through.

192
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,270
You know that not only ionizing
radiation causes biological damage,

193
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:58,860
but I also mentioned the
biological effects of
overexposure to ultraviolet light,

194
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,960
which you've probably all
experienced through sunburn
or some other overexposure.

195
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,180
So these aren't the only kinds of rays
that can have a biological effect,

196
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:10,920
but they're the ones that
we're most concerned about.

197
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,220
Okay?

198
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,810
Okay.
Questions about that or this,

199
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:18,350
this is probably a picture that
you've seen before. If not,

200
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,780
I encourage you to review, uh, um, um,

201
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,510
review sort of the physics of
the electromagnetic spectrum.

202
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,160
Okay?

203
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,820
So let's talk about x rays and that is
the form of medical imaging that's been

204
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:37,490
around for the longest, uh, before x.

205
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,400
As your chapter in your
book. Um, um, describes, uh,

206
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:45,340
physicians and doctors
relied on hand drawings.

207
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,120
They would draw things so that they could
describe what they sought to others or

208
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,570
so they could remember if a patient
came in and had something abnormal,

209
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:56,110
they might draw a sketch of it
in your, uh, in their notebooks.

210
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,480
So they would remember how
it looked for next time.

211
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,380
And then photography changed that because
you could take pictures of things and

212
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:04,260
you could remember them without drawing a,

213
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:07,270
but we still couldn't look
inside the body, right?

214
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,460
Still couldn't look inside
the body. Well, you could,

215
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,310
but not really very well on living people.
Right?

216
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,950
So a lot about what we knew about
the inside of the body was, uh,

217
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,970
from the science of dissection and
looking inside the bodies of cadavers,

218
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,790
people after they died and learning
about their anatomy that way.

219
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,890
So we knew something about that,

220
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:29,350
but we weren't able to look
inside the living body. Well,

221
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,840
this Wilhelm Renkin change that.

222
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:36,700
And Rankin was a physicist who discovered
that rays could penetrate through

223
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:40,330
solid objects. And um, he, uh,

224
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:44,560
announced that discovery in
1895 he did an experiment,

225
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,760
which is shown,
uh,

226
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,080
in a diagram in your book where he put
objects in front of an x ray source.

227
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,850
And he was able to show that these x
rays would pass through the object and he

228
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,700
could detect them on the other
side with a, with a film.

229
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,330
So here's two useful properties of x-rays.

230
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,390
One is they can penetrate
through solid objects.

231
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,800
The second is that they can expose film,

232
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,360
film like photographic film
is sensitive to x rays.

233
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,460
And because of this,

234
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:21,461
then you could imagine taking a picture
of how these rays pastor with solid

235
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:22,520
object.

236
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,460
Now the other thing that's interesting
about x rays is that they pass through

237
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:30,380
some solid objects better than others.
The more dense the object is,

238
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,190
the less radiation x ray
radiation that passes through.

239
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,570
So if you expose an x ray beam on an
object that solid at some parts and hollow

240
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,064
in the others,

241
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,250
x rays are going to pass easily through
the hollow part and not so easily

242
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,240
through the solid part.

243
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,880
And so the amount of x ray radiation
that goes through an object is related to

244
00:15:57,161 --> 00:16:01,690
the density through which that x
ray penetrated. And it's these,

245
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,160
these properties that made it
good for taking images by, uh,

246
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,470
by a tea after he discovered that,
um,

247
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,970
that x rays could penetrate
through objects. It didn't
take him very long to say,

248
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:16,390
well, if it penetrates through solid
objects like bricks and boards,

249
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,000
maybe it'll penetrate
through a person as well.

250
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:23,890
And took some of the first images, x ray
images of people by looking at the hand,

251
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,840
for example.
And he won the,

252
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,610
the first Nobel Prize in
physics for that discovery.

253
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,700
And so it was one of the things
you could take from this,

254
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,880
from the time that he first announced
at 1896 til the time you won,

255
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:41,680
what's come to be known as the highest
prize in science took only six years.

256
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,730
So people recognized immediately
the value of this approach,

257
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:50,560
particularly this approach for medical
imaging. Now, the raid that he discovered,

258
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:55,110
we now call the x Ray. Um,
initially it was called, uh,

259
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,090
the Rankin ray because he was
the one that discovered it.

260
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:03,091
And there are some countries that still
refer to a two x rays as Rankin raise.

261
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:06,700
And so you might hear that
a nomenclature if you, uh,

262
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,970
if you travel or if you're reading
particularly in older textbooks.

263
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,700
So how does it work? Here was the
first kind of experiment that a,

264
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,280
that I described earlier
in x ray source here,

265
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,210
the x ray source is emitting x
rays in all different directions.

266
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,960
Some of them would, uh,
would impinge on this object.

267
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,700
All right.
And,

268
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,890
and depending on the density of the
material with inside this object,

269
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:37,891
some of the x rays would be absorbed
and some of them would pass through in a

270
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:41,900
dense part of the object, the x rays
would be absorbed in a less dense part.

271
00:17:41,901 --> 00:17:43,580
More of the x rays would pass through.

272
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,020
And if you put a piece of film or some
kind of a detector behind the object,

273
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:52,290
then you could create basically a shadow,
right?

274
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,970
Just like a shadow. When you're standing
on the street and the sun is up here,

275
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,830
the light doesn't pass through you.

276
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,910
And so what you see on the ground
behind you is the sun all around.

277
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,940
But a shadow where your body
did not allow the, the, the,

278
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:11,160
the radiation to pass through. In this
case, you'd see a shadow of this object,

279
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,790
but it could be a more sophisticated
shadow in some ways because the x rays can

280
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:20,760
penetrate somewhat through dense material
and even better through less dense

281
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:21,450
material.

282
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,650
So the shadow would be light where there
was density in the object and it would

283
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:30,600
be dark where there was hollowness
or less density in the object.

284
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,300
Right. That makes sense. So in
this way, and x ray is a shadow,

285
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,830
it's an inverse image of the density
through which the x ray passed.

286
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,970
The diagram over here shows you,

287
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,010
shows you a more sophisticated setup and
the kind of setup that's used for x ray

288
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:51,180
imaging in patients.

289
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,510
So you have an x ray source and so x
rays are admitted from this source.

290
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,990
And if you didn't confine those x rays
in some ways they'd be admitted in all

291
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,824
directions,

292
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,090
but you can find it so that x rays
are only admitted from one side.

293
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,280
Um, you, uh, let that pass
through a filter because these,

294
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,220
these sources of x ray
generation are not perfect.

295
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:17,580
They generate waves of
different wavelengths and
still through a filter that

296
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:22,581
only lets x rays pass through through
a device called a column mater and a

297
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:27,240
column mater is a physical object that
basically just straightens out of being.

298
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,820
If I had a source of radiation
here, right, and x and, and it was,

299
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,720
it was emitting x-rays, they would,
they would radiate in all directions.

300
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,730
I could put something that was x ray
dense behind it and now they would only

301
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,300
admit to the front.
Right?

302
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,870
But what I would like is if I'm want
to take an image of, of someone,

303
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,850
if I want to take an image of me,
for example,

304
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,710
I would like all those x rays to pass
straight through me so that I knew what

305
00:19:55,711 --> 00:20:00,360
direction all of the rays were traveling
so that when I tried to interpret what

306
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:01,320
was on the film,

307
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,440
there'd be a one to one correlation
between where the x Ray hit the film and

308
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,340
where it went through my body.

309
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,870
If I've got x rays coming
from all different directions
and that's going to blur

310
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:16,170
the image, right? So you
need to straighten it out.

311
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:19,230
So the x rays go in one direction
and that's what a column mater does.

312
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,700
It's shown as a whole here, but
really it's, it's, it's a, it's a,

313
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,730
a sheet with many small pinholes and
these pinholes only allow x rays to go

314
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:32,070
through if they're going in
the right direction, right?

315
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:35,310
Ones that come at an angle like
this are going to bounce off,

316
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,650
but x rays that come straight through are
going to pass straight through and hit

317
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:44,520
the object.
The object is the patient.

318
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:46,950
So I'm standing here and there's,

319
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,160
and there's something behind me that's
going to detect the x rays that pass

320
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:54,820
through.
That's something behind is this,

321
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:59,200
there's a grid also to prevent scatter
to only collect the x rays that are

322
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:02,500
passing in the right direction because
some of those x rays might've been

323
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:06,220
deflected as they pass through
the object through me, right?

324
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:10,120
But I only want to collect the ones that
are going in one direction so that I

325
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:13,660
will know where the anatomical
object they pass through our,

326
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,130
that hits a fluorescent screen.
And the fluorescent screen is,

327
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,530
is a special material that,
uh,

328
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,970
that emits light when x rays hit it.

329
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,270
So an x ray hits the fluorescent screen,

330
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,730
it generates a lot of
light right in that spot.

331
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,560
And this detector detects the light.

332
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,670
So the fluorescent screen
amplifies the x ray signal.

333
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,640
Several photons of X-ray hit,

334
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,980
they generate fluorescence,
they expose the detector,

335
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,160
right?
And now in the old days,

336
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,400
this used to be really film x Ray film
photographic film that was sensitive to x

337
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,210
rays.
And you would,

338
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,210
the detector is really a piece of film
that you would take out of the machine

339
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:03,710
and you would, and you would
develop it with chemicals, right?

340
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:07,940
The same way you develop a, uh, uh,
any other kinds of photographic film.

341
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,410
Now there are detectors that are
electronic and so you can detect things

342
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:13,790
electronically without film.

343
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,000
If you have an x ray though,
you probably,

344
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,880
if you have one at home at checks
x Ray that your parents gave you,

345
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:25,690
say you're going off to college, take
your chest sacred. Hey, anybody bring one?

346
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,320
Wow.

347
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,390
Uh, well if you did, it would be
probably a real piece of film.

348
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,470
Um, so, uh,

349
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,000
x rays are formed from high energy
radiation and inverse shadow is created

350
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:45,740
because x rays pass through Lens,
less dense areas easier.

351
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,890
And what's it going to pass through in
the body if you do a chest x ray of,

352
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,900
uh, of my chest, for example,

353
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,680
where will the x rays pass
through the most easily? Well,

354
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:02,340
they'll pass through the lungs.
The lungs is primarily air, right?

355
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,390
The lungs is air and tissue,
but it's mainly airspaces.

356
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,250
And so what you see is dark.

357
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:13,251
Here are the less dense regions are the
lungs where nothing much interfered with

358
00:23:13,381 --> 00:23:15,750
the x rays passing through the body.
All right.

359
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,320
Had to pass through skin soft tissue,
some muscles,

360
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,450
and then primarily through air
where the image is light here.

361
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,240
Those are regions that
absorbed most of the x rays.

362
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:31,890
So not many of the x rays got through
to hit the film in back of me. Right.

363
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,630
And those, uh, those, those areas
appear lighter. So this bone,

364
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:40,240
the clavicle appears light.
The ribs up here,

365
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,730
like the bones of the rib cage appear
lighter. What's this object here

366
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,840
in the chest over on this side?
Big

367
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,053
Right?

368
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,710
The heart. Right. And why is the heart
to pure light on this image? Well,

369
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,610
it's not bone, right?
It's not as dense as bone.

370
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,360
It's muscle. It's soft tissue,
but it's also filled with water.

371
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,200
A lot of water, right? And it's
a three dimensional object.

372
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,800
And so for x rays to pass through
this whole three dimensional object,

373
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:23,630
a lot of the x rays get absorbed, right?
It's a thicker object then this bone.

374
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,870
And so even though it's
not as dense as bone,

375
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,170
it appears wider here because it's thicker

376
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,970
it x rays have to pass through more of it.
In order to get to the other side,

377
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,080
the thicker the region,

378
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:39,950
it has to pass through the
more opportunity for those
x rays to be absorbed.

379
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,540
The diaphragm.

380
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,610
And what do you think are these scattered
sort of white things all around here?

381
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,650
All around the side here.
Well first,

382
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:55,610
what's this object that comes
up and sort of off to the side?

383
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,750
Here's the heart.
Something comes up.

384
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:06,090
Sorry. The Aorta. The aortic arch is here.

385
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,130
Remember from our pictures of the heart,

386
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,400
you can't see it entirely because behind
it is another white object that's sort

387
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:17,310
of in the mid line here.
That's the bones of the spine.

388
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,670
All right?
And in this region here,

389
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,420
they're all super imposed,
right?

390
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:28,500
So you can't really tell how much of this
absorption comes from the aortic arch

391
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:30,060
and how much of it comes from the spine.

392
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,510
So this is one problem with rays

393
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:40,250
that you're not seeing a three
dimensional image of the chest.

394
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:46,200
In this case, you're seeing
a projected image, right?

395
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,860
And so you're only looking
in one direction really,

396
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,610
and you're seeing a projection of all
the things that the x rays could pass

397
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:55,800
through. So I can't tell, for example,

398
00:25:55,801 --> 00:25:59,640
if the aortic arch is in
front of or behind the spine,

399
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,900
I can't even tell where the boundary
of them are because it's all just there

400
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,120
absorbing x rays.
And so I can't see it.

401
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:10,020
So what if I want it to look at this in
more detail or I wanted to distinguish

402
00:26:10,021 --> 00:26:13,260
what part of this is the aortic
arch and what part is the spine?

403
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,270
How would I change the imaging,

404
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,280
Sarah?
Yeah.

405
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:25,990
You could ask the patient to turn to
the side and you could then do the same

406
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:29,260
measurement this way, right? And
now you'd see another projection,

407
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:31,090
but you see a projection
from another angle.

408
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,320
And so you would be able to differentiate
what is different in this direction,

409
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:36,983
right?

410
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,070
And you might do it obliquely, you
might ask the patient to turn, you know,

411
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:44,700
a little bit sideways or, or
uh, or turn the other way.

412
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,270
And by putting together several different
images taken from different angles,

413
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,870
you can learn more about the three
dimensional aspects of what's inside.

414
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,610
You might be able to see things that you
can't in one image in one of the other

415
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,683
angles.

416
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,200
Okay.

417
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Okay.
So x rays are a projection,

418
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,470
a two dimensional projection
of a three dimensional object.

419
00:27:05,471 --> 00:27:06,820
And that's one of their limitations.

420
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,900
And you can get around that
a little bit by asking the,

421
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,440
by moving the object around and
taking images from different sides.

422
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,950
Another problem with x
Rays is radiation dose.

423
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
I mentioned that x rays were
a form of ionizing radiation.

424
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,730
And so if you're exposed to x rays,

425
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:28,990
you could be generating ions inside
and with a normal chest x ray,

426
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:33,970
if you only have one chest x ray taken
every five years or 10 years or so,

427
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,640
the dose that you get is relatively low.

428
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,680
Your body has mechanisms for repairing
those, uh, that biological damage,

429
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,490
right?

430
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,420
Your body has mechanisms for repairing
the kind of biological damage that's done

431
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:50,200
by ionizing radiation.
And so if the dose is low enough,

432
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:54,310
the risk of some permanent
kind of damage is fairly low.

433
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,223
Where,

434
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,430
okay,

435
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:02,380
there is a risk is if you have
repeated exposure to higher doses,

436
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:08,340
in which case you're generating more ions
are being generated in your body than

437
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:12,310
the repair mechanisms that are
naturally in place can repair.

438
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,510
And then you get tissue damage.

439
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,720
And so one is concerned when you're
using radiation with limiting the dose

440
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:25,770
that is delivered on each x Ray.

441
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,950
So how could you reduce the dose here?

442
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,630
How could you reduce the radiation
dose that the patient receives?

443
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,190
Thinking about how this thing works,
how could you reduce the dose?

444
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:39,820
Okay.

445
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,650
Well one is you could use the minimum,

446
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,880
the minimum number of x rays
necessary to see what you want to see.

447
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,590
And of course as you
use less radiation dose,

448
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,710
you're going to see less on the image.
So you're set,

449
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,420
the sensitivity is going to go down.

450
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:00,220
And so one of the things you might not
see if you use less radiation dose,

451
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:04,480
you might not see these other structures
here that are barely visible in this

452
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:06,430
particular image,
right?

453
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,550
And these structures here are vessels
from the pulmonary vasculature and the

454
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:16,510
Bronc I associated with the lung
and you might care about those.

455
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,690
So you might need a higher dose in
order to see what you want to see.

456
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:23,560
So you can reduce the dose by reducing
the intensity of the radiation.

457
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,320
But the cost is you don't get
as high a quality of an image,

458
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,960
not as useful for diagnosis.

459
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,273
Um,

460
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,070
one could also make innovations
in the machinery, right?

461
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,540
In particular, you could make detectors
that are always, that get more sensitive.

462
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,510
And the more sensitive the detector is,
the more information you get per, uh,

463
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,190
per photon or per, uh, radiation.

464
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,330
So more sensitive detectors allow you
to make better measurements with less

465
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,620
radioactivity and there have been those
innovations continually over the years.

466
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:04,621
And so the x rays that you would
get now are fairly low dose x rays,

467
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,920
uh, without much, uh,
apparent risk to you.

468
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,540
You also can limit where
the x rays hit the body.

469
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,140
And part of that is done by focusing
part of it's done by something called

470
00:30:18,141 --> 00:30:21,440
shielding, right? So if you are
getting a checks x ray done,

471
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:25,460
they might put an apron on your waist.

472
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,570
That apron contains a very dense material
and so the x rays don't penetrate

473
00:30:29,571 --> 00:30:31,220
through below your waist.

474
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,743
All right?

475
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:38,300
So these are all ways that
that radiologists use to
reduce the radiation dose to

476
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,110
uh, to uh, patients.

477
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,640
Okay.

478
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,640
We talked about being able to see more
by looking at different angles and the

479
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,040
technology called computed tomography or
CT is sort of the end product of that.

480
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,420
It's trying to design x ray
machines and CT machines use x rays.

481
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,640
The physics of how you form
the image is exactly the same.

482
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,430
You're generating x rays and
they're passing through the body.

483
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,670
What's different is that the machine
allows you to take pictures at many,

484
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:17,990
many different angles while
the patient stays, uh, still.

485
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,370
So instead of asking the patient
to move from one side to the other,

486
00:31:22,371 --> 00:31:24,140
so you can take pictures
of different angles.

487
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,210
You have an x ray source and a detector
that basically spins around the patient.

488
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:30,790
Yeah.

489
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:35,790
And it takes pictures at different angles
and you use not a broad beam that's

490
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:40,390
going to expose my chest
all at the same time,

491
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,810
but you use a narrow collimated beam,

492
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,140
a narrow beam that you can focus
and move throughout all of the,

493
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,900
um, throughout all of the
angles around the body.

494
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,040
So you're not giving a sort of
a plane of radiation anymore.

495
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,530
You're giving something more
like a line of radiation.

496
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,270
Right.

497
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,460
And as that line passes through me,

498
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,710
there's going to be absorbance detected
back here depending on what was in the

499
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:13,600
way of that particular line of
radiation that was coming through. Now,

500
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,290
any one line doesn't give you
very much information, right.

501
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,230
Any one line of radiation doesn't
give you very much information.

502
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,050
But what if you collect those
lines from all around my body?

503
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:26,470
You can basically see my
body from every angle.

504
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,110
That still is going to be a
complicated set of images, right?

505
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:36,610
What if you took 360 pictures as
you spun this thing around my body,

506
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:40,580
now you've got 360 pictures to look at.
How do you make sense of that? Well,

507
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:41,750
you couldn't really,

508
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,960
and so what really made CT possible
is that mathematicians figured out in

509
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:53,030
mathematical ways for taking all of these
separate images that are collected as

510
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:57,800
you move around the body
and reconstructing and image
of the whole object that

511
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:02,240
must been in between. All right, that the,

512
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,280
the mathematical process is called
back projection and you take,

513
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,590
you take a large number of
projected images that are
acquired from all different

514
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:14,640
angles and you can reconstruct a picture
of what the object must have looked

515
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:19,260
like that it was sampling.
Okay?

516
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,270
Now because it's a narrow beam, you're
doing this in a line instead of a plane,

517
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,040
you're and you're spinning it around,

518
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:31,041
you're really doing a slice through the
body with each rotation of the device,

519
00:33:31,621 --> 00:33:34,170
right?
If I spend this all around my body,

520
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:37,440
then I'm basically moving this line
around different angles and I'm looking at

521
00:33:37,441 --> 00:33:41,130
one slice maybe between here
and here all the way around.

522
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:46,550
And so you can reconstruct an image
of a slice that might look like this.

523
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,070
All right? The digital,
the, the chest x Ray,

524
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,780
a plane of radiation shadow
of what that produces.

525
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,790
The CT gives you a slice,
a transverse slice of the body,

526
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,510
but it shows you the real three
dimensional structure of what's inside.

527
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,940
So what can you see in
this picture? Well, here,

528
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,770
here was the spine and this picture,

529
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,750
is this from the thorax that contains
the lung or is this from the abdomen that

530
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:18,740
contains the intestines?
Don't read the bottom of the picture,

531
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:24,560
but just looking at it, it's not the
lungs, right? Because you don't see,

532
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:29,240
you don't see a lot of dark area in
here that would indicate hair, right?

533
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:34,241
What you see in stead are a lot of soft
tissues that sort of absorb radiation.

534
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,580
Uh, this here is the liver. You can see,

535
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,620
you can see muscles and bones of the
rib cage, which are down in the abdomen.

536
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:48,310
Here you can see the spine very clearly.
You can see the kidneys at the back.

537
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,970
You can see the intestines in here.

538
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,530
All right.

539
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,460
And so an experienced radiologist
who's looking at this can see a lot of

540
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:02,700
information arranged in the
proper three dimensional way.

541
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,740
Now this is one slice,
but you could do another slice as well.

542
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,920
And you can do that in the machine because
the patient is sitting still and is

543
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:18,180
moving through the machine
one step at a time, right?

544
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:21,840
So there's a conveyor belt here that's
bringing the patient into the machine.

545
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,680
And in the machine is this rotating
array of x ray sources and detectors.

546
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,860
This part spins around.
So you bring the patient in,

547
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,190
you spin it around, you collect all
the, you bring them in a little farther,

548
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:42,020
you spin it around each time, each
increment that you move to patient in,

549
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:43,740
you're taking a picture of another slice.

550
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:49,020
And so one could take a three
dimensional image of the whole body.

551
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:50,700
Okay?

552
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,990
Now, because you're just using
line sources of radiation,

553
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,250
one can reduce the amount of radiation
that with each individual picture that

554
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:00,084
you take,

555
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,310
okay?

556
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:05,990
Compared to an Xray. But you've got to
take a lot of these pictures, right?

557
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,730
And so the cumulative dose of
radiation, uh, can be significant.

558
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:14,990
So even though you could take a full
three dimensional picture of your body,

559
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,360
you might not want to do that,
right?

560
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:20,900
You might just want to take a picture of
the slices that seem to be of interest.

561
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,080
Maybe the abdomen, maybe
the chest, maybe the knee,

562
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,820
if you're having a problem with your knee.

563
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,320
And so CT is commonly used
for head injuries. It's fast.

564
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:39,210
It's a very effective at
detecting blood in the brain,

565
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,240
for example. So you can
detect that easily. And,

566
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,820
and for analyzing the structure
of bones and you know,

567
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:47,760
x rays are very good for bones.
If you've had or had a broken bone,

568
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,970
then you've probably seen an x
ray of the bones of your body.

569
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:54,660
And that's because bones
absorb x ray radiation.

570
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:57,840
And so x rays are very
good ways to detect it.

571
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,430
Okay.

572
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,510
I think that's where I
want to stop for today. Um,

573
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,580
and we talked about x ray radiation.

574
00:37:09,581 --> 00:37:14,200
I got some slides on here that say a
little bit more about ionizing radiation

575
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:19,060
and I put them on there for you to read
because it's not in the chapters in the

576
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:23,050
book. Uh, but this talks about
sources of ionizing radiation, uh,

577
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,550
a picture of sort of what it is and some
of the biological effects of ionizing

578
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:31,360
radiation. It's sort of beyond what
I'm going to ask you about, uh, in the,

579
00:37:31,361 --> 00:37:35,230
in the exams or anything.
But I wanted you to have that information.

580
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,820
And then next time we're going
to move on and talk about, um,

581
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,300
forms of imaging that
don't require x rays.

582
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:47,980
And so don't have the biological
risks of ionizing radiation.

583
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,220
We'll talk about ultrasound
imaging and MRI imaging,

584
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,840
and we'll talk about what I think
is going to be a, an important, uh,

585
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,620
imaging technique of the future,

586
00:37:56,621 --> 00:38:01,270
but using light to image inside
the body as well. Okay. Questions?

587
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,773
Okay,

588
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:09,590
good. Thanks. I'll see you on Thursday.
