1
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,860
So we're going to continue
talking today about, about DNA.

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,680
And in particular we're going to
focus today on sort of how to,

3
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,890
how to manipulate and use
a DNA in some applications.

4
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:27,720
And this is a huge area of,
uh, of science and technology.

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,430
Uh, you know, this, you can,
uh, it's, it's hard to, uh,

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,450
pick up a newspaper or a news magazine
without hearing some new application of

7
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,470
DNA technology.

8
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:41,370
So what I'm going to do is focus on sort
of a couple basic things that turn out

9
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:46,371
to be a really important
for general applications.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,420
And then I'll talk not in too much detail
about a few applications of DNA that

11
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:55,320
you're probably familiar with to try
to give you a, a framework, uh, to,

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,780
to hang this on. And uh, this, uh,

13
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:01,860
I think chapter three
describes fairly well. Um,

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,700
the things we'll talk about today and
you've probably already noticed that

15
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:10,170
there's some material that sort of set
aside from the text and in boxes and I

16
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,930
encourage you to particularly look
at those boxes for this chapter.

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,540
There's one on DNA
fingerprinting for example.

18
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,290
That gives you a little bit more
detail about that specific, uh,

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,740
about that specific technique.
Another one on, on, uh,

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,760
production of therapeutic proteins.
I'll talk about these both a bit today,

21
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,370
but I encourage you to read
those for more information.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,710
So I want to start kind of where we
left off last time we talked about the

23
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,030
structure of DNA,

24
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,060
how it works in terms of a physical
chemical model of the DNA molecules.

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,530
We talked about base pairing and
how that leaves to this process of

26
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:50,580
hybridization or very specific
matching between complimentary strands.

27
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,110
And we talked very superficially
about, um, about the,

28
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,850
the biological process
going from DNA to protein.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,710
So the process of transcription,

30
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,170
RNA processing and translation
to produce a protein.

31
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,860
And then I ended with this
picture that, that, um,

32
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,650
that shows you a little bit about control
of gene expression and the important

33
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:22,530
concept that while every cell in your
body has the capability of making all the

34
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:26,040
proteins that are needed
throughout your body,

35
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,550
not every cell is doing
that at any given time.

36
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,220
Only certain genes are being expressed.

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,900
And it's the family of genes that
are being expressed in a cell.

38
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,100
Likewise,
the family that are not being expressed,

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,090
that determines what a cell is like,
how it functions,

40
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,740
what's called the phenotype of a cell.
Um,

41
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,980
and we will talk more about this next
week when we start talking about cells and

42
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:55,650
a little bit about cell physiology.
Uh,

43
00:02:55,651 --> 00:03:00,430
but there are multiple mechanisms that
a cell can use to decide which genes it

44
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,850
is expressing at any one time
and which ones are not expressed.

45
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,310
And I showed you this
in this picture here.

46
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,380
And those levels of control can be
at the level of transcription. So,

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,610
and there are molecules in cells that,
uh,

48
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,680
give the DNA the signal that it's
time to transcribe and express a gene.

49
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,080
Those are called transcription factors.
We'll talk about them a bit later.

50
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,740
There's a interfering with RNA processing.

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,800
And I'm going to talk about that in the
next couple of slides because there's a

52
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:33,040
couple of new methods for um,

53
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,930
or potentially interfering
with gene expression in,

54
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:42,790
in living animals that have been
developed based on changing, uh,

55
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,710
interfering with DNA
transcription. And, uh,

56
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,750
and um,
and the ability of,

57
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,870
of messenger RNA to be translated and
you could interfere at these later levels

58
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,760
as well. For example, by, uh,

59
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,810
by augmenting a RNA degradation if the
messenger RNA for protein is not present

60
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,750
in a cell than the,

61
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,200
that that can't be translated
obviously in the protein can't be made.

62
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,970
So these two new medical therapies

63
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,810
that, um, that I mentioned are based on,

64
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,850
are interfering with the biology of RNA
and one is older than the other and the

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,240
older one is called antisense therapy.

66
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,020
And when you think about
a Jean or a transcript,

67
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,210
the messenger RNA copy of a gene,
uh,

68
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,260
you know that for every
sequence of a nucleic acid,

69
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,290
there's a complimentary sequence now
of the two complementary sequences,

70
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,110
one of them in codes, the gene, right?

71
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,860
One of them has the right sequence
of code ons to specify the amino acid

72
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:55,030
sequence of the protein. And the other
one has a complimentary sequence.

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,291
And you know,

74
00:04:56,291 --> 00:05:01,291
from our discussion last time that
these two complimentary strands are not

75
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:04,990
mirror images of one another and they're
not identical, they're complimentary,

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,270
right?
They face in the opposite direction.

77
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,270
And you could predict the
properties of one from base pairing,

78
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,960
a base pairing rules of the other,
but they're not the same.

79
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,670
So one of the strands and codes the
protein encodes for the protein,

80
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,504
the other does not.

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,950
The one that does is called the sense
strand and the other one's called the

82
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,120
antisense strand anti meaning it's the
compliment and it will hybridize to the

83
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:28,954
sense.

84
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,850
So what if you knew what
the sequence of a gene was?

85
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,480
A gene,
let's say it's the gene for insulin.

86
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,850
Um,

87
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,570
and I'll use that one as
an example because it's a
familiar one to most people.

88
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:47,440
And you know that the protein insulin is
made only in your pancreas and certain

89
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,550
cells of the pancreas.

90
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,410
So that means those cells are
continually making messenger RNA and that

91
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,110
messenger RNA is being
converted into protein. Well,

92
00:05:56,111 --> 00:06:00,560
what if you knew the sequence for the
Messenger Rna that made insulin and you

93
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:05,561
designed another single stranded DNA
or RNA molecule that was the exact

94
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:10,370
opposite, or the exact compliment
I should say, of that strand.

95
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,460
So you made somehow an antisense

96
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,580
Pauline nucleotide to the insulin gene
or some fraction of the insulin gene.

97
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,510
Well, that antisense strand
is shown here as the red

98
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,740
right,

99
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,740
and the sale is naturally making the blue
or since strand of messenger RNA for a

100
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:33,670
particular protein.
Well,

101
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:38,671
if somehow you could take your antisense
molecules that you'd made and you could

102
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:43,810
get them into cells,
then by this process of hybridization,

103
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,390
they would naturally
form a pair like this.

104
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:50,710
They would naturally hybridize and
form a duplex or a double stranded,

105
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,190
a double stranded,
a nucleic acid,

106
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,320
and when it's double stranded,
this gene can't be translated.

107
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,330
Okay?

108
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,440
All right.
When it's double stranded,

109
00:07:01,441 --> 00:07:04,650
it can't be translated because you have
to have the single strand in order for

110
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,830
the transfer RNA to bind and for this
process of translation to take place.

111
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,880
And so what you could do then,

112
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:15,060
if you could deliver these
red colored molecules here,

113
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,830
is you could stop specifically
the expression of this
particular gene in these

114
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:20,880
particular cells.

115
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,533
All right?

116
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,540
Now, what are the challenges there? Well,

117
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,510
you've got to be able to make this stuff
and you've got to be able to make it in

118
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,291
large quantities.

119
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:33,370
And we'll talk about how to make nucleic
acids in large quantities a little bit

120
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:36,940
later in the lecture here and you've
also got to get it into the cell.

121
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,960
And it turns out that getting
large molecules like this,

122
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,961
particularly large charged molecules
like nucleic acids inside of cells,

123
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:50,440
it's not so easy. And we'll talk about
that a little bit later as well. In fact,

124
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:53,320
we'll talk about that concept throughout
the course because one of the big

125
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:58,321
challenges of making these sort of new
biological therapies work in people to

126
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,220
treat diseases,
um,

127
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:04,660
is getting the right molecules into the
right cells at the right period of time.

128
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:05,471
Now,

129
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:10,471
I gave you the example of insulin and you
probably wouldn't want to stop insulin

130
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:13,810
production, right? That might
not be a good thing to do,

131
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,750
but what if this is a gene that's causing
a cell to be cancerous? It was just a,

132
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,061
it was,

133
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:23,950
it was a gene that was causing a cell
to be malignant and to divide without

134
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:24,970
control,
for example.

135
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,240
Then you could imagine blocking
gene expression would be a therapy.

136
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,130
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.

137
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,460
Why you'd want to do that? Yeah. So
you wouldn't want to stop the insulin,

138
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:37,190
for example,

139
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,840
they get back to what you might prefer
to do is start insulin production.

140
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:43,000
And we'll talk about ways
to do that in just a minute.

141
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:46,630
So these are ways to to stop
a gene from being expressed.

142
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,030
And there turns out there's
lots of applications in that.

143
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:54,031
Lots of diseases result from the unwanted
expression of certain kinds of genes.

144
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,740
And cancer is probably the best example
of that. But there are, there are many,

145
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,410
a newer version of this that,
that works in a similar way,

146
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,860
but a different way is
called RNA interference.

147
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:12,440
And it turns out that this is a natural
mechanism that cells have. And, and it's,

148
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:16,050
it's a, it's a mechanism that they
have evolved in order to present,

149
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,170
prevent foreign genes from entering a
cell and being expressed in that you have

150
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:26,970
mechanisms inside your natural mechanisms
inside your cell that allow the cells

151
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:31,500
to degrade unwanted RNA sequences.

152
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,960
And those mechanisms are called RNA
interference. You might. Um, um,

153
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,680
okay.

154
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,780
You might've heard about
this because it's a,

155
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,400
it's been quite an active area of
science of science and it turns out to

156
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:48,280
activate RNA sequence,
RNA interference,

157
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,430
you deliver double stranded RNA and
certain double stranded RNA sequences will

158
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,540
cause in the cell a process of degradation
of a very specific RNA sequence.

159
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,930
And this involves mechanisms
that are still being
understood. Uh, but if you're a,

160
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:12,190
if you've studied some biology
or read about this, you've
heard about, um, the, uh,

161
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,570
the, the uh, protein complex
called dicer and dicer is a,

162
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:21,000
is an internal cellular
mechanism for degrading our rns.

163
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,440
And um,
you might have also heard about the uh,

164
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,080
risk complex or the right or
the RNA silencing a complex.

165
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:32,890
And these are the biological mechanisms
that are involved here and only shown by

166
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:37,330
sort of orange arrows on this slide.
The end result is that you can,

167
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,100
you can design now very specific
double stranded RNA sequences that when

168
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:45,210
delivered into sales, again,
we'll activate this process of,

169
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:50,080
of natural degradation of
an existing messenger RNA.

170
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,990
And of course if you
degrade the Messenger Rna,

171
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,250
okay

172
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,610
at a rapid rate,
then you'll stop expression of the cells.

173
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,700
Now the Nice thing about this is that the,
the,

174
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,850
the degradation mechanisms seem to
persist for some period of time beyond the

175
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:09,730
time at which you deliver
the double stranded RNA.

176
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,620
Whereas obviously this mechanism here is
only going to exist for as long as the

177
00:11:14,621 --> 00:11:19,570
antisense sequence is present, right?
So this might be a longer lasting,

178
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,280
a more permanent form of, uh, of, uh, of,

179
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,510
um, elimination of the
expression of a particular gene.

180
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,093
Okay.

181
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,740
So I just wanted to introduce
those concepts because you've,

182
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,910
you've read about them.

183
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,900
We'll be talking more about about RNA
interference in particular as we go on

184
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:40,734
through the course.

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,760
The rest of the time I want to talk
about expression of genes of new genes.

186
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:46,740
So taking foreign genes,

187
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,880
genes that aren't naturally expressed or
might not even exist inside a cell and

188
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:54,580
putting them there and putting them
there in a way where work and by work,

189
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,060
meaning the gene gets expressed,
are translated into a protein.

190
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,930
And I'm going to start by talking about
a very specific and interesting form of

191
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,210
double stranded DNA called a plasmid.

192
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,570
And plasmids occur in nature and
plasmids turn out to be one of the most

193
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:17,350
powerful and simplest
examples of a vector,

194
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,180
what's called a vector for delivering,
uh, for delivering DNA into a cell.

195
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,730
And now the challenge is not just to
get the DNA that encodes a gene into a

196
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:28,151
cell,

197
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:31,510
the challenge is to get it into the sale
and a form where the cell can use it,

198
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,590
can express it and make
proteins from it. And, uh,

199
00:12:35,591 --> 00:12:39,790
so the plasmid has some features
which allow it to do that. Now,

200
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:44,170
to start with the plasmid is usually shown
in the diagram. Like this is a circle.

201
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,320
It's a double stranded
circular piece of DNA,

202
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,040
meaning that the three prime five
prime ends that hang off our,

203
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,210
our join back together again to form
a continuous, a continuous loop.

204
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,030
And again, these plasmids
occurred naturally in, um,

205
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,300
in nature that they were
discovered, uh, particularly in,

206
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:06,820
in microorganisms have plasma to that
confer biological properties onto them.

207
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,850
So this particular, this
particular example of a
plasma, it has several regions.

208
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:17,980
Now in your, in your book, there's an
example of a plasmid, uh, where, uh,

209
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:22,450
where I've given you the exact sequence
of nucleotides that makes up the whole

210
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:26,080
double stranded DNA molecule. You just
get, I just give you one of those, right?

211
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:28,720
Because you could write down
the other one because you know,

212
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:33,220
the other complimentary sequence
from base pairing. Um, but uh,

213
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,430
one of the things about these plasmas
that makes them very useful is that their

214
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:39,040
entire base pair sequences
known. So, you know,

215
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,120
everywhere on this picture you could
write down exactly what the sequence of of

216
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,710
nucleotides are that make
up this, uh, this vector,

217
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,340
this region here of
this particular plasma.

218
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:54,670
It is called the Ori or
origin of replication.

219
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,690
And remember we talked about how DNA
replicates itself and that there are

220
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:02,860
enzymes, DNA polymerase that
bind to the double stranded DNA,

221
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,860
separated denature it locally and then
start the process of replication, right?

222
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,380
So one of the properties that you would
like a plasma to have as you'd like for

223
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:14,560
sales to be able to replicate it,
to make more copies of it.

224
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,000
That way you could deliver a small number
of vectors and they could amplify into

225
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,200
a large number of vectors.

226
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,350
And so having a place that the cell knows
where the cell knows how to replicate

227
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,630
is important. And so plasma to
have an origin of replication.

228
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,000
The Blue Region here is a gene,
it's a gene that's on the plasma.

229
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,840
In this particular gene confers
a specific biological property,

230
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,500
two cells that have the plasmid
and can use it properly.

231
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,230
And the property it
gives here is called amp,

232
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,560
superscript r or resistance to ampicillin.

233
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,040
Ampicillin is an antibiotic.
Antibiotics are chemicals,

234
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:56,890
usually small organic molecules that
will kill microorganisms like, uh,

235
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,290
like, uh, like bacteria. And um,

236
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,990
and if they,

237
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:07,110
if a cell has a gene that makes
it resistant to Ampicillin,

238
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:12,111
and that means that that micro organism
can survive being exposed to this

239
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:16,010
normally deadly chemical,
uh, without dying.

240
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,230
And so this is one of the,
this is one of the biological properties.

241
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:25,430
The naturally occurring properties of
plasmids is that they exist in microbial

242
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,610
populations and they confer
on them resistance from
toxins that would ordinarily

243
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,670
kill them.

244
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,060
So being a microorganism that got a
plasma that gave you resistance to an

245
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:38,990
antibiotic would be a good thing that
gave you resistance to something that

246
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:41,780
naturally killed cells like you and
your environment would be a good thing.

247
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:46,310
But we're going to use that.
Uh, we're going to use that
ampicillin resistance in,

248
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:50,450
in, um, in technological ways. And I'll,
I'll, I'll describe that in a minute.

249
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,850
And the rest of this,

250
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:57,560
this sort of beige part of the molecule
here is called the poly linker part.

251
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,400
And this is where,

252
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,510
this is the region of the plasmid where
we're going to insert the DNA that we're

253
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:03,344
interested in.

254
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,360
We're going to have DNA that we would
like to make lots of copies of or we're

255
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,780
going to have DNA that we would
like to get expressed in a cell.

256
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,900
And we're going to put it in this
region that's called the poly linker.

257
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,100
And how we do that. Uh, we'll be,
we'll be clear in a, in a few minutes,

258
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,350
but this poly linker is as described down
here is a site where you can clone in

259
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,980
jeans.
Uh,

260
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:32,981
so let's assume that we have this
plasmid cloning vector and we have some,

261
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,060
uh, pieces of DNA that we would
like to put into a plasmid, right,

262
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:40,920
that we would like to make copies of.

263
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,710
And DNA cloning or any kind of
cloning just means making copies of.

264
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,050
So the process of cloning DNA is taking
a few strands of DNA of a gene that

265
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,260
you're interested in, in making
many copies of them. That's cloning.

266
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,910
You'd like to make identical copies.

267
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,580
And this vector is going
to allow us to do this.

268
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,780
The first step in the process
is to take our plasmid,

269
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:08,670
which we've selected and to insert
the gene that we want into it.

270
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,520
Okay?

271
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:10,941
For a minute,

272
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:13,640
just assume that we can do this and I'm
going to show you how to do it on the

273
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,890
next slide. Uh, but,

274
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,180
but the first step is to take the DNA
fragments that we're interested in and put

275
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:25,181
them into this vector by basically
cutting open the double stranded DNA and

276
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:29,420
inserting the gene that we like in the,
in the region where we've cut,

277
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,800
then we're going to take the
newly formed vectors that now are,

278
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,940
uh,
recombinant.

279
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,570
They're combined from at least
two different sources, right?

280
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,790
And the sources are one,
the plasmid vector that we've picked.

281
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,400
And the second is these genes that
for some reason we're interested in,

282
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,060
and they might have come from two
completely different places from two

283
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:57,060
completely different species from
different parts of the world, right?

284
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,520
And they're put together in a new way,

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,790
and that's why it's
called recombinant DNA.

286
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,150
And then we're going to take these,
uh,

287
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,180
these plasmid vectors and we're going to
somehow put them in contact with cells

288
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,290
in such a way that the cells in jest,
the DNA and they use it.

289
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:20,170
And in this particular example here,
uh,

290
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,740
we're exposing these
plasmids to bacterial cells,

291
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,510
and that's shown in this diagram as little
colonies of bacteria that are growing

292
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:32,230
on a plate. Okay. And you've
probably seen auger plates.

293
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:36,670
If you smear a solution that's
contaminated with bacteria on it, then uh,

294
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,510
then that bacteria will grow on this
auger rich medium and you'll get many,

295
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,530
many copies of the bacteria that you've
smeared at low density onto the plate.

296
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,220
And that's a way of culturing
or propagating bacteria. Well,

297
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:52,900
if you do that under the situation
where you've put your plasmid into these

298
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:53,734
microorganisms,

299
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,030
then you're going to have little colonies
that grow many copies of the bacterial

300
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:58,720
cells.

301
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,320
And hopefully each one of those cells
is containing one or more of the plasma.

302
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:05,110
It's that you're interested in and
those are being copied as well.

303
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,890
And so what you get on the plate is many
copies of the small number of plasmids

304
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,450
that you've put in.
Now,

305
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:18,010
how do you find those colonies on a
plate that have the plasma that you want?

306
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,990
Well, well that's, that's a trick and
there are multiple ways to do that.

307
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:28,170
But one way is to allow these bacteria
to grow on a plate that is loaded with

308
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:31,870
antibiotics like ampicillin.

309
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,750
If this plate has ampicillin in it,

310
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:37,450
then the only cells that
wouldn't be able to grow here,

311
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:39,910
our sales that have
resistance stamp facility.

312
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,700
And if you selected the cells right,

313
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,270
then the only ones that have that
resistance to ampicillin are the ones that

314
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:51,271
successfully got your plasmid and are
using this ampicillin resistant gene.

315
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:58,230
And you could imagine strategies where
you have multiple resistance genes on a

316
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:04,000
plasmid resistance to ampicillin to
penicillin, Erythromycin for example.

317
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,800
And you design strategies for
separating out which, which cells are,

318
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,400
um, are, are carrying the plasma
that you're interested in.

319
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,690
But this process of using a, a, um,

320
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,690
biological,
um,

321
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:24,780
a biological event like resistance to
ampicillin in order to pick out the cell

322
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:29,890
population that you're interested
in is called selection.

323
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,150
If we grew these cells on a plate loaded
with ampicillin and we could select

324
00:20:36,191 --> 00:20:37,990
cells that have ampicillin resistance,

325
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:41,830
and this process of selection in cell
culture is very important and we'll talk

326
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:45,790
about it more next day, next week. So,

327
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:50,791
so how did we put our gene fragments
into this plasma DNA in order to make

328
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:55,010
multiple copies of it or
to clone the gene? Well it,

329
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:57,850
it involves several steps.

330
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,260
The first step is we had to be able to
take this circular DNA and cut it to

331
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,410
create a site for our
new gene to be added.

332
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,620
And that cutting is done by uh,

333
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,650
by special proteins called restriction
enzymes and restriction enzymes or just a

334
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:19,240
kind of enzyme enzymes are protein
molecules that make a chemical reaction go

335
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:20,050
faster.

336
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:24,610
And the chemical reaction that
restriction enzymes do is cutting DNA.

337
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,380
And they do that in a very special way
and that they restriction enzymes are

338
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:33,940
able to identify a particular
sequence of bases in a gene.

339
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,540
There's whole families of restriction
enzymes. There are, there are hundreds,

340
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,370
thousands of them known now.
And each one has a specific character.

341
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,500
And one of the aspects of its character
is that it only binds and cuts at a

342
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,810
particular sequence of DNA.

343
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,330
And so this particular restriction
enzyme here recognizes this sequence, g,

344
00:21:58,331 --> 00:21:59,860
a, t, t, c,

345
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,710
and when it sees that sequence in
a, in a, a double stranded DNA,

346
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:07,330
it will bind there and it will cut.

347
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,910
Now another property of restriction
enzymes is that they always cut the DNA.

348
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,370
And the same way.
In this case,

349
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:18,220
this particular restriction enzyme cuts

350
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,510
symmetrically like this,
but not at the same point.

351
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,900
It doesn't cut straight across
the double stranded DNA,

352
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:28,990
but it cuts in this
jagged fashion that is,

353
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:32,950
it cuts between the g and the AA here
and it cuts between the g and the a here.

354
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,530
And so when it cuts,

355
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:41,130
it leaves sticky ends or unbased paired
a single stranded regions on each end of

356
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,380
the part, it's cut, right?

357
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,320
And that's just a property
of many restriction enzymes,
not all, some cut blunt,

358
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,970
just right down the middle.

359
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,880
Most restriction enzymes
also recognize symmetric,

360
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,880
a symmetric, a sequences
of DNA, g, a, t, t,

361
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:05,110
C for example.

362
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,700
If you do the base pairing goes exactly
the same sequence backwards down here.

363
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,970
That's an example of a symmetric sequence
and it happens that most restriction

364
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:15,850
enzymes also recognize those spaces.

365
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,720
Well if you cut and you
open up a segment of DNA,

366
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,060
then you've left these sticky ends,
for example.

367
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,990
And these sticky ends are capable of
recognizing each other by the process of

368
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,940
hybridization,
right?

369
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:35,941
So these will naturally want to reform
and they'll want to reform to reestablish

370
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,210
this base pairing and so they
could be pasted back together.

371
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,340
And the pasting process takes advantage
of this natural process of complimentary.

372
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,660
So this gives you a biological
mechanism for cutting,

373
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,430
using restriction enzymes

374
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,433
and then

375
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,130
you denature so that it falls apart and
then you re nature so that it comes back

376
00:23:59,131 --> 00:23:59,964
together.

377
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,690
Cutting involves a enzymes called
restriction agent and endonuclease's are

378
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:09,510
restriction enzymes which I've already
mentioned and uh, they have names,

379
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,920
restriction enzymes have names.

380
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:15,921
The particular one that does this function
here is called echo are one and the

381
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:17,040
names all look,

382
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:21,660
they're all italicized and their capital
letters and small letters so that they

383
00:24:21,661 --> 00:24:25,950
won't be easy for you to understand.
Uh, but they, but they are,

384
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,710
if you know the nomenclature,
easy to understand this,

385
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:31,170
this restriction enzyme was
founded in a natural source.

386
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:33,600
It was found in a micro
organism called ECO lie.

387
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,320
And the first three letters
of e coli or e, s c o.

388
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:41,940
So Echo it was found in strain
are a particular strain of e coli.

389
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,790
And it was the first
one found echo are one.

390
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,150
And so there's a nomenclature that's
evolved for this and now we know so much

391
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:48,811
about these,

392
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:52,080
they've turned out to be so useful
in biotechnology that there are whole

393
00:24:52,081 --> 00:24:56,250
catalogs that you can go to and buy
restriction enzymes and you can look up in

394
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,920
the catalog. What are the properties
of this restriction enzyme?

395
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,520
What base sequence does it recognize?
How does it cut,

396
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,520
what concentration do I
need to use to achieve that?

397
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,120
And so if you have a plasmid where
you know all the base pairings,

398
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:12,630
then you could go through that plasmid
and say, I want to cut it right here.

399
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,410
What restriction enzyme will do that?
Or You could ask the question,

400
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:21,120
I have this restriction enzyme at what
regions on this plasmid Willick cut,

401
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,683
right?

402
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,180
The pasting back together occurs
partly naturally by this process of

403
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:28,140
hybridization,

404
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,280
but hybridization only
reestablishes the base pairing.

405
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,180
You know that these molecules are also
linked in another way, right? Bad.

406
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:40,170
The phosphate bonds that connect the
three prime in the five prime carbons of

407
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,140
adjacent nucleotides.
And that doesn't heal naturally,

408
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,320
but can be reformed by other
enzymes called light gazes,

409
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,470
like aces reestablished
the phosphate bonds.

410
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,020
Yeah.

411
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,740
So,
uh,

412
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,420
how would I put in a gene that I'm
interested in into a plasmid? Well,

413
00:25:58,421 --> 00:25:59,290
the first,
uh,

414
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:03,100
the first step would be to cut open the
plasmid with a particular restriction

415
00:26:03,101 --> 00:26:03,910
enzyme.

416
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,910
And then what if I take
that same restriction enzyme
and I cut up the DNA that

417
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:10,450
I'm interested in?

418
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:16,020
If I cut both the plasmid and my DNA
of interest with the same restriction

419
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:21,150
enzyme, I'm going to end up with the same
sticky ends on both molecules. Right?

420
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,460
And so now if I put them in
contact with one another,

421
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,700
the plasma that's been
opened and fragments of the
DNA special fragments that

422
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:32,050
I've produced with the
same restriction enzyme,

423
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,000
they'll have the same sticky ends.

424
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,100
They will naturally
hybridize with one another.

425
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,240
I apply ligase and I've got
the plasma that I have before,

426
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,760
but now with my Jean
colored green here inserted.

427
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,890
Right.
Yeah,

428
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,550
that's a really good question
because if I open this up,

429
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,810
why wouldn't it just reform with itself?
Why would it want to have this in here?

430
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:03,900
And, and the answer is it will
want to reform with itself.

431
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,790
And if I have these in solution,

432
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,690
then how many reform with itself and
how many reform with the molecule I'm

433
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:12,960
interested probably depends on the
relative concentrations of both in the

434
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:17,790
solution and what conditions I have at at.
So it's a statistical process.

435
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:22,200
Some are going to reform and some are
going to reform with the gene in and some

436
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:25,680
are probably aren't gonna reseal it all
under the conditions that I've used.

437
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:26,130
Right.

438
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:31,130
So not every plasmid in your test tube
is going to have the right gene inserted

439
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,470
in the right way.
Um,

440
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:40,490
so one way that you can look for that
gene that you want is by making the cut in

441
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:44,670
your plasmid

442
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,470
inside of a gene that encodes for
some property like resistance to an

443
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:57,300
antibiotic.
If this reforms,

444
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,450
so the plasmid reform
back to its native state,

445
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,250
that resistance will be recovered.

446
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:08,370
So bacteria that get an unloaded
plasmid are going to have resistance to

447
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:11,010
antibiotics.
If your gene goes in,

448
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,910
you've interrupted the gene for antibiotic
resistance and those new organisms

449
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:17,010
aren't going to be resistant
to antibiotic anymore.

450
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:22,250
And so you could use sort of negative
selection in order to find the ones that

451
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,960
you want.
I don't know if that makes sense or not,

452
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,830
but yeah,

453
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,910
so,
so some do,

454
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,300
but there's an advantage to having the
sticky end there and that you can put

455
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,134
things back on.

456
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,160
But there are also methods to chemically
produce a sticky end where you can take

457
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:48,150
blunt ends and you can add specific
nucleotides onto one of the,

458
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,430
one of the DNA chains by either doing
chemistry on the three prime or the five

459
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,800
prime end and create your own sticky hand.

460
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:01,010
So sometimes a blunt cut is useful if
you want to sort of grow a sticky end of

461
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:04,950
your choice on it.
And,

462
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,990
and you're starting to see that there's
all different ways that one could take

463
00:29:08,991 --> 00:29:12,620
advantage of this fairly simple
process of cutting and pasting. And,

464
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,520
and that's why, um, molecular biology,

465
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,740
one of the reasons why it's turned
out to be such a powerful tool.

466
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:20,360
Because if you can think creatively,

467
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:24,620
you can find all different ways to
using these very simple principles to

468
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:29,390
recombine molecules to make
unique new DNA sequences,

469
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,643
right?

470
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,260
Where does the DNA sequence come from?

471
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,410
I want to spend a little time talking
about that and let's say we've got a human

472
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:42,760
gene that we want to make and let's say
it's the human gene for insulin that we

473
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:43,750
want to produce now.

474
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,220
And so all the cells in your body
have the gene for insulin in them,

475
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,780
only cells in the pancreas. Some cells
in the pancreas are making insulin.

476
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,290
So one way I could try
to find the gene for, uh,

477
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,360
for human insulin is to take any
cells from, from any of us skin cells,

478
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:06,190
let's say. And I could identify where
on the Chromosomal DNA that, um,

479
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,250
that, um, insulin is likely to occur.

480
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,300
And I could cut that up into fragments
and I could search in these fragments to

481
00:30:13,301 --> 00:30:17,440
try to find the one that has a
insulin, the insulin gene on it. Now,

482
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:21,850
the problem with that is a problem I
mentioned before that most human genes are

483
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:26,851
not just a straight sequence
from beginning to end of
the protein that you're

484
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:28,240
interested in.

485
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,960
There are in coding regions called
Exxon's and those are interrupted by

486
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,880
noncoding regions called introns.

487
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,750
And if I cut up just
DNA from the chromosome,

488
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,900
what's called Genomic
Dna, uh, then I'm gonna,

489
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,220
then I'm going to have both Exxon's
and introns within the fragments that I

490
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:48,910
create. That might be a
good way to do it, but,

491
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:51,730
but it's going to be more of a
challenge, right? Because you might,

492
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,950
you're going to have a lot of these non
coding sequences that are in the way and

493
00:30:56,951 --> 00:31:01,951
alternate way is to go to the cell
that's making the protein that you want.

494
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,390
And if it's making the protein you want,

495
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:07,270
it must be producing messenger
RNA with that gene on it.

496
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,080
And that messenger RNA that's being
used has already gone through the RNA

497
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:15,160
splicing mechanism. And so the
introns have already been removed.

498
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,490
And if I could isolate that messenger
Rna Messenger RNA is just a copy of the

499
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:23,440
DNA from which it came,
right?

500
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,460
So if I could do the process
of reverse transcription,

501
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,940
that is instead of transcription,
which goes from DNA to RNA,

502
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:33,700
if I could go backwards from RNA to DNA,

503
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:37,060
I could recover a DNA version of
the gene that I'm interested in.

504
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:41,080
And it turns out that we can do that
now because we have an enzyme called

505
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,400
reverse transcriptase,

506
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,550
which is able to take single
stranded a messenger RNA and make uh,

507
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,070
and make DNA out of it.

508
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,310
Now you've heard about reverse
transcriptase someplace before, right?

509
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,770
Anybody heard of reverse transfer?
HIV?

510
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:01,780
HIV is a natural virus that, that,
that contains an enzyme in it.

511
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,880
Why does it contain reverse
transcriptase in it?

512
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,150
Because HIV is an RNA virus
and if it enters your cell,

513
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:14,620
the only way it can replicate it can
put its DNA into your cells is by first

514
00:32:14,621 --> 00:32:17,860
making DNA out of its RNA genome.

515
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:21,490
We're going to talk more about
this later. Uh, but um, so,

516
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,760
so reverse transcriptase is a
naturally occurring protein.

517
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,100
It has a biological function.
And HIV,

518
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,630
but we can use it for a technical logical
function here by going backwards on

519
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:36,580
the biological path from messenger
RNA to uh, to, uh, to DNA.

520
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,730
Now, DNA that's produced this way is not
called Genomic Dna because this doesn't

521
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:45,560
match the, it does not match the DNA in
your genome on your chromosomes, right?

522
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:46,550
The introns are gone.

523
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:51,320
Now it's called CDNA or complementary
DNA to indicate that it's a copy,

524
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,780
a complimentary copy of the Messenger Rna.

525
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,780
But this is a much more
efficient way to get,

526
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,640
to get a DNA for a gene that you're
interested in for a couple of reasons.

527
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:05,210
One is the processing has already been
done, so the introns are already out,

528
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:07,890
so you don't have to figure out what's
the Exxon and what's the in Tron.

529
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:11,720
It's already done for you. Plus,
if you're looking for insulin,

530
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,350
okay,

531
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,180
if you're looking for
the gene for insulin,

532
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,460
you're going to cells that
are making it already.

533
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,680
They have abundant messenger RNA,

534
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:23,180
so it's much easier to
separate out and identify the,

535
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,810
the gene that you're interested in.

536
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,140
You're not fishing through a whole
chromosome in order to find what you want,

537
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,510
but you're going to a cell
that's already enriched in it.

538
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,330
Does that make sense?

539
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,850
I want to talk about one other technique
and then I'm going to give you some

540
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:42,960
examples about how to, how to use these
in the last in the last few minutes,

541
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:43,611
but the,
the,

542
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:47,820
the technique I want to talk about is
one called polymerase chain reaction and

543
00:33:47,821 --> 00:33:52,470
this is another way to clone or make
many copies of a gene of interest. Now,

544
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:56,370
one of the big advantages of plasmids I
already mentioned is that you can take

545
00:33:56,371 --> 00:33:58,470
this plasmid and a plasmid is a,

546
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:03,600
is you could think of it as a highly
tuned machine for copying itself,

547
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,890
right? A plasmid is a highly tuned
machine for making copies of itself.

548
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,440
You take that plasma and you put
it in the right micro organism,

549
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:11,071
you're going to make many,

550
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:15,930
many copies of that plasmid and we're
cloning a gene of interest to us by sort

551
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:20,730
of hijacking that biological mechanism
by putting our gene on this plasmid.

552
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:25,140
And so our gene gets copied many times
as the plasma. It gets copied many times.

553
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:27,120
So that's a way of cloning DNA.

554
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:30,720
Here's a note that that's a biological
way of cloning it and we're using

555
00:34:30,721 --> 00:34:33,720
biological mechanisms
and we're growing cells.

556
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,510
Yeah.

557
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,560
In order to accomplish it. Here's a way
that you can do it in a test tube, uh,

558
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,210
without using any cells by this process
called polymerase chain reaction.

559
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,860
And I'll describe how it works here you
have a fragment of some kind of DNA that

560
00:34:47,861 --> 00:34:51,520
you would like to, that you would
like to clone or make many copies of.

561
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,050
Yeah.

562
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,380
Now in general, these
are small fragments, uh,

563
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:59,830
but they're not whole genomes,
but there's some small piece of DNA,

564
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,440
maybe the size of a,
of a protein,

565
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,520
and you put this Chromosomal Dna or this
DNA that you're interested in double

566
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:08,800
stranded into a test tube.

567
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,280
And you do that together with
primers and with nucleotides.

568
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,240
Because if you're going to synthesize DNA,
you need the raw material of DNA,

569
00:35:16,241 --> 00:35:16,451
right?

570
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:20,800
You need the individual nucleotides and
you add a special DNA polymerase called

571
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:24,310
Taq polymerase.
And Tech Polymerase is polymerase.

572
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:28,330
That was identified a DNA polymerase
that was identified from an organism that

573
00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:30,620
lives in regions of the earth,
where there that are,

574
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,200
they're constantly at high temperature.
Tack stands for Thermos. Aquatic is,

575
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,170
it's a marine microorganism that near
lives near these hydrothermal events in

576
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,220
the bottom of the sea.

577
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,460
And they live under very high
temperatures and pressures all the time.

578
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,460
And so their enzymes are tuned.
Unlike our enzymes,

579
00:35:47,461 --> 00:35:51,900
which are tuned for working most
efficiently at 37 degrees centigrade,

580
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,230
tack is used to living
at 90 degrees centigrade.

581
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,820
And so it's enzymes operate most
efficiently at this elevated temperature.

582
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,150
Um,
and so you take advantage of that.

583
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:08,010
You put it in a test tube together with
nucleotides and primers and your DNA,

584
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,720
and now you start a process,

585
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,780
a cyclical process where the first step
in the process is denaturing the DNA.

586
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,560
And you can do that by gently
adding heat and making it basic.

587
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,770
But you make the two DNA strands separate
when they separate the primers that

588
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:29,901
you've added automatically bind right
through the process of hybridization.

589
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:36,050
And then you turn up the temperature to
the optimum per taq polymerase and DNA

590
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:37,620
synthesis starts.

591
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:43,050
That polymerase starts a process of
replication of your DNA sequences.

592
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,640
So you, you, uh, first separated your DNA,

593
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,050
let the primers bind,

594
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,860
then turn on the enzyme and it
makes copies of each one of these.

595
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,870
You then denature again,
each one of these strands get separated.

596
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,560
Primers bind, turn on the
polymerase. A new strand is made.

597
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,520
And if you repeatedly go through this
cycle of denaturing synthesizing,

598
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:12,150
denaturing synthesizing, you'll
get many, many copies of DNA.

599
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,350
The number of copies you get depends on
how many times you do the cycling, right?

600
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:20,400
And you'll get, if you have, if you
start with, if you start with only one,

601
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,990
you know,
two pieces of DNA,

602
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,680
then you'll get a two to the
nth fragments after end cycles.

603
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,710
Because each cycle you're producing,
you're doubling the number.

604
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,150
This has turned out to be a very powerful
technique because it's relatively

605
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,880
rapid.
It's totally synthetic.

606
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,800
There's no microorganism involved in
making the, making the, making the,

607
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:43,300
uh, um, uh, DNA for you. Uh,

608
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:47,550
so you can do it very rapidly in a
laboratory and fairly inexpensively now.

609
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,990
And it's really been a powerful
tool in, in, um, in, uh,

610
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,860
molecular biology because I might
have a very small copy of a,

611
00:37:55,861 --> 00:38:00,000
of a gene that I'm interested in and I
can make enough copies that I can start

612
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:02,350
to do something else with it.
All right.

613
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:08,030
You can also use PCR to identify specific
genes that are present in a biological

614
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:13,770
sample. So you can use PA
PCR for fingerprinting as
well for looking in a, in a,

615
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:18,030
in a, some unknown fluid, for example,
is a gene that I'm interested in there.

616
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,660
And you could use PCR to do that
because if you amplify a gene in PCR,

617
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,280
that gene had to be
present from the beginning.

618
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,153
Right?

619
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,560
Well, let's talk about some
mechanisms for using this.

620
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:38,561
And I'll start with a simple example
of how one can detect a gene in a,

621
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:43,090
in a, um, in a fluid, in a
blood sample, for example,

622
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,010
where that gene is unknown.

623
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:49,210
And this takes advantage of the very
specific properties of a restriction

624
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:54,040
enzymes. And this particular example
involves the gene for sickle cell anemia.

625
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:59,260
Sickle cell anemia is a
disease that affects a subset
of the population and it's

626
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,810
a single gene defect.

627
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:06,811
And we know exactly where the the
genetic defect is in sickle cell.

628
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,420
It's on the gene for hemoglobin.

629
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,680
And the hemoglobin that that you produce
if you have sickle cell anemia is not

630
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:17,530
quite right because
there's one, uh, a meat.

631
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,930
There's one based difference if you,
um,

632
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,570
if you have normal hemoglobin, you
have this sequence here, CCT g, a,

633
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:30,490
G, G, g. In sickle hemoglobin you have,

634
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,400
I sequenced, it's only slightly
different within the gene CCT, g,

635
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:40,840
T, G, G, a, g. So there's a, there's a
thei mean that substituted for an Alanine.

636
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,870
And that results in making
hemoglobin that's not quite right.

637
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:48,780
That doesn't function in the
same way as as, uh, as uh,

638
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,130
the normal hemoglobin gene does.

639
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,940
So how could I identify in a chromosomal
DNA sample whether the sickle gene is

640
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:02,770
present? But one way you could do
it is by saying, if, if I have this,

641
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,530
if I have this one base pair difference,

642
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:10,890
then this sequence is going to be cut
by a specific restriction enzyme that

643
00:40:12,881 --> 00:40:17,740
recognizes the sequence
CT, g, a, G, G, a, right?

644
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:18,880
And that restriction enzyme,

645
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:21,790
there is a restriction enzyme
that does that and has MST three.

646
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,560
If I took this same restriction enzyme
and tried to cut the chromosome ml DNA of

647
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:31,120
a sickle patient,

648
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,360
it wouldn't cut at that point
because the wrong sequence is there.

649
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,430
So here's how can I, how
can I find that, right?

650
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,100
Here's a difference between,
uh,

651
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:46,890
between normal hemoglobin and
sickle hemoglobin. I can make a,

652
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,110
I can see a chemical difference. I can
exploit it. How can I find it? Well,

653
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,690
the way to find it is by
using a process called, uh,

654
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,610
called electrophoresis
and southern blotting and
electrophoresis is described in

655
00:40:57,611 --> 00:41:01,810
the chapter here. I'll just describe
it briefly. If you have DNA fragments.

656
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:05,140
So this is DNA that you've cut up into
fragments using restriction enzymes,

657
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:09,940
for example. You load them into the
top of a Gel and the Gel is, uh,

658
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:12,940
is, uh, in this case it's
a synthetic polymer gel,

659
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:17,160
but it looks very much like Jello. And
I'm sure some of you have, have, uh,

660
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,490
have dealt with, uh, electrophoresis
gels in the past and it's really just a,

661
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,200
a slab of something like Jello where
you can put a sample at one end of the

662
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:29,230
Jello,
your sample of fragmented DNA.

663
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,280
Now you apply electrical charge
across that Jello because it's a gel.

664
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,400
Electricity is going to move through
the jail because they're ions in it the

665
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:41,680
same way for the same reason. You
don't drop a, uh, a, uh, uh, um,

666
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,860
electrical device into the bathtub,
uh,

667
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,970
because charge moves through
water that has ions in it, right?

668
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:51,360
Charge is going to move through this
gel and DNA is charged, right? It's,

669
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,710
it's loaded with
phosphates, which are, uh,

670
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,530
which are negatively charged and they're
going to move from a negative pole to a

671
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:01,520
positive pole. And so they're
gonna move through this Gel. Well,

672
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:04,880
if you've created fragments here and
they're fragments of different size,

673
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:07,220
the small ones are going to
move faster than the big ones.

674
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,770
And so the DNA is going to get spread out
on this gel according to size with the

675
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:15,110
small ones going farther
and the short and the,

676
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:17,030
and the large ones not going as far.

677
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,460
So if I can run the Gel for some period
of time, run the electrical fields,

678
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:25,610
spread it out,
and now if I can stay in in some way,

679
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,170
if I can somehow label the DNA seq
fragments that I'm interested in,

680
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,220
I could find out where those fragments
are on this gel and I would be able to

681
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,840
predict their size because
how far they moved,

682
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,470
dependent on how big they were.
So how would I,

683
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,930
how would I label this
DNA? Well, the, the,

684
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:53,970
the best way to label this DNA is by
designing probes or labels that hybridized

685
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:58,700
with specific sequences that
you're interested in, right?

686
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:03,701
So this label is DNA that might be made
radioactive or made fluorescence and it

687
00:43:03,741 --> 00:43:07,220
has a base pair sequence that is from
some other region of the gene that you're

688
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,054
interested in.

689
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:13,130
And so it's only going to
bind to fragments that contain
that piece of the gene,

690
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,133
right?

691
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,650
And it will make those
visible to you in some way.

692
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:22,490
So you can see where your gene traveled.
Now,

693
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:25,790
something similar to this as the basis
of DNA fingerprinting that's described in

694
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:29,210
one of the boxes in your book. In this
specific example, what are we going to do?

695
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,430
We're going to take a chromosomal DNA,

696
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:33,860
we're going to digest it
with this restriction enzyme.

697
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,220
We're going to put it in this tube and
run it on a gel and we're going to see

698
00:43:37,221 --> 00:43:40,730
what results down here
in a normal cell DNA.

699
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,380
That DNA in the normal cell, this DNA
gets cut by the restriction enzyme.

700
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,910
So the sickle gene ends up or so the
hemoglobin gene ends up in two pieces.

701
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,480
One that's 0.2 kilo bases long and
one that's 1.1 kilo bases long.

702
00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:00,560
Kilobases a thousand base basis.
And so when I look for it here,

703
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm going to see two pieces.
One that's uh,

704
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,620
nearly the same length and
one that's much shorter.

705
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,690
If this was a sickle patient, so they
didn't, so they had this gene instead,

706
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,710
it wouldn't get cut.

707
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,670
And when I went to look for that
presence of that gene on this gel,

708
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,820
it would appear as one large segment
instead of a large one in the smaller one.

709
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:28,070
And so the absence of this smaller region
tells you that this sample came from a

710
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:30,040
sickle patient.
Right?

711
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,440
And so you can imagine other ways of
doing this or why is it doing the same

712
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:35,520
thing in different ways,

713
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:38,670
but it takes advantage of the
specificity of the restriction enzymes,

714
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,320
the fact that we know what
the gene sequence is that
we're looking for and using

715
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:44,130
this,
uh,

716
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,960
this technological process
of electrophoresis to
identify changes that we

717
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:49,794
predict.

718
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,390
That's, yeah, go ahead.

719
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,850
Yeah. This is just one particular
example of how to, how to do it,

720
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:03,820
but you could imagine.

721
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,830
So you have to identify something
that's unique about it and then design a

722
00:45:07,831 --> 00:45:10,530
method for identifying that unique thing.
And here,

723
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,340
the unique thing was that there's
a restriction site inside that is,

724
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:19,140
it's is present in normal
DNA and not present in, um,

725
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,070
in sickle DNA. But if you could
identify some other change,

726
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,000
you could do it as well.

727
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,463
MMM.

728
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:30,690
Another example of,

729
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,580
of using this techniques is to
produce therapeutic proteins from,

730
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,880
from cloned DNA. And I'm, I'm
going to describe this one.

731
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:42,850
This will probably be the, the, um, uh,
the last example I have time for and I'll,

732
00:45:42,851 --> 00:45:46,010
so I'll go through the rest of
them quickly in the next lecture.

733
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,990
But here for example,

734
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:53,300
the idea is to make many copies of a
protein for use as a pharmaceutical.

735
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,120
So now here's an example where
we'd like to make insulin.

736
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,050
We're having the insulin gene would be
useful if we could take the insulin gene

737
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:03,560
and make many copies of the
insulin protein. That would
be a very useful thing.

738
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,700
And it turns out that there's lots of
proteins that have value as therapeutics

739
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,260
and there's a list of them here and some
of them you'll recognize a wreath wrote

740
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:14,030
poetry in, uh, commonly called HIPO.

741
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,080
And its function is to treat
anemia because it stimulates
blood cell production.

742
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,430
You might think that its
function is to make you a more,

743
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,580
a better cyclist, but that's
not its only function. Uh,

744
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,640
it's used to treat people that have,
you've heard about HIPO and

745
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,200
blood doping.

746
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,060
Everybody's tired something.
Yes. Yeah. Uh, but it,

747
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:40,450
but it's a therapeutic protein as well
and very useful for patients with the

748
00:46:40,451 --> 00:46:45,080
anemia. Um, so how do you make
many copies of a cloned DNA? Well,

749
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:49,820
one way is to do just exactly what we
talked about before. Take a plasmid,

750
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:53,690
cut it open, insert a gene
that we want into the plasmid,

751
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,190
and then put that plasmid in a host
cell and let the host replicated.

752
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:59,900
Now in this case, the host, you,

753
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,260
you want the host not only
to replicate all the DNA,

754
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,270
you want it also to express the gene.

755
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,360
You're not just trying to clone the DNA,

756
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,130
you're trying to also clone or make many
copies of the protein. And so that's a,

757
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,810
that's a slightly different thing,
right?

758
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:18,590
Because we want not only
for the cell to be able to,

759
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:20,330
okay,

760
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:21,830
synthesize the DNA.

761
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:25,220
You want it to be able to express
the protein off the DNA as well.

762
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,850
And so that requires
designed at a different,

763
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,740
not only does it have to have an origin
of replication which works so that you

764
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:37,240
can synthesize the DNA. The gene has to
be inserted together with a promoter,

765
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,280
and that promoter is a sequence,

766
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:44,310
a DNA sequence that the host will
recognize as a signal to transcribe and

767
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:46,690
translate this protein.

768
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,650
We'll talk more about promoters
as they go on. For now,

769
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:54,400
let's just assume that we have a promoter
that works in this particular cell.

770
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,250
The promoter in this case
is called the Lac promoter.

771
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:02,430
And normally in a micro organisms that
lac promoter is used to produce a gene

772
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:05,230
called, um, called Lac z,

773
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:09,940
which makes a protein called Beta
Galax societies Beta galactus sideways.

774
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:15,180
What we're going to do is
take this plasmid with its
promoter gene construct in

775
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:16,774
it and,

776
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,780
and engineer it to take out the LAC z
gene leaving in the promoter and putting

777
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:25,870
in the protein that we want the,
the gene for the protein that we want.

778
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,360
In this case, it says it's a GCSF, but
it could also be insulin. For example.

779
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,070
Now, when we put insulin in this
place behind the right promoter,

780
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:41,440
the cell thinks that it still
has the Lac z gene present,

781
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,430
which it needs for its metabolism.

782
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,850
And so it's going to express this gene,

783
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,180
but you've put a foreign gene in
the place of the natural gene.

784
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,810
And so the foreign gene
gets expressed instead,

785
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,660
in this case GCSF or it could be insulin.

786
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:06,310
And now if I take this cell and I
grow it under the right conditions,

787
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:11,550
that is under conditions in which the
cell would normally express the Lac z

788
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:13,174
gene,

789
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,340
it's going to express our
gene instead and presumably,

790
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:21,640
hopefully make large cop
in large quantities of it.

791
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,720
So this was a process that was perfected
on an industrial scale by the company

792
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:30,250
Genentech in California
in the, uh, in the 1970s,

793
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:35,430
the first therapeutic protein that was
produced was insulin to treat diabetes.

794
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,041
Before that,

795
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:39,160
diabetics have been treated with insulin
that came from a different source,

796
00:49:39,161 --> 00:49:44,161
usually from pigs so far by harvesting
and purifying a insulin from pig

797
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:50,110
pancreas. And now most diabetics
take human insulin made,

798
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,660
uh, made not in humans, uh,

799
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:57,370
but made in a micro organisms that
are growing, uh, in, uh, in um, uh,

800
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,630
manufacturing facility.

801
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:05,380
That is a way of putting a clone gene
into a microorganism and then using that

802
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:07,720
microorganism has sort of
a factory for the protein.

803
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,570
You could do the same thing in
mammals. And here's one, uh,

804
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,260
one quick example of that using
a different kind of a vector,

805
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,930
but inserting a gene into,
uh,

806
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,110
into the fertilized egg of a mammal.
In this case,

807
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:24,820
a sheep and the biology of this is more
complicated than what I described before,

808
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:29,900
but you can inject this DNA into a
egg of a sheep and then implant that

809
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:33,500
fertilized egg with the foreign DNA
that's been micro injected into it,

810
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,940
into a foster mother.

811
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,350
If that leads to the birth of a,
of a,

812
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,640
of a young sheep, hopefully that
she has this gene encoded in.

813
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:48,410
It's a genome now and it will
express the protein that you wanted.

814
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,550
A one example of the way people have
used this is that they've taken the gene

815
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:57,551
that ordinarily produces a milk protein
and they put a gene like the insulin

816
00:50:58,611 --> 00:51:00,800
gene in place of the milk protein,

817
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:06,910
but behind the promoter that that
is used to produce milk proteins.

818
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:12,550
So this gene is going to be turned on
in the sheep when it makes milk under

819
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:17,270
conditions where it makes milk. And if
the sheep grows up in the right way,

820
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:19,850
and people have shown that this will work,
you can milk the sheep,

821
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,630
the sheep has milk, the milk
has insulin in it, right?

822
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:27,830
So here's an example of
using a large animal by, by,

823
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,200
by inserting the gene
that you're interested in,

824
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:33,680
you can make this animal into a factory
for the kind of protein that you would

825
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:34,880
like to make.

826
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:38,360
So I'll finish talking about these
examples at the beginning of lecture on

827
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,630
Tuesday.
I'll see you this afternoon in a section.
