1
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,240
So we're going to continue talking
about a tissue engineering. Uh,

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,610
today I introduced the subject on a
Tuesday and I'm going to talk about some

3
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,540
more examples that sort
of illustrate this,

4
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,690
a new approach to creating
a medical therapies.

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,260
And so I just wanted to
remind you before about the,

6
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:36,290
about the two readings that are already
posted on the website and to encourage

7
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:39,700
you to uh, to look at those, um,

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,790
to get a sense for how the field has
developed over the last 20 years or so.

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,273
So,
and,

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,540
and last time I use this sort
of outline as a guide to have,

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,680
uh, at least my view of the
characteristics of tissue engineering.

12
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,300
We talked about it at the beginning of
class last time as a logical extension of

13
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:04,730
conventional medical and
surgical practices. And, uh,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,730
in that sense a solution,
potentially a solution to the,

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,080
to the limited,

16
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,730
a number of donor donor organs that
are available to treat diseases where

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,040
transplantation of tissue is the only,

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,100
only option that many approaches to tissue
engineering involve regulating your,

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,270
your body's natural response.
We can heal in many cases and regenerate.

20
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,410
And the liver is a,
for example,

21
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,450
is a fabulously regenerative Oregon.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,770
If you go into a laboratory animal like a,
like a rat,

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,350
if you remove two thirds of their liver,

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,580
their liver will regard grow within
a period of a couple of weeks.

25
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,370
The liver has an amazing
regenerative capacity,

26
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,950
but there are human diseases where that
regenerative capacity is overwhelmed. Um,

27
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,640
and uh,
infection can be that kind of a disease.

28
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:00,780
Hepatitis infection for example.
Cirrhosis is that kind of infection.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,860
And when you,

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,270
when you get past the body's
natural ability to heal itself,

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,570
then transplantation is the only option.

32
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,660
And in tissue engineering we might be
thinking about a different strategy.

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,840
Could we provide some,
um,

34
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,110
some support for the
body's own ability to heal?

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,470
Could you provide a little bit of extra
liver tissue that would allow the body

36
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:28,290
and opportunity to compensate
for, uh, for its loss?

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,180
So, so tissue engineering involves control
or regulation of the normal healing

38
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,980
process. And a, today I'm going
to start by talking about, uh,

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,730
how it attempts to replace or supplement
the sailor component of disease tissues.

40
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,360
When, uh, when a tissue
is diseased, for example,

41
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,450
when we talked about the,
um,

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,640
the coronary arteries
and needing a bypass,

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,670
you're adding extra cells or extra
tissue there because medical therapies,

44
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,230
at least the ones we have now are not
effective at reestablishing the blood flow

45
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,830
pathway,
right?

46
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,700
So you're adding new cells and they
have to be cells that are in the correct

47
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,050
configuration,
right?

48
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,430
They have to be sells like a vessel and
they have to be performing the function

49
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,770
that cells ordinarily provide.

50
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,780
And I talked about how we couldn't use
completely synthetic materials to replace

51
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,740
that blood vessel,

52
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,890
even though a synthetic material would
provide a conduit for blood because the

53
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,760
material properties aren't right,

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
it isn't the same as the
natural cellular layer,

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,440
then blood coagulates on the surface,

56
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,800
it doesn't provide that normal
function that sales provide.

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,640
So we want to think about ways to replace
or supplement that cellular component.

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,810
Okay.
So let me talk about one example.

59
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,510
And this is an example
that, um, that, that uh,

60
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:57,790
I've been working on in my
own lab together with uh,

61
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,440
two different laboratories at the medical
school, Jordan Poba in immunology. And,

62
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,540
um,
and Al Bothwell in immunology.

63
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,160
And it really uses a strategy that's been
used in laboratories around the world

64
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:13,480
to try to reestablish
a tissues in animals.

65
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,290
And the technique is fairly straight
forward in shown in this cartoon that,

66
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,100
uh,
cells are cultured.

67
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,320
So these are a special cells in a,
in a couple of different ways.

68
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:31,321
One is they are human cells and they are
harvested from human umbilical veins,

69
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,140
right?
So the umbilical vein,

70
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,540
which is normally discarded
after delivery, the baby is born,

71
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,770
the umbilical cord and the
placenta are ordinarily discarded.

72
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,720
If you keep that tissue,

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,430
you can isolate the cells that
form the lining of that tissue.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,840
It's a vein.

75
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,580
And what you get from this isolation are
endothelial cells and it's abbreviated

76
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:00,220
here. H, U. V, e. C Hugh Vec.

77
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,400
That stands for human umbilical
vein endothelial cells.

78
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,490
And people have learned over the past,
uh,

79
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,320
past few decades how to maintain these
cells in culture, how to propagate them,

80
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:15,420
how to increase them, a number using the
same techniques we talked about. Uh, neat,

81
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,020
very near the beginning of the course.

82
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,200
They've also discovered how to genetically
modify these cells so that they

83
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,180
perform better in culture.

84
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:30,181
And one of these modifications is to add
a gene called BCL two and BCL two is a

85
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:35,941
survival gene that allows these cells to
live beyond when you would expect them

86
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:36,790
to live.

87
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,750
If you just take human umbilical vein
and Athelia cells and you propagate them

88
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:44,260
in culture, you can, you
can, you can passage them.

89
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,900
You remember the process of passaging
from one tissue culture to another,

90
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,750
always getting more and more cells.

91
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,940
You can do that for some
limited period of time,

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,430
but if you give them this
survival gene BCL two,

93
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:59,190
you can do that for a much longer period
of time. You can get more cells, right?

94
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,830
So cells are grown from
human, uh, from human tissues.

95
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,610
Now the idea is to somehow get these
cells into an animal or into a patient and

96
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:14,900
get them to reform blood
vessels inside the patient.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,970
And the way that,
uh,

98
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,400
this has done is that these cells are
suspended in a three dimensional jail.

99
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,550
So this is a gel of Collagen and it
looks just like this scanning electron

100
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,670
micrograph on the side.
If you look at very high magnification,

101
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,850
it's just a web or a network of protein
fibers formed from the natural protein

102
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,390
Collagen.

103
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,390
And we talked about Collin's role in
the extra cellular matrix earlier here.

104
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,370
This is,
this is isolated Collagen,

105
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,300
purified and then formed into a gel
and cells are suspended within it.

106
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,870
That's what this picture down here is to
show you. This is a high magnification.

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,120
A cell in here would be almost the same
size as this whole picture would be a

108
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,540
cell.
And so you can imagine each cell,

109
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:10,541
but suspended in this three dimensional
material is surrounded by a webbing of

110
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,640
protein fibers, right? And
it has a thickness, right?

111
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:20,870
So unlike normal cell culture where
we grow in flat on a plastic dish,

112
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,260
these cells are suspended
within a three dimensional jail.

113
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Now there's something else in this
gel here, and that's shown here.

114
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,200
These are particles, particles
made of the, uh, of the, uh,

115
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,010
material algenate and in
section a few weeks ago,

116
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:41,450
you all made particles like this, right?
We made them with food coloring in them.

117
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,920
Uh, but you, you, you learn the
process. It's quite straight forward.

118
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,900
And imagine that instead of putting
a food coloring in it like we did,

119
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:56,020
you put in a protein and you selected
that protein to be one that encourages

120
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:57,950
blood vessels to form.

121
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,430
It's a protein that your body naturally
uses to cause blood vessels to form more

122
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,604
readily.

123
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,140
And that protein is called vascular
endothelial growth factor or vegf.

124
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,690
It's not important the details,
but it's a,

125
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,200
it's a signal that the body
uses to form new blood vessels.

126
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,870
We've isolated it,
purified it,

127
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,050
and encapsulated in these tiny particles
which are then suspended with the cells

128
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,493
in the jail.

129
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,250
So what you have here is something that
you might call a neo tissue. Uh, what,

130
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,500
what we would like to become a tissue
when we implant it back into the animal.

131
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,790
It's not a tissue yet.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's a collection of cells
and extracellular matrix
and signaling molecules that

133
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,580
are arranged in a three
dimensional structure.

134
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:47,810
And the hope is that if you put these
back into a patient or put them back into

135
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,940
an animal,
like the mouse shown here,

136
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,740
that you would grow new blood vessels.
Okay.

137
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,510
That's the hope.
So how does this work?

138
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,060
And this is some early
work that was done by, uh,

139
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,790
Jordan [inaudible] here
in the school of medicine.

140
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,070
And there's a lot of pictures here.

141
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,740
This is from a paper that I could give
you if you're interested in reading in

142
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:10,890
more detail,
but I want you to focus on this one here.

143
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,200
So what they did was they,

144
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,470
instead of taking this gel and
putting it right into the animal,

145
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,330
they maintained it and culture for awhile.

146
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,960
And the idea was that in culture you
can control the conditions that the neo

147
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,190
tissue develops within.

148
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,840
And maybe you can control them in such a
way that the tissue gets a start toward

149
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:34,500
being what you would like it to be.
And in this green picture here,

150
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:35,550
I don't know if you can see it,

151
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:40,020
but this posted online and you could
blow it up and take a look at it. Um,

152
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,050
what you see is that these cells have
organized into tube like structures and

153
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,870
you'll see tubes clearly here in
this jail where you don't see them.

154
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,540
So clearly in the other green images here.

155
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,630
So these are the cells
I talked about before,

156
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:58,860
the ones that are genetically modified
with the survival protein so that they

157
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,240
survive in culture.

158
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,400
And it turns out that
this survival protein also
encourages their formation into

159
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:05,711
tube,

160
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:10,110
like structures that are starting to
look like blood vessels if you wait the

161
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:13,950
proper period of time and then
implant these gels into a mouse.

162
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,940
So here they just made a small incision
in the skin and slip the gel underneath

163
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:19,710
the skin and left it there.

164
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,000
Then these tubes develop
into blood vessels.

165
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,270
Now that would be cool enough on its own,

166
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,420
but it does something more in that this
gel that's now filled with blood vessels

167
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,690
does two things. One is that the
vessels start to differentiate.

168
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,890
Some become like capillaries,
some become like veins,

169
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:44,891
some become like arteries and they start
to connect to the vascular system of

170
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:48,054
the mouse.

171
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,800
And so if you wait long enough and you
look by electron microscopy inside these

172
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:56,040
gels, you will find many, many
blood vessels that look like this.

173
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:58,680
This is a cross section in this panel.
Be Below.

174
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,000
You can see the endothelial cells have
formed into a capillary. It's a tube.

175
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,710
Not only is it a tube, but here's a
mouse blood cell inside of it. It's a,

176
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:11,190
it's a tube that's now carrying
mouse blood through it.

177
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,820
So you've created new pathways
for blood to flow right now.

178
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,250
That's a neat trick.

179
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,460
And you could imagine using
that to treat disease.

180
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,760
One way you might use it to treat disease
is to implant these things into areas

181
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,670
of the body that where there
aren't enough blood vessels.

182
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,560
For example, um, many, uh, many, uh, um,

183
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,210
uh, adults, uh,

184
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,110
get vascular deficiencies in their legs
and these could result from trauma,

185
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,570
some from just the
natural process of aging.

186
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,590
Some from diseases like diabetes and the
blood vessels in your legs don't work

187
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:55,300
anymore. And if you're not
delivering enough blood to your leg,

188
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:59,590
the tissues become ischemic
or derive deprived of oxygen.

189
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,090
But what if you put one of these
patches into that area where you weren't

190
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,900
getting enough blood flow and you could
create new blood flow and that's what

191
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,340
this experiment shows here.

192
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,110
Treating an ischemic limb with one
of these patches and what you see

193
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:18,790
particularly in high magnification is
that lots and lots of new blood vessels

194
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,990
form and they connect back to the major
vessels that are already in the leg,

195
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,270
so you've created new blood flow pathways.

196
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,570
One could imagine using this in
the heart for example as well.

197
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,670
When you have tissue that's deprived
of oxygen because of a heart attack,

198
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:37,330
for example, or loss of
flow. That's one idea.

199
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,060
Another idea is that you could use these
to create sort of miniature organs in

200
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:47,680
that what if instead of just
putting endothelial cells in there,

201
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,500
we put other cells in there as well.

202
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,760
What if you put liver cells in together
with the endothelial cells and the

203
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:58,450
signaling molecules? What if you put
cells from the pancreas in there?

204
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,460
Then maybe this gel would develop
not only into a vascularized tissue,

205
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,230
but into a vascularized tissue that
contained liver cells or cells from the

206
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:10,570
pancreas or sales from the kidney.

207
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,550
And maybe those cells would start
to function like a little tissue,

208
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,570
right? So maybe you could
make a system that supports

209
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,880
deliver. In the case of the natural
liver is developing. This is,

210
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,990
this is one of the central
ideas of tissue engineering.

211
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,490
Okay. One of the other, uh, um,

212
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,680
that I think illustrates one
of the reasons why tissue
engineering has become a

213
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:44,830
viable alternative at this
point in our scientific, uh,

214
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,820
in the scientific culture.
Because we know how to culture cells,

215
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:53,560
we know how to genetically manipulate
cells and we know how to put them in these

216
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:55,570
kinds of micro environments
like I've shown.

217
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,870
The other thing that we've
learned how to do is look,

218
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,340
and I mentioned this last time,

219
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:05,341
is to make synthetic materials that
could serve as artificial extracellular

220
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:06,514
matrices.

221
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,910
And this slide shows a number of materials
that were made in laboratories here

222
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:16,630
at Yale. Uh, one of them
is a network of fibers.

223
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:21,631
Now this should look reminiscent to
the Collagen picture I showed you a few

224
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,701
slides ago,
right?

225
00:14:24,701 --> 00:14:28,330
It looks like a a network of
fibers that are all wound together.

226
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,870
Now the fibers here are much bigger
than Collagen fibers. In fact,

227
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,050
a cell here would look very tiny on this
scanning electron micrograph where it

228
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,420
filled up the whole thing before.

229
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,170
So we're thinking about fibers
at a different scale, right?

230
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,090
These are large fibers.
In fact,

231
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:47,710
these are the same kinds of fibers that
are used same size and in some cases the

232
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:52,490
same actual fibers that are used to
make, uh, the materials in your clothing.

233
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,660
Clothing is made of fibers
that are woven together.

234
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,770
Now this is a non woven mesh,
so the fibers are randomly arranged,

235
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,730
but their fiber's not unlike the kinds
of fibers you would find in cloth

236
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,290
material that we make into
clothing at high magnification.

237
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,890
These are cylindrical fibers.
There's lots of space in between them.

238
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:18,010
And so you could fill these fibers up
with cells and cells would cling to the

239
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:23,051
fibers and potentially
grow within this scaffold.

240
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,450
This is a different kind of architecture
of a scaffold but made of the same sort

241
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:33,350
of material, synthetic polymers, uh,
but here instead of making fibers,

242
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,170
a porous structure was made
that looks like a sponge.

243
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,120
And so there are the walls of the
material that give it substance.

244
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,280
And there are lots of spaces in between,

245
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,370
much larger than sales that you
could fill up with sales. So why use,

246
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,650
why you synthetic materials when I all
you showed you an example of how you

247
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:56,300
could use a natural material. Well,
there's a couple of advantages.

248
00:15:56,301 --> 00:16:00,800
One is that we know a lot about
how to process synthetic materials.

249
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:05,660
Now we can make them into almost anything
that you want and you can control

250
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:09,590
their structure on the microscopic
scale as I've shown here.

251
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,610
And you can control their structure
on the, on the larger scale as well,

252
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,380
which I'll show you in a few minutes.
Uh,

253
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,690
the other advantage is
that these particular, um,

254
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,810
these are different than the kinds of
fibers that are woven into clothing

255
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:27,380
because these intentionally
degrade over time.

256
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,970
So these are synthetic polymers that
will slowly dissolve over a period of

257
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,880
months.
And so one could make a scaffold,

258
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,360
build a tissue around it,
implanted in the body,

259
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,120
and then this scaffolding
which slowly disappear.

260
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,190
And what you hope is that as the,

261
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,300
during the time period when this
scaffolding scaffolding is disappearing,

262
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,390
genuine tissue is being
formed in its place. Okay.

263
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:55,240
And that's an advantage of
these materials as well.

264
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,600
That because they're polymers we can uh,
we can um,

265
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,050
control to a fairly high degree how
fast they degrade and what products they

266
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,824
degrade into.

267
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:14,370
So this shows you an example of tissue
engineering where these kinds of

268
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,350
materials I showed you on the last side.

269
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:21,130
So microscopically they'd look
like this up on the top panel here.

270
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:26,830
Macroscopically or with your eye.
This is just a photograph from a camera.

271
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,100
You could make these thick materials full
of all this webbing of fibers and you

272
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:37,960
could, you could form them into
different shapes, a triangle, a square,

273
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,760
or a cross in this shape here. Now because
this is a synthetic solid material,

274
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,180
it maintains its shape even
if you put it into water.

275
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,920
And because it's a porous material,
as I showed you before,

276
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,480
you could fill this up with cells.

277
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,290
And the experiment that was done
here is that these materials,

278
00:17:55,291 --> 00:18:00,291
these porous materials were seated with
cells from cartilage and the cells that

279
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,720
make up cartilage are called chondracytes.

280
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,940
And so samples of Cartlidge were obtained,
digested down to individual cells.

281
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,480
Those cells were grown in culture until
you had a lot of them. And then sells.

282
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:15,150
We're put here, put here, put here,

283
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,970
and then they were
implanted back into animals.

284
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,070
And here's what comes out of the animal
several months later. And what you see,

285
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,850
uh, is material that looks
very much like Cartlidge.

286
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,470
Okay.

287
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,940
A couple of things are interesting.

288
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,080
One is that these things have maintained
their shapes even though they were

289
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:37,860
implanted into animals for many months.
So the shape that you make,

290
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:42,090
the original material in leads to
a tissue that's that same shape.

291
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,990
If you look microscopically
inside these tissues,

292
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,110
you'd find that they look like
Cartlidge in many respects.

293
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,730
They look like natural cartilage and that
is the chondracytes or the individual

294
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:58,020
cells that we put on here multiplied
inside the body, inside the scaffold,

295
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,350
and they filled it up.
They filled up the space.

296
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,760
And so the tissue that you get looks
like the scaffold that you use,

297
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,333
right?

298
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,680
This is a microscopic
image of some of those.

299
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:14,260
So imagine you cut this
one in it down the middle,

300
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:17,980
and then you looked under a microscope.
This is what normal cartilage looks like.

301
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:21,100
You can see the chondracytes
here, the white, uh, regions,

302
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:24,880
and the chondracytes excrete
an extra cellular matrix,

303
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:28,060
which is stained red in
this particular preparation.

304
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,110
If you look at this cartilage that
was formed by tissue engineering,

305
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:36,430
you'll see some structures here, some long
structures. These are residual fibers.

306
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,910
The polymer fibers haven't
completely degraded at this point,

307
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,850
but you see a lot of cells,
a lot of healthy cells,

308
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,450
and you see they're almost at the same
density that they are in the natural

309
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,021
cartilage.

310
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:51,170
So the cells have multiplied to reach
sort of a natural state and they're

311
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:53,260
secreting an extra cellular matrix.

312
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,430
They're making their own micro
environment by secreting molecules.

313
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,340
And so they also stain red.

314
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:01,310
Yeah.

315
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,990
Now it's not as deep.
Red is here.

316
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:07,850
They're not making as much
as natural cartilage do, but
they're on their way. And,

317
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,870
and um,
so here's an example of taking a material,

318
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,660
being able to fashion it into a
particular shape that you want.

319
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,340
Being able to control the microstructure
so that you can put cells in it in such

320
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:23,790
a way that the cells develop
into something that's
starting to look very much

321
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,190
like tissue. Now. Um,

322
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,123
okay,

323
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:34,110
this was done, um, in the late 1980s,

324
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,130
I believe. And at this time the
scientists that were doing it,

325
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:42,690
we're trying to make the point that there
was a lot of potential for this kind

326
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,870
of, of a, of a strategy.

327
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,790
And one place where white want
to make new cartilage is in, uh,

328
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,450
it plastic surgery. So people that, um,

329
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,500
that have lost tissue due to
cancer or to a birth defect,

330
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,740
maybe they're missing some
cartilage in their nose.

331
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,770
There are diseases where children are
born without functional cartridges,

332
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,350
cartilage in their rib cage.

333
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,370
There are even some traumas where
people might lose an ear, right?

334
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,890
In your ear is basically
skin covered with cartilage.

335
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,560
So they did this experiment mainly to make
a point and a, so I'll show it to you.

336
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,500
Instead of making a triangle
or a square or across,

337
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,330
they made a polymer scaffold that
looks a little bit like a human year.

338
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:29,840
Okay?

339
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,470
And they filled this scaffold.
This is 100% polymer.

340
00:21:33,471 --> 00:21:37,610
Now there's no tissue in here.
But then they added a cartilage cells.

341
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:41,900
They added Chondracytes and they
implanted it back into an animal at a site

342
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:45,110
where they could easily see it. They
implanted it into the ear of a rabbit.

343
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,390
And over time,

344
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:51,590
what happened was the cartilage cells
that were in this scaffold grew into

345
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:55,730
cartilage in the same shape
as the scaffold that they use.

346
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,020
So here's a what looks like a human
ear growing on the ear of a rabbit.

347
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,893
All right?
Um,

348
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:06,580
so a dramatic demonstration if and when
they took this ear out of the rabbit,

349
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,960
obviously it, it's not a real ear.
It doesn't here, right? But it has,

350
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:13,600
it's all the cartilage that forms
the outer part of your year.

351
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,720
And if you took a section of
this later and looked inside,

352
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,660
it looked just like the
cartilage that's inside your ear.

353
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,633
Yeah.

354
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,760
Well you could use this same strategy
to make other kinds of tissues as well.

355
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,960
And I'm going to return to the example
of coronary arteries because that's such

356
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:34,580
a big medical problem around the world.
Coronary heart disease,

357
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:39,581
heart disease is either the number one
or number two killer around the world.

358
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,030
Certainly in countries that
are developed like the u s uh,

359
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,970
heart disease and cancer are
the leading causes of death.

360
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,960
And a lot of the deaths from heart disease
comes from failure of your coronary

361
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:52,710
arteries.

362
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,760
So one of the most performed surgical
operations in the United States is

363
00:22:56,761 --> 00:23:00,580
coronary artery bypass surgery.
And you probably all know somebody who,

364
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,250
who has got it, maybe, maybe, uh,
maybe a grandparent or, um, or, or,

365
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:08,970
or a family friend.
And so it's not an uncommon surgery

366
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,120
and it's not perfect yet.

367
00:23:11,121 --> 00:23:13,610
And we talked about the ways
that it's not perfect last time.

368
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,890
So what if you could grow outside of the
body blood vessels that you could use

369
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:22,190
to replace, uh, the vessels
inside of a patient.

370
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,500
And people have been working
on this for a long time.

371
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:29,501
So here's an initial attempt and this
is a tube that was made of a polymer and

372
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:33,590
in this case it was a polymer
was a natural polymer collagen.

373
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,800
So sort of like that college and Gel
that I talked about several slides ago,

374
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:44,840
that we suspended the endothelial
cells in only this time. It's um,

375
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,790
it's into the form of a tube.

376
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:52,220
And the idea was to take those endothelial
cells and coat the inside of this

377
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:57,170
tube with endothelial cells.
So make a tube that's mechanically strong,

378
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,550
that will stay like a tube,

379
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,560
but coated with the natural cells that
form the lining inside your blood vessels

380
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,410
and allow it to develop and culture
to the point where you have a natural

381
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:14,710
endothelial cell lining and then implant
this back into an animal in place of

382
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:16,880
its own artery.

383
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,340
And what you hope is that blood will flow
through here and it should flow cause

384
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:22,461
it's,

385
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:27,410
there's an opening and that the blood
won't clot because now instead of a

386
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,300
artificial material, you have a lining
of blood vessel cells on the inside,

387
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,693
right?

388
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,550
This is a picture, uh, from, uh,

389
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,540
studies that were done in the
early 1980s on this approach.

390
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,960
And there was some success. You could
make them work for some period of time,

391
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,520
but they always eventually failed.

392
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,610
And I won't go through
the whole history of this,

393
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:53,060
but there's a long history of
people trying different materials,

394
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,450
different ways of putting cells
on different sources of cells,

395
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,500
all the things that you could imagine
changing and all of them working for a

396
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,790
little while and then failing.

397
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,050
And you can imagine it's
a hard engineering problem
at difficult engineering

398
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:10,850
problem because you need to make this
material strong enough that it serves as a

399
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:15,530
vessel, right? It's got to
withstand blood pressure, not burst.

400
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,270
It's gotta be strong enough to put a
stitch into because you've got to sow this

401
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:21,440
into the natural artery.

402
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:24,380
So it's got to have good
mechanical properties on its own,

403
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,770
but still allow the formation of a
natural tissue around it and all those,

404
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,740
all those criteria turned
out to be difficult to meet.

405
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,270
I want to talk in, in, in, in
detail about it in advance.

406
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:43,380
That was made by someone
who's now here at Yale,

407
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:46,950
a woman named Lauren Nicholson and
she's in our department of Biomedical

408
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,870
Engineering and anesthesiology. And uh,
when she started looking at this problem,

409
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,120
she thought, well, everything that's done,
you know, it's, it's working kind of,

410
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:59,760
but it's not quite working well enough.
And that the vessels,

411
00:25:59,761 --> 00:26:04,710
when you put them in the body, they don't
develop the way that normal vessels do.

412
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,600
They don't develop a normal structure.

413
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,900
And she thought maybe that's because
we're not exposing them to the,

414
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,190
to the kinds of environments that
arteries normally develop under.

415
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,290
And when our art or is developed
during embryonic development,

416
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,150
they developed as the heart developed,
right.

417
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,600
And while they were developing and turning
from just collections of cells into

418
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:34,680
arterial tissue,

419
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,810
they were exposed to flowing blood
because the embryonic heart was already

420
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:40,470
beating.

421
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,470
There's already an immature circulatory
system and these arteries develop in the

422
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,960
presence of a beating heart.

423
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,620
So what if you simulated that in cell
culture and took these tissue engineered

424
00:26:55,441 --> 00:27:00,441
structures that are polymer scaffolds
filled with the right kinds of cells and

425
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:06,261
you hook them up to on both ends to a
tube where you can expose them to blood

426
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:13,491
flow and blood pressure and build a
reactor around these blood vessels so that

427
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,660
as they're developing outside the body,

428
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,250
you can control the conditions that
they're grown under so that it's close to

429
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:26,640
the conditions that unnatural artery
would experience when it's developing

430
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:27,600
inside an embryo.

431
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,920
And so this shows some of the things
that she did in order to create this, uh,

432
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,080
to create this environment.
Here's a picture of a bioreactor.

433
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,180
Here is an artificial blood vessel that
she made in the laboratory. And again,

434
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:44,160
this is a polymer scaffold,

435
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,110
the same kind of scaffold I showed
you several slides ago of a material,

436
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,370
uh, uh, uh, a network, an unwoven, uh,

437
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:57,470
Fiber Mesh and formed into a tube smooth
muscle cells or the internal cells of

438
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:01,290
the artery are cultured inside.

439
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,190
And then it's placed in this reactor and
you can see it's hooked up to two tubes

440
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:05,431
here.

441
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:10,431
So blood is constantly flowing through
the inside and it's flowing in a

442
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:13,280
pulsatile manner, just like our, uh,

443
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,610
our blood is flowing through our
coronary arteries or our artery.

444
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,500
And she found that if she did this,

445
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,950
they developed into
tissues that looked much,

446
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,951
much more like real arteries and that you
could take these and implant them into

447
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:32,730
animals. And one is shown here in the
carotid, in the, this is in the neck of,

448
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,680
um, of um, a large animal, I think either
as sheep or a pig, I'm not sure which one,

449
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,660
but it's stitched into place.

450
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,590
The animal then leaves the operating
room with a new blood vessel,

451
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:47,940
which you can study by using imaging
techniques and you can follow this blood

452
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:52,350
vessel. And they've done this for many,
many months now, even years in some cases.

453
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,760
And you can form vessels that are smaller
than any that have been transplanted

454
00:28:56,761 --> 00:29:01,050
in this way. And um, and they
maintain their function in culture.

455
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,610
So I show this because I
think, what is it? It's an,

456
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,190
it's an exciting example of
tissue engineering. It's also,

457
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:12,390
I think a good illustration of one of
the advantages of tissue engineering in

458
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:17,391
that you can create a tissue outside
by arranging things together.

459
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,410
You can maintain it under controlled
conditions in the laboratory until it's

460
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:26,580
ready to be transplanted. And then you
can transplant it at the right time.

461
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,540
And all of these things are under control
so it could be optimized to produce

462
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,940
the best quality tissue.
In this case,

463
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:37,290
they've cultured the vessels for eight
weeks in order to get the kind of

464
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,190
function that they want.

465
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,270
I think you can imagine from
these examples I've shown
you lots of different, uh,

466
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,860
ways that you could
build outside the body,

467
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,400
neo tissues or structures
that will develop into,

468
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,800
into hopefully real tissues.

469
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,530
And this illustration is
just to sort of show you, uh,

470
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,790
all of the kinds of tissues that at this
point in time people have tried to make

471
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,290
using, uh, using tissue
engineering approaches. Uh,

472
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:11,860
many of you might know a Aaron Lovick
in our biomedical Engineering Department

473
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:13,090
who's been working.
Uh,

474
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,880
it has some fabulous results on tissue
engineering to create spinal cords to,

475
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,180
to treat injured spinal cords.
Um,

476
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,810
and there's many examples like this.

477
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:27,400
There's already tissue engineered skin
that's available for physicians to use.

478
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,790
And the other thing I tried to show you
with this diagram is that what you're

479
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,090
trying to achieve,

480
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,260
while you might be using the same
approaches that I've shown here,

481
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,230
you're trying to achieve different
things in different tissues.

482
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,650
Some things you're trying
to replace structure mainly.

483
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,470
So if I'm trying to use this
approach to make new bone,

484
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,990
I'm trying to make new
structural material.

485
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,430
What I care about is the mechanical
properties of the tissue that I create,

486
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,773
right?

487
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:01,260
At least like I care about that a lot
of bone that cannot form perform the

488
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:06,640
mechanical functions of bone
is not a very good bone, right?

489
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,530
It has to have the right elastic modulus,
which we talked about earlier.

490
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,480
And in other tissues you're trying
to replace metabolism or the cellular

491
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,790
biochemistry that goes on inside the cell.

492
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:23,560
So in the liver you don't care so much
about the mechanical properties of the

493
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:26,200
liver. You care that all
the cells are performing,

494
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:30,340
all the metabolic properties that
are liver ordinarily performs.

495
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,420
That table of things I showed
you last time in the pancreas.

496
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:39,100
In the same way you're trying to create
a tissue that forms a metabolic function.

497
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,240
And in the pancreas,

498
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:44,950
one of the most important metabolic
functions is that it senses glucose and

499
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:48,130
Secretes Insulin in response to glucose,
right?

500
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,950
You don't care about the structure,
you care about the metabolism.

501
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,240
And there are some things like, um, like
blood vessels where you're in between.

502
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,040
A blood vessel needs to perform.

503
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:02,050
A mechanical function needs to serve as
a physical plumbing to carry blood from

504
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:06,760
one place to another, but it also
performs a biological function. It,

505
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:11,680
it carries the blood and it anti
coagulates at the same time it stops

506
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:15,520
coagulation, right? And
there are many other, uh, uh,

507
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,610
bio biochemical functions
at blood vessels perform.

508
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,700
Okay. That next, uh,

509
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,980
aspect of tissue engineering I want to
focus on is that tissue engineering often

510
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:30,010
uses cellular processes
to control drug delivery.

511
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,650
So this provides a new
way to do drug delivery,

512
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:36,610
to supplement the kinds of engineering
approaches we talked about a few weeks

513
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:39,500
ago. Now how might you do
that? Well, let's imagine,

514
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,940
just look on this side of the slide here
and imagine you have a hollow fiber.

515
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,140
So a hollow fiber is a fiber that has
an outside diameter and then it's hollow

516
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:55,340
on the inside made of some
kind of synthetic material.
So it might look like a,

517
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,010
like a straw, you know, like a straw
that you drink through. Uh, only, uh,

518
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,140
only the straw has special
properties. And in general, it's much,

519
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:06,050
much thinner than this than
a drinking straw would be.

520
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:10,790
So this might be a millimeter across,
instead of,

521
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,940
you know, several millimeters
like a drinking straw would be,

522
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,190
and you fill this up with cells,
you fill up the hollow fiber with cells,

523
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,250
and the fiber is a special material
in that one. It's biocompatible,

524
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,290
so you can implanted in the body and the
body doesn't respond adversely to it.

525
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:32,510
And two, it has a controlled,
uh, has controlled,

526
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,140
uh, porosity so that
molecules can pass in and out.

527
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,330
So it's porous.
It allows molecules to pass in and out,

528
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,450
but it doesn't allow cells
to pass in and out. Right,

529
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,910
so it's a filter.

530
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,710
It's a porous filter that allows
small molecules to go in and out,

531
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,140
but doesn't allow large
molecules to go in and out.

532
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,940
Now this is filled up with cells and now
I show this cutaway so that you could

533
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:02,030
see inside, here's a little
clusters of cells growing inside,

534
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,450
but it's a full cylinder in reality and
the ends are sealed and I implant this

535
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,223
into the body.

536
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,590
Let's say I put it into the abdominal
cavity or I put it under the skin.

537
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,520
What you would like then is for these
cells to be able to communicate with the

538
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:23,270
body through molecules,
but not directly, right?

539
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:28,450
They're isolated from the body because
this hollow fiber is surrounding them

540
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:34,100
everywhere. And what if these
were cells from the pancreas?

541
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:35,930
Yeah.

542
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,730
Then maybe glucose,

543
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,270
blood sugar could could diffuse or move
through the wall of this hollow fiber,

544
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:46,970
exposing these cells to glucose.

545
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:51,170
The cells would sense the glucose is there
because their sales from the pancreas

546
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:52,430
and they're functioning normally,

547
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,530
and they would secrete insulin in response
to glucose and the insulin would flow

548
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:02,450
out and then into blood
vessels outside here. Now,

549
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,020
why go to all this trouble?
Why not just inject these cells?

550
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,410
Why not just inject these
cells right into the body?

551
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,460
Why surround them by this hollow fiber?

552
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,853
Okay.

553
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,630
What do you think would happen if you
just injected them under the skin or you

554
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:25,920
injected them into the abdominal cavity?
Kaitlin?

555
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,090
Yeah.

556
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,260
They would be recognized as foreign by
the immune system and unless they were

557
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:33,220
yourselves,

558
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,760
and you need this treatment because
cells aren't working properly,

559
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,510
right? So you don't have any
pancreas cells to contribute.

560
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,690
So the sales either have to come from
somebody else and aloe graft foreign to

561
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:50,340
you,
or it could even be a xenograft.

562
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,450
It might be cells from another species.
They might,

563
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,460
they might be sales from a pig,
for example.

564
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,980
And it turns out that the insulin that
pigs make is very similar to human

565
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:04,020
insulin. Not exactly the
same, but very similar.

566
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,210
And so for decades and decades until
we discovered ways to make recombinant

567
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:14,211
human insulin in the 1980s pig insulin
was the primary source of insulin to

568
00:36:14,851 --> 00:36:15,930
treat diabetics.

569
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,740
So why not use cells from a species
where cells are readily available and put

570
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:31,311
them inside of a capsule like this so
that they're separated from your immune

571
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:36,831
system but still able to
function as a pancreas?

572
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,900
In a sense, it's functioning as a drug
delivery system. The drug here is insulin,

573
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,270
but it's a smart drug delivery system
and it has the intelligence of the cells

574
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:51,600
that are encapsulated inside.
And it's smart in what way?

575
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,280
It's smart in the fact that it can detect
the presence of glucose and Secrete

576
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,170
Insulin only when Glucose,
glucose is present and insulin is needed,

577
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,810
right? So if this was used to treat
diabetes, if you are a diabetic,

578
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:11,490
you wouldn't have to be checking your
glucose levels and adjusting how much you

579
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,420
inject because you'd have a system
inside your body that's doing it

580
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:19,140
automatically in the way,
hopefully that a normal pancreas is.

581
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,710
And what I show on the left hand
side of the graph here is, um,

582
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,490
some different configurations that people
have now made using the same concept.

583
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:34,100
It doesn't have to be a hollow fiber, but
you can make a, you can make a, um, um,

584
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,150
um, uh, micro capsule like this.

585
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:40,410
And remember when he made the algenate
particles in, uh, in the section meeting,

586
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,510
um,
uh,

587
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:46,530
we mentioned that not only could you put
food coloring inside these particles,

588
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:49,590
but maybe you could put cells
inside these and you can,

589
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:54,180
you can put cells inside these particles
and make little capsules that have

590
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:55,410
cells on the inside,

591
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,860
but it's surrounded by a barrier that
keeps them away from the immune system.

592
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,250
And there are a variety of other
ways of doing this as well. Again,

593
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:06,000
this next slide just shows you the
advantage of this strategy here.

594
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:08,880
The dashed line is the membrane,

595
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,720
whether it's formed by a hollow
fiber or an Algenate, a hydro gel,

596
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,520
a seal engineered cells are in the inside.
Uh,

597
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,450
now I talked about putting
cells from an animal inside,

598
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:26,451
but maybe you could genetically engineer
a Beta cells so that they function for

599
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:27,600
a long time.

600
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,130
Maybe you could take a patient's own
diseased cells and genetically engineer

601
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:34,740
them so they work properly
and then give them back.

602
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,640
Or maybe you could take a cells from
the pancreas of an individual donor,

603
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,080
genetically engineer them so
that they grow in culture, right?

604
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:48,740
And then they'd be available to
treat lots of patients. Um, and uh,

605
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,750
the idea is that nutrients,
oxygen, glucose can come inside.

606
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,640
Insulin can come back out,

607
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,660
but that the immune system
won't recognize it as foreign.

608
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,810
Now this is an idea that's also
been around for a long time.

609
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:03,400
There's been a lot of people
that have worked on it.

610
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,840
Great progress has been made.

611
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,310
It turns out to be a
tremendously challenging
engineering problem because you

612
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:14,260
need to engineer a material that's
compatible with the body that doesn't,

613
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,580
that allows only the passage of certain
molecules and not other molecules, right?

614
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,760
It has to allow insulin to
pass, but not antibodies. Uh,

615
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:27,090
it has to do that very reliably without
allowing any immune system components to

616
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:31,480
come inside. And it has to do
it at a high enough rate, right?

617
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:33,790
You have to not only allow
insulin to go through,

618
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:37,660
you have to allow it to go through in
large quantities so that you can provide

619
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:42,661
enough insulin in order to treat
diabetes without having a huge device.

620
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:47,500
Right? It needs to be small, so,
and produce a lot of insulin.

621
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:51,850
And these turn out to be, uh, challenges
that we haven't quite achieved yet.

622
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:54,503
Okay.

623
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,983
MMM.

624
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,220
So let me just summarize what
we've talked about, uh, in, in,

625
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:07,350
uh, the, the field of tissue engineering,
which I think you're gonna see, uh,

626
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:10,000
make a lot of progress
during your lifetime.

627
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,590
A logical extension of
conventional medical and
surgical practices and involves

628
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,840
the control or regulation
of normal healing.

629
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:21,160
And we talked about tissue engineering
approaches that use cells and tissue

630
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:25,180
engineering approaches that don't use
cells where the material or some other

631
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:29,080
aspect of what you're using a
controls the healing process.

632
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,460
We talked about tissue engineering to
supplement the cellular component and even

633
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,640
to guide the ways that cells form into
new tissues to control drug delivery.

634
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:42,190
And this last aspect which,
um,

635
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,520
which I think you can probably see more
clearly now than when I mentioned it

636
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:46,091
last time,

637
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:50,530
is that now you could use these new
tissues that are created in the laboratory

638
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,750
to understand physiology better.

639
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,880
You could take doctor Nicholas [inaudible]
tissue engineered blood vessels and

640
00:40:57,881 --> 00:41:02,710
use them to understand more about how
blood vessels develop during embryonic

641
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:06,250
development because she's created this
system where she can control many of the

642
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:07,150
key variables.

643
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,740
You could add cells at different time
and see how this developing tissue

644
00:41:11,741 --> 00:41:12,700
responds to that.

645
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,270
You could add signaling
molecules at different times
and see how this developing

646
00:41:16,271 --> 00:41:19,710
tissue remodels or responds
to these signals that you had.

647
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,360
And so these turn out to
be very powerful tools,

648
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:27,010
not only for creating new therapies, for,
for understanding a human physiology.

649
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,360
Okay,

650
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,580
okay,
I'm going to stop there,

651
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:37,460
but there's time for questions and it
could be questions about this or last

652
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,950
minute questions about your
papers that are due tomorrow.

653
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,390
Any questions about that?
I know I've answered quite a few by email.

654
00:41:45,391 --> 00:41:47,340
It seemed like everybody
was on the right track.

655
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:57,980
Nope, everybody's good. Good. So I'll
see you in section this afternoon.
