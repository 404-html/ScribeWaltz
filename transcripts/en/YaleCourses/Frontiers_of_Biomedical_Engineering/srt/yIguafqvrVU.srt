1
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,070
Great. Well, welcome. Today we're
gonna continue talking about vaccines.

2
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:20,850
So we started on this topic on Tuesday,

3
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:25,470
particularly emphasizing smallpox and kind
of the history of vaccine development,

4
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,110
but then also emphasizing
in the case of smallpox,

5
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:32,430
how even after the scientific
discovery was made, it took many,

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,380
many decades for people to be able to
produce the vaccine in large enough

7
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:41,970
quantities and distributed so that you
could think about making an impact on, uh,

8
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,950
on global prevalence of the disease and
want to talk about that same concept,

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,820
uh, today in terms of polio,
which is a vaccine that is, uh,

10
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,970
both,
um,

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,910
made and manufactured in a different
way than the smallpox vaccine.

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,480
And that will lead us into a discussion
of sort of modern methods and sort of

13
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:04,380
the spectrum of methods that are
available now for vaccine development.

14
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,010
The other thing that I want to do
today is try to tie this discussion on

15
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:12,180
vaccines a little bit more closely with
what we talked about last week in terms

16
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,140
of,
uh,

17
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:18,141
of what happens inside your body when
you receive a vaccine or when you're

18
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,060
exposed to an antigen and how,
uh,

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,000
how the immune system
actually responds to that.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,550
And so the question is what happens after
a vaccine is introduced into the body?

21
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,860
And I want to spend some time
on that till we talk about,

22
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,700
before we talk about development of,
of the polio vaccine.

23
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,230
And so here I've just picked a
couple of the pictures that, uh,

24
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,670
that I showed you last time when we were
talking about cell communication in the

25
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,080
immune system, uh, because the,

26
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,260
what happens after the vaccine is
introduced into your body is that a,

27
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,400
is that it initiated cellular events and
cells share signals with each other and

28
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:02,451
that leads to activation of
a specific cell population.

29
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,750
If we're thinking about a vaccine
that produces antibodies, for example,

30
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,220
that leads to activation of B cells,
immature B cells,

31
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,420
which do two things.

32
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:17,421
They both proliferate increase
in number and they differentiate,

33
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,080
they differentiate from immature B
cells into antibody producing cells.

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,840
And so let me, uh, let me go back to
what we talked about last week and,

35
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,870
and illustrate that a
little bit more closely.

36
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,820
So one of the things that happens is
that certain cells within your body

37
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:37,500
process, the vaccine or the
Antigen, and we talked about that,

38
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,650
we talked about host's cells that are
perhaps infected with a virus displaying

39
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,960
pieces of that virus,

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,020
antigenic pieces of that virus in the
context of a surface receptor called MHC

41
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:56,901
one and presenting that and other cells
in the immune system recognizing that

42
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:02,590
this is,
this is a foreign molecule,

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,800
but it's being presented in
the context of a self cell,

44
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,550
right? So because it has
MHC one your MHC one on it,

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,310
this t cell recognizes that
it's one of your cells,

46
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,580
but it has a foreign antigen
associated with it. In this case,

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,550
it might be a piece of a virus that's
replicating inside this cell, right?

48
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,570
And so that's antigen presentation to
this population of cells called cytotoxic

49
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:36,580
t cells, cytotoxic t cells, t sub c,

50
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,630
a subset of the class of t
cells in the immune system.

51
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,870
They become activated and they produce
eventually mature cytotoxic t cells in

52
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:48,340
large numbers.

53
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,440
And these cells can now kill cells
that have the correct signature.

54
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,630
And the signature is MHC one with this
foreign antigen associated with it.

55
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,750
Right now for antibody production,

56
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,490
it is still a t cell that recognizes
the antigen presenting cell.

57
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,650
But this antigen presenting cell is
more likely a professional antigen

58
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,830
presenting cell or a subset of cells of
your immune system that are specialized

59
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:22,831
in ingesting foreign
particles and displaying their
contents to the rest of the

60
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:26,590
immune system.
And so the classes of t cells,

61
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,570
macrophages and natural killer
cells, these are uh, and uh, uh,

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,740
uh, class of cells that's particularly
important, uh, called dendritic cells.

63
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,610
They might ingest extra cellular antigen,

64
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,970
presented pieces of it on their cell
surface in the context of MHC to

65
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,770
another subset of t cells called t
helper cells will recognize that signal

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,920
by direct contact with it and they
will become activated and proliferate.

67
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,960
Now these th cells,

68
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,990
helper t cells go on to stimulate B cells
and it's these B cells that become the

69
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:13,051
mature antibody producing cells that make
quantities of an antibody that fill up

70
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,650
in your body,
but,

71
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:20,651
and the antibody that they stimulate is
antibody that's specific to this antigen

72
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:25,870
that was presented earlier,
right? So now I recognize, well,

73
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:29,890
you should recognize that this is a
very simplified view of a highly complex

74
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,290
network of interactions that takes place.

75
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,010
If you go on to study more about
immunology, which I know most of you will,

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,530
you will recognize that I'm,

77
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,980
this is just the simplest level
of one of the most complex, uh,

78
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:44,470
systems, uh, within our body.

79
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,940
And it has to be complex because we're
asking the immune system to be able to

80
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:53,710
respond to every potential foreign
pathogen that we come into contact with.

81
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,610
And it does that through a complex
set of sort of cellular interactions.

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,990
And it turns out also gene rearrangements,
if you go further to study that.

83
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,180
So this is just a,

84
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,240
this is a highly simplified view and
what I want you to remember is that

85
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:11,000
specific subpopulations
of cells get activated.

86
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,800
The activation results
in a specific response.

87
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,170
In this case here,
you're generating host's cells,

88
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:26,171
cytotoxic t cells that can
kill only very specific cells,

89
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,210
cells that are expressing
this foreign antigen.

90
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,810
And in the case of the helper cells,

91
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,930
they stimulate a specific population
of B cells to mature into antibody

92
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,260
producing cells.

93
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,770
And that antibody is generated against
the antigen that stimulated it.

94
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,020
All right? Um, so if,

95
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,650
if we just thought about
that second part of it,

96
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,140
just the antibody
generation or the humoral,

97
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,190
what we called last time last week,
the humoral immune response,

98
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,600
the immune response.

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,550
That's ssociate with generation of
antibodies in the blood and other fluids.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,440
And we looked at the
kinetics of this response.

101
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,320
What happens in your body after
you're exposed to an antigen?

102
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,620
So this is a time course here.
The scale is in days.

103
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,770
So this is several months and this,
uh,

104
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,680
this logarithmic scale on the y axis,

105
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,110
it represents antibody concentration.

106
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,980
And now we're not thinking about total
antibody concentration because you

107
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,540
already have a lot of antibodies
circulating within your blood and in your

108
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,290
fluids.

109
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,290
We're thinking about the particular
antibody that binds to this antigen that

110
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,430
you're exposed to.

111
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,660
And I'm using here Antigen interchangeably
with vaccine for our purposes today,

112
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,631
right?

113
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:52,610
So the antigen we're thinking about is a
vaccine particularly designed to elicit

114
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:54,290
an immune response against the pathogen.

115
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:59,510
So you introduce that antigen
into a person, into me,

116
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,403
for example,

117
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,670
and there's a lag period where if
I was just looking for antibodies,

118
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,750
nothing happens for a while.
And at some point, maybe, uh,

119
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,990
maybe a week later,
four to eight days later,

120
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,380
you start to see antibody levels rise.

121
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,200
And, uh, again, this,

122
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:21,530
these are antibodies that are specific
to that Antigen or vaccine that we

123
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:25,670
introduced. Those levels would reach
a plateau after some period of time,

124
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,120
maybe after a couple of weeks, and
then they would begin to decline again.

125
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,920
Right now,

126
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,970
if I was a person that was designing a
vaccine and I noticed that this was the

127
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:38,570
response that it got,
the antibodies were produced,

128
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,410
they reached some intermediate level,
they started to fall. I would say, well,

129
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,510
I haven't stimulated the
immune system enough.

130
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,140
Let me reboost let me give
another dose of Antigen.

131
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,690
And if you did that,

132
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,380
what would happen is you
would see antibody levels
rise even more sharply than

133
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,214
before.

134
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,670
The response to the second exposure to
an antigen is different in a couple of

135
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:03,870
ways.
One is there's no lag period.

136
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,770
Notice that antibody levels start rising
right away after the second exposure

137
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,640
and and that rate of rise is steeper,

138
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,270
so they antibody levels go up more
rapidly and they reach a higher level.

139
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,190
Now this is just a typical response.
You might,

140
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,660
you could probably find some antigens
that don't follow exactly this behavior,

141
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,531
but in general,

142
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,850
this is the kind of behavior you would
see on first exposure to an antigen or

143
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:34,851
vaccine called the primary exposure and
on subsequent exposure to an antigen or

144
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,100
vaccine called the boost.
Right? So if this was tetanus,

145
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,410
you got this tetanus
vaccine when you were young,

146
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,610
you get a boost every five or 10 years
because your antibody levels are starting

147
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:51,060
to fall right
now.

148
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:56,061
Just what this diagram also shows you is
that that response is specific to that

149
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,350
particular antigen.

150
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,400
It's not just that your whole immune
system gets revved up and it's going to

151
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:06,360
respond more rapidly to any
antigen it's exposed to.

152
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,750
Because if we did the experiment
where on this booster,

153
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,050
we included not only the initial
antigen but some unrelated antigen,

154
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,280
the response to the unrelated antigen
called be here looks like a primary

155
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:23,250
response, right? There's a lag phase.

156
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,860
There's a slow rise to an
intermediate level of antibody, right?

157
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,520
And so every time you're exposed
to a new vaccine or a new antigen,

158
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,880
you go through this, this, uh,

159
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,270
this primary response before
you have the secondary response.

160
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,500
Does that make sense? Kate?
Did you have a question?

161
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,700
Secondary volume?

162
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,440
So, so I'm not sure I understand
the question. So the question is,

163
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,040
if you're naturally exposed to antigen,
wouldn't this happen anyway? Yeah. So,

164
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,600
so for example, you get exposed
to it. Before there was a vaccine,

165
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,980
you're brother and sister had chicken pox.
And so you got exposed to chicken pox.

166
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:21,180
Naturally through your contact with them,
you would have this initial response.

167
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,030
Now that initial response might be too
slow to prevent you from getting chicken

168
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:25,864
pox.

169
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,370
Right?
You just start with

170
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,433
secondary

171
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,790
secondary response.

172
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,570
Yeah. So, so, so you're
asking if, for example,

173
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:47,830
why do you need a booster of tetanus?
Because if I get exposed to tetanus,

174
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:51,790
wouldn't I have this rapid response?
And the answer is yes, you would.

175
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,690
The question is, would, would that
response, even though it's much faster,

176
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,250
be fast enough to protect you from the
initial exposure to tetanus that you got

177
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,580
and probably it wouldn't, you'd
probably get a little bit sick anyway,

178
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:08,540
but recover. Right? So, so that's
a really good question. And,

179
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,940
and I'm talking in terms of
generalities here, uh, but,

180
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,630
but the specifics matter and that's
why every development of every specific

181
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:20,500
vaccine turns out to be different because
they don't all follow exactly this

182
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:22,480
kind of time course.
Some,

183
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,630
like the smallpox vaccine on an on one
on one exposure generates a very high

184
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:32,230
response that lasts for many years.
So you don't need a boost, right?

185
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,220
And others generate a weaker
response that does require boosting.

186
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,790
So there's no absolutes
about this, right? This is,

187
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,540
this is a general response where all
the features can be different with

188
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,780
different, uh, pathogens. Did
that answer your question?

189
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,870
So why the leg phase? Why the
lag phase at the beginning? Well,

190
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:56,980
because it takes some time
for these cellular events
that I mentioned earlier to

191
00:12:56,981 --> 00:13:00,850
happen, right? The Antigen has to
be presented to helper t cells.

192
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:05,851
Those helper t cells have to stimulate
a B cell population to both proliferate

193
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:08,890
and differentiate.
So this is a picture I showed you before,

194
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,990
and you can imagine that even when this
immature B cell gets the signal, uh,

195
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,130
you're now, now's the time you need
to turn on antibody production.

196
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,250
That it takes some time
for it to both proliferate,

197
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:26,251
to make a cells and for those cells to
mature to the point where they become,

198
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,620
uh, where they become what
are called plasma cells,

199
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:34,540
which are antibody producing factories.
Take some time for that to happen. Now,

200
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,950
why is the time less on second exposure?
Because on second exposure,

201
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,470
there's another population of cells that
I haven't mentioned before that remain

202
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,070
after the primary exposure.
And those are called memory cells.

203
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,930
They're down here.

204
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,200
So not all of the B cells
that are stimulated become
plasma cells are antibody

205
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:59,050
secreting cells. Some of them
become what are called memory cells.

206
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,830
And these are cells that
recognize a particular antigen.

207
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:05,290
They're ready to
differentiate into antibody,

208
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,740
they're ready to rapidly differentiate
into antibody producing cells and they're

209
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:15,770
waiting for that second signal to come.
And so these memory cells, um, uh,

210
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,630
are,

211
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:21,100
are a way that your immune system keeps
track of antigens that it's been exposed

212
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:26,101
to for even if maybe the plasma cells
that were producing antibody in response

213
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:31,390
to the initial exposure have
died and disappeared, right?

214
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,630
Memory cells are long lasting cells that
remember this exposure and can respond

215
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,610
very quickly on second exposure.

216
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,420
We talked about about antibodies,
we've talked about them a two weeks ago,

217
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:50,260
we talked about them in section
last week, uh, uses of them.

218
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:54,500
I just want to remind you that if you
looked at the population of antibodies

219
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,500
inside, uh, in your blood, for example,

220
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,700
the predominant antibodies
would look like this.

221
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,590
These are the class called
Igg there y shaped molecules.

222
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,650
They have a region down
here called the FC region,

223
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,480
and that is responsible
for effector functions.

224
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,800
And there's a region up here called
the antigen binding region and those,

225
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,300
and there's two copies of that region
and it's responsible for antigen binding,

226
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:23,900
right?

227
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,730
And so many the predominant number of
antibodies in your blood look like these

228
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:31,430
igg molecules,
but not all of them do.

229
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,760
There are different kinds
of antibody molecules, uh,

230
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,190
and not only the Igg,

231
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,420
but there are special
antibodies called Secretory Iga.

232
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,950
And these are highly
enriched in a mucosal fluids.

233
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,530
In the mucus lining of your gut.
You have the eye of other, uh,

234
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:54,350
a mucosal organs and they're
also enriched in milk.

235
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,630
So milk contains large quantities of
this special class of antibodies called

236
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:04,280
Secretory Iga. They also have
binding sites for Antigen, uh,

237
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:09,281
but and but they are sort of two igg
type molecules bound together by another

238
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:14,690
peptide chain.
And so imagine taking two Iggs,

239
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,030
turning one upside down and
then they're hooked together.

240
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,930
The advantage of this is that now you
have four binding sites for antigen

241
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,040
instead of just two.

242
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,870
And so these are better at binding to
antigen because they have more binding

243
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,380
sites on them.
It also turns out that there's,

244
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,450
they're made stable in these environments
like milk and mucus secretions because

245
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:37,760
of this secretory chain
which is wrapped around it.

246
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,590
And another important class
of antibodies is called IGM.

247
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,800
And the IGM is really five Igg type
molecules that are linked together through

248
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,900
dice sulfide bonds,
uh,

249
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,920
such that their fc portions are all
pointing in and their antibody antibody

250
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,370
binding portions are all pointing out.
So now you have a single molecule,

251
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,060
very large molecule with
not just two binding sites,

252
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:06,680
but with 10 binding sites.

253
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,240
And so this is a very potent
molecule for binding to antigen.

254
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,090
One of the things that I didn't mention
before is that when you get this primary

255
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:19,940
response and then the secondary response,

256
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,530
if you looked at the antibodies that are
generated during the primary response,

257
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,071
again,

258
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:29,150
we're only looking at antibodies that
bind to the particular antigen or vaccine

259
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:32,750
that we have used for the priming.

260
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,070
If you looked at the antibodies that
were present in the blood, for example,

261
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,130
you would find that most
of those antibodies are igm
during this initial period

262
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,370
of, uh, of antibody concentration rise.

263
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,400
Most of them are up the class igm,
igm antibodies are,

264
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,220
are produced on first exposure.

265
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,740
If you look later as the antelope,

266
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,160
as the antibody production
response matures,

267
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,950
some Igg is produced right?

268
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,220
So that in the late period
after initial priming,

269
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:10,020
you'd have a mixture of igm and Igg
and the blood on second exposure.

270
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:15,021
It's different that Igg is produced
predominantly on second exposure to an

271
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:17,010
antigen.
Okay,

272
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,420
so one thing I do want you to remember
is that igm class antibodies are the

273
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:26,370
antibodies produced on first exposure.
Why? Why do you think igm are,

274
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,920
uh, are produced on first exposure? Well,

275
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,280
one way to think about it as they have
more antigen binding sites and said

276
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,850
they're going to be more efficient
at neutralizing the pathogen on a per

277
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:40,050
molecule basis than Igg is. And so it's
good to get those produced more quickly.

278
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,630
Um, the memory cells which are
stimulated lead to an igg response.

279
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,130
And that's why Igg is
the antibody, uh, of, uh,

280
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,210
that is produced
predominantly after the boots.

281
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:53,460
But there is some igm produced also.

282
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,610
So let's talk about, uh,
about the polio virus vaccine.

283
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:03,930
Keeping those things in
mind. And, uh, polio was a,

284
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:08,880
is a crippling disease in many
cases. It affects, um, it also,

285
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,600
uh,
initiate it's infection through the gut.

286
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,470
It can be passed from one
person to another, uh,

287
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,720
orally and,
um,

288
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,410
infects first cells of your intestinal
system and then spreads to other cells in

289
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:29,451
particular spreads to cells
that are involved in the
neuro muscular junction and

290
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:31,830
can affect, uh, then, uh,

291
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,240
muscle activity or your ability to
move a voluntary muscles. And so polio,

292
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,090
uh, the disease caused by polio, uh,

293
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,860
can be a paralytic disease
crippling and in some cases can,

294
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,100
um, can lead to death if, uh,

295
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,560
if the disease progresses in certain ways.

296
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,920
And if we looked in 1950,
the,

297
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:57,921
this is the incidence of paralytic or the
worst form of poliomyelitis in the U s

298
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,950
was about 20 up per
hundred thousand people.

299
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,520
And this is mostly a disease
that would occur in children.

300
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,410
You would first get exposed in
children in childhood and then, uh,

301
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,280
at a point when you're
susceptible to the disease.

302
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:19,290
And so in a town that's the size of
new haven with a population of, uh,

303
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:23,610
of let's say 100,000 people in
just the immediate new haven area,

304
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,660
there might be 20 of
these, uh, uh, instances,

305
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:31,060
a very severe form of, of,
uh, polio per year, uh,

306
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,670
20 crippled children, uh, would
result. And so over the course of time,

307
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:39,300
this could have a very substantial
impact on the community.

308
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,820
And, uh, because it's past, uh,

309
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,810
by an can be passed by an oral route.

310
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:50,710
It's a disease that's very transmitted
in school settings where children are

311
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:55,520
together and uh, or childcare settings.
And so it was something that, uh,

312
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,220
parents before 1950,

313
00:20:57,221 --> 00:21:01,110
we're very concerned about if a case
of polio emerged in the community,

314
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,080
the chances that it could spread to
other children or to your child, uh,

315
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,780
were high.
Um,

316
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,420
so great interest in this and
the early part of this century.

317
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,130
And so a group of scientists, uh, um,

318
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:18,150
mainly in Boston found importantly that
they could cultivate the polio virus,

319
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,100
the disease causing polio virus that
could cultivate it in cell culture.

320
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,400
And they found that certain cells in
particular epithelial cells from a monkey

321
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,970
kidneys were very effective
at propagating the virus.

322
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:36,880
So you would grow these monkey
kidney cells in culture.

323
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,710
You would add some virus to the culture
broth. The cells will become infected.

324
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,870
The virus would go through its life cycle,

325
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:49,050
and the cells would be basically little
reactors for generating lots of virus.

326
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:54,220
So you could make lots of
virus to study Jonas Salk,

327
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,370
who probably you've heard the name was
a physician who at the time thought,

328
00:21:59,561 --> 00:21:59,861
well,

329
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:04,861
if we can make large quantities of this
virus than perhaps we can make it into a

330
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,300
vaccine.
And,

331
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,330
but unlike the cow pox virus vaccine
IA that we talked about before,

332
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,430
this is the real disease causing agent,
right?

333
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,650
So if you just introduced
this polio virus,

334
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,660
which you could make in
large quantities into people,

335
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:22,120
now you would be causing polio,
right?

336
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:26,590
So you couldn't introduce the live
virus in because that would cause the

337
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:29,610
disease, not just immunity. Um,

338
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,610
remember that the lucky
thing about, uh, about, um,

339
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,030
the smallpox vaccine was that an an a
naturally occurring attenuated form of the

340
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:44,650
smallpox virus.
Very Yola called back Sinia was found.

341
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,830
And so that was a naturally occurring
attenuated virus that could be produced

342
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:53,320
into a vaccine that didn't
cause, uh, the disease.

343
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,940
So the strategy that salt
used was to kill the vac.

344
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,880
The virus instead make a lot of the virus.

345
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,950
It has all of its antigenic
epitopes on it, but we'll,

346
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,670
we'll just kill it so
that it can't replicate.

347
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,240
And then if we inject it into people,
they'll be getting the real virus.

348
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:16,300
So hopefully their immune systems will
respond to it, like the real virus,

349
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,220
but it won't be capable of replication
because we've chemically cross linked it

350
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:24,310
so it can't go through its life cycle.
Right.

351
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,850
I'll talk about viral life cycles in a
moment and you'll see how that killing

352
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:31,480
works. So they, uh, they grew the
virus in monkey cell cultures.

353
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:35,280
They purify the virus cause you've got
to get all the other stuff from the, uh,

354
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:35,880
the cells.

355
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,490
You're growing it in a way they inactivate
it it by treating it with formalin,

356
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:40,780
which is just a formula.

357
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,220
It's just a mixture of formaldehyde
and formaldehyde cross links, proteins.

358
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,470
So you cross link all the proteins in
the virus and you make a particle that

359
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,400
looks like a virus,

360
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,990
but it can't act like a virus any
longer because it can't replicate.

361
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,860
And then they did preliminary studies
of safety and effectiveness and people

362
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,620
basically injecting it
into some test subjects.

363
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,130
Making sure that they didn't
get disease from it and uh,

364
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:10,790
and looking at antibody responses
to see if it worked. And it did.

365
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,510
So very rapidly a clinical
trial was started.

366
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:19,511
Now the problem or one of the challenges
with clinical trials of vaccines is

367
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,170
that you have to,

368
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,820
you have to enroll a lot of patients into
clinical trials because only a few are

369
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:27,530
going to get sick in any case,
right?

370
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:32,531
Only 20 out of 100,000 so you're treating
healthy people and you're trying to

371
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:36,020
prevent them from getting a disease and
you don't know who's going to get it,

372
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,490
right.
So you have to,

373
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,600
you have to test it by 10 by giving the
vaccine to a large population of people

374
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:45,620
and then watching and seeing if you've
reduced the incidence of the disease.

375
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,550
It's,

376
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,900
that's a very different process than
testing a drug where if you had a drug for

377
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:52,370
heart disease for example,

378
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,970
you would give it to patients that had
heart disease and see if you had an

379
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:59,990
impact. And you could do that with
a relatively small number, right?

380
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:03,570
If you're trying to prevent a disease
that only occurs at a rate of 20 per

381
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:04,820
100,000 people,

382
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,080
you have to give the vaccine to millions
in order to see if the number goes down

383
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,550
that,
does that make sense?

384
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:15,140
And so they started a clinical trial
and the clinical trial was designed such

385
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:20,141
that almost 2 million elementary school
children were given this test vaccine.

386
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,140
And you can imagine, uh,
that, that this is a,

387
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:27,800
this is a monumental sort of undertaking
and a number of different ways.

388
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,900
One is if you have to coordinate how
you're going to give this vaccine to 2

389
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,600
million children across the u s and you
want to give it to people in different

390
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:39,350
communities to make sure that it works
in all the subpopulations where the

391
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:42,110
vaccine is potentially valuable.
Um,

392
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,020
you want to give it to children because
children that are susceptible and that

393
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,250
that's the, that's where you would like
the vaccine to be useful as in children.

394
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:52,580
So you want to give it to them because
the biology of children is different than

395
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:55,310
adults. And so you need to make
sure it works in that population.

396
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,470
And they had to give some of them the
real vaccine and some of them a placebo

397
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:04,910
vaccine in order that they could really
tell if the vaccine worked right.

398
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,680
You have to have it placebo controlled.

399
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,740
And they did this in 1800
elementary school children.

400
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:10,970
So these are about eight year olds.

401
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,690
So imagine proposing a clinical trial
like that today where you had a test

402
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:21,770
vaccine that had been, that had been, uh,
that had been tested in a few P patients.

403
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,150
It's thought to be safe,
but we're going to give it to a million,

404
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,320
uh,

405
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,320
the test vaccine to a million or 2,000,008
year olds in the u s and see if it

406
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:37,370
works. Well, you know, that was possible
at this time for a couple of reasons.

407
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:40,970
One is people must have had an incredible
amount of confidence and Jonas Salk,

408
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,860
uh, and, and, and he did a good job.

409
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,000
And in preparing the initial studies
to show that it was safe. And two,

410
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:53,001
it gives you some sense for how a
concerned parents were about the risks of

411
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:58,821
polio in the community and how much they
wanted of vaccine to be developed such

412
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:04,140
that they gave permission for their
children to enter into this trial. Well,

413
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:07,530
the vaccine turned out to
be about 70% effective.

414
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,880
And as we'll see in section
today of vaccine does not
have to be totally perfect

415
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,950
in order to prevent
transmission of a disease.

416
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,020
Because when a disease enters a community,

417
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:18,150
it's spread from one person to another.

418
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,660
If you can block one of those
people from getting the vaccine,

419
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,120
you also stop from getting the disease.

420
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,230
You also stop all the people they would
have transmitted it to from getting a

421
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:28,621
disease.

422
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:33,060
And so one can stop the spread of disease
through community without being 100%

423
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:37,500
effective in each person who
gets the vaccine. And that's an,

424
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,190
that's an important concept.
And so it was, it was effective.

425
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,710
It was a rapidly than introduced
into general use. So I,

426
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:48,860
I taught at Cornell before Gail
and my, uh, my, uh, assistant, uh,

427
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,260
was a woman named Bonnie
at, uh, at Cornell.

428
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,330
And She was part of the clinical
trial, uh, that did this,

429
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:56,760
and they gave everybody
certificates after it was done.

430
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,110
So you didn't know at the beginning,

431
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,870
you knew you were enrolled in
the trial that gave you a shot.

432
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,100
You didn't know whether you were part of
the part of the real group that got the

433
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:09,480
test vaccine or the placebo group that
got the control and it turned out that

434
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,730
Bonnie was part of the control group.

435
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,970
So she got a certificate
at the end thanking her for
participating in a clinical

436
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:18,390
trial and also telling her to go get the
real vaccine because she hadn't had it,

437
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,820
uh, yet. Uh, so, um,

438
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,370
so this is real people who were
involved in these tests. Well,

439
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,820
this shows what happened in
the period after this, uh,

440
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:32,550
this vaccine was introduced
into the general population.

441
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:36,120
So that would have been in 1954.
This is a complex slide.

442
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:38,040
So let me show you what it is.

443
00:28:38,041 --> 00:28:42,780
The Salk vaccine is also called
the killed polio vaccine.

444
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:44,850
And some people call it KPV.

445
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,330
Also sometimes called inactivated
polio vaccine. I, ve IPV.

446
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,280
Uh, but this is the vaccine I just
talked about, produced by Sulk.

447
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,090
And after the clinical trial, it was
rapidly introduced into the population.

448
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,830
So this curve here with the squares shows
you how many millions of vaccine doses

449
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:06,831
were distributed across the u s and so
this is hundreds of millions of doses

450
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,010
that were given.
And as those doses were given,

451
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,140
you look at the prevalence of polio
within the United States and it dropped

452
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:20,740
dramatically in the period
from 1954. This is these, uh,

453
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:25,410
these filled black bars here referred
to this access polio cases per hundred

454
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,420
thousand population dropped down to,
uh,

455
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,570
to only three or four cases, uh, by 1956.

456
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:38,571
And so this just shows as the vaccine
was distributed given to more people,

457
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,730
that prevalence of the disease
dropped dramatically. Well,

458
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,940
it also illustrates that one of the
things you do after you introduce the

459
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,380
vaccine,
you can't stop there.

460
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:51,220
You have to continually watch what's
happening with this disease in your

461
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:55,930
population. And one thing that
happened was that after 1956, 1957,

462
00:29:55,931 --> 00:30:00,460
the number of cases were down, there was
a small bump here. The cases were up.

463
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,390
And this was of great concern because
the number of polio cases shouldn't go up

464
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,960
as the vaccine is being even more
actively distributed through the country.

465
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,300
So what happened,

466
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,860
this led this led people to go back
and look at the places that we're

467
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:16,480
manufacturing the vaccine,

468
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,130
to make sure that they were all
producing vaccine of the proper quality.

469
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,670
And it turned out that one of,
there were three vaccine manufacturers.

470
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:27,910
One of them was using the
procedure not quite correctly.

471
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,540
They weren't completely killing, uh, the,

472
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,980
the virus when they produce their vaccine.

473
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,840
And so some of these cases were probably
due to polio that was transmitted by

474
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,340
incompletely killed a virus that
was present in the vaccine. Um,

475
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,750
they fixed that procedure and after that,
uh,

476
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,550
the Kate day cases went down even more.
Now the,

477
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:56,200
the polio vaccine that sock
produced was very effective. Uh,

478
00:30:56,201 --> 00:31:00,790
but it required a fairly large dose of
the vaccine and it had to be injected

479
00:31:00,791 --> 00:31:03,520
into the arms of children. And, uh,

480
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:06,010
so there was some thought
that maybe we could do better,

481
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,870
particularly if we took advantage
of the fact that this is a,

482
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,400
this is a virus that's
easily transmitted orally.

483
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,080
And could you make a vaccine that
would be effective orally as well?

484
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,820
That would be a tremendous advantage,

485
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,050
especially in children who
don't like to get shots.

486
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,650
And if you could take your five year
old or your eight year old in to get a

487
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,410
vaccine where there was orally
administered instead of a shot,

488
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:34,210
that's a much easier thing to do. Plus
it makes it, as I talked about last time,

489
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,110
much easier to think about distributing
the vaccine around the world because

490
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:41,920
shots require skilled
medical personnel and,

491
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,750
and whereas an oral vaccine could
be self administered, right?

492
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:51,010
And so that means that it's easier to
take into certain kinds of populations or

493
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:54,290
remote parts of the world.
So a,

494
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:57,280
an oral polio vaccine was
developed by a man named Saban.

495
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,490
And what he did was took the polio
virus into the laboratory and,

496
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:06,730
and tried to make an
attenuated form of it. That is,

497
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:11,110
can I get the virus to mutate in ways
that it doesn't change its physical

498
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:14,140
structure much so it still
looks like active polio,

499
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,980
but it changes as disease
causing properties, right?

500
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:22,100
So change is disease causing
properties without making it, um,

501
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,770
a non immunogenic.

502
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,600
And he produced an oral polio
vaccine from an attenuated virus.

503
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:32,410
This was not a naturally occurring
attenuated virus as used in smallpox,

504
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,040
but a virus that was attenuated
in the laboratory, uh,

505
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:41,070
basically by propagating and in culture
and looking for that were formed as you,

506
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:46,130
uh, as you propagated this virus under
different experimental conditions.

507
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,540
So this is the, this is the
vaccine that you probably took.

508
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:54,740
The vaccine that's still most widely
used in the u s is the oral form of the

509
00:32:54,741 --> 00:32:57,440
vaccine is used because of
the reasons I described.

510
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,410
Why would you maybe not want
to use the oral vaccine?

511
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,570
What are the disadvantages of using it?

512
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,550
Knowing what you know now,
any concerns about taking the,

513
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,700
taking the oral polio vaccine
instead of getting the shot?

514
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,680
Are there any features
that you'd worry about

515
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,920
Bobby?
It's a live virus,

516
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:31,420
which is actually going to infect your
intestinal system and, and reproduce.

517
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,920
And because it infects your sales and
reproduces your immune system responds

518
00:33:35,921 --> 00:33:37,150
much more vigorously.

519
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,290
And you could imagine that you've got
virus that's propagating inside your cells

520
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,610
making more and more virus.

521
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,570
Your immune system really responds
well to that doesn't respond as well to

522
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:48,460
killed vaccines.
And that's why,

523
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,390
that's why the Salk vaccine has
to be injected at a high dose.

524
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,990
So it's more effective
because it's a live virus,

525
00:33:55,991 --> 00:34:00,991
but it's a little bit more concerning
because it's a live virus as well in that

526
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,390
you trust that it's attenuated,
but,

527
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:08,830
but could it convert back to a very
old form or a form that caused disease?

528
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,800
It turns out that that hasn't
been a problem. And in fact,

529
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,260
another advantage of the,
um,

530
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:18,310
of the oral vaccine is that you
give it to children. They take it,

531
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:22,390
the vaccine itself, the virus
reproduces in their, in their gut.

532
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,720
And they can actually spread it to
other children in the same way that they

533
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:28,390
spread the disease. Right?
You've got children that are,

534
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,420
that are maybe at school or it
childcare and you ever looked at,

535
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,460
at children in the playground, they're
all over each other sometimes, right?

536
00:34:36,461 --> 00:34:39,730
And they can spread
saliva or other fluids.

537
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,190
And it turns out that, um, that
if you give one child in a home,

538
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,820
the, uh, the, uh, oral vaccine,

539
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
you often have a protective effect in
other children in the home as well because

540
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,190
it spreads from one individual to another.

541
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,220
That's another advantage
of the oral polio vaccine.

542
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,873
Okay.

543
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,670
Well,
polio is not yet eradicated,

544
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:09,290
but there still are hopes that polio
could be eradicated. It's only endemic.

545
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,530
That means only naturally
occurring in certain countries.

546
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,670
And the World Health Organization keeps
track of what countries have cases of

547
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:19,880
polio and when they occur
and what the frequency of,

548
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:23,900
and so this is a map from a few years
ago and there are efforts that occur

549
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,790
occasionally. For example, this effort
that's described here from 2001 where,

550
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,260
um, where the World Health Organization
has a push. They say, we know where the,

551
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,850
where the cases are occurring.

552
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,890
We know what communities
still have polio within them.

553
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,030
If we do sort of really
gear up for a massive, uh,

554
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,280
immunization effort in those areas,

555
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,610
we could eliminate polio
from that community.

556
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,090
And in this way by by knowing
what communities it's in,

557
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,440
an acting on all of them at once,

558
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:57,441
you might be able to eradicate polio in
the same way that we eradicated smallpox

559
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:00,720
so far. Those efforts have
failed for a variety of reasons.

560
00:36:00,721 --> 00:36:03,420
One is the resources that are
needed in order to do this.

561
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,570
The other is that some places
where the disease occurs, uh,

562
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,910
the governments are not stable or there
might be civil unrest or civil wars.

563
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:16,020
And that makes it very difficult to
orchestrate giving vaccines when there's

564
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,230
other things happening in the country
that are more immediate concern.

565
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,940
And there are some communities that are
frankly suspicious of western medicine

566
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:28,260
and don't want a, don't want people to
come in with their modern approaches.

567
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:33,480
And, and, and, and feed things to, uh,
to, uh, members of their community.

568
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,100
So there are still problems to solve
in doing this. Uh, but I wanted to, um,

569
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,410
show you, uh, so that if you're interested
in this and you want to keep track,

570
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,560
there's a, oops, there is a,

571
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,350
okay,

572
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,183
I'm going to get it.

573
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:54,310
There's a web site called Global Polio
Eradication Initiative and you can look

574
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,610
and you can actually look and see what
countries polio is occurring in and where

575
00:36:58,611 --> 00:37:02,320
they are and how many cases
have been reported. Uh,

576
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,770
you can't see this too well,

577
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:07,220
but there's a map of the world here that
actually shows you all the individual

578
00:37:07,221 --> 00:37:11,960
cases of polio that occurred
between this period of August,

579
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,760
2007 and it's cut off on the screen
February of Oh eight. And, um,

580
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:20,450
and this is the kind of surveillance
that's needed to really make an impact.

581
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:24,080
And this is why, uh, one of
the other ways where, uh,

582
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,880
where engineering approaches are
needed in order to, uh, in order to,

583
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,400
uh, solve medical problems. Like this one.

584
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,030
There's a lot of engineering they've
already talked about in terms of producing

585
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:38,000
quantities. The vaccine, producing
it reliably, producing it's safe,

586
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:41,860
distributing it and keeping
track, uh, requires, um,

587
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,470
a level of sophistication,
uh, that uh, maybe, uh,

588
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,580
you wouldn't have thought
about, um, initially.

589
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,900
Okay.
So that um,

590
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,190
yeah,

591
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:57,740
that slide is, uh, is on your, is in,

592
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,850
in the slides that are distributed.
If you want to follow on that website.

593
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,580
There's the picture that
I copied a yesterday.

594
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:08,620
So you see most of the cases are in,
are in central Africa and uh,

595
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,120
uh, in the region around India,
particularly northern India.

596
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:15,810
Okay.

597
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,130
Let me go back and finish up today by
talking about the life cycle of a virus.

598
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:24,630
And again, this is a, this is
a highly simplified version of,

599
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,220
of the lifecycle of a virus.
This might be a polio virus for example.

600
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,970
The example I've given here is
what is a virus that contains DNA?

601
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:36,120
Is it genetic material?
You know that some back,

602
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,900
some viruses use RNA as their genetic
material and so their lifecycle is going

603
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,250
to be slightly different than this.

604
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,400
HIV is a member of the family of viruses
called Retro viruses and retroviruses

605
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:50,530
all use RNA as their genetic material.

606
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,100
I'll talk about that at the end of the
lecture here. But here's a DNA virus.

607
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,360
It infects a cell.
Usually viruses have, um,

608
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,890
have certain kinds of cells they want
to infect or that they're capable of

609
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:03,700
infecting.

610
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,700
And that infection occurs because of a
ligand receptor interaction on the cell

611
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:13,540
surface where the virus itself is the
lie gand and it takes advantage of a

612
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:18,160
receptor that's expressed on
the cell surface. For example,

613
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,880
HIV enters cells of the immune system
by binding to a receptor called CD four.

614
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,070
All right. Um, and uh, you can these, uh,

615
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:34,230
these trope Isms or affinities of viruses
for certain cells are a well mapped

616
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:34,601
out.

617
00:39:34,601 --> 00:39:39,601
Now the virus enters the cell and it at
breaks down and it breaks down into its

618
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,790
component parts. And I show two
of those component parts here.

619
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:45,340
One is the genetic
material in this case DNA.

620
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,040
And the other is all the proteins that uh,

621
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:53,070
that formed the structure of the virus
that a DNA gets replicated to make many

622
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:57,160
more copies of the, of the, uh,

623
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:02,310
of the viral DNA using host mechanisms
that is often using the DNA polymerase,

624
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:07,670
which is naturally present in the host
cell for its own replication. And these,

625
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,690
the proteins that are produced by
genes that are on the viral genome get

626
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:17,731
transcribed and translated in order to
make more structural proteins that are

627
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:22,840
needed for assembly of the virus.
The virus then can self assemble.

628
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,230
That is you've made a
lot of genetic material.

629
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,330
You've made a lot of
the structural pieces.

630
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,330
There has to be some way that
the virus can reassemble,

631
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:36,040
repackage itself into,
uh, into active forms.

632
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:41,140
And then that those active
forms are released from the
cell. Now sometimes those,

633
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,910
that release occurs without the
cell itself dying. In other cases,

634
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,170
the virus propagates in such high numbers.

635
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,440
That release is literally an explosion
of the cell and release of tens of

636
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:57,640
thousands,

637
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,180
hundreds of thousands of
new virus particles from one
individual cell such that

638
00:41:01,181 --> 00:41:04,150
the cell gets killed in the
process of replicating the virus.

639
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,590
These released particles can now
go on and infect neighboring cells.

640
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,000
They can travel in the bloodstream to
s to infect cells at a distance and the

641
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:16,060
virus spreads throughout
a multicellular host.

642
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,560
Now what happened with the Salk
vaccine is that formaldehyde was used

643
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,200
formaldehyde cross-links proteins.

644
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,370
And so if you treated this
virus with Formaldehyde,

645
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,780
even if it was entered able to enter a
cell, it couldn't break down anymore.

646
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,920
And so its genetic material
wouldn't be released. And um,

647
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,870
and even if it was released,

648
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,980
the genetic material is also cross
linkedin so it can't be transcribed and

649
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:45,800
translated or replicated.
All right.

650
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,180
And so this is the stage at
which you prevent disease in, uh,

651
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:54,800
in the Salk vaccine in the Sabin
vaccine or the oral polio vaccine.

652
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,270
Now you have a non, uh, very lent a virus,

653
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:04,271
so one that perhaps does not reproduce
in such high numbers that you create an

654
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:05,690
overwhelming infection.

655
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,900
But one that still goes through its
lifecycle but is limited in its effect.

656
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,200
So that suggests. Now, if you think
about this even highly simplified life,

657
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,440
suggest some other ways that we might
use kind of modern technologies to

658
00:42:21,441 --> 00:42:25,310
engineer new vaccines.
We've talked about getting lucky,

659
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,840
finding a naturally occurring attenuated
live vaccine is in the case of smallpox.

660
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,470
We've talked about killing the virus
by cross linking it, for example,

661
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:37,160
to make a uh,
a substance that looks like a vaccine,

662
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,770
looks like a virus but can't replicate.

663
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,510
We talked about attenuating
in the laboratory using
cell culture techniques and

664
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,570
what we know about mutating virus's.

665
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,470
One can also purify parts of the protein.

666
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:53,750
That is parts of the virus.
That is,

667
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:58,280
do I really need to deliver the whole
virus if the immune system recognizes only

668
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:02,030
small pieces of the virus and
mounts an immune response to that.

669
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,200
How about if I just take
these pieces of a virus, like,

670
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,270
like some structural subunit,

671
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,420
some piece of protein and
use that as a vaccine.

672
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,940
Now I'm not introducing any
genetic material at all,

673
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:17,390
so I don't have to worry about it
replicating because there's no genetic

674
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:20,300
material.
All I do is deliver the vaccine,

675
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,090
the particles.
Well,

676
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:27,650
this is an approach that's been used in
a variety of vaccines most successfully

677
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:32,210
with hepatitis B. So the problem is
where do you get these proteins? Well,

678
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:35,180
one way to get proteins,
and it was first used in hepatitis B,

679
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,760
is to find patients,

680
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,360
find individuals who are already
infected with hepatitis B.

681
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,170
And so hepatitis has already
infecting cells of their liver.

682
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,750
Their liver is actively making new virus.

683
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,870
It turns out in the case of hepatitis V B,
the way the lifecycle proceeds,

684
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,230
that the cells make too much of the
protein and not all of it gets assembled

685
00:43:57,231 --> 00:43:58,310
into the virus.

686
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,030
And so if you look in the
blood of patients that are
infected with hepatitis B,

687
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,510
you find a lot of hepatitis
B surface subunits,

688
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,590
proteins without the nucleic
acids circulating in their blood.

689
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,940
So what if I collect that blood from
patients that are already infected with

690
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:17,570
hepatitis B,
purified the hepatitis B protein,

691
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,880
and inject that back into people?

692
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:25,180
That would be a sub unit vaccine because
I'm purifying a subunit of the virus

693
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,350
that could be injected and hopefully
induce an immune response and it turns out

694
00:44:30,351 --> 00:44:35,310
that that, that that works. What any
potential problems with that approach

695
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,760
would you like to get that vaccine?

696
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,690
You've probably,
you've all been immunized for hepatitis B.

697
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:49,080
Would you be happy to hear that that's
where your hepatitis B vaccine came from?

698
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,523
It's okay.

699
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,420
Sounds okay.
But it does sound okay and it does work.

700
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:06,421
The danger is that it's being purified
from patients that have a disease and and

701
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,420
so you want to make sure that there's
not other diseases that are present in

702
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:12,040
that sample at the same time.

703
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:17,370
And the hepatitis B subunit vaccine was
produced at the same time that that HIV

704
00:45:18,461 --> 00:45:21,250
AIDS was being recognized as
a problem in this country.

705
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:25,630
We did not yet have good methods
per screening blood to look for HIV.

706
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:30,010
We didn't have the Eliza technique that
we talked about in section a few weeks

707
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:30,280
ago.

708
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,970
And so there was great concern that there
might be other diseases that you'd be

709
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:38,971
passing on from unknowingly from this
subset of patients that you're isolating

710
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,150
the vaccine from it.

711
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:44,380
So that particular subunit vaccine was
only used in people that are at high risk

712
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:46,330
for acquiring hepatitis B.

713
00:45:46,331 --> 00:45:50,860
That is people that work in healthcare
situations that are exposed to a blood

714
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:54,160
routinely as part of their job.
It wasn't used in the general population.

715
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,293
What was,

716
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,950
what the vaccine you got was produced
totally outside of people using

717
00:45:59,951 --> 00:46:02,980
recombinant DNA technology.
And in that case,

718
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:06,040
we took the gene for
the hepatitis B protein,

719
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,620
took it out of the virus completely.

720
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,180
Okay.

721
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:15,180
Cloned it into a plasmid that plasmid
was expressed in a foreign host.

722
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:15,881
In this case,

723
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:20,881
it was expressed in yeast cells and yeast
cells were grown in large numbers with

724
00:46:21,641 --> 00:46:24,310
this plasma inside.
They expressed the plasmid.

725
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:28,510
And so you made hepatitis B
surface antigen, not in people,

726
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,460
but in, um, in a cell culture where,
uh, where it was not normally formed.

727
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:38,200
And then that, uh, that sub
unit was purified and, and, um,

728
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,630
formulated into the vaccine the
kinds of vaccines that you and I got.

729
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:48,631
So this was an early example
of recombinant DNA technology
being translated into

730
00:46:49,511 --> 00:46:52,690
a clinical product. Um, and um,

731
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,920
that's the vaccine that's
widely used in, uh, in, uh,

732
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:57,970
in practice now.

733
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,323
Okay.

734
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,930
Uh, another approach which
is still investigational and
that it's being tried for

735
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:05,550
many diseases but not yet,

736
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:10,200
not yet clinically used in any
particular one is maybe you don't need to

737
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:14,070
introduce a whole virus or pieces
of, uh, of a protein at all.

738
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,320
What if you took,
instead of using,

739
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,380
instead of going through the step of
isolating the gene per hepatitis B,

740
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,920
cloning that into a plasma,
at expressing the plasmid in sales,

741
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,750
manufacturing these cells,

742
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,840
and then purifying the protein product.

743
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:37,050
What if you just took that plasmid that
that contains the gene for hepatitis B

744
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:39,970
and you gave that directly to people?

745
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:46,410
Then you could get the hepatitis
B protein expressed in yourselves,

746
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:49,690
right? If we injected it
into a muscle, let's say,

747
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:54,040
and your muscle cells took up this plasmid
and now the plasmid started to do its

748
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:58,360
thing, which is replicate and
the gene gets transcribed,

749
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:01,030
then your muscle cells would
start producing hepatitis B,

750
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:05,470
surface antigen and your immune system
recognizing that's a foreign protein

751
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:06,670
would start responding to it.

752
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,890
And that concept is called a DNA
based vaccine are DNA vaccines,

753
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:17,070
so totally avoids the manufacturing
processes that are used to produce other

754
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:20,530
vaccines. You got a
manufacturer DNA. Instead.

755
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:26,770
I want to say a little bit about the cost
of vaccines because this is a part of

756
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,010
what makes it difficult to, uh, to, uh,

757
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,670
to accomplish what's usually our goal
in vaccine development, which is,

758
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:37,090
which is deliver the vaccine to
every population in the world.

759
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:42,091
But often vaccines cost a considerable
amount to produce the hepatitis B vaccine

760
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:44,020
I talked about before,

761
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:47,860
produced by recombinant DNA technology
is called [inaudible] of x, HB.

762
00:48:47,861 --> 00:48:50,770
That's one version of it.
And if you or I buy it,

763
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,390
it costs $51 per dose.
You need three doses to be effective.

764
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,860
Why do you need three doses of hepatitis
B? Because this is not a virus at all,

765
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:04,120
but it's a virus subunit. Your body
doesn't respond to it as strongly.

766
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:06,370
Your immune system doesn't
respond to it as strongly.

767
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,860
And so you have to formulate it properly.

768
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,060
That is mix it with things
which make it more, um,

769
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,860
make your immune system
respond more strongly.

770
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:19,780
And you have to inject it multiple times
because the first blip that you get,

771
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:22,090
an immune response is not very high,
right?

772
00:49:22,091 --> 00:49:26,350
You have to boost and often you have
to boost again in order to get a high

773
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:30,340
enough response to be protective.
So for any one of us, it costs 150,

774
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:34,720
$153, $156, uh, to be immunized. Now,

775
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,210
that is doable for us,
but that's not,

776
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,960
that's not affordable in many parts
of the world. And in addition,

777
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,610
this is just the cost of the vaccine,

778
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:46,030
not the cost of the doctor or
nurse who injects it into you.

779
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,220
So you have to figure
that cost in as well.

780
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,970
The CDC can buy this from the
manufacturer for a lowest lower price.

781
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:56,590
And when you hear about, about government
organizations distributing vaccines to,

782
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,710
uh, different parts of the world,
they're buying at a reduced rate,

783
00:49:59,711 --> 00:50:04,030
but it's still not inexpensive, right?
Uh, measles, mumps, and rubella.

784
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,120
This is an established
vaccine also quite expensive.

785
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:12,300
And I didn't have the commercial price
for the chickenpox vaccine called Vera

786
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:16,810
Vax, but you can imagine that it's
even more than $50 a dose for that one.

787
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,870
So I just wanted to try to
put that in perspective.

788
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,370
I also talked last time about smallpox
and the perceived need to produce more

789
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:29,360
smallpox vaccine in the event that
smallpox used as a weapon in 2002.

790
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:30,920
So shortly after nine 11,

791
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,420
the government made a
contract to a company called
a canvas to make 400 million

792
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:40,220
doses of smallpox for $343 million.
So this is not cheap, right?

793
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:45,460
And the problem is you've got to make
hundreds of millions of doses sometimes in

794
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:47,840
order to have an effect on
progress of the disease.

795
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:51,050
And so even if the cost is small,
$10 a dose,

796
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,840
it quickly amounts to a
large amount of money. Uh,

797
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,990
there were some problems with that
deal and I just give you one, uh,

798
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,520
one a news report on that,

799
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:03,030
but you can follow it if you're
interested in spite of that fact. Um,

800
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:03,690
uh,

801
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:08,480
it turns out that vaccines are one of
the best uses of our money in terms of

802
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:13,340
extending the lives of population.
And this is old data now from 1995,

803
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:16,490
but I don't think it's changed very much.
And it asks the question,

804
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:21,610
how much do different public health
interventions cost per life saved?

805
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:24,770
And so we have a mandatory
seatbelt law here.

806
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,170
That means that you have to have
seat belts and all your cars.

807
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:29,750
That means people paying more for cars
because they have seat belts and you have

808
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:32,540
to enforce the law and all the
costs that goes along with that.

809
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,150
In terms of life saved
by that may measure,

810
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:39,560
it's estimated that it costs
about $69 per life saved.

811
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:44,240
So that's a reasonable cost to spend,
uh, for something like measles,

812
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:48,170
mumps, and rubella immunization,
which costs what I showed you before.

813
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,330
You can save so many lives that way,

814
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:55,370
that the cost of distributing
and producing the vaccine
is actually less than,

815
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,240
than the, uh, the, the, the
value of the life's that save.

816
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:04,040
So it's saves money. Uh, you, you're
saving money by doing it, not,

817
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:08,990
it's not costing you. And obviously
these are complex calculations, uh,

818
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:12,890
but I just want to point out that
and smoking cessation advice,

819
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,370
advice about not smoking to
pregnant women is another, um,

820
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:20,420
another very inexpensive lifesaving
intervention intervention things that we

821
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:23,200
think are good.
And I'm not advocating,

822
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:27,230
we don't do them like having radiation
admissions standards for power plants,

823
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:32,060
nuclear power plants and other power
plants cost a lot of money per the risk

824
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:37,010
involved, uh, with them. And on
this scale, uh, vaccines are a very,

825
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:41,630
a very inexpensive way to save lives.
Okay,

826
00:52:41,631 --> 00:52:43,960
we'll stop there section this afternoon.
Uh,

827
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,140
we'll talk about disease spread through
populations and how vaccines impact that.
