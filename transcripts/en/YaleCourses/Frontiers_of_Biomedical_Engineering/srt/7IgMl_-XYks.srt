1
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,460
Welcome. So we're going to continue a
today talking about a drug delivery.

2
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:20,380
And I want to pick up where
I started last time. Uh,

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,140
where at the end of the class I was trying
to convince you that one way to think

4
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:30,141
about a drug delivery was to take
what we know is a complex system,

5
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,540
the human body and
represented in a simple way.

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,160
And this is a common approach to uh,
to um,

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,260
engineering where you take a system that
might be a complex system and you say,

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,950
how can I represent it in the most simple
way? And then you ask the question,

9
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:49,650
what comes out of that simple description?

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,450
And does it fit experimental evidence,
right?

11
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,150
Does it match what we know
about how things work?

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,540
And so this simplification was to take
the human body and represented as a

13
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:07,941
simple stirred vessel of
water and to ask the question,

14
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,470
if we introduce drugs into the body,

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,450
do they behave in the same way as if
I introduced drugs into this wealth,

16
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,840
stirred, uh, well stirred
vessel full of water?

17
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,190
Are there things that match about it?

18
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,410
And so we made the vessel a little bit
more complicated than a simple tank full

19
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,980
of water in that we,
uh,

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,020
we allow its volume to be variable and
this is going to account for the fact

21
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:36,330
that when we introduce
drugs into the body,

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,400
some of them are going to go to
different compartments within the body.

23
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,710
Some will remain confined to the
blood plasma space, for example,

24
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,570
while some will be
distributed more widely.

25
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,970
So we'll adjust the volume of the vessel
to match the drug some way and how it's

26
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,520
distributed.
And we'll assume that it's a,

27
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,900
that it's a magical vessel and another
sense and that drugs disappear and they

28
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,870
disappear in a very orderly
fashion. That is, they,

29
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,930
the rate of disappearance of the drugs
is equal to some constant times the

30
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:13,140
concentration.
So it's a first order.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,730
It's a first order rate of
elimination from this a compartment.

32
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,560
And if we do that, what I wrote
on the board, uh, today, uh,

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,090
the equations that are in the box at the
end of the chapter in chapter 14, uh,

34
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,260
just uh, to review them very quickly,
that if we have a system like this,

35
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:34,320
we know that mass has to be conserved.

36
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,490
And one way to write down the conservation
of mass equation is like this.

37
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,430
The amount that comes in minus
the amount that goes out,

38
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,440
plus any molecules that are generated
inside minus any molecules that are

39
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:50,370
consumed inside the system has
to be equal to accumulation.

40
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,600
And accumulation is just the
rate of change of concentration.

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,720
If molecules are are
accumulating inside the vessel,

42
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,030
that means their concentration
is either going up or down.

43
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,950
And so cumulation is the rate of
change with time of the total number of

44
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,690
molecules inside the vessel.

45
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,140
And if we went through this analysis for
the system that I drew up here and the

46
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:18,451
particular circumstance that I'm going
to inject drugs in to the body or into

47
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:24,190
this vessel at time,
t equals zero after time t equals zero,

48
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,440
no molecules are going
to be introduced right?

49
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:30,550
So this is when I'm just giving all the
drug at once at the beginning so I'm

50
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:35,551
simulating and intravenous injection so
there's nothing coming in and there's

51
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:40,570
nothing going out over the in terms of
drugs introduced over the time that I'm

52
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,404
interested in

53
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,590
your no molecules of drug
are being generated inside
the body but they are being

54
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,400
consumed,

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,330
they are disappearing in some way and
they're disappearing by this first order

56
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:57,331
process where the rate of disappearance
is equal to a constant times the number

57
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:02,341
of molecules that are still available
and I could solve this equation,

58
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,300
this differential equation
I I've told you yet,

59
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:07,360
if you don't know about solving
differential equations, don't worry.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,110
Another way to think about
it is here's the solution.

61
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,390
You could convince yourself that this
solution does match this equation.

62
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,940
If I take the derivative of
this and plug it back in here,

63
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:22,000
do I get the right answer?
It's another way to think about it.

64
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:26,770
Or You could just trust me that it is
the right solution to the equation and we

65
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,300
also have to know one more thing.

66
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,420
How many molecules of drug we introduced
at the beginning and we're going to

67
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,100
call that number m zero.

68
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,380
And so the final result is Amazon
equal to m zero e to the minus KT.

69
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,600
The amount of drug that I have within
the body at any time is equal to the

70
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:48,601
amount I had at times zero times and
exponential to the minus k times t power

71
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,830
whereK is this rate constant.
So if I knew what the rate constant was,

72
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,370
I knew how long after the injection I
knew how many molecules I'd injected at

73
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:06,610
the beginning, I could calculate
how many I have at any time. Right?

74
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,730
And another way to write this is to write,

75
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,460
not in terms of the total
number of molecules in the body,

76
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:16,540
but in terms of the concentration
and to get concentration,

77
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:20,020
I just divide both sides by the volume,
right?

78
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:24,490
So concentration in the body as a function
of time is equal to this expression.

79
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,100
And I applauded that a for you last
time in that plots shown here where if I

80
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:34,900
looked on a simple plot of
concentration versus time,

81
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,140
concentration starts at a maximum and
it drops and it drops exponentially over

82
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,090
time. Now, and this, this turns out,

83
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:47,530
this very simple model matches very well
the way many drugs behave if you inject

84
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,430
them into the body,

85
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,780
if you inject them intravenously in
this case and that the concentration

86
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,930
immediately after the injection will be
the highest and concentration will drop

87
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,100
over time.
And for many drugs,

88
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,600
the way that they're eliminated from
the body does result in first order

89
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:09,980
elimination like this. So
you see this pattern. Now,

90
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,180
another useful parameter to describe here
is that is what's called the half life.

91
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,500
How long do drugs remain in the body?
What's the time course of that?

92
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:23,000
And the half life is defined as the time
that it takes for drug concentration to

93
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:26,000
drop from one value to half of that value.

94
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,920
So it might drop from c equals
c zero down to half of CS.

95
00:06:31,921 --> 00:06:32,660
Jiro,

96
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,660
it might drop from half of [inaudible]
down to a quarter of c zero from a

97
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:40,820
quarter to an eighth.
What?

98
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,930
It doesn't matter where you start at
four processes where you have first order

99
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:45,800
elimination,

100
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,370
the time to get rid of half of the drugs
that are remaining is always the same.

101
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,200
That's a characteristic of
first order processes, right?

102
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,990
And that half life is just equal to
the natural log of two over the rate

103
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:57,824
constant.

104
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,430
So what this plot over here shows you
is how rapidly would drugs disappear for

105
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:09,581
drugs that had different half lives or
different rates of elimination and it's

106
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,590
plotted on a,
on a semi elog plot.

107
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:17,120
So this is the natural law or this
is the log based 10 actually of,

108
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,120
of um,
of,

109
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,270
of drug concentration in the
body as a function of time.

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,230
Here's a drug that has a half
life of 600 minutes long.

111
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,370
Half life means it stays in the
body for a long time. You clear it,

112
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,120
you get rid of it very slowly, a shorter
half life. You get rid of more quickly,

113
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,760
a very short half life,
you get rid of it very quickly.

114
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,250
So what's the result of that?

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,460
That for drugs with a short half life
drugs that the body gets rid of more

116
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:46,544
rapidly.

117
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,920
If the desired effect isn't
achieved with one dose,

118
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,120
I have to give another dose, right?
I'd have to give another dose.

119
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:58,580
If the drug had a half
life of six minutes,

120
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,800
I'd have to give another dose when the
drug concentration dropped down to a very

121
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:08,030
low level if I want to
maintain a high concentration.

122
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,020
Right? So knowing the half
life is really important.

123
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,470
And when you will see in a minute here,
um,

124
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,640
how this same factor
is important for drugs,

125
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,470
not just that her intravenously injected,

126
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:25,070
but for drugs that are
taken by pills as well.

127
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,800
But this is something that if you're,

128
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,020
if you're making a drug or
you're making it to sell,

129
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:34,520
you need to know about because you need
to tell people how frequently they can

130
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:39,080
take the drug. Right? And that depends
on how quickly your body gets rid of it.

131
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,130
That'll be more clear in
just a moment. I hope so.

132
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:48,131
That's the simplest possible model and
it matches very well the behavior of many

133
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,270
drugs when they're injected intravenously.

134
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,610
But how could I extend this to talk about,

135
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,590
to think about other situations as well.
Well,

136
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,120
what's dip rent if I don't directly
inject the molecules into the body,

137
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,710
but I take them by a pill.
That means if this is,

138
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,280
if this is most of your body.
Now when I take a pill,

139
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,560
I'm not introducing the drugs all at once,

140
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,760
but I'm putting them into my intestinal
system and they're being slowly absorbed

141
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,380
into the body,
right?

142
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,450
So one way to describe that is to
add another compartment to the model,

143
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,460
to add another compartment to this
simple model and say, here is a dose,

144
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:31,170
but it's a dose in form of a pill and
the patient is gonna swallow it. Nate,

145
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,700
would you mind closing that door for me?
And the patient is gonna swallow it.

146
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,120
And then that drug will be available
in a particular sub compartment of the

147
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,270
body.

148
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,270
Now it's going to be in the
intestine and it will be absorbed.

149
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,623
Thanks very much.

150
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,950
It will be absorbed from the
intestine into the bulk of the body,

151
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,360
into the circulatory system
where it can distribute. Now,

152
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,730
I'm not going to write down
the equations for this, but,

153
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:04,230
but you could do that and you could solve
this equation and what you would find

154
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,050
is,
is this curve here,

155
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,920
which matches your intuition.

156
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,010
Probably that what happens if I swallow
a pill and that pill dissolves in my

157
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:22,950
intestinal tract and then molecules
get absorbed slowly into the body.

158
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,560
Is that right after I take the pill,

159
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:30,561
the concentration hasn't changed inside
my blood yet inside the bulk of my body

160
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,890
because the molecules are
still outside your body.

161
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:36,390
They're still in your intestinal tract,

162
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,170
but they slowly get absorbed
and as they get absorbed,

163
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,200
concentration rises can see concentration
rising here and now what happens to

164
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,680
those molecules that are
circulating in your body? Well,

165
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:54,420
the same thing happens to them is what?

166
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:57,270
What happened to them if
they were injected is that
your body is trying to get

167
00:10:57,271 --> 00:11:00,780
rid of them, right?
But at this point here,

168
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,530
the rate at which they're being absorbed
as much faster than the rate that your

169
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:08,610
body is getting rid of them.
And so the concentration is rising,

170
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,430
it eventually reaches a peak.

171
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Most of the drug has now been absorbed
and concentrations start to fall.

172
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,350
What's happening during this phase
is that most of the drug has now been

173
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,410
absorbed.
So the rate at which you're getting,

174
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,620
it's coming into your body from the
pill that's dissolving and the molecules

175
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,820
being absorbed through the
intestinal track is being, uh,

176
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,530
that rate is less than the rate at
which your body is getting rid of it.

177
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,050
And so the concentration starts to drop.

178
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,630
So if you took Acetaminophen or you took,
if you took Ibuprofen,

179
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,130
which is Advil or Motrin,

180
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,730
what's happening in your body
is over some period of time,

181
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:57,760
usually 10 minutes to half an hour,

182
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,000
the molecules are being
absorbed from your intestine.

183
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,700
The concentration in your
blood is starting to rise.

184
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,610
If you took a pill and then you
measured concentrations in your blood,

185
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:09,970
you'd see those concentrations
start to rise. They reach a peak,

186
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,060
say half an hour after you take it and,

187
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,120
and hopefully whatever aches or pains
or whatever the reason you're taking the

188
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,770
medication for, you start to feel an
effect of it after some period of time.

189
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,140
And then concentration start to fall.

190
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,920
Now eventually they'll fall to such a
low level that the drug doesn't have its

191
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,050
desired effect anymore.
Right.

192
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:40,450
And in the event that your pain
hasn't gone away, you'll take another

193
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,100
dose, in which case the
same events we'll repeat,

194
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,940
right? Drug will be absorbed,
concentration will go up,

195
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,310
and then it'll start to fall again.
Right.

196
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:55,340
And so what you would see
on repeated doses here,

197
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,340
I show the effect of giving
one dose at time zero,

198
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,010
giving another dose at 120 minutes,

199
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,390
giving a third dose at 240 minutes.
So this would be taking a drug,

200
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,040
taking pills every two hours,
right?

201
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,500
And each one of the pills you take
yields the same behavior and the total

202
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:20,090
concentration in your blood is
just the sum of each of those,

203
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,700
the effect of each of those doses,
right?

204
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,480
So each of those doses would have
produced what are the dotted lines here?

205
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,110
The total effect that you
would see is this purple line,

206
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,843
right?

207
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
So let's say this drug is effective
when the concentration is 0.1

208
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,090
let's say this drug is effective.

209
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:47,091
When the concentration is 0.1 well
that means after what time is after 20

210
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:51,480
minutes or so after the first dose,

211
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,610
I get a level that's above 0.1 and I start
to feel some relief from the symptoms.

212
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,600
Concentrations peak, I'm feeling
good. They start to drop.

213
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,310
I know because I read the bottle, it
said take a dose every two hours, right?

214
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,260
I take another dose at two hours the
concentration rises again and so by,

215
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,720
by repeating these doses every two hours,

216
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:17,580
I maintain the concentration over 0.1
and I have an effect from the drug that

217
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:18,750
lasts long time.

218
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,770
What if at 0.3 what if had a concentration
of 0.3 you begin to see side effects,

219
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,390
right? What if had a concentration of
0.3 you begin to see side effects? Well,

220
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,200
no problem after the first dose.
After the second dose,

221
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,880
I've slipped into the range where I
might start to see side effects after the

222
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:39,810
third dose.

223
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,100
I'm clearly up into the range
where side effects might happen.

224
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,630
And so you're,

225
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,890
there's some danger as you repeat doses
that because drug is accumulating that

226
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,950
uh, you could slip into a range
where you start to see side effects.

227
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
Now the reason why you
can, uh, you can, um,

228
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,580
as I mentioned this last time,

229
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:07,250
but it should be more clear now
when you look at this picture,

230
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,960
the reason why you can take some drugs
like Ibuprofen or aspirin or drugs that

231
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,830
you typically buy over the counter without
a doctor's prescription and therefore

232
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,200
without a doctor's
guidance on taking them.

233
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,370
The reason why you can buy those and
use them yourself is because the toxic

234
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:27,050
levels don't occur until
hi on this chart,

235
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,250
right? Side effects don't occur
until high on this chart, right?

236
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,670
And so you can safely take it and without
much risk that side effects are going

237
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,320
to occur for many drugs.
However,

238
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,010
the side effects occur
at lower concentrations,

239
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:47,810
concentrations that are closer to the
dose you need in order to have a useful

240
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:51,770
response. And so those are ones that
you have to be more careful with.

241
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:55,670
Those are ones that physicians don't want
to prescribe unless they're seeing you

242
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,080
frequently enough that they can monitor
how well you're doing with the drug.

243
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,330
Right. And, um, does she give you
some idea about why that happens?

244
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,433
Right.

245
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,420
So people have been
thinking for a long time.

246
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,760
We talked about why different
modes of administration,

247
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:19,761
oral administration is the preferred mode
for almost all kinds of drugs because

248
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,860
it can be self administered.

249
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:27,660
It's very convenient and people
don't mind taking drugs that way. Uh,

250
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,730
but there are problems with it.
For example,

251
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:34,731
this problem of how do you maintain
constant levels within this safe range,

252
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,940
uh, over long periods of time. And um,

253
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:44,150
so this just shows that same plot again
with the levels rising and falling with

254
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:49,080
the minimum effective and the maximum
tolerated concentrations shown explicitly

255
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:49,830
here.

256
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,510
And what's shown by the Blue Line
is sort of what you might prefer,

257
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,110
some kind of a drug delivery system that
gives you long lasting concentrations,

258
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,310
but concentrations that don't rise and
fall in the way that they do when you're

259
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:11,270
taking a, when you're taking
individual doses repeatedly.

260
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,490
All right.
Now could you do this with an oral,

261
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,563
with a pill?

262
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Could you achieve this sort
of long lasting constant
concentration with a pill?

263
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,670
Will you could in some rare circumstances,
right?

264
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,800
Think about how would that happen? Well,
maybe a drug has a very long half life.

265
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,430
If you could design a drug that
had a very, very long half life,

266
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,650
you could main Kate tank
concentrations for a long time. Nate,

267
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:45,650
you have a question? Yes, so let me,

268
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,530
let me get to that in just a minute.
Did, but that's a really good,

269
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,000
that's a really good point. So, but
an alternate to that would be to say,

270
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,560
what if I had a drug that
that had a long half life,

271
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:58,170
well that would naturally
have this kind of a pattern.

272
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,830
Okay.

273
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,970
Instead of that,

274
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,110
what if I design a pill
that releases it slowly?

275
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:09,230
So thinking about a couple of slides ago,

276
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:13,460
what if I designed a pill that was
absorbed very slowly from the intestine,

277
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,990
right?
If I make it absorbed so slowly,

278
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,970
that drug is continually coming into
your body over a long period of time,

279
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:27,500
right? The peak in this diagram
occurs after only 30 minutes or so.

280
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,520
What if I designed a a pill such that
the drug was absorbed over five hours?

281
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,220
Right?

282
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,450
Then I could extend,

283
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,080
then I could extend this period here and
I could have drug concentrations that

284
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:47,250
remain long,
a long time.

285
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:51,240
This would be five hours instead of 60
minutes down here where the peak occurs,

286
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:54,540
right?
What's the limit of that?

287
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,470
Why is there a limit on how far
you can go with that approach?

288
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,410
Jasmine? There's only so much drug, so,

289
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,100
so it might be that you
know as if you do that,

290
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,330
then your pills getting larger and larger
and presumably, and there's only so,

291
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,990
so big a pill you could swallow
so that that could be a problem.

292
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,560
But most compounds fairly potent.
If he had something that was potent,

293
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:23,400
you could still put several days' worth
into a pill that was of a reasonable

294
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:26,940
size. So that might not be
the limitation for every drug.

295
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:30,120
But that's a really good point.
What's another limitation?

296
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,680
That's another limitation. Yeah. Neilia

297
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,150
so that's a real, that's a real
safety is a really good point.

298
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:52,150
And what I've been talking about here
is how these things behave in an average

299
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:52,930
person.

300
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,670
And what if you happen to absorb drugs
much more quickly than the average person

301
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,270
and you've got several days' worth
of drug you're taking in one pill,

302
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:02,650
but it gets absorbed more quickly.

303
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:05,800
You could go into this
toxic or side effect range.

304
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:08,230
So safety is certainly an issue.

305
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,563
Yeah.

306
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,030
One more.
How often do you eat?

307
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,150
Why? Why? Why don't we
only eat once a day?

308
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,950
Yeah.
Sorry.

309
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,010
Because that's the rate at which
you absorb food. Right? And that's,

310
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,380
that's the rate at which
your intestinal system works.

311
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:40,850
Things pass through at a certain rate,
right? You can't really slow that down,

312
00:20:40,851 --> 00:20:41,870
right?
You can't really,

313
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,820
you can eat more and feel full for a
period of time feel satisfied. But that,

314
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,490
but you can't,

315
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,510
you won't continue to be
absorbing more drugs because,

316
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,500
because whatever you take into your
intestine passes through in a matter of

317
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,820
hours,
right?

318
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,050
There's a transit rate through your
intestinal system that is not very

319
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:07,470
changeable.
And so a pill that you take can,

320
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,200
is only going to be there as long as
it's still in your intestinal tract.

321
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,230
And there's a limit to how
long it will last, right?

322
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,970
It's not going to last forever.

323
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:21,030
We know this from our experience with
food and eliminating the waste products of

324
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:25,570
food, right? That there's a time course
there that can't be altered very much.

325
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,930
And so there's a limit to how much
you can do in terms of sustaining or

326
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:33,790
prolonging release with an oral system.

327
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,650
So people have designed other methods
and as, as I mentioned, this is,

328
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:43,180
this is my research lab.
This is my specialty. So I'm
going to talk about some,

329
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,750
um, some things that we've designed
to try to get around these, uh,

330
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,200
these barriers in,
um,

331
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,590
for certain kinds of drugs
in certain situations.

332
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,980
One way that you could get around it is
by designing not something that's taken

333
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:03,640
orally, but by designing a
delivery system that's implanted.

334
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,100
All right. Now when you start thinking
about this is not a pill but an implant,

335
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,300
you're automatically limiting it to
certain kinds of conditions, right?

336
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,600
You wouldn't want to get an
implant for a headache, right?

337
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,490
Or something that you
know is going to go away.

338
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,210
You're talking about serious
medical problems that are ongoing.

339
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,850
So this might be for something like
treating diabetes where you need to take

340
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:29,830
drugs every day,
multiple times a day.

341
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,360
It might be pretreating something like
cancer where a course of chemotherapy

342
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:37,630
could last for several weeks
or several months, right?

343
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,290
It might be for treating
longterm disorders like, uh,

344
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,740
like hemophilia where you're
deficient in factor eight,

345
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,800
a protein in the blood and you need
to have a injections of factor eight

346
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:54,640
continuously, right? So it's only for
certain kinds of things, but, but,

347
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:55,570
but um,

348
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,950
but you could imagine that there are
those kinds of medical problems that you

349
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:02,620
could treat. Well, here's
one way to achieve long,

350
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,780
long release of drug into the body
from an implant to make implants out of

351
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:10,090
biocompatible materials like polymers.

352
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,900
So what's shown on the bottom of this
slide here is an implant that's made of a

353
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:17,680
gray substance, which is a
polymer, a biocompatible polymer.

354
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,750
Imagine it's something like, um, like uh,

355
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,730
the contact lenses that you would
put in contact with your eye.

356
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,930
These are materials that are synthetic
materials, but uh, their, uh,

357
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,460
their Ma that your body doesn't respond
to them as foreign objects very strongly,

358
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,673
right?
You can put,

359
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,230
you can put some polymers in contact
with one of the most sensitive areas of

360
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,370
your body,
your eye,

361
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,570
and it can remain there for a long period
of time without very much response of

362
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:45,530
your body to the material.
Well,

363
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:48,590
what if you took that material
embedded within it drug molecules.

364
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,400
And that's what's shown here. And in
fact, it's not just molecules of drug,

365
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,240
it's solid particles of drug,
which has shown is the orange dots here.

366
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,360
So that this whole thing is maybe the
size of a coin, maybe the size of a dime.

367
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,590
Right? And what I'm showing you here
is a cross section of that dime, dime,

368
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,920
laying flat. I cut it like this.
You're looking at it from this side.

369
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,650
So it's a millimeter or so in depth,

370
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,640
several millimeters in diameter,

371
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,160
and it's a solid polymer.

372
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,850
But inside of it are particles of
the drug that you want to deliver.

373
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,200
And what these graphs show
our experiments that we did.

374
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,270
This was back in the late 1980s where we
put drug molecules into these polymers

375
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,870
and then just drop them into a test
tube and ask the question, could we,

376
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,130
could we release drugs slowly from
these implants so we could make a long

377
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:41,570
lasting pill,

378
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,710
essentially make a long lasting
implant that slowly released drugs.

379
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,980
And this shows for a drug that is
used to treat Parkinson's disease,

380
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:56,390
another sort of chronic indication where
patients have to take drugs every day

381
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,100
for the rest of their life.
Uh,

382
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,400
and this shows that when you drop these
implants into a test tube full of water,

383
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,310
the dopamine is released and it's
released for a fairly long period of time.

384
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,180
This is days here. So this point
here is 30 days, about a month.

385
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:17,110
So one of these systems released
a drug for a period of a month,

386
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,380
one released for almost three months here,

387
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:24,320
a sort of continuous and
reliable sorts of drugs.

388
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:27,890
So you can make implants that release
drug molecules over long periods of time.

389
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,350
And the rest of these curves just show
you that you could do this with, with uh,

390
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,590
drugs like dopamine that are small and
molecular weight and water soluble.

391
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,970
You could do it with proteins which
are higher in molecular weight and uh,

392
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,860
and uh,
also water soluble.

393
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,450
You could even do it with gene therapy
vectors with plasmids we talked about

394
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,760
several weeks ago. Plasma
DNA, these are big molecules,

395
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,520
very difficult to administer,
right?

396
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:57,020
We talked about how hard it is to
get plasma DNA inside of cells,

397
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,440
but you can put them into these polymers
and they'll slowly be released from the

398
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:01,880
polymer over a long period of time.

399
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,260
So one could potentially make a long
lasting gene therapy delivery system.

400
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:12,850
One of the advantages of making these
materials out of polymers is that we now

401
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:17,330
know how to, you can make all
kinds of things out of polymers.

402
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,830
That's one of the nice features of
plastics or polymers is that you can mold

403
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:25,070
them and shape them into all
sorts of kinds of devices.

404
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,760
So here this is that
same kind of material,

405
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,270
but instead of making a,
a coin out of it,

406
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,910
we coated it onto the surface of a wire.

407
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,880
So this is a bare wire and it's
the kind of wire that, uh, that um,

408
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,460
you can put into the brain and you can
measure recordings of what's happening in

409
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:46,830
the, in the brain, extra cellular space.

410
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,300
So you can measure action potentials
and electrical activity in the brain by

411
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:55,470
putting electrodes in. And physicians
do this all the time to measure,

412
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,060
to measure activity in the brain, in
patients that have epilepsy, for example.

413
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,810
But one of the problems
with these materials is that
when you put them into the

414
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:06,590
brain,
they're not completely biocompatible.

415
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,720
The brain does respond to them and
it will form a scar around them and

416
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,580
eventually the electrode
won't work anymore.

417
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,830
So we coated these electrodes with
a polymer that contained drug.

418
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,200
In this case it's a drug dexamethazone.

419
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:22,260
It's a steroid that prevents
scar formation locally.

420
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,000
And so you make a wire that's able to
record but it's also able to deliver a

421
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:30,600
drug. And so now when this
is placed in the brain,

422
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,740
you're not only can make the recordings
but the drug is slowly being released

423
00:27:34,741 --> 00:27:39,060
and it prevents scar formation around
the outside of the electrode and the

424
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:43,860
electrode will function for a longer
period of time inside the, uh,

425
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:48,480
the patient. So this is an example
of taking a medical device,

426
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:50,340
the kind of devices
we've been talking about,

427
00:27:50,341 --> 00:27:55,341
and we'll continue to talk
about and making it safer
and better by adding a drug

428
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,114
delivery.

429
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,260
The other advantage to this is that I
didn't have to deliver steroids all over

430
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:04,650
the body in order to
accomplish this effect, right?

431
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:07,830
We've put the steroids right on the
device and they act locally when they're

432
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:11,910
needed. So you don't have steroids
delivered all over the body,

433
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:15,630
but only at the site where you're
doing the intervention. Well,

434
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:20,610
this has become a very big business
in, um, in, uh, uh, around the world.

435
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,140
And that's because several companies
took this kind of technology that, uh,

436
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:30,060
that had been developed and used it in
a very clinically important application.

437
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,530
What this shows you here is a stent.
It's made of a metal.

438
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:35,580
This is one kind of it.

439
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:39,270
There are many sorts of versions
of this and I imagine this is a,

440
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:43,620
this is a stent that's expanded,
uh, over this tube that's inside.

441
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,110
But you can imagine this design here,

442
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:50,280
which looks like a kind of a chicken
wire fence could be collapsed,

443
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,470
right?
Because the wires are,

444
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,010
would bend and you can collapse
this into a smaller form.

445
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,540
So what they do is they collapse this
into a form around the end of a tube

446
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,530
called a catheter.

447
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,120
And so this a shrunken version of this
stent shrunk and only in its diameter

448
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:13,311
being reduced is then put into your
body at the catheter is a long narrow

449
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:20,810
plastic tube that can be inserted into
a a distal artery like your femoral

450
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:22,050
artery in your leg.

451
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,190
And then physicians know how to move
this catheter up into your body and

452
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:28,530
actually into the blood
blood vessels of your heart.

453
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,120
So they put this tube up
into your coronary artery.

454
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,880
Now one of the manifestations of heart
disease is that coronary arteries become

455
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,560
a sclerotic there.

456
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,910
They become narrowed because you
get atherosclerotic plaques there.

457
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,470
If the vessel becomes narrowed than
blood can't flow through very easily and

458
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:54,820
that can lead to pain in your chest
because your heart is not getting enough

459
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:59,821
blood and can lead to a heart attack
or loss of blood flow to the heart and

460
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:04,180
death of that tissue.
So when that process starts to happen,

461
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,900
what if you put one of these catheters
in and I didn't tell you that the

462
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:12,901
catheter also has a balloon on the tip
and the balloon is underneath this stent.

463
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,440
So once you've got it in place,
you blow up the balloon,

464
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,510
the stent becomes larger,

465
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,610
it forces the blood vessel to become
open and then you deflate the balloon.

466
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:28,450
And because this is made of metal, it
doesn't deflate when the balloon deflates,

467
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,530
but it stays there inside your blood
vessel holding the blood vessel open.

468
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,070
So now blood flow can continue.
All right.

469
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,360
And this is a very common medical therapy.

470
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:40,390
This done as an alternative
to heart bypass.

471
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,050
We'll talk about heart bypass
operations, uh, in a few weeks.

472
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,780
But instead of having a new
blood vessel put into your heart,

473
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:50,440
which is a major operation, you can
put this stent in, blow up the balloon,

474
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:52,270
inflate the vet vessel,

475
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,530
and the stent is left behind in
order to keep the vessel open.

476
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,180
Well, you could imagine that this
is not a normal circumstance.

477
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:05,860
Your blood vessels were not designed to
have a piece of metal inserted in them

478
00:31:05,861 --> 00:31:08,170
to hold them open.
And in fact,

479
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,380
they respond to this and they respond
in the way that your body responds to

480
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:17,650
having foreign objects put into it.
It tries to form a scar around it.

481
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:23,580
And often that scar formation will
occur so aggressively that scarf tissue

482
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:27,040
starts to fill in the vessel
where that you've opened.

483
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,980
And this process is called restenosis.

484
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,420
So what these companies did was took
these stents which were known to be very

485
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:39,421
effective and physicians are very
capable and able to to put these into the

486
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:42,730
body, into the coronary
vascular system now readily.

487
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,390
And they coded the wires with a polymer.

488
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,370
And that's what's shown
in this cartoon here.

489
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,520
The yellow is a wire and
this gray is a polymer,

490
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:55,300
like the polymers I've been describing
and why coated with a polymer,

491
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:59,800
because now you can put drugs inside
the polymer and the drugs will be slowly

492
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:04,210
released from this polymer coating.
So this becomes not just a stent,

493
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,750
but what they call him, the
industry, a drug eluting stent.

494
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,670
It releases drugs that prevent
scar formation locally.

495
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:17,470
So a patient that has heart disease
gets one of these stents put in their

496
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:18,520
vascular system,

497
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:24,210
they opened up the artery and now that
stent not only holds the artery open,

498
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,320
but it contains enough drug molecules
that are released slowly over time that

499
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:33,640
prevents this restenosis.

500
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:38,200
And the vessel stays open for hopefully
the rest of their life. Right.

501
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,730
We're going to talk more about about uh,

502
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,920
stents and mechanical objects
like this that are used for uh,

503
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:50,000
for medical therapy later.
The important part here is the,

504
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,030
is the coding on the skin which releases
drugs very slowly and it's really just

505
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:59,480
an extension of what I showed
you in the last couple of slides.

506
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:05,650
These were really at least
into the approved by the
FDA and in 2002 or so a few

507
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,540
years ago and became one of the biggest
selling drug products ever in a US

508
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,840
history.
Uh,

509
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,380
which tells you something about sort of
the clinical need for things like this.

510
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,180
Again,
like that other system,

511
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,290
one of the advantages is you're not
delivering drugs over the whole body but

512
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:26,570
only in the vessel where you need it,
right?

513
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,240
Only in the vessel where
the scar is going to form.

514
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,930
And so you can deliver drugs locally,

515
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,050
you can prevent side effects that
would happen in other places.

516
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,820
One more example.
And in that,

517
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:44,140
in that example I just
showed you that you, you,

518
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:48,080
you have a stent which is going to remain
in the patient for a long period of

519
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:50,270
time. And there's a good reason
to put the stent there, right?

520
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:52,880
To hold this vessel open so that
you can get good blood flow.

521
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,460
In other situations,
you might want to introduce an implant,

522
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:02,060
but you don't want the implant to
last forever, right? Because it's not,

523
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,750
it's not a natural material.
You might like the implant to go away.

524
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,500
And so there are some polymers like this
that can be made into devices like this

525
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,310
implant here,
which is again about the size of a coin,

526
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,030
but it's made of a very special polymer
that's different than the kinds that are

527
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:23,510
used in contact lenses in
that it slowly dissolves.

528
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:29,240
So if I implant this co coin made of
this kind of material into the body,

529
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,340
it will slowly dissolve.

530
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,320
So if I implanted under the skin and
then I go back and I look several months

531
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,010
later, the implant itself is
totally, totally disappeared.

532
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,730
Um, and you, of course you
can't do this without any,

533
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,410
with just any kind of material,

534
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:48,980
has to be a very special material is
both biocompatible that your body doesn't

535
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:53,981
respond to and that dissolves down
to molecules that are not toxic,

536
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,290
right? So it's not so easy
to design these things,

537
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,240
but there are some materials
that are available.

538
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:01,970
Now what we did in this experiment,

539
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:06,971
which showed that you could load these
polymers with chemotherapy drugs and

540
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:12,200
these are just three
different chemotherapy drugs
and you could load them in

541
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:16,780
such a way that if you put
this material into water, uh,

542
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:21,800
the chemotherapy drugs would be slowly
released. And that's what's shown here.

543
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,820
This is with the, uh,
the drug, uh, Bcnu. It's,

544
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,120
it's a drug that's commonly used to treat,
or at least it was in the 1990s,

545
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:34,121
commonly used to treat brain cancer and
it's released over a period of seven

546
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:37,830
days.
90% of the is released.

547
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,420
And then the last 10% comes out
over a period of several months.

548
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,050
If we look longer than that,
all the drug is gone now.

549
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:50,070
And then the polymer itself starts to
dissolve. And so by three months later,

550
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:53,490
four months later,
the whole device has disappeared,

551
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,910
but it disappears in an orderly fashion.
In fact,

552
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:59,040
we engineered it to work just this way,

553
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,120
such that most of the drug would be
released rapidly over a period of a week.

554
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:08,610
10% of the drug would be released more
slowly over a period of several months.

555
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,830
And then the device itself
would be completely gone in
a period of six months or

556
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:16,950
so. So what would you use this for? Well,

557
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,600
this was designed as a,
um,

558
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,660
as a device that you would give to
neurosurgeons so that they could improve

559
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,100
therapy of brain tumors.

560
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,960
And you probably know that,

561
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,310
uh, that, that tumors of the brain
are among the most difficult to treat.

562
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,250
If you get a tumor in the
central nervous system,

563
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,630
they have very poor
prognosis or life expectancy.

564
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:49,980
People that get aggressive brain tumors
die within a very short time after it's

565
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:52,140
diagnosed, unfortunately. And that can,

566
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,760
that situation hasn't changed much
over the last hundred years. Um,

567
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,700
and one of the reasons is
what we mentioned earlier,

568
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,910
that the brain is protected from chemical
entry by the blood brain barrier.

569
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,590
Capillaries in your brain don't
allow molecules to move across them.

570
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,880
And there's good reasons for that so
that your brain chemistry can remain

571
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:18,510
constant throughout the day.
But because of that blood brain barrier,

572
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:22,140
if you give drugs the normal way
by taking pills or injections,

573
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,620
you get high doses everywhere else,
but not very much gets into the brain.

574
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,440
We thought that when they do
neurosurgery to remove a tumor,

575
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:35,370
which is commonly done,
the brain is exposed,

576
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,710
then the surgeon has an opportunity
then to do something extraordinary.

577
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,510
And that is to after the surgery,
they removed the tumor,

578
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:50,250
then they could place these wafers
inside the surgical resection cavity.

579
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,070
So where the tumor used to be,

580
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,160
you place these coins that are made of
this degradable polymer that released

581
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:03,351
these drugs very slowly and the patient
leaves the operating room with most of

582
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:05,910
their tumor gone.

583
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,680
And in addition,
these drug delivery systems,

584
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:15,681
which are releasing drugs slowly to
kill any tumor cells that remain in the

585
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:21,930
vicinity of the surgical site.
Uh,

586
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:26,040
this is, uh, this is a different
strategy for drug delivery, right?

587
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,560
It's a very specialized
strategy for delivering drugs.

588
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:32,460
It's one that takes advantage of the fact
that you're having a medical procedure

589
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,294
already.

590
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Can we design something that's going to
make that procedure even more effective?

591
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,400
And this was approved by the FDA.

592
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:44,401
It's now the standard of care for
treating brain tumors at most countries in

593
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:46,090
the, uh, in the world.

594
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,890
Okay.

595
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,660
How could you make this more,

596
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:55,610
how could you make this kind of technology
or this kind of engineering more

597
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,910
accessible? Right? Here was an example,

598
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:03,911
actually several examples of very
specialized applications of this different

599
00:39:04,731 --> 00:39:05,870
form of drug delivery.

600
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,640
Yeah.

601
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,260
Well,
one way you could do it is by,

602
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,640
is by shrinking these devices down so
that they're so small that could be

603
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:15,560
introduced through a needle.
Right?

604
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,200
Those wafers I showed you before,
it could be used by surgeons because they,

605
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,330
the tissue is exposed, right?
And you can implant things in.

606
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,050
That's not the case for
many other indications.

607
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:33,530
Surgery isn't done in
every medical situation.

608
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,840
But if you could put a needle into the
body and introduce these delivery systems

609
00:39:38,841 --> 00:39:40,070
through needles,

610
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:44,390
then maybe that would make it
better for other forms of, uh,

611
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:47,300
of disease.
So these are microparticles.

612
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,020
They're made of the same
kinds of degradable polymers,

613
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:55,940
but they're very tiny particles now
and in, in section this afternoon,

614
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:59,760
we'll talk about how you make these
kinds of particles and, and, and uh,

615
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,650
you'll actually be able to make
some, uh, but, uh, these are,

616
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,490
these particular ones are made of the
same kind of polymer that slowly degrades,

617
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,050
but they're very small. They're a micron
or so in diameter. So they're much,

618
00:40:12,051 --> 00:40:17,051
much smaller than a needle and they
can be injected through a needle.

619
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,880
You just imagine
suspending these particles,

620
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:24,410
which looked like dust in water and
then injecting them through a needle.

621
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,070
They also have the property that you
can put drugs in them at fairly high

622
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:31,130
concentration and the drugs
are released slowly over time.

623
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:36,350
So that if I put a needle into a
tissue and introduce these particles,

624
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,610
the particles will sit there at the
tissue side and they'll release the drug

625
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:43,400
molecules for a long period of
time just like the implants do.

626
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,730
And so just to show
that this works and how,

627
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,320
how tiny you might be able to make the
particles and how locally you might be

628
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:52,250
able to deliver them.

629
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,480
We made some particles like this and
we injected them into the eye of a,

630
00:40:56,481 --> 00:40:59,510
of an animal that had a retinal disease.

631
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:04,100
The the animal had a disease of the retina
as such, that would cause blindness.

632
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,880
And ordinarily there are many drugs
that are known to prevent this kind of

633
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:14,240
blindness, but they have
short half lives, right?

634
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:18,680
So if I inject the drug directly into
the eye, it disappears within a day.

635
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,240
Okay.

636
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,940
And so here's a drug that works.

637
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,760
Here's a condition that
it works in it's edition,

638
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:29,450
that it's a condition that causes a
very serious medical problem blindness.

639
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,340
But in order to use the drug, you have
to get an injection in the eye every day.

640
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,510
That's the only way to get concentrations
high enough for it to be effective.

641
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,810
But if you put it into the
particles that I showed you before,

642
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:45,200
you put the same drug into the particles,
you inject the particles into the eye,

643
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,880
the particles stay there in the eye,

644
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:51,881
they stay there for a long time and
drug concentration now lasts for 30 days

645
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:53,270
instead of one day.

646
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:59,020
So this takes what would
be an unthinkable therapy,

647
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:04,180
right? Difficult to think. Even if
blind, if you want to avoid blind,

648
00:42:04,181 --> 00:42:07,450
it's difficult to think about getting
an injection in your eye once a day for

649
00:42:07,451 --> 00:42:11,330
the rest of
the time you want to remain eyesight.

650
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,990
But you might think about it once a month,
right?

651
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,260
If it meant the difference between being
able to see and not being able to see

652
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,130
if we can make the particles better
such that they worked for three months,

653
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,760
that makes it even more possible.
If they work for a year,

654
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:31,330
then once a year and you can see that's
a therapy that would be acceptable to

655
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:36,320
most people. So it's, it's an
example of an approach but it,

656
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,590
but it also shows the constraints
of the approach, right?

657
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,780
So far we can do a month,

658
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,790
we'd like to be able to do longer and
as we do longer, this will become, uh,

659
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,010
a more,
uh,

660
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:52,250
therapy that's more likely to be
adopted into clinical practice.

661
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:56,270
And you can imagine that making it longer
requires better engineering of these

662
00:42:56,271 --> 00:43:01,271
particles and it's hard to make particles
that are really small but hold on to

663
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:03,980
drugs for a long time.
Right?

664
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:08,060
That's a hard thing to make particles
that are really small but hold on to drugs

665
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:08,894
for a long time.

666
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,350
What we've gotten good at so far is
making particles that are really,

667
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:16,400
really small. So these are the, these
are sort of the state of the art.

668
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:19,010
These are particles that are
made about degradable polymer.

669
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,320
They're only 150 nanometers in size.
So now much smaller than a micron,

670
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,480
even these are the size of a virus.

671
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:31,070
So we were talking about smallpox virus
before a naturally occurring pathogen.

672
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,180
These are synthetic polymers made totally
in the laboratory that are the same

673
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:40,181
size as a virus and they're made of a
polymer that's well known to be safe.

674
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,760
And they also contain drug.
These particular particles, uh,

675
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:48,890
were made by a graduate student who
worked with me named Amaryllis Sanchez,

676
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:53,891
and Amaryllis was able to put 20% by
weight of a chemotherapy drug inside these

677
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:57,950
very tiny particles,
particles the size of a virus.

678
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,870
And even though the
particles are very tiny,

679
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:04,700
the drug comes out relatively slowly
over a period of about a week. Now, why,

680
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,630
why make, why make a
particle so small? Well,

681
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,800
it turns out that these particles are
so small that they can actually enter

682
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:14,870
cells like viruses.

683
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,150
They can infect cells only they don't
infect in the same way that a virus does

684
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,330
because they're totally synthetic,
right? They don't reproduce.

685
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,760
They just sit inside the cells and they
release chemotherapy drugs in this case.

686
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:29,900
Well,

687
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,900
that's makes possible a totally
different strategy for treating cancer.

688
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:35,510
You know,

689
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:40,510
and one of the problems with treating
cancer is that cancer drugs have to get

690
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,010
deep inside the cell in order to work.

691
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:48,690
Most of them work by inhibiting cell
division and most of the targets for

692
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:52,320
inhibiting cell division or not just
within cells, they're within the nucleus,

693
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,310
inside the cell.

694
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:59,970
And the approach for chemotherapy is to
deliver these toxic drugs all over the

695
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:04,971
body and hope that they get into tumor
cells and hope that they get into tumor

696
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:11,031
cells at high enough concentrations
that they can reach these targets,

697
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:14,430
deepen the nucleus.
Well,

698
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:19,970
what is possible we think with this
approach is that you can design not just,

699
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,060
um,
long release of drugs.

700
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,520
I didn't do a very good job
there. Uh, but you can. Um,

701
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,590
but you can design particles that will
specifically recognize tumor cells in the

702
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:39,801
same way that viruses recognize tumor
cells or specific cells that will enter

703
00:45:40,381 --> 00:45:44,220
only certain cells and that they'll
release their drugs only when they've

704
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:46,170
entered the correct cell.

705
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,380
And that would be
potentially a much safer,

706
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,350
more effective a form of chemotherapy.

707
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:54,900
Okay.

708
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,900
So I've taken in this lecture
and covered a lot of material.

709
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,670
Uh, but, uh,

710
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,390
the important things I hope are too,

711
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,540
which I've emphasized I hope are
to think about ordinary forms,

712
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:17,250
are common forms of drug administration
like pills and injections.

713
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:22,640
And understand a little bit about how
those forms of administration lead two

714
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:28,190
concentration changes within the body as
a function of time and how those forms

715
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:32,760
are limited in some ways.
Now, even with those,

716
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,290
with those limitations,

717
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,680
obviously medical therapy has advanced
tremendously because of the availability

718
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,330
of drugs,
right?

719
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,120
Antibiotics have changed our lifespan,
right?

720
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,710
People don't die of infectious diseases
because of vaccines and because there

721
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:56,970
are antibiotics that you can
take sometimes orally. We
all have taken them, right?

722
00:46:56,971 --> 00:46:59,980
You've taken antibiotics
and you got better. Uh,

723
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,570
so drug therapy has been
an incredible advance.

724
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,080
The second part I want you to think
about is how sort of engineering of

725
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:12,390
materials in the case I've described here,
uh,

726
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,800
could allow you to think about making
systems for drug delivery that are even

727
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:17,634
better,

728
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:23,180
that can take existing drugs and expose
them to the body in different ways such

729
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:27,780
that they're safer. And more effective
at treating certain kinds of diseases.

730
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,640
Okay. So we'll, we'll meet at a
section this afternoon, right?

731
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,630
Any questions?

732
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,280
Great.
See you this afternoon.
