Speaker 1:          00:13          This week we're going to talk about about DNA technology and genetic engineering. And so this is chapter three of the book. And uh, some of this will be familiar to some of you who've had biology in high school or other places, you know, something about Dna. In fact, if you haven't had a biology class, um, it's hard to be, you know, alive in 2008 to not know something about DNA. It's become such an important, uh, important part of our, uh, of our lives. So I'm going to ask you to, um, to um, indulge me while I go back to the beginning and talk about some things that you know, but I'm going to go through this pretty rapidly. Uh, and I think the book has a fairly good description of it. So if you don't pick up everything in the lecture, hopefully you've read that beforehand, you can go back to it afterwards and read about things that didn't make sense. So we'll talk about some chemistry today, what DNA molecules are like, why they have the behavior that they do. And you need to understand this in order to understand how you manipulate DNA. And so my goal today is to talk about sort of the basics of the molecules. They're chemistry, the function of DNA in cells, sort of the basic, the basic side of that. And then on Thursday we're going to start talking about how to manipulate DNA and get closer to using it in biomedical engineering.

Speaker 1:          01:35          So DNA is a double helix. You A, you know this, the double helix was the structure of DNA was discovered about the time that I was born. And so it's been known throughout your lifetimes. You've always lived with it. But it's really remarkable how fast, how far, how fast we have come from just knowing the structure of this molecule to being able to manipulate it and study it in great detail. So I want to start by showing you this cartoon that you already know about what the structure of a double helix. So it's a twisted ladder and there's a couple of things to notice about this familiar structure. One is that there are two backbones right here in the, in the light blue. So this would be the, the upright parts of the ladder that are twisted. And those, those are two continuous strands that wind around each other to form the double helix.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Right? So one thing to notice is this is this part of the double helix that we'll call the backbone. The backbone is on the outside of the molecule, like the up right struts of a ladder on the outside of a ladder. Right on the inside are the, are the rungs or the struts that hold the ladder together. And there are several things that you'll notice about the struts in this particular cartoon. Uh, one is that there's four different colors and so you can see red, blue, yellow, green here, four different colors. And that's all there are. There aren't more than for that. There are two colors per strut. So what's linking the two backbones together? Our two colored segments that come from the outside towards the middle and um, that the color's occur only in certain combinations. Red and green, yellow and blue, that's all you see.

Speaker 1:          03:10          You don't see a red and yellow, you don't see green and blue. Right. And this is a feature of, of, of DNA shown in this cartoon a form. So if you can keep that, that sort of schematic in mind, it makes it a lot easier to understand the detailed structure. And that's what I want to do for the first few minutes of the lecture here is tell you a little bit about the details of the structure and how molecules fit into this. This image of DNA that's already very familiar to you. But the things that you need to know are the things that are really listed on this slide, right? You're going to know more details about it. They're not really colors right there, chemicals but specific chemicals. Um, and um, but the pattern is the same. So the molecules that really make up DNA are nucleotides and DNA is a polymer of nucleotides.

Speaker 1:          04:02          And a polymer is just a large molecule that's made up of repeated units. Right? And so we're familiar with polymers, plastics in our daily life. You know the chairs that you're sitting on are made of a, of a kind of a plastic polymer that is basically an organic chemical that is cross linked together. Cross is not the right word, that is chemically a bonded with repeat units to make large molecules that when you have a bunch of large molecules together, they have certain physical properties like the solid property of the plastic that you're sitting on. Well, nucleus nucleic acids of which DNA as an example, our polymers of nucleotides and so the repeating unit in DNA is this structure here. A nucleotide which has three different regions. There's a sugar, a five carbon sugar, which forms the core of the nucleotide and attached to this five carbon sugar at specific positions on the sugar relative to this oxygen, which is part of the sugar ring is a phosphate group, phosphate and an organic base.

Speaker 1:          05:20          And when these nucleotides get polymerize to form a long DNA molecule, they all get polymerized in exactly the same way. The chemistry is the same, is that the phosphate group of one nucleotide gets linked to the sugar group of another nucleotide. And I'm going to show you that in a few minutes. So what's going to form the backbone is this continual link, phosphate, sugar, phosphate, sugar, phosphate to sugar, all linked together to form one long, long molecule. And what's hanging off of the side of this long molecule that's formed by polymerizing nucleotides are, is this base unit.

Speaker 1:          06:02          So it's the phosphate in the end, the pentose that make up the backbone, they'd make up the upright struts of the ladder. And it's the basis that make up the connecting struts, right? So the basis or the colors, there are four different, uh, uh, bases, which I'll talk about in a moment. We're going to talk about two different nucleic acid molecules, two different nucleic acid polymers. One is DNA deoxyribonucleic acid, the other is RNA ribonucleic acid. And one of the differences between the two is that the Pintos or the sugar that makes up DNA is deoxyribose shown here. And the Pintos that makes up RNA is ribos shown here, right? So every pentose in a DNA polymer is deoxyribose. The phosphate is linked to this carbon on the Pantos. And notice it, there's a number on this carbon, it's called the five prime carbon. And this is a convention that organic chemists use when they're describing molecules like this, they'd like to be able to refer to each carbon separately so they can talk about reactions with this molecule.

Speaker 1:          07:16          And so the number of the carbons, and in this case this, these pintos molecules, whether it's ribose or Deoxyribose, the carbons are numbered. The same one prime to prime, three prime for prime, five prime. Those are the five carbons that make up the Pintos. So I could refer to the four prime carbon and you'd know, I mean this one or the two prime carbon, I, you know, I need this one. The ones that are important to us or the three prime carbon and the five prime carbon. And the reason for that is that the five prime carbon is where the phosphate is attached. And Nucleotide, the phosphates always attached to the five prime carbon. All right. And the reason the three prime is important is that when you polymerize two nucleotides together and a third nucleotide and a fourth nucleotide, when you polymerize nucleotides together, they get polymerized. The phosphate of one gets linked to the three prime carbon of another.

Speaker 2:          08:12          Okay?

Speaker 1:          08:13          No. So this is important because this molecule here, deoxyribose is not the same upside down as it is. It's not symmetrical upside down and right side up. It's a different molecule because the five prime carbons either pointed out per pointed down. And so the nucleotide has a directionality. There's an up and a down to it and it's going to turn out that the chain that's formed by polymerizing, these has a directionality as well. And that's important in defining the structure. Okay? So these are the penthouses, this, uh, and remember five prime and three prime because that orients you with respect to what direction

Speaker 1:          08:53          the molecules facing. Now the base is, uh, you and, and we, you don't need to memorize the structures of these. I'm going to, I'm describing the whole molecule to you in its sort of molecular detail and then we're going to simplify it down to a version that we can talk about more easily, but to give you all the detail, there's two sort of classes of bases that appear here. Uh, one class is called the Purina and they have to ring like structures and there are two of them that are going to be important to us. One is Adenine and the other is Guanine shown here. And because saying adenine takes a long time and saying Guanine takes a long time, we're going to simplify it by calling adenine and Guanine G.

Speaker 2:          09:35          All right.

Speaker 1:          09:36          The second class is the perimeter teams and there's three of those that are important. You're a sill, thymine and cytosine, which we're going to simplify it by calling you t. And. C.

Speaker 2:          09:48          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:49          Now remember that there were four only four different colors in the cartoon of the DNA double helix that we talked about. And I told you that those colors are really represent the bases, but there's five of them here.

Speaker 2:          10:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:03          There's five, because there's one of these that's particular to RNA only that appears in only RNA and there's one of them that appears in only DNA. The one that appears only in RNA is you're a sale. The one that appears only in DNA is, is timing. And so in DNA there's only four colors. There's only four bases. CTG A and RNA. There's four bases a g you see. All right, so you and t are interchangeable in the sense that you appears where ti would appear in uh, in a RNA. And t appears where you would appear in DNA.

Speaker 2:          10:42          All right?

Speaker 1:          10:45          If I drew this altogether, and this is one particular nucleic acid again, now shown in more detail, the all of the carbons of the, of the Pintos are shown here. The phosphate is shown and a base is shown in this particular base is Adenine. This is ribos. So this is a monomer or a single unit from an RNA molecule. You know that because it's ribos and it's the particular molecule that has a, as it's organic base,

Speaker 1:          11:18          we don't need to really talk about all the molecular detail in order to completely describe a DNA or an RNA molecule because these structures repeat themselves, right? Every unit in the backbone of this ladder has the same sugar unit, the Saint Pintos. It's either it's either RNA or DNA and has ribose or deoxyribose. So you don't need to describe the whole thing. You can just say it's RNA or DNA and you know everything about the Pintos in every molecule on the chain. You don't need to say anything more about the phosphate because they all have the phosphate, right. And every set of these is hooked together in the same way. So the five prime carbon has a phosphate off of it and that phosphate is linked to the three prime carbon of the next one. Right? And they all have a base hanging off the side. So the only thing I need to say in order to distinguish this particular part of the chemistry of a DNA and RNA molecules is say it's DNA or it's RNA and what the base is, right?

Speaker 1:          12:18          And that tells, and if I told you that, draw me a nucleotide from RNA that has adenine, you could go back to this picture and you could draw the whole thing. So you can just talk about it in a simpler way. You can say a polymer of of DNA for example, is four bases long. That means it has four of these repeat units and they go in the sequence from five prime to three prime of a g t, g. And if I told you that a DNA sequence went five prime to three prime a GTC TG, you could, you could draw the whole thing referring back to these notes, right? In fact, you don't have to draw it this complicated way. You could just draw it as align, right? With a g t and g hanging off of it. And you would know that that's a DNA molecule for bases long that it, uh, right now, what does the line represent here? This represents the upright stretch because on the ladder that I showed you before, it represents this backbone that's shown by, that's, that's formed by polymerizing. The pentose is together through phosphates always going five prime to three prime, five prime to three prime. So I could take and draw a line continually down the molecule where my finger was touching, right? My finger would be touching a phosphate here. The five prime carbon, the four prime carbon, the three prime carbon and the next phosphate.

Speaker 2:          13:42          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          13:42          so the backbone is what? It's phosphate carbon, carbon, carbon phosphate, carbon carbon or carbon phosphate. And it has this structure hanging off the side.

Speaker 1:          13:54          Now DNA is a double helix and I've only shown you one part of the Helix, right? I've shown you one upright strut and a base hanging off of it, but it forms a double helix because complimentary strands of DNA strongly associate with one another and that's a very stable structure. And they do that because the basis can interact with one another. In particular ways, and this you know about this was the famous finding of Watson and Crick and describing the structure of DNA. And this is what this diagram shows you, is the forces that hold these ducts, these, these individual strands of DNA into a double stranded form. And they, the forces are occur because of hydrogen bonding between complimentary pairs of the basis and the coupler mentoree pairs are adenine and thymine a and t and Guanine and cytosine GC. Now, if read in the book you read about where this big year is shown in the book, you can understand more about why these structures line up in the right way so that the right molecular elements are together to form hydrogen bonding pairs between them. Uh, that's really beyond what I'll be asking you to understand for the course. But, but you can, you can understand that if you read it, I'm sure

Speaker 1:          15:14          now it remember that, um, that I mean only appears in a DNA and Duracell appears in RNA. And so you're a cell can also form a hydrogen binding pair with Adenine.

Speaker 2:          15:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:26          So the whole structure of a DNA molecule looks like this. Going back to a more cartoon version like I showed you before, but adding some detail onto it. Now there are two uprights struts of the latter one shown in blue here. The other show in black, they are linked together by four different colored segments indicated here, not by colors now, but by letters. It's DNA. So it's [inaudible] and they always occur in pairs. Where before it was two colored pairs. Now as two letter pairs, g c t a.

Speaker 2:          16:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:00          The chains are different now. They weren't, they were colored the same. The backbones were colored. The same in the diagram there. Color different here to indicate one new difference that you know about now. And that's that there's an orientation, there's an up and down on the chain and that's due to the asymmetry of the nucleotides, that there's a five prime to three prime end and the way that they're linked together. So this blue chain here goes from five prime carbon all along the chain. And there's a three prime carbon left open at the bottom,

Speaker 2:          16:34          right.

Speaker 1:          16:35          So if I wanted it to link another nucleotide to this DNA chain, what would I attach here on the bottom, I would have chat attached the phosphate that's connected to the five prime carbon of another nucleotide, right? I would link this one.

Speaker 2:          16:51          All right.

Speaker 1:          16:53          Facing in this direction, I would add onto this, right? The other chain is facing in the other direction. The three prime carbon is up to five prime carbon is down,

Speaker 2:          17:04          right?

Speaker 1:          17:05          And remember that this molecule, let's look at the, at the, at the blue one wouldn't be the same if I turned it upside down, right? It wouldn't be the same if I turned it upside down because the carbons, the, the, the rings here, the pentose is, would all be turned over. The chemistry would look different, right? And the sequence of basis would look different.

Speaker 2:          17:31          The

Speaker 1:          17:33          corresponding half of the ladder that corresponds to any given ladder, let's say the black DNA molecule that corresponds to the blue one is not just a mirror image, we call it the compliment. We call it the compliment and each strand of DNA, each polymer of DNA that you could make or you could draw has only one compliment. And that compliment has the following features. One, it's chain is oriented in the opposite direction,

Speaker 2:          18:07          okay?

Speaker 1:          18:08          Where this one goes, five prime to three prime. This one goes three prime to five prime. It's oriented in the opposite direction and it has the complimentary base pairs at each position where there's an a here, there's gotta be a t here where there's a t here that's got to be an a here where there's, let's see here at g, g a c and that's because you have to satisfy this base pair matching in order to have hydrogen bonding in each of the struts of the ladder in order to form a stable structure,

Speaker 2:          18:39          right?

Speaker 1:          18:41          If I'm talking about two DNA strands and they differ only in one or two base pairs, they won't be exact complements and they won't form this double helix.

Speaker 2:          18:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:54          This, um, this notion of complimentary strands is very important. It's the way the DNA exists inside the cells of your body. It exists as in a double stranded form where every strand is matched by its compliment. And these, these, uh, molecules of DNA, very long molecules of DNA are, uh, are condensed and packaged within the nucleus of every cell in your body. Every cell in your body has exactly the same DNA. That is, if I could stretch out all the DNA and look at the base pair sequence, the sequence of basis along all the DNA and your chromosomes, they'd be identical in all the cells may be different in each of us. And that leads to the difference in the diversity between people. All right, and so you, you've heard about the human genome project, we'll talk about that a little bit later, but the, the goal of that was to take for a typical human or for a typical, in the case, the human genome project.

Speaker 1:          19:57          Maybe you're looking at fruit flies. He went to look at all the DNA in a fruit fly, but to look at the sequence of base pairs that makes up human DNA and write them all out. Right. We'll talk about that later. This slide shows one important sort of feature of the physical chemistry of DNA that turns out to be very important for all of the technology that is built on DNA. And it has to do with the nature of this complimentary binding between double stranded DNA and the fidelity of this, of this base pair matching, informing, informing stable DNA molecules. And I told you that the fidelity is very high. What does that mean? That only strands that have the exact compliment can form double stranded DNA. Because of that, you can do the experiment and it's a simple experiment is simple to understand but, but the concept is very important.

Speaker 1:          20:54          So I encourage you to think about it and make sure you understand it, is that if I took two double stranded DNA molecules and I expose them to certain conditions that caused them to denature, that means it's native structure falls apart, nature native structure falls apart. The native structure is this double stranded structure here. And if I heat it up slightly and I add some bass, so under slightly basic conditions, these molecules will fall apart because you've created conditions where the hydrogen bonding is no longer favorable. So they, they, they peel apart. And so if I had a beaker sitting on the table here and it contained a million blue double stranded DNA molecules and a million red double stranded DNA molecules and I heated it up and add a little base, I'd soon have 4 million individual strands just floating around in the solution because I've broken up this hydrogen bonding and the DNA molecules fall apart and that's called denaturing DNA.

Speaker 1:          21:53          So that tells you something about the physical chemistry of the molecule, that it's these hydrogen bonds that hold the double strands together and I can break those down under certain conditions. If I then if I then put it back into its original condition, lower the heat, say temperature back to body temperature and reduce the Ph down to seven. Again, the molecules will re nature, they will reform their natural structure. And for DNA that means forming double helixes. But they will do that in a, in a very particular way. And that only strands that exactly match, we'll be able to reform their native structure. Right? So a blue strand here, we'll never re nature with the red strand because their sequences don't match exactly.

Speaker 2:          22:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:48          But a complimentary blue strand will always rematch with its with its partner. Right now this is the basis of a, of a uh, physical chemistry process called hybridization. And it turns out that this is how we can identify specific DNA sequences and how we can do things like DNA fingerprinting, how we can clone molecules, DNA molecules from one organism to another. Rely very heavily on this principle of rename duration and hybridization. And hybridization simply means that DNA will rename chair and form a stable double helix only with its particular match.

Speaker 2:          23:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:34          Only with the hybrid that it is perfectly complimentary too.

Speaker 1:          23:42          That's something about physical chemistry of Dna, what it looks like and how it behaves in a simple sense. What I want to spend the rest of the time, uh, doing is talking about some of the biological properties of DNA. And again, I know this is something that's familiar to most of you and so I uh, indulge me just for the rest of this lecture, I'll go through it. I want to try to hit the points that I think are important to remember because they're going to be concepts that come up again and again throughout the course. And I want to make sure that we're on the same page. So this diagram at the top here is a very familiar one to most of you. It's sometimes called the central dogma of molecular biology and it indicates how information flows in cells and indicates a lot about the work that is cell does in a maintaining and recreating itself and maintaining its environment.

Speaker 1:          24:35          And that is that the information needed to operate. A cell is stored in its DNA and that information gets put into action through a process of biological process called transcription, where particular regions of DNA are transcribed into RNA and that RNA is made into proteins and proteins are the working molecules of the cell are enzymes. They're structural molecules, they're proteins that exist in the membrane that allow things to go in and out of a sale. So really the working molecules of the cell in every sense and RNA is converted into protein by a process called translation.

Speaker 1:          25:14          And here's another picture of it here showing it a little bit more detail that you have lots of DNA in each of the cells in your body, but you're not using all that DNA at any one time. Every cell in your body is only using a fraction of the DNA that's available to it. Cells in your pancreas for example, or making the protein insulin and they're making that because you need this protein. Insulin is a hormone and it's important for sugar metabolism in your body. And so those cells in your pancreas are making insulin. That means the gene that encodes insulin, the sequence of base pairs that encode insulin. And I'll talk about what that means and coding insulin means in a minute, but there's a gene that tells your body what insulin looks like and that gets trans greived.

Speaker 2:          26:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:05          But only in those cells that make insulin and it gets converted into a protein insulin only in those cells that are able to make the RNA that are able to express the protein. Right?

Speaker 2:          26:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:18          Well, it turns out that proteins are essential in driving this process too. And in order to have DNA, you have to make DNA. And yourselves are continually making DNA inside your body through a process of DNA synthesis. And that sin, that synthesis is occurring because of the presence of an enzyme, a protein called DNA polymerase. And the same way this process of transcription, which is occurring in cells throughout your body all the time is made possible by a protein called RNA polymerase that allows a RNA, uh, to be made from a DNA template. All right? So it's not as simple as DNA going to RNA going to protein because protein's need to be present in order to make these things happen as well,

Speaker 2:          27:03          right?

Speaker 1:          27:05          Let's talk about DNA synthesis for a minute. So when a cell divides in your body, when cells of your intestine divide, when cells of your skin divide, and they're doing this all the time in order for a cell to divide and form two daughter cells, we'll talk about that process next week. But in order for that to happen, the parents cell has to copy all of its DNA in order to have enough DNA to pass on to two daughter cells, right? And it does that through a process of DNA synthesis. And what happens is the machinery of the cell, largely this protein DNA polymerase is able to open up the double stranded DNA to denature it locally, exposing two strands, which it then makes, allows to make copies of. And what's shown here is what's called a replication fork. It's in DNA that's undergoing synthesis. The DNA molecule here has been spread apart, opening up to single stranded Dnas, which have complimentary base sequences because they were double stranded DNA. And then a new single stranded DNA is formed on each one of these open single strands. And so DNA is replicated using one strand of the DNA as a template,

Speaker 2:          28:28          right?

Speaker 1:          28:30          The result of this process, if it's replication went down, the whole length of the DNA would be to form two identical double stranded DNA molecules. All right, now the book talks about more detail about this and you can read about it. Polymerase needs a primer and that turns out to be important. Um, and a primer is a short RNA sequence or, or a DNA sequence that, uh, gets sort of the, the, um, the process of replication jumpstarted. And that's just because of the biological properties of DNA polymerase at that primers needed synthesis. A Co always occurs in one direction and that makes sense to you now because you know there's a directionality and the chemistry is different going one way and the other and this DNA polymerase only works on the chemistry going in one direction and that that and that the correct a compliment is made because of these principles of what Sin Crick base pairing that we talked about before. It's easy to know what nucleotide to put in each position as you're going along and pull it memorizing a new molecule because of this process occurs this way. If a parent's cell replicates its DNA and then passes them along to two daughter cells, one of the daughter has one strand from the parent, the dark blue strand here. For example, the other daughter cell has the light Blue Strand, the complimentary strand, and each of the daughter cells has a newly synthesized piece of DNA,

Speaker 2:          29:56          right?

Speaker 1:          30:00          So that's synthesis and that has to happen in order for cells to replicate and cell replication is happening in your body all the time. Transcription is also happening. Certain segments of DNA are being converted into RNA and whereas in replication you have to copy the whole genome, the whole, all of the chromosomes, all of the DNA contained in the chromosomes of the cell in order to completely replicate it. Transcription only works on particular sequences of DNA. The w the DNA that encodes the proteins that are important to the life of that cell. A pancreas cell in the pancreas for example, needs to make insulin and so the gene for insulin is transcribed and transcription just means making a single stranded RNA copy of a sequence of base pairs in a DNA. I told you that that's driven by a protein called RNA polymerase. RNA polymerase is smart. It knows where it needs to go in order to make the copy of RNA that's required. It operates in a similar fashion to DNA polymerase and that it denatures locally or opens up the double stranded DNA, but it's different in that it creates a new polymer from the DNA template in the language of RNA using RNA, nucleotides and not DNA nucleotides. And the end result of transcription is not double stranded DNA. It's single stranded RNA where the RNA that's produced is called Messenger Rna.

Speaker 2:          31:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:37          It's the transcribed

Speaker 1:          31:41          version of DNA. Um, and it's the exact complement of a particular region of DNA. Again, more details in your book if you want to read that. Well, what I said is not entirely true. Um, that used to be the way that we thought about it, right? DNA goes to RNA, goes to protein. That's it. And that is the way it happens in simple organisms like bacteria and complex organisms like humans. There's another step that we're still only learning about. Now. We know some parts of it, we don't know all of it, but it's very important in, um, in the biological operation of human cells. And that step is RNA splicing or processing of this RNA, single stranded RNA that's produced by transcription. And we're going to talk more about this as we go through some specific examples of where RNA processing is important. Um, for now, just think modifying your picture of this sort of information flow through a CELDT include another step that RNA is produced by transcription from DNA double stranded DNA goes to a single stranded RNA molecule and that RNA is processed in the cell in some way in order to form message your RNA.

Speaker 1:          32:58          And one of the forms of processing that happens, uh, that's very important in human, uh, in, in human, uh, gene, uh, uh, expression is that some of the sections of the DNA molecule are not really necessary for describing the protein, the regions that are necessary for describing what the protein is like are called Exxon's. The regions that are not are called introns, a section of DNA that is responsible for encoding a gene. Let's say it's the insulin gene for example, might be some stretch of DNA on a certain chromosome inside yourselves, inside the cells of the pancreas. And if it was directly transcribed, there'd be regions that are important for making insulin and regions that are not. And those regions that are not are spliced out during RNA processing to form the Mrf a transcript that's used to make the protein. Now there are other kinds of processing that can happen to RNA as well.

Speaker 1:          33:58          And again, I said this is, this is really still an emerging science. Uh, but this is one that's well known and you could imagine that it's important if I want to clone a gene from a human right, if I want to clone the gene for human insulin, mean make many copies of the gene that's responsible for making insulin. I sh I need to know whether they're introns, they are not right. And if I'm going to make insulin from this, I have to know that I've got the entrance spliced out correctly so that that's something that will come up in the lecture tomorrow. So remember that concept and that revision of this sort of classical picture. Um, I don't want to go through this in detail because I assumed that you, you know, it. Plus, I think it's a little bit easier to read and have some time to digest.

Speaker 1:          34:45          But this process of translation or conversion of messenger RNA into protein is a complicated biological process that's occurring all the time. Before we talked about how do you know what messenger RNA to make, how do you know what, what, what RNA to copy from a DNA template. Will you do that by this Watson Crick base pairing? So I know if I have a g c g a, I know what messenger RNA to make from that because I have to satisfy these base pairing rules. It's more complicated in making protein from an RNA strand. And that complication is called the genetic code. And you know that you probably know that a messenger RNA is read in three base units called Code Ons. And so this particular piece of Messenger Rna is, uh, is drawn in this cartoon in three base pair units. And that's because every three base pairs describes an amino acid in a protein.

Speaker 2:          35:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:48          While there are only four different bases that make up either RNA or DNA, and so the complexity of an RNA polymer is limited, right? It's only got one of four possible choices at each position. There are more than 20 amino acids that make up the biological polymers called proteins, so there are 20 choices of each amino acid at a position on a protein. Why are there three bases in a coat on? Because it takes three units where there's only four choices at each position to have at least 20 unique combinations, right? How many combinations of Code Ons are there? If there's three basis and four possibilities at each base, four times four times four,

Speaker 2:          36:44          right?

Speaker 1:          36:47          Four Times, four times four possibilities. Because I could have a g c you hear a Gcu here Ajcu here. Four Times four is 16 if I only had two per code on, I wouldn't have enough. Right? I'd only have 16 possible to based sequences. That's not enough to specify over 20 amino acids. If I have three, I have 16 times four or 64 possible choices way more than enough.

Speaker 2:          37:16          Right.

Speaker 1:          37:17          That creates a problem in the genetic code and that there's 64 possible sequences, but there's only 20 some amino acids. So each amino acid can be specified by more than one code on,

Speaker 2:          37:31          okay.

Speaker 1:          37:31          Right? There's, there's combinations to spare. There's 64 combinations of three of three, uh, basis. Right? And I only needed to describe 20. So there's combinations, despair. So if I look, this table here shows you how, uh, how biological translation takes place. Whenever a three bay sequence is identified, say it's Gcu that specifies and amino acid, how would I, how would I know what amino acid that is? Well, I could look up this table because somebody has figured it out for you. Um, gee, in the first position, see in the second position, you in the GC, you g see you right here is alanine. And that's the protein, the amino acid that's in that position in the, um, in the protein.

Speaker 2:          38:29          Okay?

Speaker 1:          38:30          So you could read through this sequence and you could figure out what the sequence of amino acids would be. The genetic code is set to BG degenerate because I can read in one direction. I can read Gcu is Alanine, for example, from this table and if I see a Gcu, I know it has to be Alanine. If I have the protein and I want to say what does the messenger RNA that produce that protein looked like? I can't go backwards because there's more than one.

Speaker 2:          38:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:59          Possibility

Speaker 1:          39:02          for Alanine, right? There's four of them right here, Gcu, GCC GCA GCG so I don't know exactly what gene that came from. I can't read backwards. And that has to do with the statistics of this, right? There's just more sequences in a three unit code on then I need for the amino acids. How does translation occur? A biologically is shown in this cartoon here and again, you don't need to know the details of this, but if you're interested in knowing what's the biological basis of the genetic code, this is it that inside cells in your body there are, there are special RNA molecules called transfer RNA and they are RNA molecules, but they have at some point in their lifespan, they have amino acids attached to them. Uh, for example, this transfer RNA has a unit here, g a g at one end of the transfer RNA molecule at the other end is attached to the amino acid leucine and your cells making transfer RNA. If they make a transfer RNA molecule that has g a g here, they only put leucine at the other end and that's the physical basis of the genetic code because when a messenger RNA sequence is being transcribed,

Speaker 2:          40:27          yeah,

Speaker 1:          40:28          one base pair, one coat on at a time when the sequence see you see appears in the Messenger Rna. That sequence see you see can only bind with one particular three base compliment, right? It has to be the complement. G A G, this is the [inaudible]. This is the anti code on, there's only one anti code on that matches this one and that anti code on it's always occurs in a molecule that has losing attached to the other side. It's a translation occurs by a special kind of polymerization where these transfer RNA A's operate by Watson Crick base pairing.

Speaker 2:          41:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:17          But they bring into proximity and amino acid.

Speaker 2:          41:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:22          So that instead of forming a new polymer of a nucleic acid, a polymer, a polymer of amino acids, is form a pilar of amino acids is a protein. Again, I'm just trying to highlight things you already know a little bit about the book describes the details. Uh, this isn't particularly important for us to know, uh, here, but that messenger RNA gets converted into a protein of a specific composition through a biological process called translation is important.

Speaker 2:          41:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:55          The last thing I want to talk about today is control of gene expression and control of gene expression is a very big topic. And so I'm going to show you one cartoon to sort of tell you that it is a big topic that's really important. And why is control of gene expression important? Well, I talked about earlier, I've mentioned several times. All the cells in my body, all the cells in your body has essentially the same genomic chromosomal DNA in their nucleus. If you looked at cells in my pancreas and sales in my brain has cells in my skin. They all have the same DNA, but skin cells and brain cells and pancreas cells aren't doing the same things. They don't look the same. They don't behave the same. They don't perform the same biological functions. Why? Because brain cells and pancreas cells are expressing different proteins,

Speaker 2:          42:47          okay?

Speaker 1:          42:47          All the cells in your body have the capability of making all the proteins that you make, but they're not all made in every cell. Only cells of your pancreas make insulin. For example, only cells in your brain make the enzymes that produce certain neurotransmitters that are responsible for brain function. How do cells in your brain know which proteins they ought to be making and how to cells in the pancreas know which proteins they ought to be making? They do that because they can control the expression of genes,

Speaker 2:          43:19          okay?

Speaker 1:          43:20          Gene expression for us will mean the same thing as production of a particular protein. When a gene gets expressed that means it's protein is produced and when we talk about gene expression, then we're talking about this whole sequence of events I just described, transcription, RNA processing, translation to make the protein and so all those things have to happen right in an orderly fashion, in enough quantity, in order for a particular cell to make a protein to make insulin, for example, your cells of your pancreas have to be, uh, transcribing that gene has to be processed, has to be translated into the protein insulin, but that's not all right that that protein, insolent, that protein insulin is made in the form of a long polypeptide that not, that's not always the final version of the protein. In fact, for insulin, it's not the final version of the protein that comes out of translation.

Speaker 1:          44:21          There are more steps that have to happen correctly in order for that insulin to become active. Those steps are called post translational modifications. It's a long word that just means other chemistry that happens on the molecule after translation. It turns out that the kinds of post translational modifications that human cells are able to do are very complicated. You can do many post-translational modify. Your cells are capable of doing many post translational modifications. Bacteria or simple organisms are not always capable of that. Now that's going to be important when we talk about making human gene, making human proteins inside alternate hosts like bacteria that they can't do all the things that your cells can do. So how is gene expression controlled? It can be controlled in a variety of ways. The most basic control is by controlling wind. Transcription happens when transcription happens and it turns out that there's a whole biology associated with this, including molecules that are floating around inside your cells called transcription factors and their job.

Speaker 1:          45:28          There are other molecules that are, that know about particular genes and what some of the sequences and are able to turn on those genes inside cells to make them transcribed. It requires RNA processing to happen smoothly. So if you can interfere with RNA processing, you can stop a gene from being expressed. If you can interfere with this any stage and RNA processing, you can stop a gene from being expressed. And this is a very hot topic in molecular biology now and human therapeutics. You've heard about RNA interference, for example. And that is the process of stopping this to stop a gene from being expressed. For example, a gene that makes us cell cancerous. I'd like to stop it from being expressed. And you could interfere with a translation by degrading messenger RNA. For example, if you had a way to specifically chew up all the RNA molecules that are responsible for making a particular protein, you could stop it from being expressed even though your cell is trying to make it. So I want you to look at this picture, read the little bit about gene expressed control of gene expression that's in the book. No, that it's a big topic that we're not going to talk about it, except we're going to talk about some examples where GE birth control of gene expression can be exploited in order to, uh, in order to treat a diseases, for example. So I'll see you on Thursday.
