Speaker 1:          00:13          So this week we're gonna be talking about the subject of tissue engineering and it's covered directly in chapter 14, but not in a lot of detail. And so I provided a couple of other readings which um, um, are listed here on this slide. And these are in the, in the, uh, in the lecture notes. If you go to that folder, there's two papers, one from 1993 and one from 2002. And so I would read them in that order, read the one from 1993 and then the one from 2002 and you'll see sort of how this field, which I'm going to describe today has evolved over the last 15 years or so. And, uh, some of the challenges that were talked about in this article from 1993 you'll see are still present today is turned out to be more difficult than, uh, than biomedical engineers thought to accomplish some of these things. And some of the things have gone faster. We've made more progress than we thought we would in 1993. So if you read those two papers, read the the bit from chapter 14 about, um, about tissue engineering. And then chapter 16. I've also given you chapter 16 is about bio materials and artificial organs, but there might be some things in there which are useful to you in, um, in uh, understanding, uh, this subject as well. And a section we'll meet this Thursday in the regular time and place.

Speaker 1:          01:45          So, um, so what's the motivation for, uh, for tissue engineering and, um, this, uh, slide has a lot of numbers on it and the particular numbers are not important. I've posted it in the notes for the course so you can look at it, uh, at your, at your leisure. But the, uh, the main point here is that there are many diseases that drugs cannot treat effectively and their diseases that are prevalent, they don't occur in small numbers. And that's why all the numbers are here. So you can see how many incidences there are of these different, uh, of these different, uh, what is labeled on this slide, organ and tissue deficiencies. For example, you know, that a burns of the skin are quite common and some burns are not severe enough that they need any other treatment other than maybe some antibiotic Lotion and addressing while it heals.

Speaker 1:          02:41          And some burns are so, uh, so, uh, severe or so extensive that they, uh, that they threaten the life of the patient who has them. Uh, if you lose, if you lose a nef of your skin, uh, you lose a lot of water through that open area of skin, you can become dehydrated, uh, to the point where you can die of dehydration. And so your skin is an important barrier for keeping water inside your body. And of course, your skin is a barrier for keeping other things outside the body. Toxins and in particular microorganisms, viruses and bacteria. And so your risk of infection is tremendous if you have large burns over a significant part of your body. And there's no way to, uh, that we currently know to speed up the healing of skin fast enough that patients that have severe skin skin burns can survive that injury.

Speaker 1:          03:37          So what's done is that you need a skin transplants, right? You need an preferably an autograft of skin taking skin from one place in your body and putting it into another, right? But if you have severe burns over much of your body, then there's no skin to graft, right? So you might take an aloe graft, autograft is a graft from you, from the individual to the individual taking some of your tissue and moving them to another location. That's auto self graft. Aloe graft is from a similar individual, but not you. Somebody who might be matched but not perfectly matched immunologically to you. And you get a graft from them. So when you get a blood transfusion from somebody that's not you, but there's some matching that's gone on to make sure that you're not going to be incompatible with the blood. That's an aloe graft.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Xeno graft. Zino x e n o is a graft between species. So that would be a graph from another species to too human, for example, or between species. So autograft, allograft, xenograft, good words to know for our discussion on tissue engineering. Um, but you can imagine there's a limited number of aloe grafts that his skin transplants that are available to treat a burns. And so, and so not all the patients that need them are able to get these kinds of graphs. And so, uh, so life is threatened in that situation. Not only burns, but there are pressure sores. What are commonly known as bed sores for patients that have to spend significant time in, uh, in a bed because of, because of an accident. Let's say they've had a spinal cord injury and they have to spend a lot of time, uh, recovering, uh, from that or they can't move anymore on their own.

Speaker 1:          05:26          And they'll develop sores, which are very difficult to heal. Um, and diabetics, uh, because they, um, because diabetes can affect, uh, the sensory nerves in your extremities, uh, often get, uh, sores in their extremities, particularly in their feet or lower leg, which don't heal very well, partly because they can't feel them as well anymore. And so they become injured and continue to get injured. And partly because the process of diabetes slows down healing in general. These, they get ulcers or lesions on their skin that don't heal. And um, so just this top category alone, lots of patients, different indications, not enough tissue to treat these tissue deficiencies of the skin. If you went down this list, you would find, uh, many others as well. So let me go down here. We're going to talk about in some detail the liver and when you get liver disease, that's severe enough.

Speaker 1:          06:30          The only medical option right now is a liver transplant. And we'll talk about why that's the only option available for, uh, for liver disease that becomes very severe, that could result from some metabolic disorder, from cirrhosis or from liver cancer. Uh, but in that case, uh, transplant is the only, it's the only option. And, uh, I'm sure you've all heard in the news about cases where there is a patient, often a child who has some, a disease waiting for a transplant and calls, we'll go out to the community. Um, and uh, um, and uh, this is a familiar, a story in our society. And the reason for that is because there are a significant number of patients that are in this category. Not as many as in the case of skin, but a significant number. And there is something like tens of thousands of patients that are eligible for liver transplants and waiting for them.

Speaker 1:          07:33          And why are they waiting? Because there's not enough donor organs to satisfy the need of people that have transplants. And um, and that's unlikely to change, right? For a, uh, for a liver transplant donor to become available. Somebody has to die with a healthy liver. They have to have consented to have their organs used for another person, and they have to be match immunologically with a patient who's going to receive the donor. And somehow those two things have to come together, right? And so all these things have to work right? In order for a liver donor and a recipient to match, they have to match not only biologically, but it all has to match in terms of timing as well. And that's a complicated process. So today if you go and look on this, uh, on this website we've set, we meaning we as a society have set up organizations and procedures to try to help with this matching process.

Speaker 1:          08:45          And so one of those is called the organ procurement and transplantation network. They keep track of all the patients that are on lists waiting for organ organ. They keep track of all the organs that are going to come available and a matching process occurs and you know, and, and computers are involved in all kinds of the resources you would expect to be involved in this thing. But if you look for any particular kidney transplants, there are currently, as of yesterday, 75,000, uh, individuals in the u us waiting for, uh, waiting for a donor. Kidneys in the liver there are 16,000. So these are patients that today need a, uh, uh, an organ donation there. Physicians have decided that they're too sick to respond to any other, uh, treatment and they're just waiting for an organ to appear. We, I talked at the, in the very first lecture you might remember, I showed you this picture to talk about.

Speaker 1:          09:44          There's already very high technology involved with this, uh, with this medical effort. And part of the technology are things like this organ procurement network. So this is, you know, run electronically on the Internet using all of the high tech tools of communication that we have in order to connect physicians who are trying to treat patients with physicians who find that there's a donor available and by, uh, by other high tech industries like the airlines who can quickly move Oregon's from one place to another. So if the donor of the Oregon died in California and the recipient is here in new haven, then you've got to get the Oregon as quickly as possible from, uh, from California to Connecticut and um, and that that can be done. Now sometimes. Um, another technology which is embedded in this is that some hours have to pass right between when the organ is harvested and the organ can be transplanted.

Speaker 1:          10:50          And so you need to be able to preserve organs for that period however long that period is and you'd like to be able to preserve them for a long period of time. What if we could preserve donor kidneys in the same way that we preserve blood? So blood you, many of you have gone when the, when the Red Cross has has come here looking for blood donations, they take your blood, they store it in a special way such that it can be used up to three weeks past the point when you donate it and that creates many opportunities for your blood to be useful in the same way if you donated organs and there were ways to preserve the organs, that would be make them more useful as well. And so there's that whole technology behind this that I wanted to at least describe to you in words.

Speaker 1:          11:40          And you could think about biomedical engineers are currently working around the world on better ways to preserve organs, but it's a difficult problem, can be accomplished in blood and certain kinds of blood cells can be partially accomplished with some tissues like skin cannot really be done with livers or kidneys at yet. But there's a great need for that. Um, why I wanted to say a little bit more about why you have to take this extraordinary measure of transplant, uh, to treat diseases like liver failure. Uh, when a liver becomes so diseased that it cannot, um, than it cannot recover its function on its own. Uh, lots of things go wrong. And this chart is a table of some of the functions which are happening every day in your liver. And the liver is an important endocrine organ. We talked about the endocrine system. It makes hormones like IGF one, it activates a vitamin D, which functions as a hormone is an important for structure of your bones.

Speaker 1:          12:49          It produces the hormones that are used in your thyroid gland and many other hormones. And so if your liver starts to die, you start to lose. The ability to produce those hormones. And you can imagine then that lots of things in your endocrine system start to go wrong. The liver also produces many of the clotting factors. These are proteins that are needed for clotting blood. If you have an injury and if the liver starts to die, you're not making as many of these. You can have a bleeding disorder. It makes plasma proteins like albumin, which have many functions in the body. It makes bile acids and bile acids are very important as an excretory organ for getting rid of molecules that the kidney is not able to eliminate into urine. And I could go on down the list. I put it here just to say that when your kidneys, when your liver fails, uh, thousands of things start to go wrong.

Speaker 1:          13:45          And you could imagine treating any one of these with drugs, right? If, uh, if you know the problem is, uh, is activation of vitamin D, You could take vitamin D, You could take pre activated vitamin D. If it was a thyroid hormone, you could take a thyroid hormone, right? If it was any one of these things, there might be a medical solution for it, but when it's this whole list of things because your whole Oregon is failing, you can't support that function with drugs alone. It's just too many things going wrong at once. So drug therapies are usually used for treating something where we understand what the molecule is involved is and where there's only one or two molecules that are involved, you know, so it's some metabolic disorder. You're not making a particular molecule that you need and so you take it in the form of a pill or you have an enzyme that's not working properly and so you take injections of that enzyme.

Speaker 1:          14:49          Or in the case of cancer, there's a single drug which can eliminate the unwanted cells in cancer, right? These are areas where drug therapy works. Gene therapy, which we talked about a little bit, works in other kinds of situations, right? Where you're missing an element of a cellular process like insisting fibrosis, for example, your lungs and other tissues are missing a membrane protein that's important and transport of chloride across your lung epithelium. Now you can't just take that protein because it won't get inserted into the cells in the right way. We talked about membranes and how proteins are inserted in membranes and you can't just give the patient that membrane protein and have it restored to the right location in the cell. But because it's only one thing that's going wrong, you can think about treating this with gene therapy by giving those cells that are missing the protein, a gene that allows them to produce that protein on their own and to correctly inserted into the membrane.

Speaker 1:          15:57          So gene therapy as possible to think about in diseases like cystic fibrosis and some diseases of the liver and other organs as well. But in general, there are diseases that are caused by a single gene defect. When we're thinking about liver failing, lots of things are going wrong. Many genes involved, right? And so gene therapy isn't really thinkable in that situation where the whole Oregon is starting to fail. And so whole organ transplantation is the only, is the only, um, current solution, a surgical solution for, uh, for problems like heart failure, kidney failure, liver failure, where the whole Oregon is starting to fail. The motivation then for tissue engineering is to try to think about another way to treat these diseases where you would somehow manufacture or create a tissue in the laboratory that could substitute for the transplanted tissue from another patient. All right?

Speaker 1:          17:05          So the idea is to try to make synthetic or semisynthetic tissues that could take over the function of a failing liver, a failing kidney failing blood vessel, a failing heart, right? And it is intended to treat these diseases that are too complex to think about, complex in the number of things that are going wrong. Too Complex to treat with any of the other therapies we've talked about over the course of the, uh, of our time here. So this is a field that was really, um, um, has ancient roots and those ancient ruins are discussed in your, in your book. But the idea of engineering tissues was only developed relatively recently and, uh, first defined really in the 1980s. And so that first paper I gave you to read by Langer in Vacanti, um, is a really considered one of the first most influential scientific papers in this, uh, in this growing field.

Speaker 1:          18:09          And here's one definition of what tissue engineering is. I told you what the goals of it are kind of in broad terms, but it's the application of principles and methods of engineering and life sciences toward fundamental understanding of structure, function, relationships in normal and pathologic mammalian tissues. That's not the more interesting part to me. The more interesting part to me is, and the development of biological substitutes to restore main tain or improve tissue function. So why is it only in the 1980s that people started thinking about this? And there's really two reasons and one is an engineering reason abroad reason. And the other is a sort of life science and biology. Reason, uh, that we had come to the point in the 1980s were a lot of the biology that we've talked about now was fairly well known in particular the the biology of cells in culture of taking cells out of organs and tissues, maintaining them in culture, getting them to do the things we wanted to do in culture was fairly well known by the 1980s.

Speaker 1:          19:13          It's a fairly mature technology. And so one could think about using cell culture techniques to produce complicated structures. And the other is an engineering, uh, in engineering, uh, advance. And that is that we had developed by the, uh, by the 1980s enough understanding of artificial bio materials that we could start to create materials that had unique properties, which made them good candidates for use and the kinds of applications I'll talk about. So the innovations or the, or the kind of foundations of tissue engineering, our, our ability to culture cells and to do that reliably reproducibly to understand what cells are going to do when we maintain them outside the body and our ability to build materials that are biocompatible, that can be implanted into people and that can serve as scaffolds for a new tissue. And I'll say more about what that means. So just to try to put this in more concrete terms, here's two examples of how you might artificially engineer a tissue or two kinds of applications that people might think about in a heart that's failing.

Speaker 1:          20:27          And I use this as example because we know a lot about the cardiovascular system now. And so you'll understand both of these examples we talked about. Uh, we talked about the important function of the blood vessels of the heart, the coronary arteries, and we also talked a little bit about how these vessels become, can become diseased in, uh, in life, uh, particularly, uh, for, um, for patients in the sixth or seventh decade of their life. And so th this vessel might become diseased through a process of atherosclerosis. The lumen becomes narrowed such that blood no longer flows, the resistance gets too high for blood to flow well. So you'd like to replace this artery and the only thing that the artery has to do is carry blood from one place to the other. So really all you need is a tube. All right. And so people have tried for years to use different kinds of tubes to replace this section.

Speaker 1:          21:22          The operations called a cardiac bypass, right? And so a surgeon will go in, he will remove this disease section of tissue, or he'll just put a, a bypass around it. That is a tube that goes from this location and connects to this location. So like a bypass on the highway, it's a clear route that allows you to get around a route that's no longer passable. Well, these vessels carry a lot of blood and they have to be very reliable vessels because they need to carry blood all the time because your heart is constantly working. It needs a constant, reliable source of blood. And so the best substitute for this is a natural one. And so one of the most successful operations here is to take a blood vessel from somewhere else in the patient's body and use it to create a bypass, right? And, and you'd like it to be an artery.

Speaker 1:          22:15          And so bypasses can be made. There's another artery that's nearby called the internal mammary artery that that surgeons could take. You can take it from the tissue sort of near the heart. It doesn't really serve as important to function and you can bypass it in here. And now you have a new artery in place to, uh, to continue to flow blood. That works. But what if you have more than one site of blockage? What if you have a blockage here and a blockage here and a blockage over here and a blockage over here. So you need multiple bypasses. You don't have enough arteries in order to do that. So then the surgeon will go and take the saphenous vein from your leg. It's a, it's a large vein in your leg that returns blood that's flowed down to your leg back up to the Vena Cava, and there are enough other veins in your leg that you can lose that vein without any loss of function in your leg.

Speaker 1:          23:05          They can now take the vein and cut it up into segments and use that to bypass all these segments of artery that are clogged. And that works as well. But veins aren't the same as arteries. You remember that? And if you take a vein which has a different anatomical structure and put it in the position of an artery that is exposed to the high pressures that you know already occur there, sometimes that works, sometimes the vessel changes and remodels and adapts so that it functions and sometimes it doesn't. And sometimes those veins also become diseased and they no longer serve as an effective bypass, right? So then what do you do? Right? If both of those options fail, you can try to use synthetic materials and synthetic materials are used to replace blood vessels in in many parts of the body. If you're, if you have an aorta that has an aneurysm, a surgeon can put a synthetic piece of basically dacron a synthetic material and it will serve as a functional aorta and do a very nice job.

Speaker 1:          24:13          But it turns out that we know from experience now that that only works if the vessel is big enough because for big vessels, all of these kinds of synthetic materials that we make, while they might have the right mechanical properties to serve as an aorta, they're not biological. And so blood will clot when it hits that unnatural surface. And it's okay if blood clots on the surface of a big artery because it's big enough that you could have a lining of a clot here along the inside, right. And it would still be enough diameter to flow if it's a small artery and it clots blood doesn't pass through any longer. And we know now that the limit of what one can do with synthetic materials is about half a millimeter to a millimeter. And that's the size of these coronary arteries. So you can't use synthetic materials there. So what we'd like to do is grow and artery outside the body.

Speaker 2:          25:14          Okay?

Speaker 1:          25:14          What if we could do that by taking the synthetic material and growing on it? Aligning of natural cells.

Speaker 2:          25:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:23          The synthetic material would provide the mechanical properties needed, so for it to function as an artery and if we grow natural arterial endothelial cells all over the surface of this, the blood wouldn't know that it's a synthetic material. It would only see the cells which are forming the natural barrier, the natural wall of a blood vessel. So that's tissue engineering and example of tissue engineering to create an artificial artery to use in bypass. And I'm going to talk more about the details of where we are in that process and what the obstacles are. Next, on Thursday, let's say you didn't get there in time in a particular patient, they didn't have a bypass in time. So they have a blockage, they have a myocardial infarction or a heart attack because the blood becomes compromised to some area. This area of the heart doesn't get blood for some period of time.

Speaker 1:          26:20          And so this tissue in the wall of the heart dies. Now in general, uh, if that happens, uh, there's only a limited ability of your heart tissue to heal after you have a heart attack. A scar is formed here and this part of the heart doesn't function in the same way that it did before. Remember how it functions is it has to, it has to transmit electrical signals and it has to contract in response to those electrical signals. And it has to do that with a regular frequency. So it has to both conduct the electrical signal and contract. And this, uh, this, uh, damaged cardiac muscle doesn't do that anymore. Well, sometimes that's okay. You might not need all of your cardiac muscle to be functioning in order to have a reasonably efficient heartbeat. But sometimes the area of this is so large that it compromises the ability of your heart to deliver the cardiac output. You need to stay alive. Right. Uh, so what if you could make an artificial cardiac muscle, right? What if you could take some kind of a material and grow cardiac muscle cells on it and grow them in such a way that they filled up this material and they started to function like heart. That is they, they functioned in the right electrical way and they functioned in the right mechanical way. Then maybe a physician could come in and just so this patch that you've created outside the body into place on the tissue

Speaker 1:          27:54          and maybe that patch would start to function like that part of the heart wall. That didn't function.

Speaker 2:          28:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:03          Okay. Now where would the cells come from that you did that with? We think about this particular application. We're going to create a, we're going to create a patch for repairing a myocardial defects. Right. Where would the cells come from? What would be your first choice?

Speaker 2:          28:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:23          Of cells that you wanted, that you use for this

Speaker 2:          28:29          jasmine

Speaker 1:          28:31          from the heart. From what heart?

Speaker 2:          28:35          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          28:35          from the patient's own heart. What if you could take a small biopsy of tissue from somewhere else in the heart? You could take a small sample of those cells and you could take them outside the and grow them in culture. Well, this is where our ability to culture cells comes in very handy because we can take a small sample, isolate the cells we want, propagate them in culture until we had millions of those cells, put them into the patch, put the patch back into the patient. Now, now the patient has an auto graft of cells but placed in the right configuration so that they function as a tissue. What are the problems with that? What's the problem with that?

Speaker 2:          29:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          29:22          so if the, if the disease was too big, you couldn't do that. Why couldn't you do that? Because you couldn't grow and upsells you think or yeah mate. So you might, there might be some practical limits to it, but you're, you're getting close to what the real problem with that would be.

Speaker 1:          29:44          You're getting close to what the real problem with that would be. Think about the timing of it. How long would it take you to take this biopsy and grow the cells and make a new Ar? Artificial? Probably would take weeks to do. And could the patient survive those weeks while you're making the, uh, the, uh, the, the, the tissue engineered solution? Maybe, maybe not. It would depend on how extensive the, the, the, um, the failure of the heart was as, as, as Justin described. Right? So what would be another solution to that? Well, let's not take cells from the patient, but let's create a bank of heart cells. Right? And that might be possible, but you have to be able to preserve heart cells. You have to have a bank of cells with all the right immunological markers labeled. You have to have them in enough quantity that they'd be available rapidly. And so there's problems with that, right? But maybe you could do it that way. Maybe you could use stem cells

Speaker 1:          30:47          and we talked about stem cells before and some of their capabilities. But one of the real advantages of what people think of as using stem cells to treat diseases in adults is just exactly what we're talking about here. Being able to create an environment or an engineering solution in which stem cells could be used to create functional tissue, right? In this case, you'd want stem cells that could very quickly become cardiac muscle cells that could be differentiated in the cardiac muscle cells, and ideally you'd want stem cells from the same person, right? You'd like to isolate them from the same person somehow.

Speaker 2:          31:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:27          Or from a or from a donor that was matched, but you're starting to see both the opportunity, I hope and the, and the problems that have to be solved and creating these new solutions.

Speaker 1:          31:39          I list on this slide a few of the characteristics of a tissue engineering that we're going to talk about. Uh, not in quite this organized a way, but I hope that by the end of the week, you'll be able to look back at this list and say, Oh, I understand what that characteristic means in terms of what we're trying to accomplish in tissue engineering. The first is what I've been talking up about up to this point, the tissue engineering really represents kind of a modern or contemporary logical extension of conventional medical. And surgical practices, right? If we're going to make an engineered tissue, in many cases, we're going to give them to a surgeon and they're going to do what they know how to do, which is replace an organ or a tissue, right? So you're just giving another resource to surgeons to do what they know how to do already.

Speaker 1:          32:25          And we're using it to extend medical practices to diseases that cannot be treated by drugs or gene therapy or other kinds of medicine. What I want to talk about, uh, for most of the rest of the time today is this second bullet here that tissue engineering and vaults control or regulation of normal healing processes that if we want to understand and use tissue engineering, we need to know something about how the body heals itself and take advantage of those natural mechanisms of tissue regeneration. And we'll talk over the course of the next two lectures about tissue engineering as a, as an attempt to replace the sailor component of disease tissues where it's drug therapy. We're thinking about the molecular component and now we're replacing cells, um, that it uses cellular processes sometimes to control drug delivery. We'll talk about how you could use tissue engineering as a drug delivery system and that a tissue engineering produces new models for the study of human physiology.

Speaker 1:          33:24          I won't say anything more about that this week. So let me just say that now that what if you could produce heart tissue like this for transplantation? Another use for it would be if I can make this tissue outside the body that behaves like the human heart, I can use it to study how the human heart works outside the body in a much more reliable way or a much more sophisticated way than I could with ordinary cell cultures. Because now you not only have the cells of the heart, but you have the cells of the heart arranged in the right kind of configuration. So I could understand, I could use it to understand how the heart develops. I could, I could expose it to different drugs and ask what are the toxicities of these drugs to the normal heart without doing it in patients, without, and with doing it in a system where I have a lot of control and a lot of ability to look inside and see what's happening.

Speaker 1:          34:16          All right. Um, so let me go back to this point. Now. Tissue engineering involves control or regulation of the normal healing process and we're all familiar with at least some aspects of healing because you've all had a cut in the skin, uh, that has maybe caused you some distress in the short term. Maybe it was a, a cut that was deep enough and this shows you the structure of the skin. Here's the outer layer of the skin here that um, that forms this sort of thick barrier layer, the epidermis that things can't penetrate water can't penetrate easily. You put water on top of your skin. It, it beads up there, right? It doesn't get absorbed. Likewise, water inside doesn't come out. That's why you don't get dehydrated and micro organisms can't go through, right? Because of this barrier underneath is a, is a more connective tissue layer called the dermis.

Speaker 1:          35:08          And inside this Dermis, there's cells that are producing an extra cellular matrix of Collagen. Largely. We talked about extracellular matrices several weeks ago. And within that, and within that a collagenous matrix, there are blood vessels, arteries, red here, veins blue, and those blood vessels bring blood to the skin to provide, uh, um, oxygen and to get rid of carbon dioxide in these cells, in your living skin. So you get a cut in this tissue. And what happens if it's a deep enough cut? You Bleed and, uh, you gotta do something to stop the bleeding, right? You've had this and so you, you put some pressure on and you wait for clotting to occur, but you've, but you've disrupted these vessels, right? You'd disrupted these vessels. They have clotted so that the clot is formed inside these vessels so that the bleeding stops and usually a clot forms at the surface.

Speaker 1:          36:07          And if you look at this, after you've got the bleeding to stop, you have a red looking, uh, you have a red looking area, right? It looks different from your skin. That's the beginning of the healing process is that your body has coagulated blood at that site to replace the tissue that's been lost, right? So you'll have a red, uh, you'll have a red spot there that turns into a reddish looking scab, right? That's your body responding to stop the immediate insult, the bleeding and to fill up the space of this tissue that's been damaged. Cuts too big. This can't happen. You can't just put pressure on it and stop it. And so what do you do? You go to the emergency room, you get some stitches, they bring the sides of that wound back together with stitches. They hold it closed and the same thing happens, but in a smaller space now, right?

Speaker 1:          37:00          Cause they've just brought the tissue together so that your body could produce this, uh, this provisional tissue and the provisional tissue at the beginning is just a blood clot. After that point, many things start happening within the skin. Uh, and uh, a complex process of cells sending out signals and cells responding to signals in a coordinated unregulated way occurs. And what this diagram shows is some little fingers of tissue entering into this coagulated provisional matrix that was formed by the blood clot. And these cells are initially cells that are called fibroblasts, which live in the dermis. And normally they're just sitting there, sort of an acquirer, essence state, not reproducing very rapidly making college in providing matrix to keep up sort of the normal structure of your skin. But when there's an injury, they get turned on and they migrate into the wound. They migrate into this provisional matrix and they start changing it.

Speaker 1:          38:05          They start digesting the clot and they start making new, extra cellular matrix of Collagen. And they do that so that there can be a pathway for these blood vessels to regrow the blood vessels need to regrow renourish the skin so that you can start to get the normal composition back, the normal cellular components. And you'll see these blood vessels, uh, starting to form sprouts that enter into this provisional matrix all now you've watched the process of a scar healing on your own, um, body, and you've seen the stages that it goes through. It will, it will, uh, go from the red appearance to a, to a dollar red and eventually become a white, you know, or, uh, it doesn't look red at all. And after some period of time you won't even see where the cut was it all right. The end process of this fiber blasts coming in, replacing remodeling the matrix of blood vessels regrowing back in establishing new cells from the epidermis start to grow in over this matrix in the end first they'll grow over the top.

Speaker 1:          39:12          And so you might see a little bump here and eventually the whole tissue through this elegant self regulated process heals itself. So you can't see where the cut was. We've all had that experience and probably we've also had the experience where we got a worst cut, right? And, and it didn't end up looking right, right. You might still have a scar from some cut that you got on, uh, on your hand or your arm where the, where it was too severe. Now, what happened there? The same process of remodeling happened, but it happened in a more aggressive or more vigorous way because the signals that control this, we're large. It was a large wound, big problem. Lots of sales got activated, they made a lot of Collagen. They may, they remodeled this, this provisional matrix very aggressively. Why? So that you could heal and so that you wouldn't have a wound here that was open to infections or loss of blood or loss of water.

Speaker 1:          40:12          Your body knows how to respond to very severe injuries are more severe than we usually encounter in our lives and the result is you'll get a scar from that because the response was too aggressive. Right? Our ancestors who lived much more dangerous lives than we did, who might get attacked by a lion or a bear needed to have a very aggressive healing response so they didn't die if they got attacked. Under some circumstances, we don't get attacked by lions or bears so often anymore and so we don't necessarily need that aggressive a healing response. We might like a gentler healing response that leads to a better functional, okay, that doesn't have a scar, for example. So how can you control healing in that case? Well, uh, one of the ideas of tissue engineering is to provide materials that would guide or regulate or change that natural response of healing.

Speaker 1:          41:10          So you have a wound and the wound is going to heal on its own in some way, but you would like it to heal in a way that you control so that the outcome is more to your liking. Now maybe the outcome is that it heals much faster. Maybe the outcome is that it heals without a scar. Maybe the outcome is that it heals and new kinds of cells are, are, are, are woven into the tissue in place of the ones that were there formerly. All right, so maybe this wound was created by a surgeon who removed the cancer here and you're trying to replace the cancer cells with normal cells. All right, so what are the options in terms of doing this? Well, what is it? You could put the material in here and uh, and the material goes into the wound and that material has some function and maybe that it serves as a better provisional matrix, then the clot would have and better means what maybe it regulates how cells grow in or how cells attach or how cells synthesize Collagen after they enter.

Speaker 1:          42:16          So maybe you could design a material that changes the healing response locally. That's, that's one of the, that's one way that you might engineer a tissue. Now here, I haven't put any cell cultures in. I've just put in a fancy material that I designed. All right, we'll talk about what those might be a little bit later. Or maybe you don't need a material at all, but maybe you could replace this with cells. So maybe I could just take cells may be recovered or harvested from some other place in the patient. Maybe these are skin cells that I got from a normal location and I put them back into a wound in order to speed up the process of healing at that site. Right? Maybe their stem cells that came from somewhere, but maybe they're just cells. But oftentimes the best combination seems to be to put cells in together with some material.

Speaker 1:          43:13          And here the material might function in a couple of different ways. It might function in this way we talked about here by giving signals to the normal tissue to regulate the healing response that's going to occur anyhow. And that, and that material might contain cells that you have derived somehow that you want to hold in that site. You want to hold locally and provide an environment where they can grow and take over the function of the tissue, right? So these are some sort of schematic ways to think about how one might use tissue engineering to control the normal healing process. And I've shown this, I've given you examples of this, that, uh, where I motivated it with thinking about the skin, but this doesn't have to be the skin, right? This could be a your liver. Maybe I put the material into your liver, uh, that allows it to regenerate. Maybe I'd put liver cells derived from some other source back into the liver. And they take over the function of the liver. Maybe I put materials on cells and create a new liver tissue, right? So you could extend this idea to almost any tissue or organ.

Speaker 1:          44:26          Here's an example of that. And, and um, where, uh, just a material is used to, uh, to guide the healing process. And, and I think this is conceptually a very simple idea and one that that works to some extent. So this is a nerve and so proximal means closer to the brain. So maybe this is a nerve in your leg and it's got severed by some kind of injury or it got crushed and somehow the nerve is damaged in this region here. So this nerve is sending sensory signals from the distal part, backup the nerve into the brain. It's sending motor signals down from the brain to the more distal regions. If this tissue, if this nerve gets damaged by trauma somehow, um, then you're not going to get sensory signals sent through it. You're not going to get motor signals. So you can't feel, you can't move in all of the tissue that's distiller downstream of that.

Speaker 1:          45:20          Um, of that site. So how do you, how would you repair that? Well, it turns out that surgeons know that if it's a small region and they go back in and they take the damaged ends of the nerves and they put them back together, you will recover much of the function of that nerve. Maybe not 100%, but if they do it quickly and they do it well, that these cells will regrow the connections that are lost in this section of trauma and you will over a period of time begin to feel in that tissue again and you'll be able to, to move, right. If the, if the damage is too big, you can't physically bring them back together. Right? Your leg is a fixed length and if at the DC area damage is too big, you can't bring these tissues back together. They found that you can use an autograft that is take a nerve from somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          46:12          If I cut the nerve out of another spot and then put it in this region in between the two ends, the nerves will regrow again. Problem with that is you don't have a lot of nerves that you're not using. And so in order to repair this nerve, you had to sacrifice a nerve somewhere else. So maybe you could do that same thing with the material. So what would the material look like? The material might look like this, and this is just a cylindrical cuff and it's a complete cylinder. It's shown as a cutout here just so that you can see inside, but it's a complete cylinder that's hollow and you put one end of the nerve into one end and one of the nerve and the other, and now you've placed these nerves not in physical contact, but you've created a compartment through which they can communicate.

Speaker 1:          47:00          So you don't have this end of the nerve dangling out in space. And this end of the nerve dangling out in space. And remember, it's not going to be a nice picture like this where the nerve is existing on its own, but there's muscles and blood vessels and other kinds of things around in this area. Right? And by putting a channel with the nerve in both ends, you've isolated the area of the nerve. You want to regenerate from all the rest of the tissue. Does that make sense? And you hope that you get some regrowth through here. And what, uh, what scientists have found that is it, that you do this, you will get some regrowth. You don't get complete regrowth of a thick nerve, but you get a thin nerve with less fibers, less nerve tissue, less function, but you get some recovery. So it works.

Speaker 1:          47:49          And we've known for about 20 years or so that it works, but it doesn't work well enough. So how could I make it better? Well, one way you could make it better is by changing the material. Maybe the properties of the material weren't right. Maybe the cuff on the outside is to impermeable and you'd like to have molecules exchanging in some way, right? Maybe it's not permeable enough, right? And so you need to regulate it that way. But maybe you don't want a nerve cuff that's filled with just air or just water. But maybe you'd like, uh, maybe you'd like a nerve conduit that's filled with a material that promotes the growth and reconnection of these fibers. Maybe you'd like some kind of a gel in there that nerves could regenerate through. And so the obvious place to go for that is to use the kinds of materials that the body uses for repairing tissues and fill up this channel, not just with water or sailing or some kind of a solution, but fill it up with an extra cellular matrix like the kind of extra cellular matrix we talked about weeks ago, that all of your tissues have the supporting Gel likes structure formed from proteins and carbohydrates that are secreted by cells and through which cells normally grow and live.

Speaker 1:          49:09          And so taking natural proteins like collagen forming gels out of them and putting these gels inside the material increases the number of fibers that crow across a gap like that. So this is just an example of a simple example. No sales involved here of a material that's designed in order to enhance the healing of a wound and how one might engineer properties of that material. To make it better at supporting the healing function. So that's what I wanted to say about tissue engineering, tissue engineering, and vaults control, or regulation of the normal healing process. But I want you to keep that in mind as we go through. Uh, the examples that we'll talk about in, uh, Thursdays, uh, lecture. I'm going to stop there, uh, questions.

Speaker 2:          50:04          See you on Thursday.
