Speaker 1:          00:12          Okay. Well, this week we're going to talk about biomedical imaging and, uh, you know, from the first lecture, as I mentioned, that one of the biggest advances in biomedical engineering was the development of, of systems for looking inside the body. And that's what we're going to talk about, uh, this week, sort of what's the physics behind some of these systems? How do they work, what are their limitations, and what are the opportunities that each of them present? And again, like almost every week's subject, uh, this one could take up a whole course. In fact, there's, there's three or four courses on biomedical imaging that are offered here at Yale. So we're just going to scratch the scratch the surface of it. But what I hope to do is give you some sense for how these different modes of imaging work, why they work, why they allow you to see inside the human body, and then what the limitations of each particular technology is.

Speaker 1:          01:06          So these are the kinds of questions that I hope we'll be able to answer by the end of this lecture. Next lecture, what is an image? Most of you could answer that probably now, but images come in different forms. And why is imaging so important to medicine? You probably already know, uh, either from what you've read in the past or from your own experience. Most of us have had at some point by the time you're as old as you are, you've had an image taken of your body of medical imaging, usually an x. Um, and uh, so you know, something about why it's so important, but we'll try to, to, to amplify on what you already know, what technologies are available. And so we're going to survey the different techniques that can be used and that are used most commonly. It's a very rapidly developing field.

Speaker 1:          01:51          And, uh, almost every year there are new innovations in imaging, new, uh, sometimes even new methods that are introduced. Um, and, um, that, that changed the way we can see inside the body. And so I'm going to talk about sort of a snapshot of what's available now. And as I said, illustrate or talk about what some of the problems are or challenges with each. What are the limitations in particular? So in image is a visual representation of um, can you get the door again? Sorry. Uh, it's become a routine thing for us. A visual representation of some measurable, a property of a person, an object or a phenomenon. We're going to be thinking about medical imaging. So we're going to be thinking mainly about images of people and, and images can be formed and displayed in, in different ways depending on, um, on properties of the object and properties of the imaging system that you're using, that you're using to create the image.

Speaker 1:          02:51          And so you're familiar with certain kinds of images. You've all probably taken a photograph with a camera. Uh, photography has changed dramatically since, uh, since you were born, right? It used to be all on film and now it's almost all on, uh, on digital. And, um, so these are different ways of capturing the same thing. A photograph is a representation of what you can see. It's a representation of how visible light reflects off of objects. And so you see the outlines of the objects and their colors and their textures. Uh, but it's basically a representation of how visible light is interacting with some object. An x ray on the other hand shows you something that you can't see on your own. It allows you to see inside the body, and this is because it's not using visible light, which bounces off of objects like us, but it's using x-ray radiation, which is able to penetrate the body.

Speaker 1:          03:46          And so by taking a picture of how these, uh, these particular form of electromagnetic radiation called x, by taking a picture of how it penetrates through the body, you can get an image that represents something about what's inside. And the challenge is to know because you understand the physics of the radiation, in this case x rays, and you understand the equipment that's used to collect the image, you should be able to be able to interpret from your understanding of those things, what it is that you're seeing inside the body. And of course, television is a different kind of image, uh, presented in a different way. But another image of something that we can already see. So two kinds of imaging, really images that represent to us, maybe not exactly the way we see it, but things that we can see and images that represent to us, things we can't see, but put it in a form that we can interpret, right?

Speaker 1:          04:44          And so that's just what this says here, that uh, that some images you're just trying to collect and record what it is that you can see so that you can look back at it later and remind yourself of what it was that you saw. Others, other imaging systems are really transducers, right? They're converting something that you can't see into something that you can. We talked about transduction, uh, several weeks ago now when we talked about cell communication and the, the, uh, the concept of transduction converting one kind of a signal into another. In this case, converting a signal that measure something you can't see but converts it into something that you can see.

Speaker 1:          05:27          So d to understand this, I have to review for you something that most of you probably already know, at least at some level. And that's the electromagnetic spectrum. And this is a representation of the variation in properties of electromagnetic radiation and certain forms of electromagnetic radiation are apparent to us because our, our retinas can detect it. And that's the, the visible part of the spectrum, which I've shown here. Now what this shows is the entire electromagnetic spectrum arranged on a scale from very short wavelength up to very long wave length. And these are in centimeters. The visible part of the spectrum is around a micron or so, or slightly less than a micron, right? It's, uh, it's around 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers is the visible spectrum. Now, why is this the visible spectrum? Because when radiation with this wavelength hits your eye, it makes a change in the cells inside your eye and allows your retina to make an image.

Speaker 1:          06:33          All right? So it's only light of those particular wavelengths that can interact productively with this particular special biological object called the retina. And that's all the light that we can see. But there's electromagnetic radiation of all different wave lengths outside of the visible spectrum. In fact, one of the things you should notice here is that the visible spectrum is only a small piece of the entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. And you know this already, there are longer wave length, there's longer wavelength radiation called infrared. So it has wavelengths that are longer than the, um, then the, in the visible spectrum, you can't see these, right? But some cameras can see infrared, right? That's how if you, when you, um, when you watch the films from the war in Iraq where they have these sort of heat heat, uh, visualization goggles, they're looking at infrared, infrared wave lengths.

Speaker 1:          07:33          So there's something in the goggles that is sensitive to infrared light and it converts it into visible wavelengths, which you can see. All right. Have you ever seen satellite pictures, uh, where, uh, they used to do this? Uh, oil companies or electric companies would take a picture of neighborhoods from the sky, right? Infrared and infrared radiation is associated with heated objects. So the higher the temperature of an object, the more infrared radiation of a higher wavelength it emits. So if you take a picture of a neighborhood at night using an infrared camera, you can see how much heat is being emitted from all the different houses. And you can identify ones that don't have enough insulation, for example, or ones that are wasting heat because they're admitting it at a higher temperature. So these are some examples of, of using a wave length that are, I can't detect, but getting information from it.

Speaker 1:          08:31          You also are familiar with ultraviolet radiation. So these are wavelengths that are shorter, shorter than the visible spectrum, shorter than the shorter than the part of the spectrum that you can see. But you can experience the effects of electro of ultraviolet radiation, right? If you're out in the sun too long, your skin turns red, right? You get a sunburn. That's because your skin absorbs ultraviolet. Radiation created a change in the cells of your skin, right? Different biological effect. You're seeing it in a sense, right? You're only seeing it where the sun hit, not where your body was in shadow. All right? But you can detect that radiation that way. Um, so if we look at the whole spectrum, I'm going to go back a slide now, and this was arranged with the, with the long wave lengths up at this end, the short wave lengths down at this end.

Speaker 1:          09:22          The other picture is arranged in just the opposite way, uh, with the long wave lengths down at this end. Radio waves, microwaves, infrared waves, the visible spectrum, ultraviolet x Ray and Gamma Ray. So these are long wave lengths proceeding to shorter wavelengths as the wave length changes. So does the frequency, they're inversely related. So as the wave length goes down, the frequency goes up and the frequency is related to how much energy these waves contain. And so the short wave length x rays and gamma rays, uh, carry high amounts of energy, right? Ultraviolet rays carry more energy than visible res. So frequency goes up as wavelength goes down. And so does the energy of the, uh, of the, um, of the, of the, uh, radiation. This diagram here shows you roughly how big is the wavelength. So for radio waves, these are very long waves that are the size of buildings or bigger than people.

Speaker 1:          10:32          Microwaves are shorter. They're the size of an insect infrared waves shorter than that, the size of a pin point, the visible raise, the ones that are retina can detect are about the size of cells. Bacteria for example, or protozoa, ultraviolet rays, the size of molecules. And then x rays and gamma rays are submolecular. There's sub subatomic in size. And because of that they have special properties and that they can actually change Adams when when x rays and gamma rays are absorbed into materials because they're wave lengths are smaller than the wave lengths of Adams or nuclei, they can actually interact with Adams and nuclei. And one of the things that x rays and gamma rays can do that other raise don't, is ionize an object. They can actually inject electrons from the atoms inside of a material and create ions. And the eye is that they create are often reactive.

Speaker 1:          11:35          And this is what makes, uh, these, uh, shortwave length, high energy forms of radiation biologically hazardous because they are in the category called ionizing radiation. When they hit your body, they can produce changes in particular produce atoms or ions from Adams. These ions can further react. Sometimes they even react with DNA inside cells and can cause mutations in DNA as a result of chemical reactions that occur. And because of this, we want to limit the exposure of our bodies to things like x rays and gamma rays. I'm going to talk about in the course of the lecture today and tomorrow, many of the ways that x rays and gamma rays are useful for medical imaging. And that's not surprising because I already said these are short wavelength, high energy forms of radiation. They can penetrate through objects fairly easily. So things that penetrate are useful for imaging what's inside, but the disadvantage of their penetration is that they can also create

Speaker 2:          12:45          okay

Speaker 1:          12:46          ions in biological damage. So we'll keep that in mind as we go through. You know that not only ionizing radiation causes biological damage, but I also mentioned the biological effects of overexposure to ultraviolet light, which you've probably all experienced through sunburn or some other overexposure. So these aren't the only kinds of rays that can have a biological effect, but they're the ones that we're most concerned about.

Speaker 2:          13:12          Okay?

Speaker 1:          13:13          Okay. Questions about that or this, this is probably a picture that you've seen before. If not, I encourage you to review, uh, um, um, review sort of the physics of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Speaker 1:          13:29          Okay? So let's talk about x rays and that is the form of medical imaging that's been around for the longest, uh, before x. As your chapter in your book. Um, um, describes, uh, physicians and doctors relied on hand drawings. They would draw things so that they could describe what they sought to others or so they could remember if a patient came in and had something abnormal, they might draw a sketch of it in your, uh, in their notebooks. So they would remember how it looked for next time. And then photography changed that because you could take pictures of things and you could remember them without drawing a, but we still couldn't look inside the body, right? Still couldn't look inside the body. Well, you could, but not really very well on living people. Right? So a lot about what we knew about the inside of the body was, uh, from the science of dissection and looking inside the bodies of cadavers, people after they died and learning about their anatomy that way.

Speaker 1:          14:25          So we knew something about that, but we weren't able to look inside the living body. Well, this Wilhelm Renkin change that. And Rankin was a physicist who discovered that rays could penetrate through solid objects. And um, he, uh, announced that discovery in 1895 he did an experiment, which is shown, uh, in a diagram in your book where he put objects in front of an x ray source. And he was able to show that these x rays would pass through the object and he could detect them on the other side with a, with a film. So here's two useful properties of x-rays. One is they can penetrate through solid objects. The second is that they can expose film, film like photographic film is sensitive to x rays. And because of this, then you could imagine taking a picture of how these rays pastor with solid object. Now the other thing that's interesting about x rays is that they pass through some solid objects better than others. The more dense the object is, the less radiation x ray radiation that passes through. So if you expose an x ray beam on an object that solid at some parts and hollow in the others, x rays are going to pass easily through the hollow part and not so easily through the solid part.

Speaker 1:          15:51          And so the amount of x ray radiation that goes through an object is related to the density through which that x ray penetrated. And it's these, these properties that made it good for taking images by, uh, by a tea after he discovered that, um, that x rays could penetrate through objects. It didn't take him very long to say, well, if it penetrates through solid objects like bricks and boards, maybe it'll penetrate through a person as well. And took some of the first images, x ray images of people by looking at the hand, for example. And he won the, the first Nobel Prize in physics for that discovery. And so it was one of the things you could take from this, from the time that he first announced at 1896 til the time you won, what's come to be known as the highest prize in science took only six years.

Speaker 1:          16:41          So people recognized immediately the value of this approach, particularly this approach for medical imaging. Now, the raid that he discovered, we now call the x Ray. Um, initially it was called, uh, the Rankin ray because he was the one that discovered it. And there are some countries that still refer to a two x rays as Rankin raise. And so you might hear that a nomenclature if you, uh, if you travel or if you're reading particularly in older textbooks. So how does it work? Here was the first kind of experiment that a, that I described earlier in x ray source here, the x ray source is emitting x rays in all different directions. Some of them would, uh, would impinge on this object.

Speaker 1:          17:27          All right. And, and depending on the density of the material with inside this object, some of the x rays would be absorbed and some of them would pass through in a dense part of the object, the x rays would be absorbed in a less dense part. More of the x rays would pass through. And if you put a piece of film or some kind of a detector behind the object, then you could create basically a shadow, right? Just like a shadow. When you're standing on the street and the sun is up here, the light doesn't pass through you. And so what you see on the ground behind you is the sun all around. But a shadow where your body did not allow the, the, the, the radiation to pass through. In this case, you'd see a shadow of this object, but it could be a more sophisticated shadow in some ways because the x rays can penetrate somewhat through dense material and even better through less dense material.

Speaker 1:          18:21          So the shadow would be light where there was density in the object and it would be dark where there was hollowness or less density in the object. Right. That makes sense. So in this way, and x ray is a shadow, it's an inverse image of the density through which the x ray passed. The diagram over here shows you, shows you a more sophisticated setup and the kind of setup that's used for x ray imaging in patients. So you have an x ray source and so x rays are admitted from this source. And if you didn't confine those x rays in some ways they'd be admitted in all directions, but you can find it so that x rays are only admitted from one side. Um, you, uh, let that pass through a filter because these, these sources of x ray generation are not perfect. They generate waves of different wavelengths and still through a filter that only lets x rays pass through through a device called a column mater and a column mater is a physical object that basically just straightens out of being.

Speaker 1:          19:28          If I had a source of radiation here, right, and x and, and it was, it was emitting x-rays, they would, they would radiate in all directions. I could put something that was x ray dense behind it and now they would only admit to the front. Right? But what I would like is if I'm want to take an image of, of someone, if I want to take an image of me, for example, I would like all those x rays to pass straight through me so that I knew what direction all of the rays were traveling so that when I tried to interpret what was on the film, there'd be a one to one correlation between where the x Ray hit the film and where it went through my body. If I've got x rays coming from all different directions and that's going to blur the image, right?

Speaker 1:          20:14          So you need to straighten it out. So the x rays go in one direction and that's what a column mater does. It's shown as a whole here, but really it's, it's, it's a, it's a, a sheet with many small pinholes and these pinholes only allow x rays to go through if they're going in the right direction, right? Ones that come at an angle like this are going to bounce off, but x rays that come straight through are going to pass straight through and hit the object. The object is the patient. So I'm standing here and there's, and there's something behind me that's going to detect the x rays that pass through. That's something behind is this, there's a grid also to prevent scatter to only collect the x rays that are passing in the right direction because some of those x rays might've been deflected as they pass through the object through me, right? But I only want to collect the ones that are going in one direction so that I will know where the anatomical object they pass through our, that hits a fluorescent screen. And the fluorescent screen is, is a special material that, uh, that emits light when x rays hit it. So an x ray hits the fluorescent screen, it generates a lot of light right in that spot. And this detector detects the light. So the fluorescent screen amplifies the x ray signal.

Speaker 1:          21:38          Several photons of X-ray hit, they generate fluorescence, they expose the detector, right? And now in the old days, this used to be really film x Ray film photographic film that was sensitive to x rays. And you would, the detector is really a piece of film that you would take out of the machine and you would, and you would develop it with chemicals, right? The same way you develop a, uh, uh, any other kinds of photographic film. Now there are detectors that are electronic and so you can detect things electronically without film. If you have an x ray though, you probably, if you have one at home at checks x Ray that your parents gave you, say you're going off to college, take your chest sacred. Hey, anybody bring one?

Speaker 2:          22:27          Wow.

Speaker 1:          22:28          Uh, well if you did, it would be probably a real piece of film. Um, so, uh, x rays are formed from high energy radiation and inverse shadow is created because x rays pass through Lens, less dense areas easier. And what's it going to pass through in the body if you do a chest x ray of, uh, of my chest, for example, where will the x rays pass through the most easily?

Speaker 1:          22:58          Well, they'll pass through the lungs. The lungs is primarily air, right? The lungs is air and tissue, but it's mainly airspaces. And so what you see is dark. Here are the less dense regions are the lungs where nothing much interfered with the x rays passing through the body. All right. Had to pass through skin soft tissue, some muscles, and then primarily through air where the image is light here. Those are regions that absorbed most of the x rays. So not many of the x rays got through to hit the film in back of me. Right. And those, uh, those, those areas appear lighter. So this bone, the clavicle appears light. The ribs up here, like the bones of the rib cage appear lighter. What's this object here in the chest over on this side? Big

Speaker 2:          23:56          Right?

Speaker 1:          23:57          The heart. Right. And why is the heart to pure light on this image? Well, it's not bone, right? It's not as dense as bone. It's muscle. It's soft tissue, but it's also filled with water. A lot of water, right? And it's a three dimensional object. And so for x rays to pass through this whole three dimensional object, a lot of the x rays get absorbed, right? It's a thicker object then this bone. And so even though it's not as dense as bone, it appears wider here because it's thicker it x rays have to pass through more of it. In order to get to the other side, the thicker the region, it has to pass through the more opportunity for those x rays to be absorbed. The diaphragm. And what do you think are these scattered sort of white things all around here? All around the side here. Well first, what's this object that comes up and sort of off to the side? Here's the heart. Something comes up.

Speaker 1:          25:02          Sorry. The Aorta. The aortic arch is here. Remember from our pictures of the heart, you can't see it entirely because behind it is another white object that's sort of in the mid line here. That's the bones of the spine. All right? And in this region here, they're all super imposed, right? So you can't really tell how much of this absorption comes from the aortic arch and how much of it comes from the spine. So this is one problem with rays that you're not seeing a three dimensional image of the chest. In this case, you're seeing a projected image, right? And so you're only looking in one direction really, and you're seeing a projection of all the things that the x rays could pass through. So I can't tell, for example, if the aortic arch is in front of or behind the spine, I can't even tell where the boundary of them are because it's all just there absorbing x rays. And so I can't see it. So what if I want it to look at this in more detail or I wanted to distinguish what part of this is the aortic arch and what part is the spine? How would I change the imaging,

Speaker 1:          26:19          Sarah? Yeah. You could ask the patient to turn to the side and you could then do the same measurement this way, right? And now you'd see another projection, but you see a projection from another angle. And so you would be able to differentiate what is different in this direction,

Speaker 2:          26:36          right?

Speaker 1:          26:37          And you might do it obliquely, you might ask the patient to turn, you know, a little bit sideways or, or uh, or turn the other way. And by putting together several different images taken from different angles, you can learn more about the three dimensional aspects of what's inside. You might be able to see things that you can't in one image in one of the other angles.

Speaker 2:          26:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:59          Okay. So x rays are a projection, a two dimensional projection of a three dimensional object. And that's one of their limitations. And you can get around that a little bit by asking the, by moving the object around and taking images from different sides. Another problem with x Rays is radiation dose. I mentioned that x rays were a form of ionizing radiation. And so if you're exposed to x rays, you could be generating ions inside and with a normal chest x ray, if you only have one chest x ray taken every five years or 10 years or so, the dose that you get is relatively low. Your body has mechanisms for repairing those, uh, that biological damage, right? Your body has mechanisms for repairing the kind of biological damage that's done by ionizing radiation. And so if the dose is low enough, the risk of some permanent kind of damage is fairly low. Where,

Speaker 2:          27:56          okay,

Speaker 1:          27:57          there is a risk is if you have repeated exposure to higher doses, in which case you're generating more ions are being generated in your body than the repair mechanisms that are naturally in place can repair. And then you get tissue damage. And so one is concerned when you're using radiation with limiting the dose that is delivered on each x Ray. So how could you reduce the dose here? How could you reduce the radiation dose that the patient receives? Thinking about how this thing works, how could you reduce the dose?

Speaker 2:          28:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:39          Well one is you could use the minimum, the minimum number of x rays necessary to see what you want to see.

Speaker 1:          28:47          And of course as you use less radiation dose, you're going to see less on the image. So you're set, the sensitivity is going to go down. And so one of the things you might not see if you use less radiation dose, you might not see these other structures here that are barely visible in this particular image, right? And these structures here are vessels from the pulmonary vasculature and the Bronc I associated with the lung and you might care about those. So you might need a higher dose in order to see what you want to see. So you can reduce the dose by reducing the intensity of the radiation. But the cost is you don't get as high a quality of an image, not as useful for diagnosis.

Speaker 2:          29:31          Um,

Speaker 1:          29:33          one could also make innovations in the machinery, right? In particular, you could make detectors that are always, that get more sensitive. And the more sensitive the detector is, the more information you get per, uh, per photon or per, uh, radiation. So more sensitive detectors allow you to make better measurements with less radioactivity and there have been those innovations continually over the years. And so the x rays that you would get now are fairly low dose x rays, uh, without much, uh, apparent risk to you. You also can limit where the x rays hit the body. And part of that is done by focusing part of it's done by something called shielding, right? So if you are getting a checks x ray done, they might put an apron on your waist. That apron contains a very dense material and so the x rays don't penetrate through below your waist.

Speaker 2:          30:31          All right?

Speaker 1:          30:33          So these are all ways that that radiologists use to reduce the radiation dose to uh, to uh, patients.

Speaker 2:          30:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:43          We talked about being able to see more by looking at different angles and the technology called computed tomography or CT is sort of the end product of that. It's trying to design x ray machines and CT machines use x rays. The physics of how you form the image is exactly the same. You're generating x rays and they're passing through the body. What's different is that the machine allows you to take pictures at many, many different angles while the patient stays, uh, still. So instead of asking the patient to move from one side to the other, so you can take pictures of different angles. You have an x ray source and a detector that basically spins around the patient.

Speaker 2:          31:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:30          And it takes pictures at different angles and you use not a broad beam that's going to expose my chest all at the same time, but you use a narrow collimated beam, a narrow beam that you can focus and move throughout all of the, um, throughout all of the angles around the body. So you're not giving a sort of a plane of radiation anymore. You're giving something more like a line of radiation.

Speaker 2:          32:00          Right.

Speaker 1:          32:01          And as that line passes through me, there's going to be absorbance detected back here depending on what was in the way of that particular line of radiation that was coming through. Now, any one line doesn't give you very much information, right. Any one line of radiation doesn't give you very much information. But what if you collect those lines from all around my body? You can basically see my body from every angle. That still is going to be a complicated set of images, right? What if you took 360 pictures as you spun this thing around my body, now you've got 360 pictures to look at. How do you make sense of that? Well, you couldn't really, and so what really made CT possible is that mathematicians figured out in mathematical ways for taking all of these separate images that are collected as you move around the body and reconstructing and image of the whole object that must been in between.

Speaker 1:          33:00          All right, that the, the mathematical process is called back projection and you take, you take a large number of projected images that are acquired from all different angles and you can reconstruct a picture of what the object must have looked like that it was sampling. Okay? Now because it's a narrow beam, you're doing this in a line instead of a plane, you're and you're spinning it around, you're really doing a slice through the body with each rotation of the device, right? If I spend this all around my body, then I'm basically moving this line around different angles and I'm looking at one slice maybe between here and here all the way around. And so you can reconstruct an image of a slice that might look like this.

Speaker 1:          33:49          All right? The digital, the, the chest x Ray, a plane of radiation shadow of what that produces. The CT gives you a slice, a transverse slice of the body, but it shows you the real three dimensional structure of what's inside. So what can you see in this picture? Well, here, here was the spine and this picture, is this from the thorax that contains the lung or is this from the abdomen that contains the intestines? Don't read the bottom of the picture, but just looking at it, it's not the lungs, right? Because you don't see, you don't see a lot of dark area in here that would indicate hair, right? What you see in stead are a lot of soft tissues that sort of absorb radiation. Uh, this here is the liver. You can see, you can see muscles and bones of the rib cage, which are down in the abdomen. Here you can see the spine very clearly. You can see the kidneys at the back. You can see the intestines in here.

Speaker 1:          34:54          All right. And so an experienced radiologist who's looking at this can see a lot of information arranged in the proper three dimensional way. Now this is one slice, but you could do another slice as well. And you can do that in the machine because the patient is sitting still and is moving through the machine one step at a time, right? So there's a conveyor belt here that's bringing the patient into the machine. And in the machine is this rotating array of x ray sources and detectors. This part spins around. So you bring the patient in, you spin it around, you collect all the, you bring them in a little farther, you spin it around each time, each increment that you move to patient in, you're taking a picture of another slice. And so one could take a three dimensional image of the whole body.

Speaker 2:          35:50          Okay?

Speaker 1:          35:50          Now, because you're just using line sources of radiation, one can reduce the amount of radiation that with each individual picture that you take,

Speaker 2:          36:00          okay?

Speaker 1:          36:01          Compared to an Xray. But you've got to take a lot of these pictures, right? And so the cumulative dose of radiation, uh, can be significant. So even though you could take a full three dimensional picture of your body, you might not want to do that, right? You might just want to take a picture of the slices that seem to be of interest. Maybe the abdomen, maybe the chest, maybe the knee, if you're having a problem with your knee. And so CT is commonly used for head injuries. It's fast. It's a very effective at detecting blood in the brain, for example. So you can detect that easily. And, and for analyzing the structure of bones and you know, x rays are very good for bones. If you've had or had a broken bone, then you've probably seen an x ray of the bones of your body. And that's because bones absorb x ray radiation. And so x rays are very good ways to detect it.

Speaker 2:          37:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          37:03          I think that's where I want to stop for today. Um, and we talked about x ray radiation. I got some slides on here that say a little bit more about ionizing radiation and I put them on there for you to read because it's not in the chapters in the book. Uh, but this talks about sources of ionizing radiation, uh, a picture of sort of what it is and some of the biological effects of ionizing radiation. It's sort of beyond what I'm going to ask you about, uh, in the, in the exams or anything. But I wanted you to have that information. And then next time we're going to move on and talk about, um, forms of imaging that don't require x rays. And so don't have the biological risks of ionizing radiation. We'll talk about ultrasound imaging and MRI imaging, and we'll talk about what I think is going to be a, an important, uh, imaging technique of the future, but using light to image inside the body as well. Okay. Questions?

Speaker 2:          38:05          Okay,

Speaker 1:          38:07          good. Thanks. I'll see you on Thursday.
