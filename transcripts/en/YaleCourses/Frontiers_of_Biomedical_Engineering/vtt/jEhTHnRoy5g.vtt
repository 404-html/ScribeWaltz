1
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.070
Good morning.
Uh,
so this is kind of a transition week.

2
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.400
We've been talking about,
uh,
about more,
more basic,

3
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:25.030
more biological subjects.
And starting this week we're going to sort of mix,
uh,

4
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.790
physiology and biomedical engineering.
And,
um,

5
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.830
and that's going to start sort of this week.
And next what the,
the,

6
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:36.390
the topic for this week is a self communication,

7
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
how mechanisms that sells within a complex organism use to communicate with each

8
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.510
other at short distances or long distances.

9
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.610
And then we're going to talk about to physiological systems just briefly where a

10
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:54.780
cell communication sort of dominates the behavior of the,

11
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.870
of the organ and that's in the immune system and in the nervous system.

12
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.570
And this will lead us into a discussion of sort of bioengineering of the immune

13
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:13.080
system in particular.
And we're going to talk next week about,
about vaccines.

14
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.860
And um,

15
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.710
so this will be the first real example where we've talked about the physiology

16
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.130
of an organ system together with,
with,
uh,

17
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.620
engineering approaches to modulate that Oregon.

18
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.590
And that will continue throughout the,
throughout the semester.

19
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.840
So you'll notice that the chapters,
because of this go go out of sequence.

20
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.950
So we're reading chapters six this week and next week we'll read parts of

21
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:39.900
chapters 14 and 15.

22
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.870
And that's because the book has a different kind of organization.

23
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:44.340
It talks about the basics.

24
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.940
Then it talks about physiology and the second part,

25
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.700
and then it talks about biomedical engineering separately.

26
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.420
But we're going to in class treat the physiology and the biomedical engineering

27
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:58.900
together.
Okay.
Questions about that or that makes it,

28
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.070
makes some sense.
Okay.

29
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.400
So cell communication and immunology is what we're going to,
uh,

30
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.020
is the topic for this week.

31
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.760
And I don't need to say too much probably about why cells need to communicate

32
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:16.530
with each other.
Uh,
but,
uh,
this is a schematic virgin,

33
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.400
one way to draw,

34
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.470
to draw sort of a schematic diagram of the operation of the human body

35
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.970
where it shows separated organ systems and tries to show them in context the

36
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:34.110
respiratory system.
For example,
the renal system,
the digestive system.

37
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.630
These are examples,

38
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.960
three examples of organ systems that contact,
uh,

39
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.110
the external environment.
Right?

40
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.310
And we've talked about the interesting way in which the digestive system

41
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:49.050
contexts,
the external environment,

42
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.070
and depending on what you call external and internal environment,

43
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.310
this path that I'm tracing here deep within your digestive system is really

44
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.620
directly connected to the outside world,
right?

45
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.910
Through both ends.
But of course,

46
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.460
when molecules get absorbed through the intestinal track,

47
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.740
they become part of your internal environment.

48
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.850
And we talked about one of the main concepts in physiology being homeostasis.

49
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.330
That is how do you maintain a constant internal environment?

50
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.570
We need to have conditions internally that are relatively constant in terms of

51
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:32.731
temperature and Ph and chemical composition in order for us to thrive,

52
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.280
right?
In order for life to,
uh,
to proceed,

53
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.310
you need to maintain constant internal environment.

54
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.590
And that's achieved in fact,
that's the main goal of many of these organ systems,

55
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:44.891
right?

56
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.891
The main goal of the respiratory system is to bring fresh air in so you can

57
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:55.141
extract oxygen from it and blow used air out so that you can get rid of carbon

58
00:03:55.661 --> 00:04:00.400
dioxide,
which is the end product of carbon metabolism inside our bodies.

59
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.330
All right?

60
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.280
And so the respiratory system plays an important role in,
in,

61
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.290
uh,
maintaining our internal environment at the proper level of oxygen,
right?

62
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:16.090
By bringing the right amount in and you regulate your breathing rate in order to

63
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:19.570
accomplish that.
And we'll talk about this in a,
in a couple of weeks,

64
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.050
the renal system has an equally important a function in that way in maintaining

65
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.070
your a water balance.

66
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:33.670
The amount of water that you need to have the optimal sort of concentrations of

67
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:34.630
things,
uh,

68
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:39.631
is determined by how much a urine your kidneys produce and how much they excrete

69
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:43.760
each day.
In addition,
the kidney,
uh,

70
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.170
controls the composition of your body of many important Dion's,

71
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.690
a sodium bicarbonate,
which is important to ph,
balance,

72
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.703
potassium,

73
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.210
and by a m by determining how many of those molecules to hold on to,

74
00:04:58.211 --> 00:04:59.500
how many to keep in the body,

75
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.900
how many to release a determines the internal,
uh,

76
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.620
composition with regard to that ion.
Right.
And the digestive system,

77
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:12.310
of course,
is responsible for bringing in sort of fresh nutrients,

78
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.680
fresh substrates for cellular metabolism,

79
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.160
fresh quantities of amino acids and nucleotides.
And the things that,
uh,

80
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.500
we can't generate internally.
And so these are all involved with our,

81
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.060
uh,
our,
uh,

82
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.350
ability to maintain homeostasis by exchanging materials with the external

83
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:32.150
environment,
right?

84
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.430
There are some organ systems that are totally internal,
right?

85
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:40.840
The circulatory system,
uh,
which we'll talk about in a couple of weeks.
The heart,

86
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.110
the blood vessels and the blood work together to form a totally internal

87
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.990
function,
right?
There's no point where the circulatory system,
uh,

88
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.970
crosses the boundary between being inside you and outside of you.

89
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.660
It's totally internal and its role is to move molecules around in the body so

90
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:05.120
that they're available to cells everywhere within your body,

91
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:08.780
regardless of how close they are to your skin.
And we'll talk about that.

92
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.480
And of course,
the nervous system,
the endocrine system,

93
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:14.450
which we'll start talking about a little bit today,
is this,

94
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.700
the system that's responsible for,
uh,

95
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.850
sending signals back and forth between tissues of your body.

96
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.020
The nervous system does the same thing in a different way,
right?

97
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.060
And so these two systems,

98
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:33.290
which are shown in the core of this diagram,

99
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.693
<v 1>uh,</v>

100
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.560
<v 0>uh,</v>

101
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.560
really are responsible for regulating and exchanging information between the

102
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:49.660
other organ systems,
right?
How did your lungs know what your heart is doing,

103
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.640
how your kid needs,
know what the status is of inside your blood.

104
00:06:54.641 --> 00:06:55.474
For example,
they,

105
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.740
they know that because they receive signals from the endocrine system and the

106
00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:03.190
nervous system.
These are primarily communication systems,

107
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:07.630
which act to allow your other organ systems to work in concert.

108
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.190
And we're going to talk about the mechanisms by which these,
uh,
work as well.

109
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.820
Now there's something very wrong about this diagram,
right?

110
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.870
In that it's showing these functions as sort of centralized in the core.

111
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.980
And of course,
that's not how your body is organized,
right?
You're,

112
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.340
it's not that all these layers are wrapped around the nervous system and the

113
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:28.180
endocrine system.

114
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:33.100
These systems are disbursed throughout your body and their disbursal is

115
00:07:33.101 --> 00:07:36.160
important.
And so we'll talk about that as well.

116
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.040
So take a step way back and think about what's the basic mechanism by which

117
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:52.140
cells receive signals.
And it turns out that cells receive signals or,

118
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.660
or information from the rest of the body in a variety of ways.
Uh,

119
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.080
but there's one way in particular,
uh,

120
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.160
that's a very useful way for thinking about how cells receive most information.

121
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.750
And it's shown schematically on this diagram here.
And so on.
The,

122
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.600
on the side over here shows a cell membrane.

123
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:15.210
And so this is outside the cell above it.
And this is inside the cell,
uh,

124
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.830
uh,
below.
And this is,

125
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:22.180
this is the lipid bi layer that separates the outside of the cell from the

126
00:08:22.181 --> 00:08:23.020
inside of the cell.

127
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.800
And I've already mentioned many times that the lipid bi layer,

128
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.380
the cell membrane isn't just a lipid bi layer,

129
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.610
that there are other molecules in the lipid biolayer and they're important for,

130
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.990
uh,
for uh,

131
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.550
cells getting information or getting molecules from outside.

132
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.180
We've talked about one class of molecules,

133
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:47.860
they're transporters that move molecules from inside to outside or outside to

134
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:51.490
end that wouldn't ordinarily be transported through a cell membrane.

135
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.250
And Glucose is a great example of that.

136
00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:58.920
And we're going to come back to that a little bit later in the lecture.
If a,

137
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:03.921
if a cell membrane was indeed just a lip at by layer than glucose could never

138
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:08.250
enter the cell because it can't permeate through cell membranes.

139
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.040
Glucose has to get into cells.
That's the main source of uh,

140
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:15.060
of energy source.

141
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:19.560
That cells use metabolism of glucose and it does so because there are some

142
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:24.090
molecules in the surface of the membrane that allow glucose to move in and out.

143
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.000
Those are called glucose transporters.

144
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.460
There's another whole family of molecules that sit in the surface and they're

145
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:36.630
not responsible necessarily for moving molecules inside and out,

146
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.930
but they sit at the outside of the cell and they wait for signals and when they

147
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:43.890
receive the signal,
they make,

148
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.100
they change in a very specific way and the cell can recognize this change that's

149
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:54.120
occurred at the cell surface and that general class of molecules is called

150
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:59.100
receptors and it's shown here just as a,
as a block of material,

151
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.110
uh,
living in the cell membrane.

152
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.970
I'm going to talk about different classes of receptors in just a minute,

153
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.190
but for now,
just just picture it in the simple way as a molecule.

154
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:14.760
Usually a protein that's embedded in the cell membrane.

155
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.990
And many receptors have a part of their,
uh,
have a,

156
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.060
have a part of them that is extra cellular and they go across the membrane.

157
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.560
This is the transmembrane part of the receptor that's going across the membrane.

158
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.690
And then there's a part that's inside the cell sticking out it down into the

159
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:38.310
cell cytoplasm.
So this is called the extracellular region or domain.

160
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.190
This is the transmembrane region or domain.

161
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.550
And this is the cytoplasmic region or domain.

162
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:50.750
And because these molecules can span across the membrane from outside to inside

163
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:55.380
there in just the right position to take messages that they receive from outside

164
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.880
the cell and transmit them through the membrane into the cells internal

165
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:01.860
apparatus.
And that's what they do.

166
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.210
And the signal comes in the form of molecules,

167
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.240
which we're going to call throughout the lecture here.

168
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:14.070
Lie Gans and this terminology lie Ganden receptor.

169
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.840
Uh,
you've probably heard before.

170
00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.410
It refers to usually receptors that are fixed in a cell on a cell membrane and

171
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:27.360
lie gans which are dispersed throughout the body and free to diffuse around.

172
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.160
And occasionally we'll find the cell and when they do find the cell they're

173
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:37.161
capable of interacting with the receptor forming some kind of chemical

174
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.180
interaction with the receptor.
Now usually this is a non covalent interaction.

175
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.050
There's not actually chemical covalent bonds that are formed,

176
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:51.170
but it's a non covalent interaction usually dominated by hydrogen bonding.
Um,

177
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.300
and we're going to talk about this kind non covalent interaction more when we

178
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:57.730
talk about the immune system.

179
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.750
Because one example of like end in receptors that's important in the immune

180
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:05.860
system are antigens foreign molecules and antibodies,

181
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.220
molecules that we produce.
But today,

182
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:12.640
let's think about it more generally as ligands and receptors,

183
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.270
the logins are bringing some message.
They,

184
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.360
they transmit the message by binding to the receptor and that when they bind,

185
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.460
they produce some change in the receptor molecule which is experienced inside

186
00:12:27.461 --> 00:12:28.294
the cell.

187
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.070
And the way that the cell experience it is through some sort of biochemical

188
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.970
changes.
And those changes usually involve enzymes.

189
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:42.840
They often involve the generation of what are called Second Messenger Molecules,

190
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:46.570
which carry the signal further into the cell.

191
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.730
And they often involve networks of reactions,
not just one enzyme,

192
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:56.731
but a series of enzymes that serve to amplify each other so that the reaction

193
00:12:57.731 --> 00:13:02.731
performed by one enzyme creates a product that stimulates another enzyme,

194
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.300
that creates a product that stimulates another enzyme.

195
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.610
And through this cascade of reactions,

196
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.560
you amplify and carry the signal forward.
Okay.

197
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:15.603
That's what's,

198
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.300
that's what's illustrated here with the end result being that there's some

199
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:22.090
change in the,
in the life of the cell.

200
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.560
Okay.
Now what would that change be?
Well,

201
00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:30.670
it might be that this signal is a signal to divide.

202
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:36.310
It's time for you to reproduce.
And so the cellular response would be my Tosas,

203
00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.050
right?

204
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:43.030
It could be that that signal is you need more glucose.

205
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:49.120
And so the cellular response is to create more glucose transporters to bring

206
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:53.140
more glucose into the cell.
It could be the responses.

207
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.610
There's something dangerous in the environment.
We've got to move away.
Right?

208
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:02.050
And so the response is for the cell to crawl in the opposite direction,
right?

209
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:06.370
So there's a diverse range of responses that might occur.
Uh,

210
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:11.580
but that response is initiated by this simple chemical process of,

211
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:15.460
uh,
of the ligand binding to a receptor.

212
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.180
Now the other thing to keep in mind is that for any cell,

213
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.720
there's not just one receptor on the cell,
all right?

214
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.480
There's not just one receptor on the cell.
There are,
uh,

215
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.500
there are thousands or hundreds of thousands of receptors and all of them could

216
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:35.470
potentially be receiving signals from a gander,
a chemical.

217
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:41.130
And so this pathway might not be the only one that's being activated inside the

218
00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:42.760
cell at any given time.

219
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.030
It might be getting a signal from this receptor and it's signal from this

220
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:47.950
receptor and it's signal from this receptor.

221
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.210
And what the cell needs to be able to do is to integrate that information into a

222
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:54.050
response,

223
00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:55.643
<v 2>right?</v>

224
00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.810
<v 0>Needs to be able to integrate that information into a response.</v>

225
00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.700
And that happens through these biochemical reactions.

226
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:05.910
Uh,
so I,

227
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:10.380
I hope that makes sense as background and I'm just going to basically illustrate

228
00:15:10.381 --> 00:15:14.980
that basic concept with a few examples throughout the rest of the lecture.
Uh,

229
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.980
the other thing that's on this slide here is sort of a simple analogy,
uh,
that,

230
00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.510
uh,
I've already described sort of,
if you think about a receptor Ligand,

231
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.210
a system as an input into the cell,
and if it was a,

232
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.650
if it was sound that was being received,
that might be a beating of a drum,

233
00:15:31.651 --> 00:15:35.550
for example,
that sound gets con gets transduced.

234
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.600
And we're used to thinking about sound being transduced,
for example,

235
00:15:39.601 --> 00:15:44.280
being converted by acoustic waves into electrical signals,

236
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:49.530
right?
That can be,
uh,
that can be recognized by your eye pods,

237
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.970
right?
Uh,
but it's,
same thing happens here.

238
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.650
There's a transduction one kind of a signal gets converted to another kind of a

239
00:15:58.651 --> 00:16:01.350
signal in the case of a ligand receptor,

240
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.110
a chemical signal in the form of a concentration of lag,

241
00:16:05.111 --> 00:16:09.030
and it gets converted into a biochemical signal.

242
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.880
And that signal is carried here,
for example,

243
00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:16.960
by the concentration of second messengers,
the concentration of something else.

244
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.273
<v 2>All right?</v>

245
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.620
<v 0>Often that signal gets amplified so it can be used.</v>

246
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.400
Same thing happens inside cells and there's some output that's generated.

247
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.500
Uh,
what are one of the,
um,

248
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.830
this understanding of receptor lag and interactions has been really the

249
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.850
biological basis of much of the pharmaceutical industry.

250
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:47.510
Much of the work that pharmaceutical companies do in terms of searching for

251
00:16:47.851 --> 00:16:52.200
drugs is searching for a new Lai gans

252
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:53.350
<v 2>okay.</v>

253
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:58.350
<v 0>That activate receptors and create biological responses inside cells.</v>

254
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.080
And there are two classes,

255
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:07.140
two broad classes of drug sort of type lie gans that are defined a agonist and

256
00:17:08.471 --> 00:17:13.020
antagonist.
And An agonist is a substance that,
uh,

257
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.160
that mimics the action of a natural lag.
And so I'm,

258
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.690
and I show you a couple of examples of agonists here.
Now,

259
00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:22.900
sometimes the agonist is the natural light end itself.

260
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.460
And that's an example of that is when you use insulin is a drug.

261
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.670
Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone.

262
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.870
It's a protein hormone that circulates in all of our bodies and it regulates

263
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.700
glucose metabolism.

264
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:42.620
When you don't produce enough insulin yourself as diabetics do not,
uh,

265
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.000
then you can use insulin as a drug.
And,

266
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.860
and what insulin is doing inside your body is,

267
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.060
is acting as a lie for insulin receptors,

268
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.020
which stimulate certain kinds of cellular responses.

269
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.790
I'll talk about that more in a minute.
Another example is in the nervous system,

270
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:04.290
patients that have Parkinson's disease have too little of a natural lie gand

271
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.190
called a dopamine.
And that can be,

272
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:11.730
it's supplied by an antagonist called El Dopa,

273
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.080
which is not exactly the same as dopamine.
It's slightly different.

274
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.020
It turns out when you give l Dopa to people,

275
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:23.400
it gets converted biochemically into natural dopamine,
which then,

276
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.140
which then serves as its own,
uh,
it's own agonist,
right?

277
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.970
But sometimes you can design drugs that act like,
uh,

278
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.610
that act like natural light guy without being the natural ligand.

279
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:41.490
And we've identified many drugs that stimulate insulin receptors,
for example,

280
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:43.050
but they're not exactly insulin.

281
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.040
And those can potentially be used as agonist type drugs.

282
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.370
And alternate is to design an antagonist.

283
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.540
And this would be an example of a substance that inhibits the,

284
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.430
the action of a natural gant.
And they can inhibit in a variety of ways.

285
00:18:59.431 --> 00:19:03.190
Sometimes they inhibit by,
uh,
by just,
uh,

286
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.260
preventing the Lygen from interacting with its receptor.

287
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.920
They prevent the lie again,
from reaching its natural receptor.

288
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:15.810
And so that antagonizes or inhibits the function of the natural law.
Again,

289
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.260
sometimes they act by actually binding to the receptor and they bind sometimes

290
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:23.700
better than the natural again does,

291
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.880
but they don't create the right biological reaction.

292
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.920
So they bind to the receptor.
They,
they occupy the receptor.

293
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.140
So now the natural eigen can't enter it,

294
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.340
but they don't create the same sequence of biochemical events.

295
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.730
And so an example of a drug that works like that is the anti a cancer drug

296
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.330
Tamoxifen,

297
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.590
which binds to estrogen receptors and blocks,

298
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:53.940
estrogen signaling and many types of cancers,
particularly breast cancers,

299
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.660
many breast cancers,
but not all are sensitive to estrogen.

300
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.720
Estrogen is a natural signal for cells to grow.

301
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.750
It's a natural signal for cells to grow.

302
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.800
And if you design a drug that blocks estrogen interaction,
you stop growth.

303
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.150
Stopping growth in tumors can be a very beneficial thing,
right?

304
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.240
And there's a whole class of antagonistic,
uh,
drugs,
uh,

305
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.540
that have been designed to influence your cardiovascular system.
One,

306
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.160
one class of them is Beta blockers.
They bind to Beta adrenergic receptors,

307
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.790
which are receptors that,
that,
uh,
that,
uh,

308
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.370
exchange information between your nervous system and,
um,

309
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.850
and the contractal system,
the beats of the beats your heart,

310
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.500
um,
and that causes the heartbeat.
And they can antagonize that reaction.

311
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:47.710
And as a result,
they affect,
they have blood rate and more importantly,

312
00:20:47.711 --> 00:20:51.050
they can affect like blood pressure as well.
Uh,

313
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.980
the strength of your heartbeat and the pressure that your heart generates.

314
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.530
So these are just some examples

315
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:59.950
I mentioned earlier,

316
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.350
we thought about receptors as being these blocks and membranes,
but there,

317
00:21:03.351 --> 00:21:07.840
there are different families of receptors.
And one useful thing about,

318
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:12.310
about separating receptors into types or families is that we found that many

319
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:15.910
different receptors work by the same basic underlying mechanism.

320
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.610
They might have different logins which stimulate them,

321
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.360
but once they're stimulated,
they work the same way.
And uh,

322
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:25.940
and understanding this has really has really,
uh,

323
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:30.280
led to lots of advances in,
in,
in biology.
We'll,

324
00:21:30.281 --> 00:21:33.760
we'll talk about that as we come to it.
What I want to do in here is just,

325
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.630
it's just introduced some of the basic kinds of of receptors.

326
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.930
The one that's on the top here is called a ligand gated ion channel.

327
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.090
And an ion channel is a,

328
00:21:43.091 --> 00:21:48.091
is a protein that sits in the surface of a cell and it can exist in a gated ion

329
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:53.320
channel,
can exist in one or two states,
a state where it's closed.

330
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.820
So imagine a channel with a lid on top of it.
When it's closed,

331
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:01.600
nothing can go through the channel.
When it's open,
then things can go through.

332
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.380
Now these are special channels and that they only allow certain molecules to

333
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:06.214
pass through.

334
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.260
And the ones that are most important in physiology are ones that only allow ions

335
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:14.500
to go through.
Sodium,
potassium chloride,

336
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.480
calcium by carbonate.

337
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.400
And we'll see just briefly in this course.
If you go on to study physiology,

338
00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:25.750
you'll learn much more about how these,
these,
uh,
channels,
uh,

339
00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:29.110
cause,
uh,
cause changes in,
um,

340
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.360
the electrical potential of cells,

341
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:36.540
which lead to events like conduction of nerve or a contraction of a muscle or a

342
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:41.360
beating of the heart.
We'll talk a little bit about that,
but not much for,

343
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.850
for these purposes.
Think about a channel.
It only allows sodium to go through.

344
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:46.684
For example,

345
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:51.690
it has a gate on it and that gate is in an open or closed state depending on

346
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:53.830
whether a lie again is present or not.

347
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.730
So if ally again comes and interacts with the receptor,
it opens up.

348
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.550
If the light gang goes away,
it closes.

349
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.080
And so in the presence of this lie Gann this molecule,
it's open,

350
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.890
it allows transport of the scion when the,
when the [inaudible] is gone,

351
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:13.030
it doesn't,
and that,
uh,
that changes the cell.
And here's some examples of it.

352
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:17.980
Many neurotransmitter's,
uh,
that carry signals between neurons in your brain,

353
00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:23.080
uh,
work this way.
The cells that take an electrical signal,

354
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:28.081
which is coming down your nerve and converted into a muscle contraction work

355
00:23:29.861 --> 00:23:32.950
this way,
right?
So neuro,

356
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.050
neuro nerve muscle junctions act,
uh,

357
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.190
based on Lygen gate gated ion channels.

358
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.780
Another family is called the g protein coupled receptor.

359
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.670
It's called the g protein coupled receptor because it's a receptor like the one

360
00:23:47.671 --> 00:23:51.710
shown here that's coupled to a special molecule called a g protein.

361
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.180
When the Ligand is present,

362
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:57.800
it binds to the receptor outside the cell and it activates this g protein and

363
00:23:57.801 --> 00:24:02.801
the g protein then goes on to create some other biochemical changes inside the

364
00:24:02.811 --> 00:24:05.960
cell.
And uh,
we're not going to talk about this in any detail.

365
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:08.120
There's a little bit more detailed described in your book.

366
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:11.780
These are fascinating molecules that turned out to be ubiquitous.

367
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:15.080
They're everywhere in a cells throughout your body and they,

368
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.980
and they are responsible for lots of,
uh,

369
00:24:18.981 --> 00:24:22.670
of the biochemistry of cell cell interaction and signaling.

370
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.490
Another family has receptor tyrosine kinases.
I'll,

371
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.320
I'll show another picture in a moment that that tells you more about what a,

372
00:24:30.321 --> 00:24:31.580
what a kinase is.

373
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.850
But a kinase is basically an enzyme that can add a phosphorous to another

374
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:38.360
molecule.
It can,

375
00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:42.410
it can phosphorolate or add a phosphorous to another protein.

376
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.450
And this is a signal.

377
00:24:44.451 --> 00:24:49.451
This passing of phosphorous is a signal that's used very frequently in

378
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.440
intracellular communication.
I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute.

379
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.640
In this case,

380
00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.820
a receptor tyrosine kinase is a receptor molecule that binds a lie again and its

381
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:06.080
surface outside the cell and initiate this enzyme activity,

382
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.400
this kinase activity and causes phosphorylation of another molecule.

383
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

384
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.120
<v 0>And um,
this is,
uh,</v>

385
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:18.620
there are also other receptors that are linked to other enzymes besides kinases.

386
00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:22.190
And so I've included that as a general family here.
So these are receptors,

387
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:26.690
for example,
that bind a lie again and then liberate an enzyme which does,

388
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.100
which promotes some sort of reaction inside the cell.

389
00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.890
Often it's kinases,
but doesn't have to be

390
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.303
<v 1>okay.</v>

391
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.680
<v 0>One of the enzymes that often gets activated is an enzyme which converts ATP,</v>

392
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.520
a small molecule that is insight all of ourselves and ATP is famous.

393
00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.030
Or,
um,
it's,
uh,
it's ability to store energy,

394
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.010
uh,
but it's also a messenger molecule and when an end,

395
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.350
certain enzyme is activated inside cells,

396
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:03.890
ATP gets converted into a molecule called cyclic amp.

397
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:06.830
Cyclic amp is an example of,

398
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.370
of one of these molecules called Second Messengers.

399
00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.330
It gets produced in response to a signal.

400
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.260
So there's a binding of a login to a receptor.

401
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.750
The enzyme that does this conversion is,
uh,

402
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:27.790
is activated and more cyclic amp is released as cyclic amp levels rise inside

403
00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:33.440
the cell.
Something about cell behavior changes right now,

404
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:35.750
one of the advantages of having second messengers is,

405
00:26:35.751 --> 00:26:39.860
is this is one way that you can integrate between different receptor systems

406
00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:41.360
that are acting inside a cell.

407
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.080
If you have two lie gans stimulating to different receptors and one causes

408
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:52.770
activation of this enzyme and generation of cyclic amp,

409
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.740
cyclic amp levels will start to rise.

410
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:01.250
If another receptor operating from a different ligature and does the same thing,

411
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:07.430
generates an enzyme which causes cyclic amp to increase the rate of cyclic amp

412
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:14.330
increase is going to go up faster than if only one of these was activated.

413
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.673
Right?

414
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.400
And so the sale is going to experience something different inside because both

415
00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:23.820
receptors were activated instead of just one.
All right.

416
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.940
So sometimes second messengers collect signals from a variety of different uh,

417
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:30.840
receptor systems,

418
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.580
translate them into one kind of internal change and the cell then just has to

419
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:40.260
know about that one thing changing.
Does that make sense?

420
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.240
Okay.
Uh,
this is another example of a second messenger,

421
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.130
the UNASA tall lipid pathway.

422
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.000
These are molecules that exist naturally in cell membranes are an activated by

423
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:54.960
certain enzymes and kinases generated by receptors.

424
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.520
Morris said about this in the book I just included here as an example.
Uh,

425
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:02.070
but it's sort of beyond the scope of what I wanted to talk about today.

426
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.600
I did want to say a little bit more about kinases because they're so important

427
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:09.870
in intracellular communication and um,

428
00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.190
kinases take advantage of the fact that proteins can often exist in more than

429
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:19.140
one state and that's what makes them useful molecules inside cells.

430
00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:19.890
That's what's,

431
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:24.890
that's what makes proteins useful and transmitting or responding to signals.

432
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.100
And often the state of a protein depends on whether its phosphorolated or not.

433
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.300
Now being phosphorolated means that a phosphate group has been added to the

434
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:41.160
protein and phosphate groups can only be added to certain amino acids along a

435
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:45.680
protein.
So proteins are only susceptible to uh,

436
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.680
phosphorolation if they have certain kinds of amino acid sequences.

437
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.530
One of the amino acids that can be phosphorylated is tyrasine for example.

438
00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:01.230
And so at protein that has tyrasine and it has tyrasine in a position such that

439
00:29:01.231 --> 00:29:06.231
it's on the outside of the protein and accessible to chemical reaction can be

440
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:08.040
phosphorylated.

441
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.820
And what a kinase enzyme does is that it recognizes this protein and for

442
00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:14.611
example,

443
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:19.611
the tyrasine that's on the protein and it performs a chemical reaction on the

444
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:24.861
protein taking a phosphorous from ATP and moving that phosphorus onto the

445
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:29.520
protein.
Now,
you know,
already or,

446
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.580
or you could review in,
um,

447
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:36.650
in chapter four a that I provided to you something about how proteins work and

448
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:41.470
you know,
that the function of a protein is intimately related to its structure.

449
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.980
Proteins have three dimensional structures in solution and their structure

450
00:29:47.051 --> 00:29:48.460
determines what they do.

451
00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:53.410
And sometimes subtle changes in the structure of a protein can convert it from

452
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:57.100
an active state into an inactive state,
right?

453
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.930
It's one of the beauties of proteins is working molecules is that their

454
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:04.930
structure can be changed by subtle means.

455
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:10.140
And sometimes that subtle change can lead to a big change in the function of the

456
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:14.110
protein.
Well,
imagine if that,

457
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.890
if that a change in structure could be switched on and off by addition of a

458
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:25.870
phosphorus and in fact it can in many proteins.

459
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.530
So some proteins can be switched from an off position where they don't do

460
00:30:29.531 --> 00:30:34.510
anything to an on position where they now do something by only a chemical

461
00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:39.070
reaction like this,
uh,
where phosphorus is added.
So,

462
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.470
so kinases can,
in many cases,

463
00:30:41.471 --> 00:30:46.420
serve as a mechanism for switching a protein on or switching a protein off.

464
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.420
If that protein is an enzyme,

465
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:54.220
then you've switched any switched it from an off position where it's not

466
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:58.060
catalyzing a reaction to an on position where it is you've,

467
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.850
you've changed the biochemical state of the cell,

468
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.170
you've changed the chemical reactions that can occur within the cell and you've

469
00:31:05.171 --> 00:31:08.020
changed its behavior,
right?
And that's

470
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.290
a very simplified version of why a kinases are important.
Well,

471
00:31:14.291 --> 00:31:17.590
if this kinase happens to turn this protein on,

472
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.160
then you would like to have a mechanism to turn it off as well.

473
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:26.350
And the other beauty about a beautiful thing about proteins is that if you make

474
00:31:26.351 --> 00:31:30.220
subtle confirmational changes,
often those changes are reversible.

475
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.070
Often those changes are reversible.

476
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:36.670
Now you all know that we can make irreversible changes in proteins.

477
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:40.870
You can denature them completely.
It's what happens when you cook an egg,

478
00:31:40.871 --> 00:31:44.890
for example,
right?
You've,
you've taken all the,

479
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:49.540
all the proteins inside the,
the white of the egg,
for example,

480
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:53.560
you raise the temperature,
you make,
not small changes in their chemistry,

481
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:56.770
but big changes in their chemistry.
You denature them,

482
00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:02.010
you can watch them d nature because the egg white turns from clear to white and

483
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:04.090
it doesn't go back right?

484
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.060
You've irreversibly changed that substance because you've changed the,
um,

485
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.180
the,
the structure of all the proteins inside.
So you can,

486
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:17.170
that irreversible changes happen all the time too.
Uh,

487
00:32:17.171 --> 00:32:19.900
but here I'm talking about very subtle small changes,

488
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.000
or you're changing the structure of the protein,

489
00:32:22.001 --> 00:32:24.340
but only a little bit such that it can go back.

490
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.960
And one way that you could switch this on and off inside the cell is by taking

491
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:31.780
off this phosphorous proteins,

492
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.480
enzymes that do this opposite reaction.

493
00:32:34.481 --> 00:32:38.590
The opposite to kinases are called phosphatases.
Okay?

494
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.760
So you could imagine a protein that's existing inside itself at it's some level

495
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:46.250
of abundance.
There are a hundred of these molecules.

496
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.020
When a receptor gets activated,
a kinase activity gets activated,
the,

497
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.890
the kinase acts on the protein,
the protein gets switched on,

498
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.320
something new starts to happen inside the cell.

499
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:02.090
Another receptor eventually activates a phosphatase.

500
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.140
That phosphatase now turns the protein off,

501
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.940
that's a switch from outside,
can be used to change the life of a cell.

502
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.350
Okay.
Um,
so that was some,

503
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.280
not too complicated,
but hopefully,
uh,

504
00:33:19.281 --> 00:33:23.900
understandable description of,
of a whole,

505
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.330
uh,
um,

506
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:30.130
area of biologics biology called signal transduction.
Uh,

507
00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.390
if you hear about signal transduction in biology,

508
00:33:32.391 --> 00:33:35.180
people that studied signal transduction arts studying just these things,

509
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:40.130
we talked about how biochemical messages get,
uh,
get,
um,

510
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:40.780
uh,

511
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:45.780
transferred into sales and through cells and want to look at a slightly higher

512
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:50.330
level of magnification now and think about different kinds of cellular

513
00:33:50.331 --> 00:33:52.620
communication.
And uh,

514
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.450
one kind of cellular communication occurs by similar mechanisms to what we're

515
00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:01.970
talking about.
But here there are receptors on one cell and the,

516
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.360
again,
that they experience is not a dissolved molecule,

517
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.800
but actually a molecule that's attached to another cell.

518
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.960
So sometimes signals are transmitted between sales by sell,
sell,

519
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:17.750
contact,
and by sell,
sell contact,

520
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:22.910
I mean that there's a receptor in one cell that that makes some kind of a

521
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.940
chemical interaction with the receptor in another sale.

522
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.760
So depending on which style you are,
you would call one the receptor.

523
00:34:30.761 --> 00:34:32.470
And the other,
the lie again,
right?

524
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.000
And this is a mode of communication that's used very frequently in the immune

525
00:34:37.001 --> 00:34:41.800
system as we'll see as we'll see later.
And it's the way,
for example,

526
00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:46.801
that foreign molecules are antigens get presented to cells of your immune system

527
00:34:47.261 --> 00:34:50.830
in order to start the process of making an immune response.

528
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:54.750
Okay.
So sometimes it's cells cell interaction.

529
00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:58.500
The rest of these examples referred to receptors as I've been describing them

530
00:34:58.501 --> 00:35:00.960
and lie gins that are soluble and can move around the body.

531
00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:05.100
And it's useful to separate this kinds of signals into three categories.

532
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.290
One is shown at the top of years called Otto Krinn and this is maybe the

533
00:35:10.291 --> 00:35:14.850
strangest because the lie gand that stimulates the receptor is produced by the

534
00:35:14.851 --> 00:35:15.780
cell itself.

535
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:21.500
So sometimes cells make signals that they receive and what,

536
00:35:22.171 --> 00:35:24.810
and this is commonly used in the immune system as well,

537
00:35:24.811 --> 00:35:27.840
but it's a way of amplifying a signal.
For example,

538
00:35:27.841 --> 00:35:30.960
what if I activated this cell by,
uh,

539
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:35.990
by encouraging it to produce this particular lie gand and that lie gand was one

540
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.680
for which the sale header receptor that further encouraged it to produce more of

541
00:35:42.961 --> 00:35:43.794
the light gand.

542
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.710
Well then you could imagine a cycle here where activation of the receptor is

543
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:53.100
leading to production of more lag and is leading to activation of the receptor

544
00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:55.650
and production of a more of a lie.
Again,
that's,

545
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.950
that's an example of a process called positive feedback.

546
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:04.260
The more of the receptor gets activated,
the more feedback it gets to activate.

547
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:10.050
And that can be a very strong amplifying response.

548
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.833
<v 2>Right.</v>

549
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.210
<v 0>And that happens in the immune system in many cases.
Uh,</v>

550
00:36:15.211 --> 00:36:19.410
an example is a production of certain molecules called cytokines by t cells that

551
00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:20.400
activate themselves.

552
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.490
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

553
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:25.820
<v 0>Another example is called [inaudible].
And here,
uh,</v>

554
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:29.090
what's different between autocrine and paracrine is that there's some distance

555
00:36:29.091 --> 00:36:33.200
between the cell that produces the signal and the cell that receives the signal,

556
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:37.550
but it's not too great a distance because the blood system doesn't have to be

557
00:36:37.551 --> 00:36:38.384
involved.

558
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:43.690
Molecules are produced here and they flow directly over usually by diffusion to

559
00:36:44.061 --> 00:36:45.260
the neighboring molecule.

560
00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:50.420
And Para means near pericrine means signal from nearby.

561
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:56.480
Endocrin are signals that get carried through the,
um,
through the blood system.

562
00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:01.100
So the cell that's producing the signal produces enough of the molecule.

563
00:37:01.101 --> 00:37:04.370
So that it enters the bloodstream,
it circulates throughout your body.

564
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.800
Eventually it reaches a cell at a great distance,

565
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.670
which has a receptor for that lie gand and the signal gets received.

566
00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.000
And an example of that is of course insulin,

567
00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.020
which is produced by cells of the pancreas and Axon sales all over the body.

568
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:23.600
Adrenaline is another one produced by cells and your adrenal gland,

569
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.670
but used by cells all over your body.

570
00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:27.213
<v 2>Okay,</v>

571
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:34.410
<v 0>well the endocrine system is a,
is a body organ system that is uh,</v>

572
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.670
that is specialized in producing these kinds of signals that are used,

573
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.390
that accumulate in the blood,
are used by cells all over the body.

574
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.870
There are two general classes of molecules that are,

575
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.160
that are produced by the endocrine system.
Uh,

576
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:51.600
all of the molecules are car called hormones.

577
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.380
So a hormone is another name for a lag.

578
00:37:54.381 --> 00:37:57.270
And that operates in this endocrine fashion.

579
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:03.450
A hormone is just a lie Gann that operates in this endocrine fashion,
but,

580
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.300
but,
uh,
hormones can be proteins.

581
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.550
Endocrine hormones can be proteins,

582
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:14.100
meaning they're large molecules that are usually fairly water soluble or they

583
00:38:14.101 --> 00:38:17.850
can be steroids and steroids are small molecules,

584
00:38:17.851 --> 00:38:19.410
much smaller than proteins,

585
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.920
smaller molecules that tend to be hydrophobic or lipid soluble example of

586
00:38:25.491 --> 00:38:26.850
protein.
Hormones are insulin,

587
00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:30.330
which we've talked about before and Glucagon and growth hormone,

588
00:38:30.331 --> 00:38:34.550
which we haven't talked about,
but that's very important during,
uh,
during,
uh,

589
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.910
periods of lifelike adolescents.
For example,

590
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:41.480
when rapid growth of your bones is occurring,
um,

591
00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.850
well,
insulin is a protein.
It's produced by cells in the pancreas.

592
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:47.320
It circulates in your blood.

593
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.630
It can't enter cells because it's too big and it's too water soluble,

594
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.280
so it can't go through cell membranes.

595
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:59.380
And so interacts with receptors called insulin receptors that are on cells that

596
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:04.030
are sensitive to insulin,
steroid hormones.
On the other hand,

597
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.300
molecules like testosterone and estrogen,
progesterone,

598
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:11.940
the sex steroids that determine sexual characteristics,
um,

599
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.540
and,
um,
um,

600
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:18.570
are important for reproductive function are molecules that are all derived from

601
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:24.460
a similar source.
Many of them are drive,
drive from cholesterol and,

602
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.960
and they're hydrophobic,

603
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.530
which means they can penetrate through cell membranes.

604
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.990
So it doesn't need to bind to a receptor on the surface of the cell in order to

605
00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:38.260
work because the molecule can actually enter the cell directly.

606
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:42.760
Many steroid hormones act because they bind to cellulars two,

607
00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.310
two receptors that are deep within the cell,

608
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.950
often inside the nucleus.
And I'll show how that works in in just a moment.

609
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.790
But estrogen,
for example,
is one of those.
When estrogen is present,

610
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.260
it can enter cells in the vicinity and it can bind to receptors that are deep

611
00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:01.990
inside cells.
So this is a new concept,
right?

612
00:40:01.991 --> 00:40:04.900
Receptors don't have to be these molecules on the cell surface.

613
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.670
There can be receptors that exist in other places within the cell.

614
00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:13.230
For example,
uh,

615
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.290
go a little bit further with this schematic and talking about what insulin does

616
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.020
and um,
and you know about this,

617
00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:22.690
but maybe you haven't thought about it at this level of detail,

618
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.280
but you know that when you,
after you eat,
you eat lunch,
for example,
after class,

619
00:40:27.281 --> 00:40:31.180
you're going to go to lunch,
you're going to eat whatever you eat.

620
00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:33.280
But hopefully it's not a snickers bar.

621
00:40:33.281 --> 00:40:37.390
But let's assume it is a snickers bar and your blood glucose is going to rise

622
00:40:37.391 --> 00:40:40.840
because you've taken a lot of sugar in a,
when it does,

623
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.200
your pancreas receives a signal that your blood glucose has started to go up and

624
00:40:47.021 --> 00:40:48.160
it will secrete insulin.

625
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:53.550
So there are cells in your pancreas which recognize glucose levels and they

626
00:40:54.311 --> 00:40:58.660
secrete insulin in response.
And when they do that,

627
00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.710
this insulin then starts to circulate throughout the blood.
And if you measured,

628
00:41:02.711 --> 00:41:05.950
if somebody measured levels of insulin in your blood after lunch,

629
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:09.130
if they took it 10 minutes,
30 minutes,
an hour,

630
00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:14.020
you would see that it's going slowly up as it's going up.
It's be,

631
00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.670
it's circulating around your body.

632
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.030
And most cells in your body have insulin receptors.

633
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.710
So insulin is starting to bind to insulin receptors on those cells.

634
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:27.070
And when it does,
it makes biochemical changes inside the cells.

635
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:32.310
And one of the things it does is include increased glucose uptake into certain

636
00:41:32.411 --> 00:41:37.160
kinds of sales fat cells and muscle cells.
Well,
why does it,

637
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.520
why does it increase uptake of glucose into muscle cells?

638
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.730
Because muscle,
uh,

639
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.700
can use and frequently is using glucose as a source of energy.

640
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.250
And so when there is extra glucose,

641
00:41:49.251 --> 00:41:51.770
you want to put it into the cells that can use it immediately.

642
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:57.140
Why does it go into fat cells?
Because maybe you ate more Glyn's glucose,

643
00:41:57.141 --> 00:41:58.340
then you need immediately.

644
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:03.550
And so it goes into cells that can store glucose and that's what fat cells do.

645
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.430
They convert glucose into a form for storage.
Well,

646
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:11.270
how does glucose uptake get enhanced in those cells?

647
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:15.050
It gets enhanced because when insulin binds to the insulin receptor,

648
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:20.110
it activates the receptor.
How does it activate it?
It generates a foe,

649
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.930
a kinase activity,
which leads to phosphorylation of the protein.

650
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.610
So insulin binding leads to phosphorylation,

651
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.280
leads to other biochemical changes.

652
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:36.350
And eventually what happens is that glucose transport molecules,
which are,

653
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:37.130
uh,

654
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:42.020
which are expressed and stored inside the cell get shuttled up to the surface.

655
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:47.450
So the cells permeability to glucose goes up and more glucose can come in,

656
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.100
<v 1>right?</v>

657
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.260
<v 0>This is a highly simplified version,</v>

658
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:55.040
but sort of closes the loop on what we've been talking about.
Insulin,

659
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:56.990
the lie again,
binds to its receptor,

660
00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.010
creates a change through a kinase activity that's exposed,

661
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.010
which leads to other biochemical changes,

662
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.040
which leads to a change in cell behavior.
In this case,

663
00:43:07.041 --> 00:43:11.570
the cell behavior is that more glucose transporters are brought to the membrane

664
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.580
and more glucose can enter the cell.

665
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:16.250
<v 1>Okay,</v>

666
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:20.210
<v 0>that's makes sense.
Uh,
sometime after you've eaten,</v>

667
00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.240
so you had the snickers bar at lunchtime and you don't have time to get anything

668
00:43:23.241 --> 00:43:27.470
else,
uh,
to eat during the day,
your blood glucose level will go down.

669
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:31.910
Why does it go down?
Well,
one,
because you're not taking any more glucose in,

670
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.610
but the other,
because when you did eat glucose,

671
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.720
you've got more insulin and the glucose got shuttled into cells where it's

672
00:43:38.721 --> 00:43:42.650
either used or stored.
And so that brings your glucose level down.

673
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.520
Another,
um,
another,
uh,
um,

674
00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:47.770
<v 1>okay.</v>

675
00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:51.490
<v 0>Hormone gets produced by the Pancreas in response to low glucose levels.</v>

676
00:43:51.491 --> 00:43:54.280
It's called Glucagon and it has many of the,

677
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:57.760
of the opposite effects that insulin has.

678
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:01.690
So not only does insulin go down and stop these behaviors,

679
00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.720
but a new hormone called Glucagon gets produced,

680
00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.970
which reinforces that change,

681
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:08.743
<v 1>right?</v>

682
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:12.260
<v 0>And these you're going between these states throughout the day,</v>

683
00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.240
<v 1>right?</v>

684
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:14.751
<v 0>And the,</v>

685
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:19.751
and where your cells experience those states is through these extra cellular lie

686
00:44:20.881 --> 00:44:22.820
gans called insulin and Glucagon,

687
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:30.020
steroid hormones can operate in a different way because of their structure.

688
00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:32.460
They're small molecules,
they are lipid soluble,

689
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.640
they can go from extracellular to intracellular.

690
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:40.590
And let's take an example of,
of estrogen.
For example,

691
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:45.270
a small molecule gets produced by cells.
In one part of the body,

692
00:44:45.271 --> 00:44:48.240
circulates in the blood,
estrogen enters cells,

693
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.710
and sometimes that estrogen is able to penetrate deep within the cell,

694
00:44:52.711 --> 00:44:54.000
even into the nucleus.

695
00:44:55.110 --> 00:45:00.110
The receptor for estrogen is a special molecule called a DNA binding or um,

696
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.533
factor.

697
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:09.200
Estrogen can combine with this receptor to form a new sort of unit which

698
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:13.290
interacts with DNA.

699
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:15.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

700
00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.140
<v 0>When this bound receptor interacts with DNA,</v>

701
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.100
it could,
for example,
turn on expression of a target gene.

702
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.220
So one of the things that estrogen does when it,

703
00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:32.250
when cells are exposed to estrogen is that certain genes get turned on that

704
00:45:32.561 --> 00:45:36.190
weren't turned on in the estrogen free state.

705
00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:41.470
It leads to expression of new genes,
production of new proteins,

706
00:45:41.471 --> 00:45:43.330
and a change in the behavior of the cell.

707
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:49.260
So sometimes receptors when they interact with lye gans create changes in what

708
00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:54.040
proteins are actually being produced by the cell.

709
00:45:54.041 --> 00:45:56.830
And this is one very direct way,
uh,
for that to happen.

710
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.710
These kinds of molecules which uh,
which activate genes,

711
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.610
they are activating the process of transcription there sometimes called

712
00:46:06.611 --> 00:46:08.140
transcription factors.

713
00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:12.580
And this is an example of a transcription factor that is,
uh,

714
00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.600
that is itself activated or turned on by the presence of a steroid.

715
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:25.160
Okay.
That's the end of what I wanted to say today.
Well,

716
00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:27.450
we're going to talk about next time and I encourage you to,
to,

717
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.670
to read ahead because you'll see that there's a lot more detail in chapter six

718
00:46:30.671 --> 00:46:33.670
then what we're talking about here.
I've emphasized the main points,

719
00:46:33.671 --> 00:46:36.670
the ones that I think are important that are clearly important for your

720
00:46:36.671 --> 00:46:38.320
understanding.
We're going to take,

721
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.700
take these general topics and talk about how they work in the nervous system and

722
00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:44.080
the immune system.
Next time.
