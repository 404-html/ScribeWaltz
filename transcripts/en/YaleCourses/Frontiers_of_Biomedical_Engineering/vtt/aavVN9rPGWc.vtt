WEBVTT

1
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.950
So we're,

2
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.470
we're going to continue that discussion of cardiovascular physiology today in

3
00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:17.981
particular,

4
00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:22.210
pay attention to the heart and its role in creating the pressure that moves

5
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:24.640
blood throughout the circulatory system.

6
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.790
So I'm going to take a step back and let's review what we talked about at the

7
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:30.100
end and then we'll,
we'll get into the,

8
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.460
into the new material for today.

9
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.630
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.340
<v 0>Um,
so the heart is an element of the circulatory system.</v>

11
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.940
It's a critical element obviously.
Um,
and it,
it,

12
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:49.620
you can show it as in this picture in the center of the circulatory system where

13
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:54.030
its role is to supply the pressure drop that moves blood through what's called

14
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:59.031
the systemic circulation or the circulation to all of the tissues in the body.

15
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:02.670
The circulation of oxygen,
rich blood to all the tissues in the body,

16
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:07.080
flowing from the aorta through arteries,
through arterials,
capillaries,

17
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
collecting vein,
Ya'lls back to veins,
back to the heart.

18
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.930
And the second circulatory system,
the pulmonary circulatory system,

19
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:20.931
which sends deoxygenated or oxygen poor blood through the lungs,

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.410
through the pulmonary artery,
arterials,
capillaries,

21
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.970
veins back through the back,
through the pulmonary vein,
uh,

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.560
to the left side of the heart.

23
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.880
And so one can think about the heart as to functioning units that are coupled in

24
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:41.610
some way.

25
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.730
And we're going to see that there coupled in almost every way that they're

26
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:49.140
coupled because the output from one side of the heart is the input to the other

27
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:50.970
side,
right?

28
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.090
The output from the left side of the heart goes through this circuit and then

29
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:55.410
back to the right side,

30
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.530
the output from the right side goes through this circuit and then back to the

31
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:02.670
left side.
So they're coupled and there are also coupled because it's one organ.

32
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.930
And so when this Oregon,
uh,
performs its function,

33
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:11.370
which is contraction,
uh,
these things are happening simultaneously,
right?

34
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:14.700
Because it's one individual Oregon that's accomplishing it.

35
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.690
<v 0>We talked briefly about the anatomy of the heart and I brought a model of the</v>

37
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:24.850
heart here,
larger than actual size,
uh,
but with,

38
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.960
and so it's not like a real heart in that way.

39
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:29.900
It's also not like a real heart because you can open it up and take a look

40
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:31.610
inside.
And uh,

41
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.910
so I'm going to bring this to section if you want to look at it or you can come

42
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:36.440
up and look at it after class.

43
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.360
But to illustrate some of the features that are shown in this cartoon that,
um,

44
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.930
there's a difference in the muscular,
uh,

45
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.800
walls that the left side of the heart has a thicker muscle than the right side

46
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.240
of the heart and that,
um,

47
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.640
there are vessels on the surface of the heart.

48
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.520
So vessels that come off of the aorta,
for example,

49
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:02.650
the red here that served the myocardium or the surface of the heart and supply

50
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:03.940
it with oxygen,

51
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.780
that the right and left side of the heart is divided into two chambers.

52
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:11.230
On the left side there's the left ventricle and the left atrium above it,

53
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.080
right ventricle,
right atrium above it.

54
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.830
<v 0>And if you look inside,</v>

56
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:22.780
there are valves that guard the entrance is between these compartments.

57
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.760
So there's a valve and going from the right atrium to the right ventricle.

58
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.683
<v 1>Okay,</v>

59
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.090
<v 0>I'm just going to put all the names up on the,
um,</v>

60
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.210
there's a valve than going from the right atrium,

61
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.200
right atrium to the right ventral,
and that's called the tricuspid valve.

62
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.250
There's a valve in going from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery,

63
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:48.460
and that's called the pulmonary valve.
Um,

64
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.310
you can't see it very well here,
but it's up here.

65
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.200
There's a valve and going from the left atrium into the left ventricle,

66
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.760
and that's called the mitral valve.

67
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.910
And a valve in going from the left atrium into the aorta.

68
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.450
And that's called the aortic valve.
Okay.
So there's four valves,
uh,

69
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.810
that are important and they guard the entrances.

70
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.150
And one of the key things we're going to talk about today is the function of

71
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:12.790
these valves in producing a flow.

72
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.950
So you know that the heart functions,
it creates pressure by,
uh,
by,
by beating,

73
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:22.280
by contracting,
right?
It beats and how his pressure generated,
uh,

74
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.080
when that happens,
you know that blood moves,

75
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:27.940
blood flows because of a pressure drop.

76
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.180
And we talked last time about the regulation ship between a pressure drop and a

77
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:37.450
flow.
So wherever there's a pressure drop,
if there's the possibility of flow,

78
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.380
there's some resistance to that flow and a certain amount of flow is created,

79
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.410
which depends on the resistance.
Resistance goes up,

80
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.550
flow goes down for fixed pressure drop resistance goes down,

81
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:50.430
flow goes up for a fixed pressure drops.

82
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:53.110
So the pressure drop is what creates the flow.

83
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.410
You also know that pressure varies with volume.

84
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.440
If I have a container that contains a liquid or a gas and I compressed the

85
00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:07.370
container,
the pressure goes up inside.
Why is that?

86
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.920
Why does pressure go up?
As volume goes down,

87
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.090
the most simple system to think about is,

88
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.850
is an ideal gas,
right?
In an ideal gas law,

89
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.390
PV equals NRT,
right?

90
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.390
In an ideal gas pressure times the volume

91
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.490
equals n.
R.
T.
If,
if temperature,

92
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.030
the gas constant and the number of molecules are constant,

93
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.500
then when pressure goes up,
volume has to go down,
right?

94
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.670
Volume goes down,
pressure goes up.
Why is that?
What's happening inside

95
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.273
<v 1>Brian?</v>

96
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.663
Right,

97
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 0>exactly.
So,
so the molecules are closer together,
closer to the walls.</v>

98
00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:01.670
The for force of pressure is created by collisions and the molecules with the

99
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.280
walls.
This is a very simple description obviously,

100
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.250
but you can imagine as the volume goes down,
then the pressure goes up.

101
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.390
More molecules bouncing against the walls and creating pressure.

102
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.850
Same thing happens in a liquid only in a liquid.
That change is not so dramatic,

103
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.070
right?
As in,
as in an ideal gas in general,

104
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.670
liquids are considered to be incompressible or you're not pushing their

105
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:27.140
molecules closer together.
Uh,
so much because they're,
it's a condensed fluid,

106
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.830
but pressure still varies with volume.
And the same way you can't describe it,

107
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:34.790
but by this equation anymore because this only applies for ideal gases.

108
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.450
But the same thing is true that when volume goes down,

109
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.320
the volume and the number of molecules is fixed,
then the pressure goes up,

110
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.380
right?
And so,
uh,

111
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:48.860
another way of thinking about it that is far less scientific is because

112
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:51.410
everybody's seen star wars,
right?
Not the,

113
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.480
not the later imitation star wars,
but the first one,

114
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.910
right?
Where Luke Skywalker gets trapped with,
uh,
somebody,

115
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:05.480
I forget even who get trapped in,
in this,
in this room,
in this garbage dump,

116
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:09.860
and the walls start coming in and as the walls start coming in,
uh,

117
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.690
he gets more and more urgent about getting out right?
As pressure is going up,

118
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:16.950
as the volume is going down and the pressure to get out,

119
00:07:16.951 --> 00:07:20.420
it gets higher and higher.
It's the same kind of thing here,
right?

120
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.640
Volume is decreasing.
Pressure goes up

121
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.510
when the heart beats or contracts,
it decreases the volume of these chambers.

122
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.370
When the muscle contracts,
it decreases the volume of the chambers inside.

123
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.970
The volume of the chambers goes down and there's blood inside and that blood

124
00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:44.720
gets squeezed as the pressure.
As the volume goes down,
the pressure goes up.

125
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.700
Okay?
So that's how pressure is generated.
Why do you need valves?

126
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.170
Why?
Why are valid is important and the function of the heart,

127
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.530
and I already alluded to the fact that that your heart cannot function properly

128
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:04.400
without valves that are acting correctly.
So why do you need a valve?

129
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.530
We'll imagine that you had a simpler system than your heart.

130
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:14.280
You had a balloon that was attached to a garden hose and,

131
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.540
and the whole thing was filled with water.
And so if I,

132
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:19.640
if I decrease the volume of the balloon,

133
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.750
the pressure and the balloon goes up and water goes out the garden hose,
right?

134
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.850
If I decreased the volume,
right?
What if I expand it again?

135
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.583
Well then the,

136
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.120
then the pressure goes down inside the garden hose and all the water gets sucked

137
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:35.954
back in.

138
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.470
So you can imagine if you had a water hose that a garden hose that was hooked up

139
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:43.520
to a reservoir and a balloon on one end and you inflated it and deflated it

140
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:44.900
inflated and deflated it,

141
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:49.250
you'd be pushing water out and pulling it in and it would go back and forth in

142
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:50.084
this way.

143
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.130
And if you're increasing and decreasing the volume by the same amount,

144
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.500
she'd be pushing out a volume of water and pulling it back in.

145
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.810
Right now that's a kind of a flow,

146
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.210
but it's not the continuous one directional kind of flow that we have in our

147
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:08.760
circulatory systems.
Right?
That would be,

148
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.080
you could imagine a circulatory system that's based on that where you have a

149
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:16.680
heart that pushes blood out and then sucks it back in and pushes it out and

150
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.850
sucks it back in.
But that's not the way that that the human heart functions.

151
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.040
In order to get blood flowing in one direction,
you push the blood out,

152
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.020
you close a gate and then when you're reinflating the heart,

153
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.430
the blood can't come back.

154
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

155
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.470
<v 0>So the function of these valves is to,</v>

156
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.770
to prevent that reverse flow of blood back into the heart when it's relaxing or

157
00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:43.910
increasing its volume.

158
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:45.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

159
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.760
<v 0>So the basic function of the heart is to contract,
decrease its volume,</v>

160
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.810
increase the pressure blood goes out,

161
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.210
valve closes,

162
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.640
preventing blood from coming back into the chamber that just ejected the blood

163
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.170
and then that chamber relaxes and goes back to its original volume.

164
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.130
<v 1>Okay?</v>

165
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.040
<v 0>That's the basic function of the heart and we're going to spend the rest of the</v>

166
00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:14.800
time talking about the details of how that happens,

167
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:20.140
but she's clear why valves are necessary part of that cycle.

168
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.373
<v 1>Okay?</v>

169
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.770
<v 0>Pressure varies throughout the circulatory system.</v>

170
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.460
If pressure's indeed generated in the heart,
as I said,

171
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.300
then you would expect the highest pressures to be in the regions that are

172
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:37.720
closest to the heart.
So if I measured pressure in the aorta,

173
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.270
and we talked about this last time,

174
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.450
you would find that pressure varies with time,
right?

175
00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:47.860
Because pressure's going up and down in the heart that that oscillation in

176
00:10:47.861 --> 00:10:50.680
pressure with heartbeat gets transmitted into the aorta as well.

177
00:10:50.681 --> 00:10:54.910
And we'll talk in a minute about why that happens.
But if you looked over time,

178
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:59.320
an average pressure in the aorta would be somewhere between 120 and 80

179
00:10:59.321 --> 00:11:02.440
millimeters of mercury.
So let's just call it 90 here.

180
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:07.780
So the pressure in the aorta is 90 now if you think about the whole circuit,

181
00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:08.620
right?

182
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:12.910
This blood has to flow from the aorta through the systemic circulation and back

183
00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:16.540
into the right atrium and the right atrium.

184
00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:21.250
It's at the end of its journey and that pressure there is approximately zero.

185
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.053
<v 1>Bless you.</v>

186
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.480
<v 0>So the pressure drop that's driving blood through the systemic circulatory</v>

187
00:11:28.481 --> 00:11:32.290
system is Delta p of 90 minus zero.

188
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.383
<v 1>All right.</v>

189
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.720
<v 0>The pressure that's generated here gets used completely in driving the flow</v>

190
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.480
around.
And if I looked at intermediate positions,

191
00:11:42.481 --> 00:11:45.480
I'd find that if I looked in the arterials,

192
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.360
the pressures about 35 millimeters of mercury.

193
00:11:48.361 --> 00:11:53.160
So the pressure drop from here to here is a 55 millimeters of mercury.

194
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.370
The pressure drop from the arterioles to the vein Ewells is about 20 millimeters

195
00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:58.180
of mercury.

196
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:03.180
And from the venules back to the right atrium is 15 minus zero or a 15

197
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:05.110
millimeters of mercury,

198
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.823
<v 1>right?</v>

199
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.170
<v 0>So pressure drops throughout the circulatory system.</v>

200
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.790
If you look on the pulmonary side,
you'll find the same phenomenon,

201
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.040
but in general,
the pressures are lower.

202
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:18.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.440
<v 0>The pressure in the pulmonary artery is only about 15 millimeters of mercury</v>

204
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.120
dropping to about six millimeters of mercury in the capillaries where oxygen

205
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:31.260
exchange occurs,
dropping back to zero.
When you get to the,
uh,

206
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.240
to the left atrium.

207
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.190
So what does that tell you about the pulmonary circulation compared to the

208
00:12:38.191 --> 00:12:39.420
systemic circulation?

209
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.670
The pressure drop across the systemic circulation is 90 millimeters of mercury

210
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.910
across the pulmonary circulation is 15 millimeters of mercury.

211
00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:52.290
What does that tell you about the pulmonary circulation in comparison to the

212
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.910
systemic circulation?

213
00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.973
<v 1>Justin</v>

214
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.540
<v 0>flows not as fast.
Is that true?</v>

215
00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

216
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:09.323
<v 0>What do you think?</v>

217
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.643
<v 1>Okay,</v>

218
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.430
<v 0>so what's the,
what's the flow through the aorta?</v>

219
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.223
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

220
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.230
<v 0>it's,
it's five liters per minute.
And I think that was a good answer.</v>

221
00:13:24.231 --> 00:13:28.070
The flow might be not as fast because there's not as much of a pressure drop.

222
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.890
But we know because this is an interconnected system,

223
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:35.030
that the flow is actually five liters per minute at every cross,

224
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.750
every location in the circulatory system.
Right.
It's a continuous circuit.

225
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.880
So the flow has to be the same everywhere.

226
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:42.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

227
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.440
<v 0>So Justin's answer was one possibility and it's a good one,</v>

228
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.710
but that doesn't work in this connected kind of a system.

229
00:13:49.711 --> 00:13:52.350
So then if the flow is the same,
what has to be different?

230
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.433
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

231
00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.353
<v 0>I'm sorry Naomi.</v>

232
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

233
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:04.590
<v 0>It doesn't have to go to the rest of the body,</v>

234
00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:07.740
so it doesn't have to generate as much pressure.
So yeah.

235
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.390
So you're on the right track.

236
00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:12.480
So what does that tell you in terms of the numbers you were dealing with on your

237
00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:17.260
homework?
Which system has a higher resistance?

238
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.890
The systemic system has a higher resistance because it takes a higher pressure

239
00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:30.290
drop in order to create the same flow.
So the systemic sit,

240
00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:34.200
sit circulation has a higher resistance in the pulmonary circulation,

241
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:38.820
high resistance,
high pressure circuit,
low resistance,
low pressure circuit.

242
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.920
And there's consequences of that.
Right.

243
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:44.580
And it sort of makes sense now that you've done your homework problem for this

244
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:44.850
week,

245
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.420
that the resistance to the pulmonary system would be less because you don't have

246
00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:52.250
so far to travel,
right.
The,
the blood have so far to travel,

247
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:56.090
so the length is much less.
You don't have to push the blood is far.

248
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.390
It doesn't have to go up to your head and down to your toes.

249
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.740
And so less overall resistance and because it has less resistance,

250
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:06.710
you don't need as much pressure drop because you don't need as much pressure

251
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:08.270
drop.
You don't need it as much muscle.

252
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.580
I don't need to generate as high a pressure.

253
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.050
So the right side has less muscle mass than the left side.

254
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.010
And the reason for more muscle mass on the lesson is to create the higher

255
00:15:20.011 --> 00:15:22.980
pressure that's needed to drive this high resistance circuit.

256
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.163
<v 1>Right.</v>

257
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:32.500
<v 0>This diagram shows you the events in what's called the cardiac cycle.</v>

258
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.100
The cardiac cycle is this rhythmic movement that we call a heartbeat and it goes

259
00:15:39.851 --> 00:15:44.020
through a very systematic,
uh,
cycle.
It's a cycle.

260
00:15:44.021 --> 00:15:46.150
So you could start and end ended anywhere.

261
00:15:46.151 --> 00:15:50.620
We're going to start in this region of the cycle that's called late diastole and

262
00:15:50.621 --> 00:15:53.170
diastole is the relaxation phase.

263
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.110
Diastole is the relaxation phase.

264
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.590
Systally is the contraction phase.

265
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.750
So in late diastole,

266
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:06.640
that's the moment right before the beat starts or the contraction starts,

267
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.180
and in late diastole,
look at the situation here.

268
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.350
There's blood flowing back into the atria coming from the circulation that's

269
00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:17.170
driven by the pressure created by the last heartbeat.

270
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.810
And there's some,
there's some,
uh,

271
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.160
blood moving from the atrium into the ventricle.

272
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.350
And that's true because this valve,
the mitral valve is open.

273
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:30.850
<v 1>Okay?</v>

274
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.050
<v 0>The mitral valve is open,</v>

275
00:16:32.051 --> 00:16:36.160
so blood is flowing back to the left atrium and back into the left ventricle.

276
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.670
The heart is relaxed.
It's passively flowing into the heart.

277
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:41.060
<v 1>Okay?</v>

278
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.910
<v 0>Right at the beginning of contraction.</v>

279
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.890
Another word for contraction is systally diastole.
Systally.

280
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.740
Now the heart starts to contract,

281
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.440
but one region of the heart starts to contract first.

282
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.600
The contraction occurs in an orderly fashion.

283
00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:00.710
It starts in the atria and it moves to the ventricles.
So first,

284
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:05.450
the Atrium contract there.
If you look at this,
they are not very muscular.

285
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.600
They have muscles,
but they're not anything like the ventricle.

286
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.350
So you can think of it as a weaker muscle than the ventricle is,

287
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.450
but it contracts first and when it can tracks,
the volume decreases,

288
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.530
it increases the pressure inside the atrium and more blood starts flowing from

289
00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:22.880
the atrium into the ventricle,

290
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:24.940
<v 1>right?</v>

291
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.000
<v 0>More blood starts flowing from the atrium into the ventricle.
So what happens,</v>

292
00:17:28.001 --> 00:17:32.110
this contraction decreases.
The volume,
increases the pressure,

293
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.590
increases the pressure drop between the Atrium and the ventricle and more blood

294
00:17:35.591 --> 00:17:38.920
gets,
uh,
gets,
uh,
gets flows into the ventricle.

295
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.420
Now the contraction moves to the ventricle,
the ventricle starts to contract.

296
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:46.450
And when it contracts,
the pressure starts going up inside.

297
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.160
When the pressure goes up inside the mitral closes,

298
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.650
that's important cause you don't want blood to flow back into the Atrium and

299
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:58.830
back into the,
uh,
into the pulmonary vein.

300
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:04.040
So the mitral valve closes and this contraction starts in during,

301
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.320
in a period called ISO volume metric contraction.

302
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.430
And this ISO volume metric contraction means that both of the entrances,

303
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.540
both the entrance and the exit into the ventricle or closed the mitral valve is

304
00:18:15.541 --> 00:18:19.590
closed.
The aortic valve is closed,
contraction is proceeding.

305
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.600
So the volume is decreased as trying to decrease,
but it can't.

306
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.800
So the pressure goes up

307
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.310
right during contraction to the point where the aortic valve opens.

308
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.840
Now this is pressurized blood,
which is ejected

309
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:43.230
pressurized blood,
which is ejected through the aorta,
flow through the aorta,

310
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.030
and then,
uh,
and then the aortic valve closes again when diastole is complete.

311
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.200
So just focus on what's happening on the left side.

312
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.810
The right side is doing the same thing,
but just at lower pressures,
right?

313
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.080
Sisterly Begins Atria contracts,

314
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:04.560
blood flows into the ventricle,
ventricle contracts,

315
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.620
both the doors are closed,
the valves are closed,

316
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:12.570
pressure gets higher pressures,
and then eventually the aortic valve opens.

317
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.333
And you get this,

318
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:19.610
this event called ventricular ejection where a volume of blood bursts out of the

319
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.370
ventricle into the aorta.

320
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.780
The aortic valve closes again and the cycle repeats itself,

321
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.223
<v 1>right?</v>

322
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.470
<v 0>So this is a schematic diagram to show you sort of the sequence of events,</v>

323
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:42.930
contraction and valve activity that lead to the forward surge of blood.

324
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:48.770
The amount of blood that is ejected from the left ventricle on each cycle is

325
00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:50.550
called the ejection volume.

326
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.860
If you took the ejection volume and multiplied it by the heart rate,

327
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.680
you get the cardiac output,
right?

328
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.250
So the ejection volume or the volume of blood

329
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.510
that's,
that's um,

330
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.740
that's ejected from the ventricle on each beat times the heart rate is equal to

331
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:19.140
that cardiac output,
right?
You know,
this is five,
um,

332
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.220
five approximately at rest,
five liters per minute.

333
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.950
If you assume that your cardiac output while you're sitting there is five liters

334
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:32.190
permitted and you put your finger on your pulse and measure your heart rate,

335
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.140
then you could calculate approximately how much blood is being ejected from the

336
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:38.610
ventricle with each beat.

337
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.223
<v 1>All right.</v>

338
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.950
<v 0>So let's think about that same kind thing and more detailed what we really track</v>

339
00:20:48.951 --> 00:20:53.350
the pressures because it turns out that following the pressures and thinking

340
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:55.750
about what's happening in the chambers and the valves,

341
00:20:55.751 --> 00:21:00.751
you can get fairly complete picture of the physics of how cardiac ejection

342
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.570
occurs.
And so this diagram is,
it's,

343
00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:09.070
it's in the powerpoints and uh,
but it's a little hard to see,
I think on the,

344
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:13.610
on the projection.
So I redrew it down here in color.
Uh,

345
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.860
but what it shows is pressure from zero to one 20.

346
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:19.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

347
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.690
<v 0>Right.
As a function of time during the cardiac cycle.
So I didn't,</v>

348
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.450
I didn't write any time units on here,

349
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:30.451
but this is time progressing and this shows you two beats of the heart.

350
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.560
And the most prominent thing that you notice is the Green Line here,

351
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.390
which shows pressure in the,
did I erase it and the ventricle,

352
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.540
which ventricle am I showing?

353
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.293
<v 1>Okay.</v>

354
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.630
<v 0>How would you tell,
I said they're both,</v>

355
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.180
both roughly the same,

356
00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:56.700
but how would you tell if this was the left or the right ventricle?

357
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.560
The total pressure and the pressure's high,
right?

358
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:10.730
It's so this must be the left ventricle because it's,
it's,

359
00:22:10.731 --> 00:22:13.380
it's reaching about 90 millimeters of mercury.

360
00:22:13.381 --> 00:22:16.020
The pressure you need to drive the systemic circulation.
This isn't,

361
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.850
this is emptied,
the left,
the left ventricle,
and it's the left atrium.

362
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:24.740
You could have also noticed,
this is the aorta I'm going to show you here.
So,
um,

363
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.320
if I'm showing the unit,
it must be the left side of the,
of the heart.

364
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.650
But the first thing you notice is this big bump in pressure.

365
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.660
This is the trace for the ventricle.

366
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:37.590
If I had a pressure sensor in the ventricle and I was measuring how pressure

367
00:22:37.591 --> 00:22:40.470
changed as a function of,
of a time,

368
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.840
I would measure what you see on this Green Line here.

369
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.990
And pressure starts off fairly low and then goes up to 120 millimeters of

370
00:22:49.231 --> 00:22:54.210
mercury and goes back down again up to 120 millimeters mercury down.
Again,

371
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.120
this is the trace for the atrium on the bottom here,

372
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.530
you'll notice that the pressure in the atrium doesn't go through these big

373
00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:03.630
excursions that the ventricle does.

374
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:08.040
And that's because the atrium is not a powerful pump,
right?

375
00:23:08.041 --> 00:23:10.500
It's not a powerful,
uh,
muscle.

376
00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:15.620
And so it only generates a little bit of pressure when it contracts and the role

377
00:23:15.751 --> 00:23:20.400
of the Atrium is to contract to basically fill up the ventricle so that when the

378
00:23:20.401 --> 00:23:23.100
ventricle goes through its massive contraction,

379
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.200
it's as full of blood as it can be.

380
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.580
So the Atrium gives a little beat in order to push whatever blood is in it into

381
00:23:32.581 --> 00:23:34.440
the ventricle,
doesn't have to go very far,

382
00:23:34.441 --> 00:23:39.300
so you don't need so much pressure and fill up the ventricles so that when the

383
00:23:39.301 --> 00:23:40.440
ventricle contracts,

384
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:45.000
you get as much ejection of blood as possible.

385
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.820
The biggest volume injected possible.

386
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.430
If I looked at the difference in pressures between the Atrium and the ventricle

387
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.120
at this point here and this point here where I'm starting is late in diastole,

388
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.960
remember what was happening late in diastole was that blood is flowing from the

389
00:24:05.301 --> 00:24:09.050
left atrium into the left ventricle and the mitral valve is open.

390
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.480
And that's what you see here.

391
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:14.780
The pressure is slightly higher in the atrium than it is in the ventricle.

392
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.620
So if I looked at the pressure drop at this point,
Delta p is moot.
It's Po,

393
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.000
it's,

394
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.050
it's higher in the atrium that it is in the ventricle and so blood is naturally

395
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:24.920
flowing that way,

396
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:30.170
but that only happens if the mitral valve is open

397
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.710
and it is at this point the mitral valve is open during diastole.

398
00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:39.743
<v 1>Okay.</v>

399
00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:41.430
<v 0>The atrium contracts,</v>

400
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.870
you see the little bump of pressure created by the Atrium contraction and then

401
00:24:45.871 --> 00:24:48.960
the ventricle contracts,
so this is the start of systally

402
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.340
right here where the contraction of the Atrium starts is the beginning of the

403
00:24:56.341 --> 00:24:58.290
heartbeat.
What happens,

404
00:24:58.291 --> 00:25:01.650
the atrium contracts pressure stays higher in the atrium that it is in the

405
00:25:01.651 --> 00:25:05.520
ventricle and so blood is flowing from the atrium into the ventricle and then

406
00:25:05.521 --> 00:25:07.530
all of a sudden the ventricle starts contracting.

407
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:09.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

408
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.580
<v 0>The ventricle has a bigger contraction,
right.
More muscle.</v>

409
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.370
So it's going to generate more pressure at some point,

410
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.530
very shortly after it starts to contract,

411
00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:22.000
the pressure in the ventricle becomes higher than the pressure in the atrium.

412
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

413
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.180
<v 0>When the pressure in the ventricle becomes higher than the pressure in the</v>

414
00:25:28.181 --> 00:25:32.290
atrium,
the valve between them,
the mitral valve closes.

415
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:33.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

416
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.700
<v 0>And it closes strictly due to the fact,</v>

417
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.830
well there it closes for a number of reasons,

418
00:25:37.831 --> 00:25:41.190
but one of the reasons that closes because there's more pressure here now than

419
00:25:41.191 --> 00:25:43.890
there is here and it slams the door shut.

420
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:46.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

421
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.590
<v 0>It's a one way valve.
When pressure becomes higher in the ventricle,</v>

422
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:53.060
in the atrium,
the valve closes.
Okay,

423
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.900
so at this point here where the lines cross,

424
00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.840
this is the mitral valve closing.

425
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:06.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

426
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:11.360
<v 0>What's happening at the other,
at,
at the exit?
Well,</v>

427
00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:15.290
the aorta is this,
the pressure in the aorta is this orange line here.

428
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.830
The pressure in the aorta is high.
Why is the pressure in the aorta high?

429
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.820
Because it was filled up with blood from the last heartbeat.

430
00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:26.190
It was,
it,
it was,

431
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.360
this blood was ejected into the aorta at high pressure.

432
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.910
That pressure stays there from the last heartbeat.

433
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:34.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

434
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:39.420
<v 0>Now why does it do that?
Because the aortic valve is closed</v>

435
00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:45.060
during,
um,
during diastole.

436
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:46.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

437
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.390
<v 0>The aortic valve is closed and that means that the pressure that was generated</v>

438
00:26:50.391 --> 00:26:53.810
stays high in the aorta,
even as the ventricle is relaxing.

439
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:55.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

440
00:26:55.810 --> 00:27:00.010
<v 0>The blood can't get sucked back from the aorta into the ventricle because at</v>

441
00:27:00.011 --> 00:27:02.320
this point the aortic valve is closed.

442
00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

443
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.830
<v 0>When the mitral valve closes,</v>

444
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:16.100
<v 1>okay.</v>

445
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:20.180
<v 0>When the mitral valve closes,
the aortic valve is already closed.</v>

446
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.520
That means the ventricle is sealed off,

447
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.053
<v 1>right?</v>

448
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:29.550
<v 0>That's what I showed you in the diagram here.
Uh,
right after atrial systally.</v>

449
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.570
<v 1>Okay.</v>

450
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.250
<v 0>Both valves are closed and the ventricle is contracting because both valves are</v>

451
00:27:35.251 --> 00:27:38.760
closed and the ventricle is contracting.
We have,
uh,

452
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:43.680
we have the Luke Skywalker situation where pressure starts to rise dramatically

453
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.690
inside the closed chamber.

454
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.300
Eventually that pressure is gonna rise high enough that the pressure in the

455
00:27:53.301 --> 00:27:57.200
ventricle crosses over the pressure in the aorta

456
00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.470
and at this point,
what happens?

457
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

458
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.080
<v 0>The aortic valve opens.</v>

459
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:10.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

460
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.900
<v 0>At this point,
the aortic valve opens.</v>

461
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:15.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

462
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.560
<v 0>And blood can be ejected from the ventricle into the aorta.</v>

463
00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.550
Now that's the only path for the blood to go because the mitral valve is still

464
00:28:22.551 --> 00:28:26.630
closed and the mitral valve is still closed because the pressure in the

465
00:28:26.631 --> 00:28:29.030
ventricle is still much higher than it is in the atrium.

466
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

467
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.680
<v 0>So what this diagram shows you is a couple of different things.</v>

468
00:28:33.681 --> 00:28:37.250
It shows you pressure in each of the chambers thinking about the chamber,

469
00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:38.930
the atrium,
the ventricle,
the aorta,

470
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.530
and depending on where one pressure sits with respect to the other,

471
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.130
if the pressure in the ventricle is higher than the pressure in the aorta than

472
00:28:49.131 --> 00:28:50.210
the aortic valve is open.

473
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.330
<v 1>Okay?</v>

474
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.440
<v 0>If it's the other way,</v>

475
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.620
the aortic valve is closed and the same thing with the ventricle and the uh,

476
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.820
and the atrium.
The ethnic valve opens here,

477
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.660
contraction continues and this is the active phase of ejection,

478
00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.110
which is shown in the diagram here.
Mitral valve closed,

479
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:10.560
aortic valve open pressure high here,
pressure lower here.

480
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.720
So blood is ejected from the heart.

481
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.210
The muscle eventually starts to relax.
Contraction is complete.

482
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:24.080
The ventricle starts relaxing when the ventricular pressure passes.

483
00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

484
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:30.900
<v 0>Through this point and drops below the aortic pressure than the aortic valve</v>

485
00:29:30.901 --> 00:29:31.734
closes.

486
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:38.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

487
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:42.010
<v 0>When the ventricular pressure at the ventricle continues relax,</v>

488
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.190
eventually it falls even below the pressure in the atrium and the um,

489
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.570
and the mitral valve opens.

490
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

491
00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.360
<v 0>And the ventricle begins refilling for the next,
for the next contraction.</v>

492
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:02.620
<v 1>All right,</v>

493
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:09.970
<v 0>this makes sense.
So it's this,
this diagram,
if you understand this diagram,</v>

494
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:14.770
then you understand the biophysics of of pressure generation and flow generation

495
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:17.530
by the heart.
It's a little bit hard to grasp all at once,

496
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:20.430
but if you walk through it in the way that I showed you a,

497
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.390
then I think you'll begin to understand it.

498
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.050
And another way to understand it is to look at this diagram.

499
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.000
I've shown it a little bit more clearly here.

500
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.860
The mitral valve closing aortic valve opening I Arctic valve closing,

501
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.510
mitral valve reopening.

502
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.910
And if you can follow the pressures and keep this diagram in mind,

503
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.020
why those valves open at the times they do make sense.

504
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.190
All right.
And the fact that they opened in the sequence,

505
00:30:48.191 --> 00:30:53.191
they do allow the heart to undergo a cyclic contraction and relaxation,

506
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.860
which results in a net forward flow of blood.

507
00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.403
<v 1>Right?</v>

508
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.900
<v 0>This shows just where,
uh,
the,
uh,</v>

509
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.130
active contraction of systally and diastally fall on this curve.

510
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:13.390
Sisterly begins when the Atrium begins to contract atrium contracts,

511
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:14.890
ventricle contracts,

512
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.600
systally ends here and the ventricle starts to relax at that point.

513
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.410
And that's diastole.
Early Diastole,

514
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:27.400
the ventricle is still relaxing late diastole.

515
00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.030
Everything is fully relaxed and prepared for the next heartbeat.

516
00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:32.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

517
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:37.010
<v 0>What's the time of this whole sequence?
Well,
how fast,
what's a heart rate?</v>

518
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.070
You know,
60 to 70 beats per minute.

519
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:42.950
So this whole sequence here takes about a second.

520
00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:45.103
<v 1>All right.</v>

521
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:50.230
<v 0>Athletes,
it's well known training,
uh,</v>

522
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:54.330
can decrease your heart rate.
What does that tell you?

523
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.860
Uh,
do athletes need less blood flow?

524
00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

525
00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.990
<v 0>No,
they need about the same blood flow,
but they have a higher ejection volume,</v>

526
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.960
so their,
their heart is operating very efficiently,

527
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:12.770
ejecting more volume per beat,

528
00:32:12.771 --> 00:32:16.040
and so they need less beats to supply that cardiac output.

529
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.330
There are other changes that occur during training as well.
It's not,

530
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.180
that's not the only thing,
but that's one thing that certainly occurs.

531
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:32.030
And as you become more cardiovascular,
as your cardiovascular fitness increases,

532
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.760
you can,
what happens when you start to exercise,

533
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.900
two things happen when you start to exercise.
One is your heart rate goes,

534
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.890
the second is your heart starts beating with more force.

535
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:49.210
So both the heart rate and the ejection volume go up in order to create more

536
00:32:49.401 --> 00:32:53.230
cardiac output.
A conditioned athlete,
uh,

537
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.970
we'll be able to do both of those very efficiently.

538
00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:00.080
And so they can create a higher cardiac output with less work from the heart.

539
00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:01.890
<v 1>Right?</v>

540
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:06.030
<v 0>And that's why with conditioning and training,
you can start to be,
uh,</v>

541
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.020
you know more,

542
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:10.110
your performance will be enhanced even though your heart rate might not go up as

543
00:33:10.111 --> 00:33:13.080
someone who,
who is out of a condition.

544
00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.073
<v 1>Right?</v>

545
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:21.620
<v 0>This is just another picture of the cardiac cycle where now I've,</v>

546
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.400
I've sort of combined everything together so that you can see this pressure

547
00:33:25.401 --> 00:33:30.050
curve here,
the pressure curve for the aorta,
for the ventricle,

548
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.900
for the atrium.
And you can,
uh,

549
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:37.010
you can visually correlate that with what's happening in each event.

550
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.300
Late diastole,

551
00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:43.490
all the muscles are relaxed and blood is passively flowing back into the left

552
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:47.600
atrium and the,
and through the mitral valve,
which is open to the left ventricle.

553
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:52.040
When contraction begins first in the atrium,

554
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:56.030
blood is pumped into the ventricle.

555
00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:01.150
The role of atrial contraction is roughly to fill up the ventricle as much as

556
00:34:01.881 --> 00:34:06.140
possible.
When the ventricle starts to contract,

557
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:10.280
pressure in the ventricle rises above pressure in the atrium causing the mitral

558
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:13.760
valve to close.
The aortic valve was already closed.

559
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:17.780
So now you have a closed chamber here and this contraction is an ISO volume

560
00:34:17.781 --> 00:34:19.220
metric contraction,

561
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:24.200
fixed volume of blood trying to increase top,

562
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.520
trying to working the hardest working to try to decrease the volume it can't.

563
00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:32.990
So the pressure goes up when the pressure goes up above what it is in the aorta,

564
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.560
the aortic valve opens,
blood is ejected,

565
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.690
that muscle starts to relax and the aortic valve closes.
And this is key,

566
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:46.930
right?
If your aortic valve didn't close,
what would happen here?

567
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.050
<v 1>Okay.</v>

568
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:53.330
<v 0>You'd pull in that blood that you just ejected into the order,</v>

569
00:34:53.331 --> 00:34:54.950
you'd pull it back into the ventricle.

570
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:59.870
A little bit does come back because the valve doesn't close immediately.
Right?

571
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:03.680
A little bit does come back.
Uh,
but,
but not very much

572
00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.960
when,
um,
when positions are listening to your heart,

573
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:13.730
one of the things they're listening for is sounds that aren't normally present

574
00:35:13.731 --> 00:35:15.260
in a functioning heart.

575
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.760
And those sounds often have to do with valves that are not functioning properly.

576
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.450
So if during a late a systally,

577
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.460
if right after systally is over,

578
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:29.000
if they hear a wash of blood when they shouldn't,

579
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:33.500
that might be because your aortic valve isn't functioning properly and blood is

580
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:35.780
wishing back into the ventricle when it shouldn't be.

581
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:38.910
Same thing with the mitral valve.

582
00:35:38.911 --> 00:35:43.200
If they hear a noise at this point in the cardiac cycle,

583
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:45.780
if they hear a noise at this point in the cardiac cycle,

584
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:50.990
that might be a flow of blood back from the ventricle into the atrium when it

585
00:35:51.781 --> 00:35:52.770
shouldn't be happening.

586
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.100
That might be because your mitral valve is not functioning properly.

587
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.630
And so that's,
that's what,

588
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:01.890
that's what physicians are listening for when they listen to your chest during a

589
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:02.880
physical exam.

590
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.863
<v 1>Wilma</v>

591
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.550
<v 0>here.
Yeah.</v>

592
00:36:11.551 --> 00:36:16.200
So what causes this little blip of pressure here after the mitral valve closes

593
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.273
do you think?

594
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.573
<v 1>Okay,</v>

595
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:21.950
<v 0>well it,
it's,</v>

596
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:26.150
it's probably happens just because you're getting this massive contraction in

597
00:36:26.151 --> 00:36:27.860
the ventricle that's right underneath it.

598
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.770
And so there's some change in volume here as well.

599
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.010
Even though the atrial contraction is almost complete,

600
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:38.870
you're also getting sort of a bystander effect from this very large contraction

601
00:36:38.871 --> 00:36:39.620
down here.

602
00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:44.620
And so that is follows very closely the pressure rise in the ventricle and is

603
00:36:44.991 --> 00:36:46.760
just a byproduct of that.

604
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:54.760
<v 1>Other questions,</v>

605
00:36:58.610 --> 00:36:59.450
<v 0>what I want to talk about.</v>

606
00:36:59.451 --> 00:37:02.930
So that's the end of the material that's covered on your midterm exam,

607
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.670
which is next Thursday.
Uh,

608
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.730
what I want to talk about next week is on Tuesday is the cardiac conduction

609
00:37:10.521 --> 00:37:14.720
system.
And I think you can see now that for this,
uh,

610
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.900
for this orderly sequence of events to occur,

611
00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:22.700
it has to be regulated in some way.
It has to be regulated in some way.

612
00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:27.850
And that the proper function of your heart requires all these things to occur in

613
00:37:28.041 --> 00:37:29.600
a very specific sequence,
right?

614
00:37:29.601 --> 00:37:34.460
The atrium has to contract before the ventricle,
right?

615
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:38.600
And um,
in order for this,
this,

616
00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.960
this logical progression of pressures,

617
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.140
proper functioning of the valves,
et Cetera,
well,

618
00:37:45.141 --> 00:37:49.490
it's the cardiac conduction system or this specialized system that moves

619
00:37:49.491 --> 00:37:54.491
electrical impulses through the heart that is responsible for coordinating the

620
00:37:55.281 --> 00:37:56.780
function of the heart on a heartbeat.

621
00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.070
And the cardiac conduction system is an electrical system where impulses are

622
00:38:01.071 --> 00:38:03.260
carried,
uh,
through the,

623
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.070
through the substance of the heart.
Now,

624
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.190
heart tissue is muscular tissue.

625
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.400
It's also electrically active tissue and each of the cells are capable of

626
00:38:16.521 --> 00:38:20.690
undergoing an action potential,
just like action potentials in nerves.

627
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:26.260
But the action potential in a muscle cell is not strictly informational like it

628
00:38:27.051 --> 00:38:28.820
is in the nervous system,
right?

629
00:38:28.821 --> 00:38:32.030
Action potential was the way that an electrical signal got propagated from one

630
00:38:32.031 --> 00:38:34.880
end of the nerve to the other.
Well,
in muscle cells,

631
00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:38.320
electrical signals get propagated from one muscle cell to another,

632
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.760
but another thing happens and that this electrical signal also activates the

633
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:45.310
contraction mechanism inside cells.

634
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.040
So as they're passing the electrical signal,

635
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.380
they're also getting the message to contract.

636
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.190
<v 1>Okay.</v>

637
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.970
<v 0>Electrical activity and muscle cells is linked to contraction.</v>

638
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:03.090
And so as this electrical activity passes over the heart in an orderly fashion

639
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.180
because of the cardiac conduction system,

640
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.870
as it passes in an orderly fashion over the surface of the heart,

641
00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.480
as we'll see next time I'm showing it this way,

642
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.600
this is the way the electrical signal passes from right atrium down through left

643
00:39:19.111 --> 00:39:24.111
ventricle as it passes in that orderly way than muscles are activated to

644
00:39:24.121 --> 00:39:26.700
contract in orderly way as well.

645
00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.270
So I'd like you to review for next time what we talked about in terms of action

646
00:39:30.271 --> 00:39:33.540
potentials that are in chapter six because we're going to go to talk about those

647
00:39:33.541 --> 00:39:37.450
in the context of a heart,
uh,
for next time.
Okay.

648
00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.053
Questions?

649
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.750
So I'll see you this afternoon.
