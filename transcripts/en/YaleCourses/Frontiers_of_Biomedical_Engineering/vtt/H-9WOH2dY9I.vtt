1
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.991
Okay.

2
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.760
Today we're going to continue our discussion of cellular principles and lead

3
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.220
into kind of cell culture technology,

4
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:23.490
which will be the subject of the section meeting this afternoon.

5
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:25.110
So just remind you about the,

6
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.280
the sections and we've been reading a chapter five.

7
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.380
And,
um,
we talked,
uh,

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.030
last time about some of the basic,
um,

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.360
properties of cells.
They're basic architecture in what ways cells are the same,

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.140
in what ways sales from animals,
including humans,

11
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.290
a differ from a simpler microorganisms like bacteria.

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.710
And then we talked a little bit about the sort of,
um,

13
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.620
physics of what holds cells together,
uh,

14
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.720
to form a collection of cells of tissue and to make up the structure of our

15
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:08.064
body.

16
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.220
And today we want to talk in more detail about the question of how can cells if

17
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.260
they're the same and they have the same kind of construction and they all

18
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:22.200
contain the same genetic material,

19
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.650
how can they develop into a multicellular organism that has cells that dipper so

20
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:32.190
greatly in function?
Uh,

21
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.070
the defer as much as the cells in our brain,

22
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.850
a differ from the cells of our skin or our liver or our blood.

23
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.250
And what are the sort of basic principles that lead to these differences between

24
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:46.620
cells.
And so to start out,

25
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:51.621
I'm gonna go back to the thinking about developmental little bit embryonic

26
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.680
development and,
uh,
show you a picture here.

27
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.060
And so this is a picture of the female reproductive tract.

28
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.730
This is the uterus down here,

29
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.520
sort of half of it is shown with the uterine wall,

30
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.430
the fallopian tubes and the ovaries.

31
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.470
And you know that the ovary produces an egg,

32
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.130
an egg and an egg is an example of a,
uh,

33
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.280
a germ cell has only half of the deployed chromosomal content that most of the

34
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.870
cells,
which are called somatic cells in our body have.

35
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.810
So germline cells,
sperm and egg,

36
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.470
are produced by the process of Meiosis.

37
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.100
And that's re reviewed in the book where it's a,

38
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.250
it's a special kind of cell division that results in the reduction of chromosome

39
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:51.351
number from two copies of each chromosome down to one copy of each chromosome,

40
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.460
right?
The other,
uh,
germline cell is the sperm cell.

41
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.750
And so fertilization of these to where these two selves join occurs in the

42
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.400
distal part of the Fallopian Tube.

43
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.060
And the result of fertilization now is a new cell that is the union of the sperm

44
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.980
and the egg at called the Zygote.

45
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.840
And it contains the diploid number of chromosomes genes.

46
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:24.400
So one copy of the chromosome comes from the egg and one copy of each chromosome

47
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:27.970
comes from that sperm.
So this is this,
this you know about.

48
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.430
So this one sell this one fertilized cell,
which is unique because it's the,

49
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.120
it's chromosome contains the combination of the sperm and the egg develops into

50
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.800
an embryo and then on birth develops into a,
into a human.

51
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.670
And each of us has something like 10 to the 14th cells.

52
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.380
And we talked about last time that that part of the process of going from this

53
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:59.590
single cell to multicellular,

54
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:04.330
many celled organisms like we are,
is cell division.

55
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.490
The cell divides and divides and divides,
uh,
many,
many times.

56
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:14.491
And that's one of the signature events of embryogenesis until we have many,

57
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:19.540
many cells that make up our bodies.
But in that process,

58
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.890
cells become different in ways that appear to be highly organized,
right?

59
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.680
We have,
uh,
tissues like the brain,
uh,

60
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.790
which are assembled to do functions that are different from any other groups of

61
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:35.080
cells in the body,
right?

62
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.290
And they work in concert and they all have similarities.

63
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.570
The same with all of our other organs.
So how does that happen?
Well,

64
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:47.860
that it really happens throughout development and it happens from the first

65
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:49.300
stages.
In fact,

66
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:53.860
there are differences that can be detected upon the first cell division where

67
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:57.220
the Zygote divides through the process of my ptosis,

68
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.410
and we talked about my tosas last time,

69
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:03.580
it's described more completely in the chapter where two cells are formed from

70
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:07.000
one.
Now these cells have some differences.

71
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:10.570
If you could look at these cells,
you could find differences between them.

72
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.100
There are chemical differences in the,
in the content of each of these cells.

73
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.830
Because if my ptosis occurs,
the way that it's supposed to,

74
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.670
the DNA that's in each of these cells is the same.
Right.

75
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:26.080
That's one of the properties of,

76
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.190
of my tosas that the DNA gets completely duplicated.
Um,

77
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.190
during the s phase,
during DNA synthesis phase.
But how,

78
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.520
how could these cells be different than if they contain the same DNA?

79
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.660
What's a physical mechanism that could lead to differences between these two

80
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:48.340
cells at this very early stage of development?
Any ideas

81
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.000
if,

82
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.560
if the DNA is synthesized exactly correctly.

83
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.160
So each one gets,

84
00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.020
<v 1>okay,</v>

85
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.320
<v 0>the right copies of DNA,
what other differences could there be?</v>

86
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.920
<v 0>The size of the cells could be different.
Maybe my toast.</v>

88
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:11.110
This is asymmetrical in some way so that one of the sales ends up being bigger

89
00:06:11.111 --> 00:06:13.000
than the other.
And how could size effect

90
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.690
affect the life of the cell?

91
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.760
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.910
<v 0>different amount of metabolic activity because one has a greater volume of</v>

93
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:28.880
cytoplasm than the other,
for example.
And so the,
the,
the,

94
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.570
these are exactly the right kinds of ideas.
There could be differences in the,

95
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:36.620
in the physics of,
of,
of cell division.

96
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.680
This process of separating into two cells such that even though they both have

97
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.680
the same chromosomes,
they both have the same DNA content,

98
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.240
maybe one of the cells in traps,
something that's different than the other cells.

99
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.740
All right?
And that difference could have been generated during the process of

100
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:58.040
fertilization,
right?
The sperm say this is the,

101
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.160
this is the one sperm cell that's able to inject its DNA into the egg.

102
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.050
Well then this cell has a polarity.

103
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.580
Now the top is different from the bottom because the sperm came in this side

104
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:12.530
physically and not the other side.

105
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.160
I remember that these cells are relatively large compared to bacteria.

106
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.690
And so diffusion doesn't occur very quickly over this length scale.

107
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.130
So,
uh,
in the time it takes for one cell division to occur,

108
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.390
it could be that this cell in traps a different chemical composition of the

109
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:35.720
cytoplasm,
then this and traps.
And that's a well known concept.

110
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:40.250
So the only important thing to realize about that is that these differences

111
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.850
start to occur very early in development.

112
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.340
And once you have a difference that occurs,
two cells are difference.

113
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.120
Those differences can propagate as the cells continue to divide.

114
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.480
So what's shown in,
uh,

115
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.290
in this diagram is the progress of the developing embryo.

116
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.480
As it travels in time down the Fallopian tube.
Uh,

117
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.290
there's one division here shows it at the 16 sales stage.

118
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:13.470
And then here in this transformation as it goes from 16 cells to more like 64

119
00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:15.970
cells,
uh,

120
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.620
there's a change in sort of the shape of the overall embryo as well.

121
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.350
It's no longer just a around spiritual mass of cells,

122
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:31.530
but it has some structure.
There's a cluster of cells here.
There's,
uh,
a,

123
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.210
uh,
sheet of cells that forms an outer lining.

124
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.920
And what is most noticeable is this cavity,
this fluid filled cavity,

125
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:41.980
which begins to develop,
well,
this,

126
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.910
this stage of development is called the blastocyst.

127
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.463
<v 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.580
<v 0>And it's at this stage late in this blastocyst stage that the developing embryo</v>

129
00:08:53.101 --> 00:08:57.390
implants in the uterine and,
uh,

130
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.450
and there begins to form an interface with the mother so that it can be

131
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:04.770
nourished during further development.

132
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.100
The cells of this surrounding sheet,

133
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.260
<v 1>okay</v>

134
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.120
<v 0>have become different in some way and they develop into the placenta.</v>

135
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.580
And the extra embryonic tissues.

136
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.600
The cells of this cluster inside next to the fluid filled cavity is that region

137
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.880
of the blastocyst called the inner cell mass.

138
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.700
And it's this group of cells,

139
00:09:29.701 --> 00:09:34.701
this subset of cells from the developing embryo that become the embryo that

140
00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:39.750
become the organism,
it become the human.

141
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.670
So we're going to talk as we go through a about the concept of stem cells and

142
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:51.150
how stem cells are related to development and what's so special about stem
cells.

143
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.450
And we're going to talk about different kinds of stem cells.

144
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.780
And one of the dip differences in stem cell populations that you will hear about

145
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.720
is you hear about embryonic stem cells and you hear about adult stem cells.

146
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.540
And those are obvious what the differences are.

147
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:13.110
Embryonic stem cells are derived from embryos and it's this,

148
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.580
it sells in this region here,
this inner cell mass,
uh,

149
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:21.110
that that's the source of embryonic stem cells.
All right,

150
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.280
sales from the inner cell mass here,

151
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.990
adult stem cells are acquired in some fashion from an adult organism.

152
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.570
So during development.

153
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:35.571
Now this blastocyst has become implanted these cells allowing the outside form,

154
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:36.600
the interface,

155
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:41.601
the placenta where the maternal blood circulation meets the embryonic

156
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:46.770
circulation and nutrients are passed back and forth that way in a very highly

157
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.720
regulated and important way.

158
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:52.260
And this inner cell mass develops into the embryo,

159
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.410
which this here shown it a later stage is beginning to be clear that it's

160
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:01.200
becoming an organism that looks like us,
right?
There's a,

161
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:04.530
there's a region that looks like a head and a region that looks more like the

162
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:08.900
tail.
And you can see this region here is going to develop into uh,

163
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.470
one of the upper limbs.

164
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:14.670
The arms here and the back is different from the front.

165
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.210
The spinal cord is developing in the back,

166
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.590
whereas the structures that become our intestinal tract is developing on the

167
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:24.120
other surface,
right?

168
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.430
So different kinds of polarity form,
right?
There's a,

169
00:11:29.431 --> 00:11:33.090
there's a head and there's a tail,
there's a back,
there's a front,

170
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.190
there's a left side and there's a right side.

171
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.840
And this is one of the kinds of differences that develop,

172
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.380
that that happens during development and cells somehow know where they are

173
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.470
within this,
within this,
uh,

174
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.290
developing asymmetrical organism.

175
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.010
<v 1>How</v>

176
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.940
<v 0>does that happen?
It happens through a very,
uh,
a very,
um,</v>

177
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:01.720
regulated,

178
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:07.500
coordinated slow process of what is called differentiation.

179
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.640
So cells move from a state of limited differentiation to a state of more

180
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.970
differentiation.

181
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.450
So the Zygote or this fertilized egg is a completely undifferentiated cell,

182
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.310
and we'll talk about another word for this later,

183
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.690
but it's a cell that's going to give rise to all the cells of our body,
right?

184
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:38.440
As division happens and the,

185
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.950
and the developing organism acquires more and more cells,

186
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.460
individual cells become differentiated,

187
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.860
they become more and more like their final mature form.

188
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.610
So cells that are within the region that becomes the nervous system become less

189
00:12:57.161 --> 00:13:02.161
like the Zygote and more like the cells of our brain neurons and glial and cells

190
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:07.000
of the mature brain in the same way,

191
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:12.001
cells that form the limb become more like muscle cells or skin cells or the

192
00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:16.600
structures that become the limb.
Well,

193
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.900
that process occurs in a series of steps and one of those kinds of steps is

194
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:29.110
shown here.
And in this diagram shows what I simply labeled as a stem cell.

195
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.990
So I'm not referring to any particular kind of stem cell now,

196
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.620
but just a cell that has the stem cell character.

197
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.890
And what does that mean to have the stem cell character?

198
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.700
It means that if I took this cell and isolated and watched it,

199
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:45.520
I noticed that it had a couple of characteristics.

200
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.050
One is that it's capable of something called asymmetrical division.

201
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:56.180
And we,
we talked about division last time we talked about the uh,
the um,

202
00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:01.530
parents cell forming two identical daughter cells and an AME set metrical

203
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:03.160
division is not like that.

204
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.920
It's when a parent self forms two cells that are different in some way.

205
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.790
And that difference has functional consequences for the daughter cells in that

206
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:18.250
one of the daughter's cell becomes what's called here,

207
00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.630
a committed progeneter cell.
It's no longer a stem cell,

208
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.010
but it's a progenitor cell and a progenitor cell.
The definition,

209
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:32.011
it just means it can generate the cells that are typical of that tissue or that

210
00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.590
Oregon,
right?

211
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.040
So it's capable of becoming this mature classes of cells.

212
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.770
We'll talk more about this in the context of the brain,

213
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.170
but if we were talking about a stem cell in the brain,

214
00:14:47.171 --> 00:14:51.190
then the result of this asymmetrical division would be a committed progeneter

215
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.200
cell that's capable of forming cells that are the cell types found in the brain

216
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.410
and not cells that are the cell types found in the liver or the kidney or the

217
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:05.810
spleen or muscle,
right?

218
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.090
So one result of this asymmetrical division is a committed progeneter cell.

219
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.880
The other result is a cell that's very similar,

220
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.020
but it is very similar to the progeneter cell,

221
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:21.620
but it's exactly the stem cell,
right?

222
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:27.550
So this stem cell division leads to another stem cell as well as a committed

223
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:30.230
progeneter cell.
Now,

224
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:33.950
the differences here may be subtle in terms of chemical composition or if you

225
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.970
put these cells under a microscope and look at their analysis.

226
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:41.420
But in terms of function,
they're very important because this,

227
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.760
this stem cell which has produced,

228
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.970
goes back into the population of stem cells and is able to repeat this process

229
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.920
to form new committed progeneter cells and to form new stem cells.

230
00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.230
And that's important because one of the attributes of stem cells is that they

231
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.260
remain at their site and capable of reproducing themselves,

232
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.590
right?
And this process is called self renewal.

233
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.750
So that's one important process of property of stem cells that they're capable

234
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:15.650
of self renewal.

235
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.110
And the other one is a committed progeneter cell that now somehow has been

236
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:26.111
changed in such a way that it's going to mature and develop into,

237
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:26.900
uh,

238
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.610
into non stem cells are the cells that make up our body somatic cells.

239
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.730
Now what could these differences be?
They're not chromosomal differences,
right?

240
00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:39.350
Cause this is the ordinary process of my tosas.

241
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:43.640
And so presumably these two cells have exactly the same DNA content,

242
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.970
but something's been passed on to this one that wasn't there.

243
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.690
And this is one of the very important areas that still is not completely

244
00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:55.010
understood in stem cell biology.

245
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:59.870
What is the difference that's generated during an asymmetric cell division?
Uh,

246
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:04.580
there are types of changes that are known.
Some of them are changes in the,

247
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:09.410
not the sequence of DNA,
not the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA,

248
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.970
but,
but the chemistry of DNA around that,

249
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.250
the way that it's packed into a nucleus.

250
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:21.251
And so the access that is cell has to certain kinds of genes or chemical

251
00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:22.970
modifications of DNA,

252
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.720
not chemical modifications that change the base pairs.

253
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:32.070
That would be a mutation,
right?
That can happen,
but that's abnormal,
right?

254
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.480
But changes in maybe the chemistry of the backbone that holds the nucleotides

255
00:17:37.761 --> 00:17:40.400
together.
In some cases,

256
00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:45.401
that backbone gets methylated and those regions of the DNA that are methylated

257
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:49.190
get treated differently by the cell,
then unmethylated regions.

258
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.970
So you go on and you study a developmental biology or molecular biology.

259
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:56.910
It learn more about these things for our purpose.

260
00:17:56.911 --> 00:18:00.000
Just these are the kinds of changes that can happen.

261
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.640
Or it can be the kind of change we talked about before,

262
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:06.960
where during division there are some chemicals that are trapped in one cell and

263
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:09.000
not in the other.
Right?

264
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.010
And that could lead to a difference we already talked about or it could be not

265
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:16.020
having to do with the cells themselves,

266
00:18:16.021 --> 00:18:19.080
but maybe the environment that the self finds itself in.

267
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:24.510
We talked last time about extra cellular matrix and this and this complex,

268
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:29.280
uh,
protein,
carbohydrate gel that surrounds all cells.

269
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.630
Well,
cell division takes place within an organism.

270
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.071
All right,

271
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:40.071
we'll talk in a minute about stem cells that are involved in generation of blood

272
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.290
and they,
they develop and they live in the bone marrow.
Well,

273
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:50.310
what if this division takes place in an environment where there's one kind of

274
00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:54.390
extra cellular matrix here and another kind of extracellular matrix here.

275
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.740
Then this cell is going to experience something different from this cell.

276
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.090
And it could be those differences that they experienced in their extra sailor

277
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:08.091
environment that lead to their choice to either self renew or to become

278
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.483
committed.

279
00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:11.743
<v 1>Okay?</v>

280
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.830
<v 0>Uh,
so that's asymmetrical division and that's a property of stem cells.</v>

281
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.450
The other property is that these committed progeneter cells that are formed can,

282
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.390
can,
uh,
can turn into something,

283
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.820
can turn into more mature cell types.

284
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.630
And that process of maturation is called differentiation.

285
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:32.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

286
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:37.090
<v 0>And,
um,
talk more about that and I've already said something about that.</v>

287
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.250
Um,
so

288
00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:40.780
<v 1>yeah,</v>

289
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.780
<v 0>a capability for asymmetric division and the production of cells that become</v>

290
00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:50.050
differentiated more mature cells,
those are key properties of stem cells.

291
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:51.640
<v 1>Okay.</v>

292
00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.480
<v 0>Another concept that's important in thinking about stem cells is potential</v>

293
00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.970
and the potential refers to what it sounds like.

294
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.540
What potential does this committed progeneter cell have?

295
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.120
What potential does this stem cell have?

296
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.080
But one way to think about it is that upon this first division,

297
00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.330
this asymmetric division,

298
00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.380
this committed progeneter cell has lost some potential.

299
00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.690
It's no longer capable of self renewal to form another stem cell.

300
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:27.610
It's gone down a path towards maturation that's very difficult to go back up.

301
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.380
So there's a loss of potential in this division,

302
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.130
this,
this stem cell,
which is reproduced,

303
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.420
still has the potential to undergo asymmetric division,

304
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.740
but this one does not.
And one sort of,

305
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.540
it might be kind of simple minded,
but one to think about potential is,

306
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.110
um,

307
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:55.110
with the kind of potential that we all experience as we develop from newborns to

308
00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.370
adults,
right?

309
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:05.050
That a newborn child has lots of different potential,
right?

310
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.840
It doesn't have every potential,
it's a boy or a girl.
It's not going to go back,

311
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.610
right?
But it has lots of potential and that eventually when it becomes an adult,

312
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:20.611
it could become a cellist or a biologist or an auto mechanic or a biomedical

313
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:24.160
engineer,
right?
All those potentials are still there.

314
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.540
As you develop,
as you're educated,

315
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:30.940
you,
um,

316
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.410
you retain all those potentials for a certain point and then you make choices

317
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.070
and you lose some of those potentials.

318
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:43.390
I'm unlikely to become a concert cellist at this point.

319
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.930
It's not impossible,
but it's pretty unlikely,
right?

320
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:51.850
So I've probably lost my potential to be,
uh,
to be,
uh,
an outstanding cellist.

321
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.830
Right?
You all could still do that if you decide to,
but,
um,

322
00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.980
but it's going to be harder for you than if you would've started when you were

323
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:01.240
10.
Right?

324
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.720
And so you're losing some potential around long the way you're in the process of

325
00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:12.190
becoming more mature and more differentiated and you're losing potential.

326
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:13.030
At the same time.

327
00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:18.280
The same thing with these cells here as the cells undergo continual divisions,

328
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.860
they're changing in ways that make them more mature,

329
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:25.900
that make them more like the mature cells of the nervous system.
For example,

330
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:29.830
if that's where they end up being a but they're losing potential as they go

331
00:22:29.831 --> 00:22:33.370
through that differentiation process.
Now,

332
00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:35.680
one of the great hopes of,

333
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:40.570
of modern biology is that we can figure out how to reverse that process in
cells,

334
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:46.110
how we could take cells that are differentiated to some extent and make them d

335
00:22:48.151 --> 00:22:52.120
differentiate to go back in the process of,

336
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.450
of differentiation so that they gain more potential.

337
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.210
And why would that be useful?
Will be useful.

338
00:22:58.211 --> 00:23:00.310
Because if I could take cells from the skin,

339
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.090
find stem cells in the skin,

340
00:23:04.091 --> 00:23:09.091
and then d differentiate them so that they were now capable of becoming liver or

341
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:13.120
brain or things that they're not going to become in their normal site,

342
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.740
then that could be a very powerful tool for medicine.
Right?
Uh,

343
00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:22.570
but so far our ability to d differentiate cells or find out how to do that as

344
00:23:22.571 --> 00:23:27.200
limited,
it just makes sense.
So what,

345
00:23:27.201 --> 00:23:31.090
what is actually changing during this process of differentiation?
What's,

346
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:32.650
what's the difference between this cell,

347
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:37.651
which I call a committed progeneter cell and its offspring and the offspring of

348
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:42.520
that offspring?
It goes,
going through this process of amplifying divisions.

349
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.270
Every division increasing the number of cells by a factor of two.

350
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.740
Uh,
and these sales becoming more differentiated around the way I've shown the

351
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:53.450
differences here in terms of shape.

352
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.570
These are shaped like octagon and these are shaped like squares.

353
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.100
But if I looked at these cells,

354
00:23:58.101 --> 00:24:00.440
what would I find that's really different about them?

355
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.660
What's different from a,
from an immature cell and a mature cell?
Well,

356
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:09.860
it's not the,
it's not the DNA,
right?
They all have the same DNA.

357
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.000
There might be these what are called epigenetic differences that I mentioned

358
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:16.460
changes in the structure around DNA.

359
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
And those changes lead to differences in which fraction of the total genes in

360
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:26.090
the chromosomes are being expressed by a particular cell.

361
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.270
And this is what makes cells different,
right?

362
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:34.750
That the number and quantity of the genes that they express.

363
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.870
So out of all the genes that are on the human genome,

364
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.320
which fraction is this particular cell using?

365
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.360
Which fraction is expressing,
determines what proteins are present in the cell,

366
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.430
determines what work or what activities the cell can engage in.

367
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.360
All right,
so what's changing along here is the,

368
00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:01.420
what's changing along this pathway is the expression pattern of genes in a,

369
00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:03.530
in cells.

370
00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:11.090
And make this a little bit more explicit by talking about the process of

371
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:16.091
hematopoiesis and hematopoiesis is the process of generating new blood cells.

372
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.270
Have Matto,
uh,
means uh,

373
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.110
blood and pollicis means generation or formation.

374
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.690
And uh,
you know,
probably that within your bone marrow there's,

375
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.580
there's a populations of cells,

376
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:35.220
there are different kinds of cells within the bone marrow.
And uh,

377
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:40.100
some of them have the capability of becoming red blood cells which carry oxygen

378
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:40.790
in the blood.

379
00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.620
Some of them have the capability of becoming white blood cells or leukocytes,

380
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.150
of which there are many different subsets,
some are called neutrophils,

381
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:54.890
and those are responsible for,
uh,
for um,
um,
fighting infection.

382
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.210
Uh,
some are called lymphocytes,
B lymphocytes,
t lymphocytes.

383
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.690
We're going to talk about those in more detail in a couple of weeks when we talk

384
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:06.860
about the immune system because these are the cells that that perform and

385
00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:11.861
regulate the functions of our immune system that protects us from a disease and

386
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:17.150
some of form what are called mega carrier sites,
which become platelets,

387
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.600
which are responsible for uh,
for clotting,

388
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.370
for forming a barrier if you're a circulatory system gets injured,
right?

389
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.990
So you don't bleed.

390
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:33.670
All these sales come from the bone marrow and biologists have traced the

391
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.730
formation of these cells in great detail.
In fact,
of all the,

392
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:42.740
of all the systems of cellular differentiation that are known in our bodies,

393
00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.070
probably hematopoiesis is the best known and it was the first place where the

394
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:52.071
concept of stem cells was developed in that if one looks carefully,

395
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.160
one confined immature cells in the bone marrow.

396
00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.460
And if you isolate those immature cells,

397
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.420
some of them are less mature than others,

398
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.830
some of them have more potential than others.
For example,

399
00:27:06.831 --> 00:27:10.470
if by isolated this one called the myeloid cell,

400
00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.840
it's capable of forming red blood cells,

401
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:16.110
mega carrier sites and neutrophils.

402
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.780
It's capable of forming all these different cells,

403
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.300
but it's not capable of forming lymphocytes.

404
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.700
Another stem cell called the lymphoid stem cell is capable of forming,

405
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.830
forming the B and t lymphocytes.

406
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.730
And so through many decades of study,

407
00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:37.731
biologists have teased out certain populations of cells within the bone marrow

408
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.090
that are capable of,

409
00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:44.340
of reproducing subsets of cells,
right.

410
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.903
Um,

411
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:50.363
<v 2>now</v>

412
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.760
<v 0>in the process of doing that,</v>

413
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.900
they found some very rare stem cells that are called plurry.

414
00:27:56.901 --> 00:28:01.901
Potent plurry just means many potencies pluripotent stem cells that are capable

415
00:28:02.361 --> 00:28:07.010
of self renewal to generate themselves and are capable of dividing into both

416
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.120
myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells.
Okay.

417
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.330
So this is an example of that asymmetric division.

418
00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.540
This pluripotent stem cell is able to self renew and it's April of,

419
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.370
of generating,
um,

420
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.200
committed progenitors of either the myeloid or the lymphoid lineage.

421
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.160
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

422
00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.680
<v 0>And so if I got these two cells,
they would be less,</v>

423
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.840
they would have less potential than these.

424
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.050
Why is it so hard to find stem cells?

425
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.530
I mentioned that this is a process has taken many decades and lots of people

426
00:28:39.531 --> 00:28:40.364
studying.

427
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:44.540
Why has it been so hard and why does it continue to be difficult to identify

428
00:28:44.541 --> 00:28:46.280
these,
these,
uh,

429
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:50.300
these pluripotent cells within tissues?

430
00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:55.340
Well,
one reason is that they're present in very small numbers.

431
00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:00.020
All right?
And so have a million cells in the bone marrow.

432
00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:03.370
There might only be one of these,
you know,

433
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.270
this might be one in 100 billion or something like that.

434
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.900
Don't write down the numbers.
I'm just using that for,
um,

435
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:15.790
for illustration that these cells are rare and so it's been hard to identify

436
00:29:15.791 --> 00:29:20.410
them.
That's part of it.
The other part of it is how do you identify them?

437
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:25.180
How do I know when I've got this one or this one in this diagram I'm showing
you?

438
00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:28.570
It's easy to tell because some are yellow and some are pink and some are blue.

439
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.870
But that's not the way they come out of the bone marrow.
Right?
They're not,

440
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:36.280
they're not colored coded.
And so how do you find them?
How do you think,
what Wa,

441
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:41.020
if you were searching for,
uh,
for unique populations of cells,

442
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.310
the bone marrow,
what tools would you use to look for them?

443
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.090
How would you,
how would you search for these sales?
Well,

444
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:54.091
one way would be to isolate individual cells and culture them outside the body

445
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:56.520
and see what they become.
Now,

446
00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:59.170
it'd be a very straightforward functional way to do it,

447
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:00.520
but you can imagine that that's,
uh,

448
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.690
that's very labor intensive because you've got to separate each individual cell

449
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:09.910
and you've got to nurture it and then keep track and study what it becomes.

450
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.900
And that turns out to be one really important way that they do it.

451
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:19.950
The other way that they define or find stem cells is that over the years of

452
00:30:20.261 --> 00:30:21.490
studying them,

453
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.840
we've begun to recognize some of the proteins,

454
00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:31.570
the specific proteins that are produced by these characteristics cells.

455
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.670
So this cell here,
which is indicated green,
is different than this cell.

456
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:39.280
That's that,
that's,
that's colored red.

457
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:42.280
And the difference,

458
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:46.330
the real difference is in what genes it's expressing of it,

459
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.940
of the total number of genes in the human genome.

460
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.360
And therefore if it's expressing these unique,

461
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.430
this unique set of genes,

462
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.420
if I could find the unique set of proteins that correspond to those jeans,

463
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:03.250
I could define kind of chemically what the cell is and it it,

464
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:07.810
it turns out that one of the places that's been very fruitful for to look for

465
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.670
proteins that differ between cell populations is on the surface of the cell.

466
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.280
And we talked about the cell membrane,

467
00:31:15.281 --> 00:31:17.890
the plasma membrane separating the inside from the outside.

468
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.220
And I mentioned a little bit that this membrane is not just lip it by layer,

469
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:25.720
but there's also proteins that are inserted into the membrane and these proteins

470
00:31:25.721 --> 00:31:29.140
have functions that are essential,
that essential for life of the cell.

471
00:31:29.141 --> 00:31:34.141
They transport molecules back and forth across the membrane and they also allow,

472
00:31:34.451 --> 00:31:38.680
there are populations of proteins on the surface of each cell that allow it to

473
00:31:38.681 --> 00:31:43.330
interact with its environment,
their receptors and uh,

474
00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:46.210
cell adhesion receptors like I talked about last time,

475
00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.740
the kinds of proteins that sit on the cell surface and form adhesion junctions

476
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:55.360
with neighboring cells.
That's one class of cells.
On the surface,
there are cell,

477
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.300
there are,
that's one class of proteins on the surface,
I'm sorry.

478
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:03.190
There are proteins that are responsible for receiving signals,

479
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.460
chemical signals.
There are proteins for example,

480
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:11.670
on the surface of some cells that bind insulin and respond to the presence of

481
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:13.030
insulin.

482
00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:17.110
And we're going to talk more about these kinds of molecules on the surface.
Uh,

483
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.950
next week for now.
Just know that different kinds of cells,

484
00:32:20.951 --> 00:32:24.850
one of the ways they're different is that they express different proteins and

485
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:28.030
the population of proteins on the surface of different cells is different.

486
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:33.330
And so we've learned how to identify and categorize and catalog sells according

487
00:32:35.651 --> 00:32:37.870
to the composition of proteins on the surface.

488
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.080
And those proteins that distinguish a seller often called marker proteins.

489
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:44.870
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

490
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.500
<v 0>they're given names.
And so,</v>

491
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:51.830
and we're able to often the names are confusing.

492
00:32:51.831 --> 00:32:55.130
If you look in the literature,
you'll find uh,

493
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:59.630
proteins that are called CD 44,
CD three.

494
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.520
These are differentiation.

495
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.330
Cluster differentiation antigens is what CD stands for,

496
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.710
but it really means a particular protein which is present on this cell but not

497
00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:12.830
on that cell.
And so I can use the presence of those to identify,

498
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:17.180
to identify,
um,
cell populations.

499
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.230
Right?

500
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.620
So one reason it's been harder to identify stem cells is that they're so rare.

501
00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:28.130
The other reason is that it's hard to identify the characteristics of them.

502
00:33:28.411 --> 00:33:32.280
And it's taken many years to work this out.
And in the,
in the,
um,

503
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:37.860
in the,
uh,
um,
amount of poetic system,
it's the most well known.

504
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.091
In fact,

505
00:33:39.091 --> 00:33:44.091
it's so well known now that we've identified proteins that stimulate the

506
00:33:44.131 --> 00:33:46.770
development of cells along certain pathways.

507
00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.550
And I talked about one of them a couple of weeks ago.
The protein Hipo,

508
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.100
a wreath throw poet called,
uh,

509
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:57.900
called Hipo is a naturally occurring protein that is in the bone marrow.

510
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:02.730
And it,
it stimulates the,
uh,
the development of red blood cells.

511
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:07.590
And so it stimulates these myeloid cells to develop along this pathway.

512
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:09.200
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

513
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.560
<v 0>right.
It's a protein that's produced by other cells in the body.</v>

514
00:34:12.561 --> 00:34:17.420
And when it's enriched in a certain area,
it stimulates more production of,

515
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.090
of,
uh,
uh,
red blood cells.

516
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.000
And because we've learned about that biology,

517
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:27.920
we've been able to make a retro poet and outside the body and use it as a drug

518
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.760
so it can be used given to people,
uh,
to,

519
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:36.200
who have certain kinds of anemia to stimulate blood cell production in a

520
00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:37.370
specific kind of way.

521
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:43.070
And there's lots of these so called signaling proteins that have been identified

522
00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:47.630
now.
And these signaling proteins play important roles in determining,

523
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.560
uh,

524
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.560
how many cells differentiate down particular pathways.

525
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.850
And they turned out also to be a very useful for treating diseases of those

526
00:34:59.060 --> 00:34:59.893
pathways.

527
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

528
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.130
<v 0>Well the um,
this,
um,
plurry potent.</v>

529
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

530
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.820
<v 0>Stem cell from bone marrow is an example of a stem cell,</v>

531
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:18.330
an adult stem cell,
a stem cell that could be identified from the blood

532
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.840
different than the embryonic stem cell we talked about before.

533
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.630
So it's an example of an adult stem cell.

534
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.070
It's also an example of a tissue specific stem cell.

535
00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:35.850
Those stem cells from the blood are capable of becoming all those cells in the

536
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:41.460
blood.
They're not capable of becoming other kinds of sales in general.

537
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.290
Now you'll,
you'll hear reports in the literature.
You'll look in the newspaper,

538
00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:51.120
you'll hear about,
uh,
about scientists that have found ways to,
uh,

539
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.040
trans differentiate cells that is moved them from one pathway to the other

540
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:00.420
defined stem cells that they can move from one kind of pathway to another.

541
00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.870
And that's been,
uh,

542
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.600
looking at blood stem cells has been a very fruitful way to look for that.
So,

543
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:11.340
so there are some ways that you can take stem cells that normally would only

544
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:14.550
produce blood cells and maintain them in culture,

545
00:36:14.551 --> 00:36:17.130
expose them to certain regimens of chemicals,

546
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.120
do certain manipulations on these cells and they become capable of producing

547
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:25.950
liver,
for example,
or brain or muscle.

548
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.480
And that's a lot of the literature of stem cells that you'll read about taking a

549
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:35.481
particular source of stem cell and nurturing it in such a way that it gains

550
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:40.850
potentials that it didn't have necessarily when it was in the body or exploiting

551
00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:46.290
those potentials that it wouldn't necessarily express.
Right.

552
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:47.800
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

553
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.920
<v 0>that's,
that's a lot of what a stem cell biology is like.</v>

554
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:56.320
It is about this diagram here sort of

555
00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:02.710
allows me to walk you through some of the terminology of this stem cell

556
00:37:02.711 --> 00:37:07.711
development and talk about these concepts again in the context of a specific

557
00:37:08.381 --> 00:37:10.570
tissue site.
In this case,
it's the nervous system.

558
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.850
And so we started the discussion talking about the Zygote or the fertilized egg.

559
00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.340
There's only one source for that.

560
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:19.740
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

561
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.580
<v 0>right?
There's only one source of that fertilized egg.
It's,
um,</v>

562
00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:28.640
it's not self renewing in that division of the Zygote results in two daughter

563
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:33.660
cells that are no longer,
you know,
the Zygote anymore.

564
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:37.080
They're down some pathway.
Uh,
but it's,
uh,
it,

565
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.860
one way of referring to this cell is in terms of its potential and the Zygote

566
00:37:44.491 --> 00:37:47.490
obviously has the potential of becoming all the cells of our body.

567
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:50.250
That's where they all come from.
They all come from the Zygote.

568
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:55.200
And so the word for that is toady potent,
totally potent.

569
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.280
It has the capability of becoming any kind of cell within the body.
In fact,

570
00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:03.450
that's what it does.
Further down the line.
For example,

571
00:38:03.451 --> 00:38:06.630
in the blastocyst I talked about before,

572
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:11.750
we could obtain cells from this inner cell mass or this cluster of cells that

573
00:38:11.911 --> 00:38:15.480
becomes the embryo and those are called embryonic stem cells.

574
00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.940
They are self renewing and they are plurry potent meaning they have many

575
00:38:20.941 --> 00:38:21.780
potencies.

576
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:26.990
And that's why people are so excited about embryonic stem cells because

577
00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:32.810
in nature they become all the cells of the body.

578
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:34.850
If we understood them well enough,

579
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.990
we could potentially make any particular kind of cell in the body from those,

580
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.220
uh,
from those pluripotent cells.

581
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:48.610
They're controversial I think for obvious reasons because you have to sacrifice

582
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:51.610
that an embryo in order to,
in order to get them.

583
00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:58.570
Um,
further down this line here,
um,

584
00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:03.320
are embryonic or let's say adult brain stem cells.
So these are,

585
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.730
these are cells that I,

586
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.790
that were obtained either from a more developed embryo past the blastocyst

587
00:39:10.701 --> 00:39:11.960
stage,
for example,

588
00:39:11.961 --> 00:39:15.170
that embryo that I showed on one of the first slides where there's clearly a

589
00:39:15.171 --> 00:39:20.171
head region and a tail region and now I isolated these cells may be from the

590
00:39:20.481 --> 00:39:24.830
head region of the embryo,
the region.
That's going to develop into the brain.

591
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.870
So that would be a good place to look.

592
00:39:26.871 --> 00:39:29.900
If you wanted cells that we're going to develop into the brain,

593
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.210
they're capable of self renewal.

594
00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:36.740
They're not quite as potent as the cells from earlier because they've now

595
00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:38.060
differentiated somewhat.

596
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.530
So they might be capable of forming all the cells of the nervous system.

597
00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:47.270
They might still have some potency to form other things that are similar to the

598
00:39:47.271 --> 00:39:51.860
nervous system.
Maybe they could make skin right?
Maybe they could make,
uh,

599
00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.130
other kinds of cells if you treated them the right way.

600
00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.600
So they've lost some capabilities,
but not,
but not many.

601
00:39:59.601 --> 00:40:03.070
And these are called multipotent stem cells.
Uh,

602
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.930
they still have broad potential and they're self renewing.

603
00:40:05.931 --> 00:40:09.260
And so there's much interest in those,
easiest to find them in embryos,

604
00:40:09.261 --> 00:40:12.290
but sometimes they can be found in adult organisms as well.

605
00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.260
If you go to the right region of an adult brain,

606
00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.310
you might be able to find cells like this,
but it's,

607
00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.950
but it's more difficult.
And as we,

608
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:26.300
as we've found cells from adult organisms that seem to be multipotential and

609
00:40:26.301 --> 00:40:30.890
studied them more carefully,
uh,
some of their potentials turn out to be lost.

610
00:40:30.891 --> 00:40:32.240
They're not exactly the same.

611
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.333
<v 2>Right?</v>

612
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.500
<v 0>And further down the line here,</v>

613
00:40:36.501 --> 00:40:39.470
if we looked in the adult brain or spinal cord in other regions,

614
00:40:39.471 --> 00:40:41.600
we'd find committed progeneter cells.

615
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.770
These are cells that are committed to become a nervous,

616
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:50.690
I'm nervous tissue.
They might self renew,

617
00:40:50.691 --> 00:40:55.010
they might not.
They have much more limited potential than before.

618
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.920
And you,
you're starting to see the pattern,
right?

619
00:40:57.921 --> 00:41:02.390
As I moved further and further away from the embryo from less differentiated to

620
00:41:02.391 --> 00:41:03.740
more differentiated from,

621
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.880
from nonspecific regions to more specific regions,

622
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:09.560
I'm getting cells that have,

623
00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:14.060
that are easier to obtain because you can obtain them from adults sources,

624
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:18.170
right?
But their potential as stem cells is more limited,

625
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.153
<v 2>right?</v>

626
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:24.370
<v 0>There are a couple of tissues that are of particular interest to,
uh,</v>

627
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:29.450
to scientists and clinicians now and uh,
and bone marrow is one of those,

628
00:41:29.451 --> 00:41:32.660
there's a lot of interest in bone marrow and the stem cells that come from bone

629
00:41:32.661 --> 00:41:34.250
marrow.
And a couple of reasons for this.

630
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.210
One is because we understand the bone marrow system so much better than we

631
00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:40.190
understand all the other stem cell systems.

632
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.080
And the other is that it's possible to get stem cells from patients from bone

633
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:47.180
marrow.
You can collect bone marrow.

634
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.990
It's not a procedure that you would want to do.
I involves putting,
uh,

635
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.010
putting a needle,

636
00:41:52.011 --> 00:41:56.600
a fairly large needle into usually the one of the pelvic bones and collecting

637
00:41:56.601 --> 00:42:00.290
marrow from which is tissue that's deep inside those bones.

638
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.400
So it's not as easy as getting your blood drawn.
Uh,

639
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.320
if you give blood to the Red Cross for example.
But,

640
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.330
but it can be done very safely.

641
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:13.160
And wouldn't it be great if we could identify stem cells that were multipotent,

642
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.780
uh,
from that,
uh,

643
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.950
from that bone marrow because you could find them potentially four.

644
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:23.030
If I needed a treatment that could,

645
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.970
if I had some ailment that could be treated with stem cells,

646
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:29.090
then you could get my own,
I could get my own stem cells and use them.

647
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:34.450
Or maybe I could donate bone marrow and those stem cells could be given to other

648
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:38.870
people in the same way that blood can be given to other people by matching

649
00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:43.740
right?
By matching and making sure that immunologically my cells were,
uh,

650
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.440
were compatible with you.
All right?
It's a lot of interest in that.

651
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:52.790
There's a lot of interest in obtaining stem cells from the blood of the

652
00:42:52.791 --> 00:42:54.380
umbilical cord on birth.

653
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.700
And it turns out that blood within the umbilical cord is also a rich source of

654
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:02.330
stem cells.
And,
um,
and again,

655
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.700
specific to a particular patient.

656
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:08.810
So there are services now we don't know yet how to get those stem cells out of

657
00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:11.450
cord blood and how to use them for therapies.

658
00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.530
But it's reasonable to think that we might know about this in 30 years.

659
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:19.700
And so some parents now are choosing to save the cord blood,

660
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.690
have it frozen,
locked away somewhere,

661
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:28.820
just in case it's useful to their child later in life.
I'm not endorsing that,

662
00:43:28.821 --> 00:43:31.700
I'm just saying that that's something that can be done now.

663
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:36.350
Um,
so I digressed a little from this diagram,

664
00:43:36.351 --> 00:43:41.090
but I think you've gotten the picture that as I moved to more adult organisms,

665
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:44.990
as I move to more specific regions of the brain,
for example,

666
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.520
I can still find progenitor cells that have some potential,

667
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.370
but,
but,
uh,
it's harder to find.

668
00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.210
They're more limited numbers and in general,
um,
um,

669
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.860
more difficult until eventually down this pathway you have fully differentiated

670
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:01.550
cells,

671
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.440
cells that are fully mature and performing the function of the mature Oregon.

672
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.550
And so the two largest populations of cells within the brain are neurons,

673
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:15.570
the ones that actually transmit electrical activity and responsible for,
uh,

674
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:16.680
the main,
uh,

675
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:20.510
functions we think of when we think of the brain and supporting cells called

676
00:44:20.511 --> 00:44:21.344
glial cells,

677
00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.250
which are responsible for sort of creating the right sort of environment for

678
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.320
neurons to function.

679
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.970
I wanted to talk about one last concept,

680
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:35.340
and this is one of the boxes from chapter five,

681
00:44:35.341 --> 00:44:39.600
and you've already been using this,
uh,
using this in your homework,

682
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:44.730
but I just wanted to talk about one last concept and that has to do with cell

683
00:44:44.731 --> 00:44:48.510
proliferation.
And we've been talking about,
uh,
about,
uh,
you know,

684
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:50.140
single-cell or some,
some,

685
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:55.190
some subset of sales and propagating them so that you get a larger population of

686
00:44:55.381 --> 00:44:58.230
cells.
And of course this happens all the time in the body.

687
00:44:58.231 --> 00:45:01.590
There are cells within your body that are always in the process of division and

688
00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:05.100
forming new cells.
And sometimes this is for,
uh,

689
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:08.520
for a tissue where sales only have a finite lifetime.

690
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.230
The red blood cells that carry oxygen only live within your circulation for

691
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.420
about a month.
And so you have to continually be replacing cells that are dying.

692
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.020
So there are cells that are proliferating.

693
00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.970
Cell proliferation is a huge issue in cell culture.
One of the main fund,

694
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:28.830
one of the main things that we use cell culture or,
or,
uh,

695
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:29.790
or,
uh,

696
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:34.590
maintenance of cells outside the body for is to make more copies of cells.

697
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.030
One of the purposes of cell culture is to make many,

698
00:45:39.031 --> 00:45:42.390
many more cells under controlled conditions where I can understand what those

699
00:45:42.391 --> 00:45:46.970
cells are.
And so in general,
when cells are proliferating,
they're,
uh,

700
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.130
they're dividing and they're dividing at a regular rate.

701
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:54.720
And what that means is that one way to describe that mathematically is shown

702
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:57.180
here.
If x is the number of cells,

703
00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:02.390
then the rate of change of x Dxdt the rate of change of the cell population,

704
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:09.530
how fast division has taken is proportional to the number of cells to have right

705
00:46:09.991 --> 00:46:12.790
in.
This makes sense,
right?
That the,
the,

706
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.690
the rate at which the cell population is growing,

707
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.130
the derivative DXDT is proportional to the number of sales I have.

708
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.440
The more sales I have,
the faster they can grow,
right?

709
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:25.710
Fewer cells grows more slowly.

710
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.850
And this is an example of an exponential growth process

711
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:34.170
and you're familiar with processes like these,

712
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:36.540
but if you solve this differential equation,

713
00:46:36.541 --> 00:46:40.230
which you don't need to do for the course,
but I showed here,

714
00:46:40.231 --> 00:46:42.720
some of you will understand immediately where this comes from.

715
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:48.050
That means that the number of sales I have at any particular time is equal to

716
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:53.900
the number of cells that I have at some starting time times e to the power mew

717
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.980
here.
Um,
where,

718
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:03.390
and it should be mew t looks like there's a Typo in the book.

719
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.950
Yeah.
You just can't see it here.
Maybe,
um,

720
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:13.160
each of the mew tea or this constant times time and this constant mew,

721
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.070
which is the proportionality constant between the number of cells and the rate

722
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:21.810
of growth is a constant that characterizes how fast a cell population is
growing.

723
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:26.190
Some will be growing very rapidly,
some will be growing less rapidly.

724
00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.580
And what this,
what this equation shows you here is how to relate that,
uh,

725
00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.640
that growth constant mew or that rate of growth to the doubling time of cells.

726
00:47:36.161 --> 00:47:38.950
How long does it take for the population of sales to double?

727
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:44.490
And one of the interesting properties of cells that are an exponential growth is

728
00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:46.090
that the time to increase the,

729
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:51.370
to increase the cell number by a factor of two is always the same.
Right?

730
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:52.091
And that makes sense.

731
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:56.860
If you think about this process of cell multiplication that I have one cell,

732
00:47:56.861 --> 00:47:57.910
it becomes two cells.

733
00:47:57.911 --> 00:48:02.410
In a minute it could become four cells and another minute it can become eight

734
00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:06.740
cells in another minute.
Right?
And that's all that this,
uh,

735
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:10.570
that this,
um,
set of equations is representing

736
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:17.200
questions about that.
Good.

737
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:18.640
I'll see you in section this afternoon.
