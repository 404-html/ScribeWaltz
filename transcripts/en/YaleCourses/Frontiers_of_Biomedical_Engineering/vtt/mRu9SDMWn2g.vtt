1
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.290
What I'm going to talk about today is to continue our discussion about what is

2
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.920
biomedical engineering and go a little bit further and we'll spend about half

3
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.210
the class doing that.

4
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.080
And then I want to spend the last half of the class talking about some

5
00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:30.640
biological structures that are very important and that you might not be familiar

6
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:34.590
with,
but I'll talk about biological membranes and lipids and how,
uh,

7
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.910
how they're assembled.
But first,

8
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:40.750
so first I want to start with the assignment I gave you last time when I asked

9
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:45.010
you all to think about these two questions and write some things down.
And let's,

10
00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:49.090
let's start with the first with ey on this list here.
What,

11
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.630
what products of biomedical engineering have you encountered?

12
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.740
And we've talked about a few of these last time,
but,
but,
uh,

13
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:57.550
I'm sure there's others.
So what,

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.130
what things did you come up with as you were thinking?

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.470
<v 1>Anybody?
Yeah.</v>

16
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.890
Okay.
Um,

17
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.470
<v 0>so in the category of already available</v>

18
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.210
<v 1>drug delivery patches</v>

19
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.730
<v 0>and these are now available for,
for a variety of,
of drugs scope Allah means.</v>

20
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:34.250
So for motion sickness was one of the first that was available.
Um,
and uh,
uh,

21
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.830
Nitroglycerin for treating heart disease is already available and these are

22
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.240
really like bandaids,

23
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.200
but they're bandaids that are loaded with drugs and they're designed in such a

24
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.900
way that if you apply this,
uh,
this,
uh,

25
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.930
this bandaid with adhesive to your skin drug will enter your bloodstream from

26
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:56.730
the bandaid through the skin.
And that's been,
uh,
that's I think a good example.

27
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.683
Others?

28
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.243
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.910
<v 0>Dissolvable stitches or sutures.</v>

30
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.670
Now what,
what needs to be engineered in those?

31
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.811
So they,

32
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:19.200
they have to be engineered to be a nerd so that they can be safely inside a

33
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.100
system and there's not,

34
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:23.820
not every material you could pick would have that property.
And it's a,

35
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:26.640
it's a suture or stitch has to hold the wound closed.

36
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:30.210
So it has to have certain mechanical strength and imagine the problem of making

37
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:32.460
something that's dissolvable so it disappears,

38
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:37.461
but also is strong enough to hold a wound close reliably for a length of time.

39
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.410
<v 1>Others,
yeah,</v>

40
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.440
<v 0>arthroscopic surgery.
And so what do you,
what are you thinking about there?</v>

41
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.991
Yeah.

42
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:56.850
So you can think about the instruments that they use and arthroscopic surgery.

43
00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.860
Arthro means joint scopic means looking.

44
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.930
So it's looking into a joint and these are instruments that have very fine sort

45
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:07.780
of,
uh,
needles on the end,

46
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.020
but also cameras in them and you can put them inside a joint and then look

47
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.700
around and see what's happening inside.
And not just a camera,

48
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:18.520
but there are also tools on the end of these things.
So you can,

49
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.150
you can cut and uh,
you can do manipulations,
uh,

50
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.470
through this instrument.
So that's,
that's a great example also.
Yeah.

51
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.753
<v 1>Hearing aids,</v>

52
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.110
that's a good one.
Others?
Yeah,

53
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.860
<v 0>cochlear implants.
So that's um,
um,</v>

54
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.100
the same kind of a function as a hearing aid to improve,

55
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.920
uh,
to improve hearing but,
but using a different mechanism,

56
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.770
not just an amplification system that you put in your year,

57
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.670
but actually an implant that replaces the function of an organ inside your ear.

58
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.290
That's a good example.
Others,

59
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.960
it must be a couple of others.

60
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.673
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.560
<v 0>Contact Lenses.</v>

62
00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.400
<v 1>Yup.
Yup.
Lasik surgery</v>

63
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.530
now,
why,
why that one?

64
00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:35.600
What makes you think of that as a example?

65
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.381
<v 0>Instruments,</v>

66
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:46.150
it involves lasers and learning how to make lasers that can,
um,

67
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.100
do the right amount of damage to tissue,
right.

68
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:54.460
Because that's what the laser is doing and the surgery is cutting like a knife

69
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.170
would do.
Uh,
but doing the right amount of damage and controlling it with the,

70
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.000
with light is an advanced there.

71
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.080
<v 1>Others?
Yeah.</v>

72
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.890
Tissue culturing.

73
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.290
Now what

74
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.930
<v 0>to be engineered in a tissue culturing.</v>

75
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.153
<v 1>I beg your pardon.</v>

76
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.990
<v 0>So what,
what kinds of engineering do you think goes on behind that?</v>

77
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.610
The technology that they use and,

78
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:39.190
and really there's quite a lot of technology here starting from the plates that

79
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:42.430
you grow them in,
turn out to be engineered so they have the right properties.

80
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.160
And we're going to talk about this more when we talk about,
uh,

81
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:47.660
about cell culturing,
uh,
later and,

82
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.640
and we'll talk about lots of potential applications of that as well.

83
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.420
<v 1>Yup.
Dialysis.</v>

84
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.080
And this is a method

85
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.913
<v 0>to,
uh,</v>

86
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.430
replace or augment the function of your kidneys to remove,
uh,

87
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.690
waste products really from the blood,

88
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.850
which is something the kidney does continuously.

89
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.473
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.090
<v 0>Cosmetic surgery.</v>

91
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.670
And you gave two examples.
One was botox

92
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.550
and the other was,
uh,
was a liposuction.

93
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.270
So two different kinds of strategies,
right?
One is a surgical strategy,

94
00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:38.590
actually removing tissue.

95
00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:42.700
When we talked a little bit about the engineering of surgical instruments and

96
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:43.630
things like and all,

97
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.210
so there's a lot of biomedical engineering that goes into everything that

98
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:47.470
happens in the operating room.

99
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.540
And Botox is an injection of a molecule,
right?

100
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.530
Or a complex molecule,
but a molecule.
Um,
so how,

101
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.570
in what ways would that be biomedical engineering.

102
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.520
So,
right.
And I think all those are good.
So there's,

103
00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.690
there's lots of different ways.

104
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:26.320
One is in terms of how you deliver the molecule so it goes where you want it to

105
00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:28.030
go and not where else she wanted to go.

106
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:31.210
And that's an engineering problem that we're going to talk a lot about how to

107
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:35.410
deliver drugs so that you get the action that you want at the site that you want

108
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:38.740
and not the toxicity,
right?
If you delivered botox all over your body,

109
00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:39.940
that wouldn't be a good thing.

110
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.970
Might not even be a good thing if you deliver it in one place in your body.

111
00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:44.980
But it's definitely not good if you deliver it everywhere.

112
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:47.830
And so controlling the dose is really important and that's going to turn out to

113
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:51.040
be very important in cancer therapy,
right?

114
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.960
Because these are very potent drugs that will have bad effects and other sites

115
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:59.050
and you want to localize them where they want.
So we're going to talk about that,

116
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:03.250
but I think this is a good list.
So let's go and,
and think about,
uh,

117
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.790
what might be a little bit more challenging.
Uh,
so in the future,

118
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.220
what things do you think,
uh,

119
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.650
biomedical engineering is going to produce in the future?
Yeah,

120
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.430
an AIDS vaccine.

121
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.870
Uh,
robotic surgery.

122
00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.030
Yeah.
Robotic surgery.

123
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.603
<v 1>Yup.</v>

124
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.110
<v 0>Artificial artificial hearts that can be used long term.
And that,</v>

125
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.120
and that is a,
there's probably several elements to that.
One is,

126
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.680
one is longterm,

127
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.320
making them compatible with the body so that you could tolerate it for long
term.

128
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.830
And the other thing means if it's going to be long term than probably it has to

129
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:02.880
be implantable.

130
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.460
And that means all of the heart has to be implantable.
Right?

131
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:12.030
And this is where we don't have something that satisfies both of those

132
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:13.170
categories right now.

133
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:16.440
So imagine how much power it takes to drive an artificial heart.

134
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.180
So you've got to have a battery or some way of generating power continuously.
Um,

135
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.650
yeah.
Uh,
to operate that and that makes it difficult to think about implantable.

136
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:28.410
And so that's a really good example of biomedical engineering.

137
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.220
<v 1>Yup.
Yeah.</v>

138
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.240
Food supplies,

139
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.530
<v 0>food,
food from cloned animals.</v>

140
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.130
And we're gonna talk about cloning next week,
but why would,

141
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.430
why would cloning be an advantage in,
in producing food?

142
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.910
<v 0>Control the quality because cloned animals are all genetically identical.
Right.</v>

144
00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:02.990
And so you wouldn't have variability that in that way.

145
00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:05.870
And so potentially you could have,
you know,

146
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:10.700
pick an individual that has really good quality meat and,

147
00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:13.220
and uh,
and always reproduce that same

148
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.003
<v 1>thing.
Yeah.</v>

149
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.160
<v 0>Genetic Scans for a disease</v>

150
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.823
<v 1>prediction.</v>

151
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.920
<v 0>And we talked about one way you might do that using gene chips last time.</v>

152
00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:39.790
We talked very little about that.
And so we'll talk more about that next week.

153
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.260
But certainly a technology is going to be available and there,

154
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.970
but there's going to be need to be ways developed to put this technology

155
00:10:45.971 --> 00:10:47.080
together,
right?

156
00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:51.790
If we looked at all 30,000 genes that were important in each individual,

157
00:10:51.791 --> 00:10:55.030
how do you pick out which ones are important for a particular disease or what?

158
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.250
And often it's not going to be just one gene,
right?

159
00:10:57.251 --> 00:10:58.810
It's going to be combinations of genes.

160
00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:03.811
And how do you predict the fate of the individual based on all of the genes that

161
00:11:03.881 --> 00:11:06.820
you know to be involved in progression of a certain disease?
Right?

162
00:11:06.821 --> 00:11:10.780
So it's not just knowing what genes are figuring out ways to look at gene

163
00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:11.590
expression,

164
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:16.590
it's figuring out how this expression of key genes affects the fate of the

165
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:22.210
individual.
Right?
And that's really a complex systems problem.

166
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.140
The kind of problems that engineers are very good at at,
at dealing with

167
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.060
<v 1>others.
A couple more.
Yeah.</v>

168
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.160
<v 0>Yeah.
So I'm gonna,</v>

169
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.450
I'm gonna call that chips implanted in the brain to control prosthetics,

170
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:43.170
but I'm going to make it a little bit more general and call it a brain machine

171
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:44.040
interface.

172
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.720
So some way of interfacing activity in your brain with,

173
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.250
with the outside world.
And uh,
we'll,
we'll talk about this as we go along,

174
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:56.610
but there's lots of reasons to think that we're,
uh,

175
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.750
that we're going to have this in the,
in the not too distant

176
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.910
<v 1>future generations.
Yeah.</v>

177
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.830
<v 0>Spinal cord regeneration.</v>

178
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.030
<v 1>That's a good one.
Yup.
Sure.</v>

179
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:19.370
Oregon or Oregon or that can be cultivated or anything like a single style.

180
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.300
<v 0>Uh,
so Oregon's</v>

181
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.390
grown from single cells.

182
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.523
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.940
<v 0>I didn't,
I didn't hear the last part.</v>

184
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.050
<v 1>Be able to do like an X.
Right.</v>

185
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.940
<v 0>Oh,
so,
um,
so imaging,</v>

186
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:51.813
<v 1>okay.</v>

187
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.680
<v 0>Of moving parts,</v>

188
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.300
like the joy,

189
00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.680
like a joint or another moving part that might be interesting to look at.

190
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:06.440
Emotion is the heart,
right?
If you could,
if you could image how the heart is,

191
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.340
is moving,
you would know a lot about its function.

192
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:14.610
You can patch,
you learn a lot about its function by,
by looking at how it moves,

193
00:13:14.611 --> 00:13:16.920
not just a static picture of it.
Right.

194
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.080
And there's lots of parts of our bodies that,
that move the lungs for example.

195
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.110
And um,
so yeah,
that's a good one.

196
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.100
<v 1>Two more.
Yeah.</v>

197
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.100
<v 0>Artificial,
artificial pancreas.</v>

198
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.280
Now how are you thinking that might work?

199
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.030
So,
so maybe,
and here are thinking about the,
the,
the,

200
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.560
the pancreas has many functions,

201
00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:10.450
but one of its important functions is to secrete insulin.
And so,
um,

202
00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.640
and diabetics have lost that normal function.

203
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.480
So what if you could take just a pump that's able,

204
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:22.540
it's capable of continuously administering insulin at various rates and connect

205
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:27.951
it to a sensor that's able to continuously measure the sugar level in your

206
00:14:28.251 --> 00:14:29.570
blood.
Right?

207
00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:33.110
And insulin is important for regulating levels of sugar in your blood.
Well,

208
00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:38.111
if you can continuously measure and then give the amount of insulin you need to

209
00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:40.040
compensate for that amount of blood,

210
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:45.020
those things could work together to be a totally artificial pancreas.

211
00:14:45.021 --> 00:14:47.360
Meaning tote made it totally out of synthetic parts.

212
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:53.110
Now another approach would be to take pieces of the pancreas that already have

213
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:56.120
all that capability within them.

214
00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:00.650
And individual cells of the pancreas are capable of,
of a healthy pancreas,

215
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:04.670
are capable of both sensing glucose and secreting insulin.

216
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.661
So what did,

217
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:09.500
you can take cells from a healthy individual and put them into a diabetic

218
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:14.501
individual than maybe those new cells you put in would function as a totally

219
00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.170
natural artificial pancreas.
Now,
why isn't that done?

220
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.230
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

221
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.210
<v 0>why,
why doesn't that already work</v>

222
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.603
<v 1>do you think?</v>

223
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:31.910
<v 0>What are the engineering problems to overcome to get that to work?</v>

224
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

225
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.450
<v 0>The same problems with organ transplantation is that the recipient has to be</v>

226
00:15:42.451 --> 00:15:46.710
matched to the donor.
And so that's a,

227
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.820
that that's a problem.
And uh,
that's,
that's a big problem.

228
00:15:50.821 --> 00:15:55.821
And so can you protect these cells that you give to the recipient from attack by

229
00:15:56.671 --> 00:16:00.090
the recipient's immune system?
That's one challenge.

230
00:16:00.091 --> 00:16:04.470
And we'll talk about ways to think about engineering approaches to,

231
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.310
to solve that problem.
One more.

232
00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.913
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.120
<v 0>Control of angiogenesis.
And angiogenesis.</v>

234
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.180
Angio means a blood and genesis means new.

235
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.300
And so angiogenesis is a development of new blood vessels.

236
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.990
And many people believe that tumors,

237
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.460
most tumors require blood vessels in order to grow.

238
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.840
If a tumor starts to grow and it doesn't develop a vascular supply,

239
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.940
it doesn't develop blood vessels in it,

240
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.130
then it can't get bigger than a certain size.

241
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:49.160
And there's lots of evidence for many cancers showing that this is true.

242
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.150
So if you could stop a tumor from being able to develop blood vessels,

243
00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:56.750
you might be able to stop its growth and its stage where it's not harmful.

244
00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:57.980
In fact,

245
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.030
I don't know if in the news that the pioneer in this is a man named Judah

246
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:06.680
Folkman who was a surgeon who first first speculated that this was important and

247
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.220
sadly he died on,
uh,
on,
uh,
Monday,
uh,

248
00:17:10.221 --> 00:17:14.750
but had a dramatic impact on our understanding of how cancers develop in people

249
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:18.650
and new approaches.
And so there already are some approaches like this that are,

250
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.640
that are working.
Uh,
but there's more that needs to be done.
So,
um,

251
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.680
of these things that are up here,

252
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:29.920
are any that seemed controversial to you or that you would have said wasn't on

253
00:17:30.351 --> 00:17:33.710
my list and I wouldn't say that that's biomedical engineering.

254
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

255
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.380
<v 0>Controversial in what sense?</v>

256
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.920
<v 1>Controlling your body where it was that</v>

257
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.200
<v 0>so,</v>

258
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.150
so controversial has sense that maybe it's not a good thing to do or there might

259
00:17:59.151 --> 00:18:02.990
be some limits on what we want to do there in terms of integrating machines with

260
00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:07.840
people's brains.
And I think that's probably probably right.

261
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:12.380
And it might be some of the others here where there might be some,

262
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:17.540
uh,
some concerns or are there others that have kind of concerns like that?

263
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.960
Yeah.
And so some issues about how these technologies might be applied,
right?

264
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:37.050
If you had genetic scans that were available for disease prediction,

265
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.440
do you want to know everything that's going to happen to you in terms of

266
00:18:40.441 --> 00:18:44.010
susceptibility to disease?
Well,
probably you want to know some of it,

267
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:45.930
but you might not want to know all of it,
right?

268
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:47.490
You might not want to know all of it.

269
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.290
And that's a really complicated a question for an individual to figure out and a

270
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:56.670
complicated question for society to figure out what you want to make available,

271
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:58.590
uh,
in that regard.
Yeah.

272
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:06.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

273
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:10.340
<v 0>And if you can,
if you can start to predict,
well,
you're going to,</v>

274
00:19:10.341 --> 00:19:13.820
you're going to have heart disease that starts to develop when you're 45 and

275
00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:17.000
you're looking to buy insurance when you're 30 or you're looking for a job when

276
00:19:17.001 --> 00:19:17.834
you're 30,

277
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.890
and that information is available to your insurance company or your employer

278
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.540
that could have dramatic effects right on,
on,

279
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.550
uh,
the,
the choices that you get to make.
And so that,
that's,

280
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:36.140
that's really does,
these are really difficult questions to answer and we'll,

281
00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:39.170
we'll,
we'll talk about,
we'll raise these issues as they come up.

282
00:19:39.171 --> 00:19:43.100
We'll try to raise them with all the technologies.
We won't try to answer them.

283
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:43.520
Uh,

284
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.490
there are probably better people at Yale to answer those kinds of questions than

285
00:19:46.491 --> 00:19:48.560
I am.
We'll talk about the technology and the,

286
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:50.210
and the questions that it brings up,

287
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.060
but I hope some of you get interested in these would be good topics to think

288
00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:54.830
about for term papers as well.

289
00:19:54.831 --> 00:19:57.930
For those of you that have that kind of inclination.
Um,

290
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.550
but any that seemed like controversial or or,

291
00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:04.880
or like I don't think that's biomedical engineering or that's not what I want to

292
00:20:04.881 --> 00:20:07.460
learn about in this course.
And you put it that way.

293
00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:10.280
I hope we don't spend a week talking about that one.

294
00:20:10.281 --> 00:20:13.370
Cause that's not what I thought.
Biomedical engineering was.

295
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.080
Any of these were they all seem on the mark.

296
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.230
<v 1>Okay.
Yeah.</v>

297
00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.830
<v 0>Food from cloned animals.
Yeah.</v>

298
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.230
You didn't expect that to be biomedical engineering.

299
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.650
Yeah.
So what,
why we,
it came

300
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.120
<v 1>that and making it</v>

301
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.750
<v 0>so I think I see where you wouldn't,
you wouldn't see it.</v>

302
00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.070
I see how you could put in that category and how you would be surprised to put

303
00:21:00.071 --> 00:21:03.910
in that category.
It should be in the category because it's,

304
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.340
it's engineering to be able to do this.
Right.

305
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:10.210
And it's a biological system that you've engineered from taking cells from one

306
00:21:10.211 --> 00:21:13.090
organism and cloning them and developing a whole nother organism.

307
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.260
And it's also engineering that helps humans,
right.

308
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:22.261
Because nutrition is one going to be one of the big problems of your generation,

309
00:21:22.661 --> 00:21:26.830
right.
How them have enough nutritious food for the population as it grows.

310
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.600
And even to understand what individuals should eat.
What should I be eating?

311
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:35.950
That's a really complicated question that we've gotten very confused about,
uh,

312
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.910
in large part because our government has confused us about it,
but,
uh,

313
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.440
but it's a confusing question to know.
Uh,
and um,

314
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.210
and so I think engineers have a role to play in that.
Um,

315
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.860
but it's not sort of classical biomedical engineering and the way that

316
00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:54.280
developing an artificial heart is where you can see that.
Right?

317
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.570
But I think it's a good example of a place where biomedical engineers or the

318
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:00.310
future are going to contribute.

319
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.670
So I want to try to put this together into a form that I've come to understand

320
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:11.360
what biomedical engineering is,
um,
and,
uh,
presented to you.
Um,

321
00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:16.560
and not only am I not an ethicist and I'm not good at those kinds of problems.

322
00:22:16.721 --> 00:22:21.520
I'm not much of an artist either.
Um,
so this is a person you can,

323
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.120
you can recognize it as a person.
Uh,
but let's say it was a person a long,

324
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:30.121
long time ago and there was a point when one person,

325
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.300
uh,

326
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.300
decided to take instruments that were around them and use them to improve their

327
00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:39.280
life.
You know,

328
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.360
somebody thought about a wheel or some group of people discovered how to use a

329
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:46.870
wheel,
some a knife and,
and some levers.

330
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:49.840
And these were very useful things and improving the quality of their life.

331
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.860
And that was probably that,
that's who you would call the first engineer,
right?

332
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.930
And then some,

333
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:59.440
it couldn't have been too long after those instruments became available,

334
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:03.370
but somebody will call them the first biomedical engineer decided to use those

335
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:08.371
instruments to look at either themselves or probably more likely their neighbor,

336
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:12.250
right?
Take a knife and open up the skin and let's see what's inside,

337
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:15.190
how do these fascinating things around me work.

338
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.580
And so people started turning these machines they developed on themselves to try

339
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:23.580
to understand how they worked.
Right?

340
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.350
And this is one aspect of biomedical engineering,

341
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:31.150
developing tools that allow you to understand how humans function and what's

342
00:23:31.151 --> 00:23:32.560
wrong when they have disease.

343
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:37.660
And so some of the things we've talked about have that have that category.
Um,

344
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:43.120
um,
arthroscopic surgery in one sense is a,
is a fancy example of that,

345
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:47.990
a way of looking inside a joint to see what's happening inside a while the

346
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:52.040
person is alive and without hurting them.
Um,
and,

347
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.120
uh,

348
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.920
imaging of moving parts that same way is sort of an advance in that,

349
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.190
oops,
I hit the wrong one.
Um,

350
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:05.150
and as these tools became applied more and more widely,

351
00:24:05.151 --> 00:24:08.060
we learned more about how human physiology worked.

352
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.560
And as we learned about how humans operate,
uh,

353
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.440
we could start to design machines that would help humans when they weren't

354
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:16.550
functioning properly.

355
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.900
And I think the simplest example was that once we learned that there were bones

356
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:25.901
or hard elements inside the leg and that those bones were important in keeping a

357
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:31.211
leg straight so that you could stand up than somebody could invent an artificial

358
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:32.383
bone,

359
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.500
a splint that would be wrapped around that would be secured to the outside of

360
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:40.880
the leg to give you a mechanical support even after you fell out of a tree and

361
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:42.770
you broke your leg.
Right.

362
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.890
And so this is another kind of engineering and engineering,

363
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:48.680
not to look more closely at how humans work,

364
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.670
but an engineering to improve their function,
uh,
when it's failing.

365
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:56.030
And as time goes on,

366
00:24:56.031 --> 00:24:59.390
we've developed ever more complex machines to study people.

367
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.900
And we've talked about some of these already EKG machines.

368
00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:07.901
So an example of an electrical device that can be used to monitor a very

369
00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:10.280
elaborate function deep inside your body,

370
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.650
the beating of your heart and the rhythm of your heart.

371
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.900
And we talked about modern imaging methods and this is an example of an Fmo Ri,

372
00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.580
a functional Mri,
uh,
um,
um,

373
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.810
a map of the brain that not only shows you the anatomy of the brain,

374
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:26.810
but shows you something about the chemistry of what's going on inside.

375
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.140
And you can put somebody in an MRI machine now and have them read a book and

376
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:37.250
look at what parts of their brain become activated when they're reading and what

377
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:40.730
parts stop activating when they stop reading.

378
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.720
So you can learn where in their brain is reading done.

379
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.110
You can ask them to read French and to read Spanish.

380
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.530
And you can find different locations in the brain that are involved in

381
00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:55.010
processing of those different languages.
And these are,
uh,

382
00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:00.320
really incredible tools for understanding deep inside the body what's happening.

383
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.740
And we can even understand it on a molecular or cellular level now.

384
00:26:03.741 --> 00:26:05.510
So this is a picture of a patch clamp.

385
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.520
It's a device that engineer's built to facet on to individual cells,

386
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:15.410
uh,
in order to look at how molecules in the membrane of the cell are working.

387
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:18.740
And I'll,
I'll talk a little bit about that as we go along.

388
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.890
So we can understand down to a very fine level now because of machines that

389
00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:28.790
we've built and as our understanding has improved and we've been able to build

390
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.990
more complicated approaches to,
uh,

391
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:36.320
to replacing function.
We talked about the artificial hip,

392
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.580
which is a modern precursor of the splint I talked about before.

393
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.860
Much more sophisticated in terms of the,

394
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.010
that are required and the design thinking that goes behind it.

395
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:52.160
So now somebody can get an artificial hip and they can live for many decades

396
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:56.460
with it.
And have almost full function of that hip over that period of time.

397
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.460
Uh,
this is an example of a,

398
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.060
of a rudimentary brain machine interface.

399
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.700
It's a device called a,

400
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.800
a deep brain stimulator developed by a company called Medtronic and it looks

401
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:13.020
like a pacemaker that's implanted inside your body.

402
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:17.040
Here is a pacemaker and this pacemaker does the same thing that a heart

403
00:27:17.041 --> 00:27:20.730
pacemaker does.
It generates periodic electrical signals,

404
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.460
but instead of those signals going to your heart,

405
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:28.200
they go into the brain that go through these wires and into these electrodes

406
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:32.070
that are deep in your brain and they stimulate tissue inside the brain.

407
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.280
And we've found that stimulation,

408
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.750
electrical stimulation deep in the brain can help patients that have Parkinson's

409
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:44.751
disease and can reduce the tremors and loss of muscle control that many patients

410
00:27:45.781 --> 00:27:47.400
with Parkinson's disease use.

411
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.300
Now these are electrodes that are only sending out signals right there.

412
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:53.670
They're producing electrical signals in the brain.

413
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:58.560
They're not recording from the brain,
but it's not that big of a difference.

414
00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.870
Right.
And,
uh,

415
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:04.140
it won't be long before we're using these same kinds of devices to both record,

416
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:09.300
to test what's going on and to act in the right way in response.

417
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.480
And this is the beginning of a real interface between machines and brains and

418
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.650
dialysis.
This is an example of a,
of a membrane dialysis unit.

419
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:24.780
Dialysis has done millions of times per day in this country and around the world

420
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.580
and keeps people alive when their kidneys have failed and they wouldn't survive

421
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.710
for even a week without dialysis.

422
00:28:31.711 --> 00:28:36.711
And you can keep people alive for many decades with periodic dialysis to remove

423
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:40.940
waste products from the blood.
So we'll talk about,
um,
these,
uh,

424
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:45.360
these examples.
What I want to leave you with is,

425
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.440
is my picture not a very elaborate picture of what biomedical engineering is to

426
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:56.190
me and two parts of it.
One,

427
00:28:56.191 --> 00:29:00.330
developing ways to understand how humans work better,

428
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.060
how human physiology operates,
and second,

429
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:08.240
developing new approaches for replacing function in people when they're sick.

430
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.960
I want to talk about,
uh,

431
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.160
move on and talk a little bit about some general concepts from physiology that

432
00:29:17.161 --> 00:29:18.420
are really important.

433
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:23.540
And here is a table that gives characteristics of an average person and this

434
00:29:23.821 --> 00:29:28.380
would be an average adult male,
uh,
30 years old,

435
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.860
the average height and weight and a surface area and temperature and lots of

436
00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:38.430
characteristics of,
of an average,
uh,
person.

437
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.910
And let's think about some of these like,
wait,
um,

438
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.380
we think a lot about weight in this country,
uh,

439
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:52.410
but wait is a remarkably carefully controlled parameter of a person that is,

440
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:59.680
you have to work pretty hard to gain weight or to lose weight,
right?

441
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.520
We take in a lot of food and water every day,

442
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:05.320
every year and yet most of us,

443
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:09.730
our weight stays remarkably stable over that period of time for adults,

444
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.630
right?
Despite how much we eat and how much we drink.

445
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.260
And your body is able to regulate your weight fairly well without you really

446
00:30:17.261 --> 00:30:19.090
thinking about it.
And anybody,

447
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.360
you're all too young to have tried to lose weight yet.

448
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:25.600
But when you get to be older and you start to think about as your metabolism

449
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.700
changes,
trying to control your weight,
you realize how hard it is to do right?

450
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:34.600
And you know this because people spend a lot of energy thinking about it.
Wait,

451
00:30:34.601 --> 00:30:36.490
does remarkably well controlled.

452
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.360
If you let your body do its business

453
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.110
also temperature,

454
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.650
you can measure your temperature and you'd find variations throughout the day or

455
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:52.420
maybe some throughout the year,
but within a remarkably narrow range,

456
00:30:52.421 --> 00:30:53.830
your temperature is controlled.

457
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.090
When you go from here to going outside to going to a much hotter room,

458
00:30:58.091 --> 00:31:01.810
your temperature stays the same and your body is able to control this on your

459
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:04.150
own.
You don't have to think about it,
and in fact,

460
00:31:04.151 --> 00:31:08.800
temperature is such a carefully controlled parameter that when it changes just a

461
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:13.150
little bit by a couple of degrees,
we know that something's wrong,
right?

462
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.210
You measure your temperature is a little up,
you've got a fever,

463
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.210
something's wrong.
I better find out what that is.

464
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.320
It's because temperature is a very highly controlled variable and you could go

465
00:31:23.321 --> 00:31:27.640
through a lot of these parameters and think about it in the same way that these

466
00:31:27.641 --> 00:31:30.520
things are really very highly controlled.
Well,

467
00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:35.521
that process of control to maintain a constant environment inside our body,

468
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.970
whether it's an environment of constant mass or constant composition or constant

469
00:31:42.971 --> 00:31:45.340
temperature is called homeostasis.

470
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.560
Your body has elaborate mechanisms for maintaining this state of homeostasis.

471
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:52.780
That is things staying the same,

472
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:57.370
the body stays the same homeostasis.
And this,

473
00:31:57.371 --> 00:32:01.510
in spite of the fact that we take a variety of chemicals into our bodies in

474
00:32:01.511 --> 00:32:05.560
different ways,
and we have to do that to stay alive,
uh,

475
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:10.561
but are we have mechanisms to control this very well.

476
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:15.940
So homeostasis is enabled by sometimes complex,

477
00:32:15.941 --> 00:32:19.210
sometimes very simple control mechanisms.

478
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:23.290
And these are mechanisms that can be described not too differently from

479
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:27.400
mechanisms that you're familiar with,
for maintaining homeostasis.
For example,

480
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.100
the thermostat in your,
in your dorm room,

481
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.100
maybe you don't control thermostats in your dorm room.

482
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:35.510
Some of you do and some of you don't.
Probably a,

483
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.080
and maybe it doesn't work very well,
so it might not be a good example.

484
00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:41.840
But imagine a perfect thermostat that you set for a temperature and then the

485
00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:45.320
temperature stays the same inside the room,

486
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.890
no matter what the temperature is outside.
Well,
how does that work?

487
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.550
It works by a control mechanism called negative feedback,

488
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.300
and that the thermostat is measuring the temperature.

489
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:57.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

490
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.570
<v 0>The thermostat is measuring the temperature and then sending a signal to a</v>

491
00:33:00.571 --> 00:33:04.500
heater somewhere.
If the temperature drops below a certain level,

492
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.350
it sends a signal turn on the heat.

493
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

494
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.670
<v 0>And that signal stays on until it gets a negative signal to turn off.</v>

495
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.530
When does that negative signal happen?

496
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.730
When the temperature gets above the level you want it to be,
right.

497
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.750
And so that's a negative feedback control system.
The heater is on,

498
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:27.950
it's producing heat until a negative signal is registered.
Oh,

499
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.320
we've gone to high and then it turns off.

500
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.680
And our bodies have mechanisms like that that mainly use the principle of

501
00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:40.940
negative feedback in order to control the parameters that are important for life

502
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.930
within a certain range.
So why is temperature,
for example,

503
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:47.750
such an important thing to control?
Why?

504
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:52.751
Why are all of us in this room within plus or minus a few tenths of a degrees at

505
00:33:54.261 --> 00:33:58.250
37 degrees centigrade or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit?

506
00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.320
Why is that such an important thing?

507
00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.013
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

508
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.550
<v 0>because that's the temperature at which many of the molecules in our bodies</v>

509
00:34:11.551 --> 00:34:15.090
operate at their most efficient.
And enzymes is the best example of that.

510
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:20.270
Enzymes work best enzymes are proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in our

511
00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:24.900
bodies,
operate by elaborate networks of chemical reactions.

512
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.560
And our enzymes are optimized to work at 37 degrees.

513
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:32.880
When we're off from that temperature,
then they don't work properly.
Right?

514
00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.170
And there are other examples as well,
but that's uh,
that's why it's important.

515
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:45.850
Um,
so we're going to think about,
uh,
in the next few weeks,

516
00:34:45.851 --> 00:34:47.480
we're going to think about,
um,

517
00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.910
the human organism at different levels of magnification.

518
00:34:51.911 --> 00:34:54.050
And I've shown those levels here.
Uh,

519
00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:58.300
the whole human organism is made up of a collection of organs and organ systems.

520
00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.970
Uh,
you know,
this,
the cardiovascular system,

521
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.840
which is the heart and the blood vessels which are responsible for and the
blood.

522
00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.670
And so this is responsible for moving blood around the body and the blood brings

523
00:35:09.671 --> 00:35:14.010
oxygen and nutrients to every part of the body at,
you know,
that.
And,
uh,

524
00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:14.800
organs,

525
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:19.210
organ systems like the cardiovascular system are made up of tissues and tissues

526
00:35:19.211 --> 00:35:22.510
are collections of cells that are working in synchrony for some function.

527
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.630
So the heart,
for example,
has a muscular tissue.

528
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:30.610
It has a very well developed muscular tissue and its function is to contract and

529
00:35:30.611 --> 00:35:34.030
relax,
contract and relax.
And as it does that,

530
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.120
it changes the volume of the heart and gives the,

531
00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:42.060
creates the pressure that moves blood around your body,
right?
So it has,

532
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.990
it has that muscular system.
It also has a blood vessel system in it.

533
00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.890
The muscles of the heart have to get blood themselves.

534
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.630
So they have blood vessels.

535
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:56.310
Inside your stomach is a very complex organ that has a muscle layer.

536
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.170
It has an epithelial layer,

537
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:02.240
which is the interface with food that comes in.
Um,

538
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.270
and it also has a nervous system,
right?
So does the heart,
right?

539
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.540
So Oregon's are made up of combinations of tissues where all the tissues are

540
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:15.990
collections of cells that are doing some function,
nervous tissue,

541
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.350
muscular tissue,
epithelium,
tissue are,

542
00:36:19.351 --> 00:36:24.351
those are examples of tissues that form that form a organs.

543
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.710
And so here I just show tissues at two levels of magnification.

544
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:30.210
And when we think about tissues,

545
00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:33.270
we're going to be interested in a couple of different characteristics.

546
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.870
One at the first level,
what are the cells that make up that tissue?

547
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:41.880
Because the cells are the fundamental component of our bodies,

548
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.773
right?

549
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:48.020
And very interesting because all of ourselves and our bodies share many

550
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:49.080
characteristics,
right?

551
00:36:49.081 --> 00:36:52.830
And some of those characteristics are shown on this picture.
They have a nucleus,

552
00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:56.310
they have a cell membrane,
they have organelles throughout them.

553
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.450
They have the same DNA.
All of your cells have the same DNA.

554
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:04.800
So the same genetic information and yet cells in your brain and cells in your

555
00:37:04.801 --> 00:37:09.270
heart and cells in your kidney do very different things,
right?

556
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:12.990
So how can cells which have the same sort of master information,

557
00:37:12.991 --> 00:37:17.991
DNA in your brain and your heart and your kidney be so different?

558
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:23.010
That's a question and it's one that we'll talk about in in weeks to come.

559
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.370
And how do those differences between cells contribute to the properties of the

560
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:29.220
tissues which contribute to the properties of the organs,

561
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:32.760
which contribute to the properties of a person.

562
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:38.030
And this maintenance of homeostasis and the main function of all yourselves and

563
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:42.660
all your tissues and all your organs is to maintain this homeostasis which

564
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:47.160
allows you to live in a changing environment.
All right.
And we're,

565
00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:51.360
so we're going to spend the first few weeks of the course talking about first

566
00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.190
DNA and genes.

567
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.180
We'll talk about how they work and I will go over that quickly cause I know most

568
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:00.330
of you know something about how Dna,
what DNA is and how it works.

569
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:05.310
But then we'll talk about engineering of DNA and why this has been such a,

570
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.620
not only a rapidly growing and advancing area,

571
00:38:07.621 --> 00:38:10.740
but one that's so important for uh,
for biomedical engineering.

572
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.290
We'll talk about cells and how they work,

573
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.170
how cells in different parts of the body are different,

574
00:38:16.171 --> 00:38:18.000
why and how they contribute to tissues.

575
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:22.680
And it in a very sort of simple level so that you can understand this as we

576
00:38:22.681 --> 00:38:26.100
start thinking about using cells for engineering purposes.

577
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.450
So I want to just highlight what's in chapter two because I told you we're not

578
00:38:30.451 --> 00:38:34.820
going to cover the details in chapter two in the course.
Uh,
but,
but this,

579
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:37.390
I give it to you as a resource so that you can,

580
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:40.330
you might have other books which described this which you like and you've read

581
00:38:40.331 --> 00:38:41.200
already.
And so,

582
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.400
but I'm going to assume that you understand this information to some,
uh,

583
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:46.900
to some extent.
And again,

584
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:49.540
if you don't and you feel like you'd like a review session on this,

585
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:51.650
please send me an email and I'll set one up.
Uh,

586
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.540
next week I do want to talk about one in one important,

587
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.870
a subject which you might not have thought too much about.

588
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:03.070
And that's lip ids because lipids are so important to the structure of the body

589
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:06.280
because they make up the membranes that formed the cells that are the

590
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:11.281
fundamental units and lipids are really complex molecules on their own,

591
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:14.350
right.
But because of their particular kind of complexity,

592
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:16.780
they allow certain biological structures to form.

593
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:21.280
So most of the lipids which make up cell membranes in your body are of this

594
00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:23.080
category of Phospho Lipids.

595
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.370
They're derived from a precursor called triacylglyceride,

596
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:32.290
which is a glycerol molecule with three fatty acid chains dangling off of it.

597
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:35.500
And fatty acid chains are fat molecules.

598
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:38.260
They behave if you have a lot of them in solution like oil,

599
00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.830
and that's what triglycerides are like.
They're just like oil.
So if you had,

600
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:47.840
if you had a jar full of triglycerides,
it would,
it would behave like an oil mo.

601
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.780
Many would be liquid at room temperature.
What happens if you add them to water?

602
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.890
You get salad dressing,
right?
You get glob.
If you mix it,

603
00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:02.100
you get glob of oil or globules of triglycerides that are floating around in the

604
00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:06.580
fluid.
If you mix it,
if you let it sit,
they settle out into two phases again,

605
00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:11.880
right?
That's how triglycerides behave.
Now if you've gone to the,
to the,
uh,

606
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.600
doctor,
the often they'll measure your triglyceride level as a,

607
00:40:15.601 --> 00:40:19.000
as a measure of how healthy your liver is.
And how healthy your diet is,

608
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.080
having too much triglyceride or fat in your,
uh,
in your blood.

609
00:40:23.081 --> 00:40:25.810
The wrong kinds of fat in particular is not considered a good thing,

610
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.040
but you need some of it because some of it gets converted into molecules called

611
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:32.680
Phospho.
Lipids and phospholipids are different.

612
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:36.700
They have to fatty acid chains and so these are the oily like parts of the

613
00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:37.271
molecule,

614
00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:40.810
the molecules that behave like oil and then link to the glycerol instead of a

615
00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:45.811
third fatty acid chain is a water soluble molecule like assault and often it's a

616
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:49.460
salt called phosphocholine.

617
00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:53.200
And so you get a phospholipid a that's made of uh,

618
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:55.840
of Coleen and two lipid chains.

619
00:40:56.050 --> 00:41:00.850
Now this behaves very differently in water because part of it is water soluble.

620
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.051
This part is,

621
00:41:02.051 --> 00:41:05.590
it's a molecule that would like to dissolve in water and part of it is like oil.

622
00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:07.090
It doesn't want to dissolve in water.

623
00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.850
So what happens when you put these molecules in water?

624
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.880
Well instead of forming droplets like fat,
they,

625
00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.490
they arrange in a very particular way.

626
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:20.670
They form these structures that are called self assembled structures because

627
00:41:20.891 --> 00:41:24.760
they occur naturally because of properties of the lipids.

628
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:29.910
But the lipids will form a bi layer where the water soluble part of the lipid

629
00:41:30.191 --> 00:41:33.480
points out of this layer.
And uh,

630
00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.660
and the oily part points in.

631
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:40.130
And the fascinating part about this layer is that it solves the problem for

632
00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:44.390
phospho lipids about how do we exist in water when half of you wants to be an

633
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:49.391
oil and that the water soluble part of the top leaflet here of the top points up

634
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:56.230
into the water and the fatty acid chains point down the opposite leaflet does

635
00:41:57.201 --> 00:42:01.040
the other thing that water soluble part points down in the fat points up.

636
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.700
So now you have a,
you have a thin region of fat

637
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.480
which is surrounded on both sides by water.

638
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.450
And this is a really interesting system because it also solves a problem for the

639
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:15.284
cell.

640
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.940
And the problem it solves for the sale is how do I make a barrier around myself

641
00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:22.640
to define what's in me and what's outside of me,

642
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.250
when most of what's around me and what's in me is water.
So inside the cell,

643
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:30.560
mostly water outside the cell,
mostly water,

644
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:35.360
but I need to separate my water from the water outside.
Right?

645
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.230
And we'll see why they have to separate that in in a minute.
But they do that,

646
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:44.240
these,
these lipid biolayer solve that problem for them and their self assembled

647
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:48.260
structures from these,
from these molecules called phospho lipids.

648
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.900
Now that's not the only thing in cell membranes.

649
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.210
There are also proteins in cell membranes.

650
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:57.340
And these proteins are special proteins that can exist within,
uh,

651
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.300
within membranes like this.

652
00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:03.230
And they exist because these proteins also have different segments with

653
00:43:03.231 --> 00:43:06.170
different properties.
Some of the segments dissolve in water.

654
00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:09.950
The great segments here and the lightly colored segments don't dissolve in
water.

655
00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:13.880
They dissolve in fats.
And so they like to be in the membrane and they're stable.

656
00:43:13.881 --> 00:43:14.091
They're,

657
00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:19.091
and they won't come out right because there's structure allows them to exist in

658
00:43:19.131 --> 00:43:21.500
these,
uh,
in these unique spaces.

659
00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.800
So I'm going to stop there and we'll,
uh,
we'll,

660
00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:27.620
we'll pick up on this topic not next week,

661
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:30.710
but the week after when we start talking about cell structure.

662
00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:34.730
I wanted to introduce it to you so that if you don't,
haven't heard about this,

663
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:35.571
uh,
before,

664
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:40.550
you might want to read a little bit about this before we get to chapter five.

665
00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.970
Next week we're going to talk about genes and genetic engineering.

666
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:45.050
That's chapter three.
