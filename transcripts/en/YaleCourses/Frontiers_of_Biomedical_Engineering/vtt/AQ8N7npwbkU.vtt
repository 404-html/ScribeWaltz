00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.860
Okay.
This week we're going to,

2
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.970
we're going to continue in our discussion about the,
uh,
about the immune system,

3
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:21.660
but talk about sort of engineering the immune system,
how to,

4
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.570
how to produce immunity in individuals.
And we're going to do that by,
uh,

5
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.320
by talking about some examples,
some historical examples,
uh,
in the,
in the,

6
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.170
uh,
uh,
sort of technology of vaccine development.

7
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.930
And what I hope to do over the course of

8
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.210
this lecture and the lecture on Thursday is,
um,

9
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.800
is a complete,
what's described on this outline slide here.

10
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.100
First using a couple of examples that have turned out to be a very important one

11
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:57.420
is the example of smallpox.
And the second is the example of,

12
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.770
of polio.

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.890
Talk about how vaccines were developed in these particular,
uh,

14
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.080
in these particular situations and how the development of the biology is coupled

15
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:16.050
with,
uh,
delivering this through populations and how,

16
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.920
how these sort of intricately woven together.

17
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.550
It's not enough to understand the biology of how to create,
um,

18
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.990
to create a vaccine if you can't make enough of the vaccine or deliver it to

19
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.800
people in ways that it's useful.
And so we'll talk about how that,

20
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.560
how that happened in the exam,

21
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.230
using the examples of smallpox and polio.

22
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.100
And that will bring us to a general discussion of sort of the tools that are

23
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:46.020
available now for vaccine development,
which we'll talk about on,

24
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.610
um,
on,
uh,
Thursday.
So,
uh,

25
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:54.930
I don't have to say too much about why vaccines are important.

26
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.680
Um,
you know about this.
Uh,

27
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:00.540
and this is a slide that I showed you.

28
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.600
The graph is something I showed you on the first day of class that over the last

29
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.860
hundred years in particular,
uh,

30
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:12.720
but what's shown on this slide is over the last 300 years,
life expectancy for,

31
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.730
uh,
for humans has increased dramatically.
And one of the reasons,

32
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.510
uh,

33
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.960
that's most responsible for that is that is that humans aren't dying at as young

34
00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:27.510
an age from infectious diseases as they did three or 400 years ago.

35
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.650
And there are many reasons for this,
uh,

36
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.690
our success in eliminating in infectious diseases as causes of death in the

37
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.420
developed world.
And you know,
what those reasons are.

38
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:43.410
One is is that doctors started washing their hands in between when they saw

39
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:48.000
patients and that had a remarkable effect on reducing transmission of infectious

40
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.640
diseases in doctor's offices in hospitals.

41
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.860
Another is that we learned a lot of things about engineering,
of,
of uh,

42
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:58.520
of uh,
public,
um,

43
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.060
systems like water supply,

44
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.510
separating our water supply from sewage and learning how to do wastewater

45
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:09.220
treatment was a really important part of reducing infectious diseases.

46
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.900
But vaccines,
uh,
at particularly in the last hundred years,

47
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.460
vaccines have been one of the most important elements in,

48
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.090
in our progress.
And uh,

49
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.540
and so what this slide just reminds you of how much progress we've made also

50
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.500
shows you something about the challenge of it because we are susceptible to

51
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:35.740
attack from lots of different kinds of microorganisms.

52
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.590
So not just the spectrum of viruses,

53
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.770
but there's viruses and bacteria and parasites and other microorganisms that can

54
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:45.880
cause disease.

55
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.120
And so this slide just illustrates that in as simple way,
the,

56
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.130
the range of different kinds of organisms that your immune system is trying to,

57
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.600
uh,
whoops,
wait a minute.
I've lost control of,

58
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.860
I'm not saying,
oh,
there it is.
It's not showing up on the screen for some reason.

59
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.730
Um,
um,

60
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.820
that this shows the range of morphologies of microorganisms that your immune

61
00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:21.821
system has to potentially encounter from complex organisms like the syphilis

62
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.780
pathogen here.
Uh,
a virus.
This is a false colored image of a virus,

63
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.260
very tiny,
not shown to scale here.
And,
and,
uh,

64
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.790
bacteria like Salmonella and staphylococcus.
So these,

65
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.640
these organisms like this are abundant in the world around us,

66
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:41.390
in our immune system,
prevents us from getting sick most of the time.

67
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.720
So what is a vaccine?
A vaccine is a prepared,

68
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.470
it's a preparation that's prepared in some way and we're going to talk about how

69
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:52.340
they're prepared,

70
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.930
but it's a preparation that is intended to stimulate your immune system.

71
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.380
And so what that really means,
you know,
from last week's lecture,

72
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:05.330
is that the vaccine stimulates these particular cells in your immune system,

73
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.520
uh,
to give you immunity.

74
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.500
And we're usually talking about adaptive immunity here.

75
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.740
So either it stimulates the production of and differentiation of B cells to

76
00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:22.790
produce a specific antibody that can neutralize the virus or,

77
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.820
or stimulates the production of cytotoxic t cells that can kill infected cells

78
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:30.980
within your body.
But in,
in any event,

79
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.160
the vaccine is intended to stimulate the immune system to produce an effect,

80
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.160
a response,

81
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.200
either antibodies or specific cells that can combat,

82
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.550
uh,
spread of the microorganism through your,
through your body.

83
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.610
And usually it's done by taking all or parts of the infectious agent and showing

84
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:57.950
them to your immune system in some way.

85
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.780
And so we talked very briefly last time about this business of antigen

86
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.440
presentation,
how your immune system,

87
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:11.441
one of the things that it does especially well is recognize what's part of you

88
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:13.460
and what's not part of you.

89
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.750
It can separate between what's part of yourself and what's foreign.

90
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.880
And it does that by presenting,

91
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.530
by recognizing antigens that are presented in the context of the major

92
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.260
histocompatibility complex MHC.

93
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.700
And so a vaccine is designed in order to engage that biology in order to provide

94
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.090
antigens that will stimulate specifically your immune system.

95
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.560
And usually it involves pieces of the infectious agent itself,

96
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.370
uh,
to,
to,
to cause that engagement.

97
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.140
So that's what a vaccine is in vaccination is the process of taking that vaccine

98
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:57.890
that you've developed and giving it to people,
uh,

99
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.610
either individual people or groups of people or as we'll talk about today,
uh,

100
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.860
people all over the world.
Uh,
and so that's a very different thing,
right?

101
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.940
It designing something that works in a particular individual and designing

102
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:15.650
something that can be used in people all over the world involve different sorts

103
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.700
of,
uh,
accomplishments.
Well,

104
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:23.300
we've all had some experience with vaccines.

105
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:27.140
You can't go to school in this country and in many countries until you've had

106
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:31.970
your,
your prescribed set of vaccinations.
And so there are already a very safe,

107
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:35.930
very effective vaccines available for many infectious diseases.
And there's a,

108
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.770
there's a partial list of that shown here,
uh,

109
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.880
starting the top of the list with smallpox.

110
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:43.400
And that's what we're going to spend most of the time talking about today.

111
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.060
But there are vaccines for rabies,
for typhoid diptheria.

112
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.670
Most recently,
um,
uh,
or more recently,
there was a vaccine for Varicella,

113
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.640
which you know,
is chicken pox.
Uh,

114
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:59.210
that was developed in the last 10 years and now,

115
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:02.180
so there's probably a number of people in this room.

116
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.140
So when I first started teaching this class 20 years ago,
uh,

117
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.320
everybody in the room had had chickenpox right?
Now,

118
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:12.830
are there people here that have not had chicken pox?
Right?

119
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:15.740
Because you had the vaccine,
uh,
presumably.

120
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:20.480
And so you didn't get the disease.
And,
um,
so this is,
uh,

121
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.510
this is a substantial change in the,

122
00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.530
in the interaction of a micro organism with a population,
right?

123
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.320
A lot of us didn't get sick from it now,
and we've got sick from it before.

124
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.120
You also know that there's some vaccines that are not yet available for diseases

125
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:37.790
that we would very much like to prevent.
Um,

126
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.580
HIV infection and AIDS is a,

127
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.630
the one that comes first to mind and is responsible for on this slide.

128
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:49.160
I think this is data from a few years ago,
um,
uh,

129
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.480
700,000 deaths per year.
That number is undoubtedly higher,
uh,

130
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.710
than now.
AIDS is a tremendous problem,
deaths from HIV,
infection and age,

131
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:03.150
a tremendous problem in Africa and other parts of the world.
Uh,

132
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.170
but there are other diseases that are numerically even more important.
The whole,

133
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.620
uh,

134
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.620
category of diarrheal diseases caused by viruses called enteroviruses,

135
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.220
uh,
where,
uh,
they,
it infects your gut,
your guts,

136
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:21.390
unable to function in the normal way.
And so you get severe diarrhea,

137
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:26.391
you can become dehydrated and die just as a result of the loss of a water there

138
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.600
because of your body's natural response to the infection.

139
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.960
And that causes five to 10 million deaths per year.

140
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:38.961
And children are particularly susceptible to these children get diseases from a

141
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:43.740
class of viruses called Rhoda viruses for which we have no vaccine and,

142
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.190
and um,
and uh,
so no way to protect them.

143
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.570
Malaria causes a million deaths per year.
And schistosomiasis,

144
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:56.440
which is a parasitic disease,
uh,
is,
uh,
is,
uh,
unfortunately,
uh,

145
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.960
a common cause of death in the world.
And so these are,

146
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.030
these are,
uh,

147
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.580
these are situations where we would very much like to produce a vaccine,

148
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:08.100
but we can't yet.
And the question is why,

149
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:12.060
why is it difficult in some cases to produce a vaccine when we've been

150
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:13.770
successful in so many others?

151
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.570
And so one of the points I want to make here on this slide is that this is a

152
00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:21.300
very disease specific thing.

153
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.620
Learning how to turn on your immune system to protect you from a specific

154
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:28.830
pathogen turns out to be very particular to that pathogen.

155
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:33.030
And that shouldn't be too surprising given what we talked about last week.

156
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.500
That your immune system,
the adaptive immune system in particular,
uh,

157
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.290
responds to individual antigens differently.

158
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.640
Just to think about,
um,
what's most important in the,

159
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:52.641
in the u s of the top five reported infections in the u s and this is again from

160
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:56.550
a few years ago,
but I'm fairly sure that the numbers been changed.

161
00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.020
Three of the top five infectious diseases or the infectious disease most

162
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.280
commonly reported in the u s are sexually transmitted diseases,
chlamydia,

163
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.360
gonorrhea and HIV infection.
A,
none of these do we have,

164
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.390
do we have,
uh,
vaccines for,

165
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.170
and it's turned out that sexually transmitted diseases for a variety of reasons.

166
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.090
We'll come back to later are a particularly difficult to develop a vaccines,

167
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.520
uh,
for.
And uh,
we'll,
we'll,

168
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:26.490
we'll talk about why that's been the case as we go through.

169
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.270
And this just to just,
uh,
is another list.

170
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.600
I mainly wanted you to have it in your notes of,

171
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.370
of diseases that are important around the world for which there are very active,

172
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.130
uh,
programs to develop either vaccines or more effective vaccines.
Uh,

173
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.980
you know that there is a vaccine for hepatitis B for example,

174
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:51.000
which is on this list and you've all been vaccinated.

175
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.710
I would guess for Hepatitis B,

176
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:57.190
it's the where you have to get three shots over a period of,
of six months.

177
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.570
And so you have to remember to go back,
you get it first,
you get a first shot,

178
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.960
you have to remember to go back after a month and get a second shot.

179
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.940
You have to go back after six months and get a third shot.

180
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.870
And then they test you to make sure that you have adequate protection.

181
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:13.210
And some people need an additional shot after that.

182
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.190
And so that's an effective vaccine,

183
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.600
but it's only an effective vaccine in the context where you have people who can

184
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:24.160
go to the doctor's office or to a,
or to a,
a,

185
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:28.900
an urgent care or some kind of medical facility three times reliably at a

186
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:33.610
specified period of time.
And that's not possible in all parts of the world.

187
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:36.840
Not Everybody has that opportunity to interact with,
uh,

188
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.220
with medical professionals that often.

189
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.150
And so there's a lot of interest not just in developing vaccines for diseases

190
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.960
that we don't have vaccines for,

191
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.400
but for delivering vaccines that are more effective.

192
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.511
For example,

193
00:12:52.511 --> 00:12:55.750
what if you could make a hepatitis vaccine that was good in one shot instead of

194
00:12:55.751 --> 00:13:00.070
three shots or vaccines that could be transported more easily?

195
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.080
The hepatitis vaccine that we get is not stable in less.
It's refrigerated,

196
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.540
it's in solution,
it's refrigerated,

197
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:12.810
and it's very difficult to transport refrigerated vaccines to all the remote

198
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.910
parts of the world where you would like to trans port them.

199
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.070
And so that very practical consideration turns out to be important in how we use

200
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:22.930
vaccines in real populations.

201
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:27.910
So if you could make a hepatitis B vaccine that didn't require a shot or that

202
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:29.500
didn't require refrigeration,

203
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.320
that would be a tremendous advance and spreading that vaccine,
uh,

204
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:33.970
through the world.

205
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.870
So that's another example of the difference between a vaccine that works and a

206
00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:39.970
vaccination that works,
right?

207
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.390
A vaccine might work if the person is there and you can interact with them.

208
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:48.340
A vaccination for it to work around the world has to be inexpensive,

209
00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:53.000
transportable,
possible to use without advanced medical,
uh,

210
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.700
personnel and those kinds of things.
Okay,

211
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.760
so let's talk about the example of smallpox,

212
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:04.910
which is one of the world's great successes in,
um,
in,
uh,

213
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.970
the battle against infectious diseases.

214
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:12.190
And just to say a little bit about smallpox,
because unlike chicken pox,

215
00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:14.800
which if you haven't had,
you've probably seen a case of it.

216
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.980
None of us here have seen a case of smallpox.
It hasn't,

217
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.850
it hasn't existed in the world for many decades now,

218
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.940
but smallpox was at one time,
one of the most frightening,
um,

219
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:30.220
diseases on the planet.
It's a devastating,

220
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:35.080
frequently fatal infectious disease.
If smallpox occurred in your community,

221
00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.520
about 30% of the people that acquire the disease would die from it.

222
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.320
The other 70% could be a disabled or permanently disfigured as a result of the

223
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:48.970
disease.
It's an infectious disease.
It is spread through the air.

224
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.250
And so it first infects you because you breathe in.
Uh,

225
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.380
some of the infectious agent smallpox is a virus called very ola.

226
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.550
It's a virus that contains DNA,
the name of the viruses,
very ola.

227
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.790
It's part of a family of viruses.

228
00:15:04.791 --> 00:15:08.840
And we'll talk about it at least one other member of that family of viruses as

229
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.300
we go through here.
Uh,
but,
uh,
it can,

230
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:15.430
it can be acquired in the air from patients that are from,

231
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.320
from other individuals that are infected.
You breathe it in,

232
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:23.350
it infects the cells of your respiratory tract and the virus begins to reproduce

233
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.430
and then it spreads throughout your body.

234
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.270
And so during the first period after you come in contact with the disease,

235
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:30.350
you have,
uh,

236
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.860
an incubation period where you get sort of the kind of symptoms that we

237
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:38.861
associate with lots of kinds of viral infections that we con that we contract

238
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.100
through our respiratory system.
You might have a fever,

239
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.601
malaise,

240
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:47.780
which is just that feeling that you don't want to get out of bed and go to
class.

241
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.450
And you might have that commonly,
but,
but,

242
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:55.430
but even more severe than normal aches and a rash.

243
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:59.180
And this is what's characteristic of smallpox is that as the virus spreads

244
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:03.800
through your body,
it particularly,
it particularly affects cells of your skin.

245
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.030
And so you get a rash or redness of the skin,

246
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.470
and then you would recover for a while that that initial phase of the illness

247
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.800
would disappear.
Your fever,
Mike go down,
you might appear to be normal.

248
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:20.150
And then you start to get lesions on your skin that are very characteristic of

249
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:24.050
smallpox.
And they started as what it called vesicular lesions,

250
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:28.670
or like blisters where they're filled with a fluid and they evolve to become

251
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.270
very dense hard.
Uh,

252
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.100
or pustular legions,

253
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:38.840
which are filled with what turns out to be a tissue debris.

254
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:43.760
It's really just the result of the virus dividing within sales of your skin and

255
00:16:43.761 --> 00:16:46.970
producing a lot of dead cells.
And so that debris,

256
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:51.500
it fills up a little spot that would feel,
um,
according to reports,

257
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:53.540
cause again,
we don't see it now.
Um,

258
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:58.250
it feels like a little pellet underneath your skin and this fluid eventually

259
00:16:58.251 --> 00:17:02.900
starts to leak out.
And the,
those,
uh,
those lesions would heal.

260
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.320
But,

261
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.880
but they leave scars in most cases because these are very deep lesions that go

262
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:10.430
not just on the surface of your skin like a blister would,

263
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:14.300
but down into the dermis or deeper layers of the skin as well.
In fact,

264
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:17.090
certain areas of the skin would be impacted.
Most,
uh,

265
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.890
most are dramatically the face and the chest,
the arms.
But uh,

266
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.600
but,
um,
more distal parts of the arms,
like the palms of your hands.

267
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.760
And so you can imagine that even in it's with all of this activity on your skin,

268
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.630
even at its most,
uh,
um,
least serious level.

269
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:40.400
It's a terrible disease.
I'll show you a picture in just a moment.

270
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.450
Um,

271
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.450
but in some cases that progression of the disease would start to affect other

272
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:51.300
organs in addition to your skin and,
uh,

273
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.950
and your body would become overwhelmed with the infection and eventually die.

274
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.180
And as I mentioned before,

275
00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:01.920
death would occur in 20 to 30% of the cases that got the most severe form of

276
00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:05.250
smallpox.
And so if this was a disease that entered your community,

277
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.760
you could have expected,
uh,

278
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.390
several centuries ago that at the end of this sweep of the disease,

279
00:18:12.391 --> 00:18:17.010
through your community,
a one in four or one or five of your neighbors would,

280
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.560
would die from the disease.
And that's has,

281
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.050
that's a dramatic effect on communities.
Well,
um,

282
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.960
smallpox affected world history.
It's,
um,

283
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.830
just as just as HIV infection is affecting world history now.

284
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:35.250
Smallpox affected world history hundreds of years ago,

285
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.950
and it was a disease disease that was common in Europe,

286
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:42.390
but not common in the Americas until,
until the Americans were colonized.

287
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:46.630
And so there are famous,
uh,
reports of how the Aztecs,

288
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.100
that whole civilization was devastated by smallpox.

289
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.960
And that disease was brought to them by the Spanish when they came,
uh,

290
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.380
to these continents in the 16th century.
And,
uh,
the Spanish,

291
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.440
a much smaller group of people was able to overtake the Aztec civilization very

292
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:06.720
well established,
uh,
because that,
uh,

293
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:11.640
that a group of people was devastated by the disease.
Um,
and um,

294
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.400
uh,
they were weakened as a result.
And so the Spaniards,
even in fewer numbers,

295
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.280
we're able to,
we're able to conquer.

296
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.710
So these are just some pictures to show you what the,

297
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.420
what the smallpox lesions look like on the face of a child and then distributed

298
00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:34.110
over the whole body of an adult.
And,
um,

299
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.460
and to give you some better idea of what kind of a disease this was.

300
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.420
So the process of,
uh,

301
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:47.220
of developing a vaccine occurred over a long period of time.
In fact,

302
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:51.580
there's,
there's evidence that even thousands of years ago,
um,
uh,

303
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.360
Indian and Chinese healers,

304
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:59.570
we're using a form of something that we would recognize as vaccination.

305
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.580
And they did this by taking,

306
00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:07.581
they recognize that somehow if you had a mild exposure to the disease,

307
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.890
your body could then develop protection against more severe forms of the

308
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:17.400
disease.
And so the older way,

309
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:21.780
the more ancient way of exposing you to disease was in the case of smallpox to

310
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:23.040
take,
um,

311
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.170
pieces of tissue from somebody that was infected.
And usually it was one of the,

312
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.340
the scabs that formed as a result of these skin lesions.

313
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:37.320
And to grind up that scab somehow and expose it to somebody who you wanted to

314
00:20:37.321 --> 00:20:38.460
protect from the disease.

315
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.710
And the way that that Indian healers did this was by putting pieces of this in

316
00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:47.380
your nose or a or injecting it under your skin.

317
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.090
And um,
and there was a,
a,
um,
a,

318
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.830
a feeling that this could protect you against the disease.

319
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.900
And it turns out that,
um,
that there is,

320
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.740
we now know what the scientific basis of that is and involves activation of your

321
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:06.640
immune system.

322
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:12.070
And it Wa was a practice that was not broadly used until somebody really studied

323
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:13.270
it systematically.

324
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:17.050
And that person who really studied it systematically and is given credit for

325
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:20.830
developing the first vaccine is a Scottish physician named Edward Jenner.

326
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.210
And he started with a similar,
uh,
with,

327
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.660
with a similar but different observation.
And that was that,
uh,

328
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.050
cows get a disease that's very similar to smallpox.

329
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.370
We know now that it's caused by a related virus,
uh,
called,
uh,

330
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.240
Vac Sinia.

331
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.010
Remember the virus that causes that causes smallpox is called Very Ola,

332
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:46.500
but very yola,
which causes smallpox in humans and Vaccine Ia,

333
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.860
which causes a disease called cow pox in cattle turn out to be,

334
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:54.460
we now know viruses that are molecularly very similar.

335
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.260
Um,

336
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.620
what was known at that time was that there was a disease in people and that was

337
00:21:59.621 --> 00:22:03.760
a different disease in cows.
And,
and they looked the same some way.

338
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.320
And Jenner made the observation that others had made that people that were

339
00:22:08.321 --> 00:22:12.340
around cows a lot tended not to get smallpox.

340
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:17.200
And in particular dairy maids whose responsibility was to milk cows.

341
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:21.630
And so they had a very intimate relationship with cattle,
uh,
often,
uh,

342
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.720
didn't get disease and sometimes they developed a mild form of the disease.

343
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.210
They would get lesions on their hands,
for example,

344
00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:32.910
the part of their body that was really in close contact with the cows.
And,
um,

345
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:33.700
and,

346
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.170
and he hypothesized that they were getting the disease in cows,

347
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:43.171
which the disease from cows that caused a milder disease than smallpox and that

348
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:46.960
protected them from getting the more severe forms of smallpox later.

349
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:53.130
Well,
I mentioned that this was just sort of a more modern,
uh,

350
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:57.370
observation of one that hadn't bay then made in the past.
This process,

351
00:22:57.371 --> 00:23:02.020
I said this ancient process of taking scabs from patients and introducing them

352
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:06.370
to people you wanted to protect was called variolation.
Um,

353
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.060
and um,
and Jenner was making a,

354
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.730
another observation that might be useful that way.
Uh,

355
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.500
there were other individuals that were making this observation at that time.

356
00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:21.940
In addition to gender,
there was a farmer named Benjamin Justi who,
uh,
who,

357
00:23:21.941 --> 00:23:26.770
who recognize that farmers being in contact with cows didn't,

358
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:31.120
uh,
didn't get a disease as often as non farmers did.

359
00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:35.890
And so he intentionally inoculated his wife and two children,
uh,

360
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:40.690
with,
uh,
with fluid that he got from one of his sick cows.
All right.

361
00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:45.691
So he took fluid from a cowpox legion on a county into his children and his wife

362
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:51.641
reasoning that this would protect them from disease even though they didn't have

363
00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.460
as much contact with cows as farmers did.
And he was right.

364
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:58.910
They got immunity and we're protected from smallpox when it affected their

365
00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:02.960
community.
Gender did this in a much more systematic way.

366
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:04.310
He used not just his family,

367
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:08.300
but he used whole populations of people and he produced a,

368
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.900
a fluid from a cow pox lesions.

369
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.070
So these were these lesions,
these skin lesions on cows.

370
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:21.020
He took this pustular fluid that was produced at this very specific phase of the

371
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:24.350
disease,
um,
and he,
uh,

372
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:29.000
and he developed a way for giving that to people.
So,

373
00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:33.140
vaccination,
the word vaccination comes from this event.

374
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.920
Vodka is the,
uh,

375
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.430
I'm sure there's a Latin scholar in here that will correct my pronunciation,

376
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.140
but vodka is the,
uh,

377
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.190
is the Latin word for cow vaccination from cows.

378
00:24:46.191 --> 00:24:50.810
And that's where the first vaccine came from.
Um,
and uh,
and,

379
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:51.890
and Jenner,

380
00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:55.940
because he was a trained position because he knew something about the scientific

381
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:56.774
method,

382
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:01.810
did something that these more ancient healers had not done in the past,

383
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:06.821
was that he wrote down what he did and he kept track of how many people he gave

384
00:25:07.221 --> 00:25:08.270
the vaccines to.

385
00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:12.170
And then he kept track of what would happen to those people when a smallpox

386
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:13.850
infection occurred in their community.

387
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.090
And as a result of writing it down and keeping track,

388
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.700
he produced a very clear record,
uh,

389
00:25:19.701 --> 00:25:24.701
and scientific evidence that using this procedure could protect a population of

390
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:29.390
people,
uh,
from the disease.
So,
um,

391
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.660
so that was the start of,

392
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.660
of the modern practice of vaccination.

393
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.890
There were problems with Jenner's approach and you can imagine what some of

394
00:25:39.891 --> 00:25:43.400
those problems are.
Uh,
one is that,
um,

395
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.750
you got to get the,
you got to get the vaccine from cows,

396
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.500
so you've got to have an infected,
infected cow in order to produce the vaccine.

397
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.640
And so it's awkward to have to wait for a cow to get infected before you can

398
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.230
vaccinate a population.

399
00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.680
And what if you're talking about a group of people that don't have any cows in

400
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:04.850
their vicinity,
let alone is sick cow.
How do you get the vaccine to them?

401
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.980
Well,
that problem was partly solved by saying,
well,

402
00:26:09.981 --> 00:26:10.820
if I,
if I'm,

403
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.850
if I'm giving the inoculation to one person and they develop a lesion locally

404
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.820
and that's what would happen when you would take the fluid from the cow and you

405
00:26:19.821 --> 00:26:24.140
would,
you would,
you would inject it underneath the skin of a,

406
00:26:24.141 --> 00:26:28.280
of a person you wanted to protect.
Then at that site where you injected it,

407
00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:33.281
you would get a lesion that looked like a smallpox or cow pox lesion.

408
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:38.630
And then we go through these same phases that I described before and it would,

409
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.510
uh,
it would you get a clear blister like region,

410
00:26:41.511 --> 00:26:46.511
it would turn pustular you develop a scab as it healed and then it would,

411
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.250
and then the scab would fall off and you'd be left with a scar.
Well,

412
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:54.660
what if instead of taking the fluid from a cow,
I inoculated,

413
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.910
he inoculated me,
let's say,

414
00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.330
and waited until I had the lesion at the right stage,

415
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:05.540
then took some of my fluid and gave it to Brian and Nate and Murtala and spread

416
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:09.190
it through the community around me.

417
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.910
Then we don't need to count anymore because you could,

418
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.480
you could pass it from one person to another and passed the immunity from one

419
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:20.160
person to another.
And that works.
The problem with it is that,

420
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:23.220
uh,
you also can spread other diseases in that way.

421
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:25.980
You're not only spreading the infection,
but if,

422
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.460
but if I happen to have some other infectious disease,

423
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:33.930
then not only would you be passing the protection to smallpox,

424
00:27:33.931 --> 00:27:37.680
but you'd be passing that disease among,
among the population as well.

425
00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:41.160
And it turned out that another,
uh,
not quite as deadly but,

426
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.600
but still very serious disease called syphilis was also common in this part of

427
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:47.670
the world at that time.
And so you could,

428
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:51.960
you could pass diseases like syphilis from one individual to another and that's

429
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.830
not great.
Right?
That's not,
not,
not perfect.

430
00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:01.200
The other problem is that as it was passed from me to another individual to

431
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:02.370
another individual,

432
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:07.520
then the vaccine could change in some ways that were hard to predict because

433
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:12.330
what accumulates in the lesion on my arm,
my is different in some way.

434
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.060
Then what accumulates in the lesion on a cow?

435
00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:20.580
And as you move through the human population,
the,
the,

436
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:26.400
the kind of response that you get could change because of the virus itself

437
00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:31.230
mutates or because you're also passing on some factors that provide some

438
00:28:31.231 --> 00:28:35.310
protection.
Uh,
that changes the course of disease and the in the,

439
00:28:35.311 --> 00:28:36.210
in the recipient.

440
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.590
And so as the vaccine was passed from arm to arm,

441
00:28:40.591 --> 00:28:44.760
it became less potent and him and the length of protection that it would give

442
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:45.960
you varied.

443
00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:49.800
So if you were someone that was getting it after it had been passed through many

444
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:50.490
people,

445
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:55.010
you wouldn't have as strong or as lengthy a protection as um,

446
00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:00.030
as the first individual did.
And we're going to just keep that in mind.

447
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:03.120
We're going to talk about the reasons for that as we go along,

448
00:29:03.121 --> 00:29:05.520
particularly at the beginning of class next time.

449
00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:10.740
But what was really needed in order to do this was a defined preparation,

450
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.993
right?
We,

451
00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:16.980
what you would like to give is everybody in the community exactly the same

452
00:29:16.981 --> 00:29:21.870
preparation so that you could predict what everybody's response to the vaccine

453
00:29:21.871 --> 00:29:26.580
would be.
It wasn't until,
uh,

454
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:28.560
until the 20th century,

455
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.030
so almost 200 years later that,

456
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.570
that we learned how to do this.
And it was,
um,

457
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.380
it was based on a couple of things.

458
00:29:40.381 --> 00:29:44.440
One was a better understanding of what you were doing when you vaccinated.

459
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.940
And I've already given you some clues about this and that this process of

460
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:53.941
vaccination that gender had developed was intentionally injecting into healthy

461
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:59.920
patients.
A micro organism,
in this case,
the virus,

462
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.510
the virus vaccine,
Ia,
which causes a serious disease in cows.

463
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:09.520
But only a mild disease in people
and injecting that,

464
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.240
uh,

465
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.240
because it was similar to very ola or the smallpox causing virus in some way so

466
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:21.370
that your immune system would develop a response to Vac Sinia.

467
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.460
But because of the similarity of the viruses,

468
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:29.230
the immune response that people developed would also protect them against

469
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.480
natural affections with very ola.

470
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:37.380
And so we call that now that process of infecting with a live virus that

471
00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:43.250
produces an immune response that cross reacts with another,
uh,

472
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.520
that's called a naturally occurring attenuated vaccine naturally occurring

473
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:53.671
because we took a virus that occurred in nature attenuated because it causes an

474
00:30:54.941 --> 00:30:56.980
immune response in people,

475
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.840
but a mild form of disease,
not the full form of disease.

476
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.090
And so this is an example of a naturally occurring attenuated vaccine.

477
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.390
Uh,
so how could you produce,

478
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.620
the question is how could you produce large quantities of this,

479
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.910
of this microorganism,
this,
this virus vaccine,

480
00:31:17.911 --> 00:31:21.760
IA under controlled conditions.
Now,
you know,

481
00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:25.570
because we talked about cell culture already,
that,
that a great,

482
00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:27.520
that that we talked about last week,

483
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:30.430
manufacturing of cells we talked about two weeks ago,

484
00:31:30.431 --> 00:31:32.230
that if you had a population of cells,

485
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.380
you could grow those population of cells and you can make,

486
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.270
if they adapt to the culture properly,

487
00:31:37.271 --> 00:31:41.680
you can make an infinite number of sales from one starting solution.
Well,

488
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:45.820
if you knew a cell that could serve as a host for a virus,

489
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:50.080
you could use this process of cell culture to make large quantities of virus,

490
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:50.711
right?

491
00:31:50.711 --> 00:31:54.190
You just grow up cells until you've got a lot of sales and you infect them with

492
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:59.191
the virus and you let the cells in culture produce the virus.

493
00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.550
Well,
it turns out that we could not identify at least at that point,

494
00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:08.540
a cell culture that would serve as a host for,
for,
uh,

495
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.980
vaccinium.
So cell culture production wasn't an option.

496
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:17.170
The only way that we knew how to grow it reliably was to grow it in its natural

497
00:32:17.171 --> 00:32:22.060
host cows.
And so in the 1940s,

498
00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.210
uh,
a group of people led by,
uh,

499
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:29.280
led by Collier started to develop a large scale production method for making a

500
00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:32.440
reliable source of Vaccina virus.

501
00:32:32.441 --> 00:32:35.680
And they did that by intentionally infecting cabs,

502
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.190
by harvesting their skin when they were at a certain point of the disease and by

503
00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:43.760
isolating the virus from the skin of the cab cabs.

504
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:44.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.360
<v 0>And of course,</v>

506
00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:49.520
you could imagine that this took some time to develop and you'd want to make

507
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:53.870
sure that you separated the virus from all the other parts of cow skin so that

508
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.730
your ultimate preparation was enriched in the virus and didn't contain

509
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.610
quantities of other things that would be a hazardous.

510
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.340
And so that's what was done in the 1940s.

511
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:09.380
And then they found that they could freeze dry this preparation of virus and

512
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:12.830
freeze drying to lower the temperature,
freeze it,

513
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:15.500
then extract that all the water.
So you're left with a powder,

514
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.580
basically a powdered form of the virus that could be shipped all over the world

515
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.020
and then reconstitute it by adding water to it.
Right?
So it's like,
uh,

516
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:29.140
it's like,
uh,
um,
it's like Koolaid,
but,

517
00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:32.770
uh,
but,
um,
more potent,
um,

518
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.510
but use the same way,
right?

519
00:33:34.511 --> 00:33:37.990
The powder you could ship anywhere and reconstitute it on site and then it gets

520
00:33:37.991 --> 00:33:38.824
injected.

521
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.700
And they also developed a very reliable way for introducing the virus so that

522
00:33:42.701 --> 00:33:45.160
when they had a defined preparation of virus,

523
00:33:45.161 --> 00:33:48.130
then you want to make sure that everybody gets it in their skin in the right
way.

524
00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:52.910
And so they developed this bifurcated tool,
which would be,
you put the,

525
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.680
the,
the stuff on the surface of the tool and then you'd scratch the skin in a

526
00:33:56.681 --> 00:33:59.890
certain way so that you could produce sort of a,
a,
a,
a,

527
00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.250
a reproducible introduction of the,
uh,

528
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.350
of the vaccine into the skin.

529
00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:06.863
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

530
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.330
<v 0>Availability of this freeze dried vaccine made it then possible to think about</v>

531
00:34:11.331 --> 00:34:15.650
vaccinating people all over the world.
And,
and,
uh,

532
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.680
so it didn't take long once this vaccine where was available for people to,

533
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.650
uh,
want to get organized

534
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.780
and think about ways of delivering this vaccine to all the regions of the world

535
00:34:30.781 --> 00:34:32.250
where people were potentially infected.

536
00:34:32.251 --> 00:34:36.570
And it was the World Health Organization or who,
which led this effort.

537
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.110
And the,
the goal was to eradicate the virus,
to,

538
00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.340
to get rid of it so that there were no natural sources of the virus on the

539
00:34:44.341 --> 00:34:46.400
planet.
And that was possible in,

540
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:51.390
in smallpox because of a few characteristics of the disease.
One is that it's a,

541
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.150
it's a,
it's a purely a human disease.
Humans are,
the only,

542
00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.540
are the only organisms that are affected by it.

543
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.870
And that's important,
right?
Because if it was a,

544
00:35:00.871 --> 00:35:05.820
if it was a disease that was carried by both humans and squirrels,

545
00:35:05.821 --> 00:35:09.060
for example,
then in order to get rid of it on the planet,

546
00:35:09.061 --> 00:35:12.420
you'd have to vaccinate not only all the people,
but all the squirrels,
right?

547
00:35:12.421 --> 00:35:15.930
Otherwise you could have,
you could have a squirrel host.

548
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.310
And I'm using squirrels cause I think that's funnier than other animals to think

549
00:35:20.311 --> 00:35:24.260
of.
But it could be any,
any potential host.
Right.
But it,

550
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:28.920
and it would be really difficult to vaccinate a,
uh,
a wildlife.

551
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:34.380
So there were no nonhuman reservoirs.
There were no asymptomatic carriers.

552
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.690
So if you've got infected with smallpox,
you got the,

553
00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.390
there weren't people that got infected,

554
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:44.391
like you can get infected with hepatitis B or tuberculosis and not even know

555
00:35:44.461 --> 00:35:47.910
you're infected.
You might not have any symptoms.
You might just be,

556
00:35:47.911 --> 00:35:50.910
have a latent source of the,
of the microorganisms somewhere in your body.

557
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:52.440
And that didn't happen with smallpox.

558
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:56.400
And that's important too because you need to be able to tell if,

559
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.900
if the virus is present in the human population.

560
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.340
And so because of those two things,
you could think about eradicating the virus.

561
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:09.600
And they did this very systematically by giving quantities of the vaccine to

562
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:13.360
countries all over the world.
That's part of it,
right?
Give enough of the vaccine.

563
00:36:13.361 --> 00:36:18.361
So you have a dose for every body in the world or a large fraction of the people

564
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:23.160
will think about in sec in section how you don't need to vaccinate everybody,

565
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.371
right?

566
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:26.550
You just need to vaccinate a critical number in order to stop the disease from

567
00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:27.630
progressing through a community.

568
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:30.960
And we'll think about that in section on Thursday.
But uh,

569
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:34.350
so you needed enough doses.
But this is,
this is real.
This is a lot of people,

570
00:36:34.351 --> 00:36:37.620
right?
So you need hundreds of millions of doses at least,

571
00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:43.080
and you,
um,
need a way to distribute that around the world.

572
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:47.940
And you need a way to keep track of who got sick and who didn't after they got

573
00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:50.130
vaccinated.
So you needed some way of reporting.

574
00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:54.240
And the WHO had all those had that whole infrastructure in place.

575
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:59.100
So they kept track of country by country when cases of smallpox occurred.

576
00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.140
And as it was eliminated from regions of the country,

577
00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.260
they then certified those regions to be smallpox free.

578
00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.700
And so it went through the years from the 1950s through the 1970s,

579
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:19.730
the last reported case of smallpox in the naturally occurring smallpox was in

580
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:25.560
1977 a man in Somalia was infected.

581
00:37:25.561 --> 00:37:29.970
There were no reported cases after that.
And so by the late seventies,
uh,

582
00:37:29.971 --> 00:37:33.930
the world was certified sort of free of smallpox,

583
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.980
a world wide.
The U S was certified free.
Uh,
uh,

584
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:42.630
in the early seventies years before that,
I was born.
Before 1970,

585
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:44.580
I got a smallpox vaccination.

586
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.290
None of you got smallpox vaccinations because once a country was certified to be

587
00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.560
small,
[inaudible] free,
there was no reason to,
uh,

588
00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:56.800
there was no reason to vaccinate people,
uh,

589
00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:01.380
any longer.
So,
so none of you in this room,
I'm,

590
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.340
I'm a hundred percent confident ever,
ever got a smallpox vaccine.

591
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.490
Uh,
well,
um,
that,
um,

592
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:18.080
that's a great story and it's an an is example of a great success in,
in,
uh,

593
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:22.790
medicine.
Um,
but it's also an example of a great success in,
in,

594
00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.870
in biomedical engineering.
And the engineering part of that is sort of the,

595
00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:29.490
the part that I,
that I talked about in one slide,

596
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:34.080
but I talked about how do you convert this scientific advance into something

597
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:39.060
that can be delivered all over the world.
And the,
the,
uh,
the,
the,
um,

598
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:46.050
the technology that was used in this case was growing the vaccine in a natural

599
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:48.310
source,
harvesting it,

600
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:52.420
figuring out how to produce a preparation that could be distributed,

601
00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:57.160
but with still biologically active that is still a could protect against the

602
00:38:57.161 --> 00:39:00.430
disease.
We now know,
and I'm going to talk about next time,

603
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.350
lots of ways to do this,

604
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:07.380
alternatives to this method of bioengineering.

605
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:12.360
Ah,
and you could guess what those,
what those techniques are.
We,

606
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:15.880
you could use cell culture so you don't have to grow the virus naturally and

607
00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:19.030
animals,
uh,
but you can grow it in cultured cells.

608
00:39:19.031 --> 00:39:23.920
And the advantages of that are that that you can do this under very reproducible

609
00:39:23.921 --> 00:39:24.581
conditions,

610
00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:29.581
much easier to keep a flask of cells under very sterile,

611
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.940
very reproducible conditions than it is to keep a small animal,
right?

612
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:38.920
Even a or a large animal like a cow and much easier to purify and know what you

613
00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:42.190
have at the end,
uh,
than if you're trying to harvest it from a,

614
00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.080
from a whole complex organism.

615
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:49.860
We have techniques of recombinant DNA and those can be used to produce either

616
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.090
modified viruses.
We'll talk about that.
So maybe I could take an info,

617
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.953
maybe I could,

618
00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.790
instead of getting lucky like we did in smallpox and finding a naturally

619
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:04.960
occurring organism that causes an attenuated form of the disease,

620
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:10.140
maybe we could genetically engineer a virus to make it less and less pathogenic,

621
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:14.290
right?
But still immunogenic,
right?

622
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:16.240
And those words mean different things.

623
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:19.690
Immunogenic means that it stimulates your immune system for response.

624
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.720
Pathogenic means that it causes the disease.

625
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:28.630
So maybe you could figure out how to use what we know about molecular biology to

626
00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:33.430
engineer a new virus that's still immunogenic but not pathogenic any longer.

627
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.410
And that's,
that's a new approach,
uh,
to,
um,
to,
uh,

628
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:42.520
to producing vaccines.
Or maybe you don't need the whole virus.

629
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.530
Maybe you don't need the whole virus,

630
00:40:44.531 --> 00:40:47.290
but you could just use a piece of the virus,
right?

631
00:40:47.291 --> 00:40:50.140
Just use a piece and antigenic piece of the virus.

632
00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:55.390
And then I don't have to produce the whole virus in order to make a vaccine.

633
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.830
I just have to produce many,
many copies of a piece of the virus,
a protein say.

634
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.850
And how would you produce a protein in large quantities?
But again,

635
00:41:03.851 --> 00:41:08.050
you could use recombinant DNA technology,
get a gene,

636
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.470
put it in a plasmid,
get that plasmid expressed in a host,

637
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.170
could even be a bacterial host,
right?

638
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:18.940
Like we talked about with insulin and make large quantities of this recombinant

639
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.660
viral protein and use that as a vaccine.

640
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.150
And we're going to talk about how that,
how that,

641
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:30.040
how those steps can happen next time I want to end with this,
uh,

642
00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.260
with this picture.
So this is a,
this is the,

643
00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.310
the cover of the New England Journal of Medicine,

644
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:38.690
one of the most famous and influential medical journals in the world.

645
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.870
And this is from April of 2002 and I talked about eradicating smallpox in 1977

646
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.050
right when officially with the last case was reported and it was certified to be

647
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:55.100
eradicated shortly after that.
But I'm on this,
uh,
cover.
Uh,

648
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:59.980
you can see that there are several stories about a smallpox,
uh,

649
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:04.130
one is called the clinical responses to undiluted and diluted smallpox vaccine.

650
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.380
One is called a current concepts,
diagnosis and management of smallpox.

651
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:10.483
Why would,

652
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:14.570
why would one of the most prominent and influential medical journals in the

653
00:42:14.571 --> 00:42:19.571
world be publishing a review article about how to manage cases of smallpox when

654
00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:24.800
there had not been any cases of smallpox for 25 years?
Yeah.

655
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.830
So the,
the concern at this time and still remains a concern is that,

656
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.230
is that,
uh,
infectious agents,

657
00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:37.520
particularly very deadly infectious agents like smallpox could be weaponized in

658
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:39.260
some way or converted into a weapon.

659
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:44.710
And if smallpox with somehow introduced into a city like New York City,

660
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.590
uh,
what would happen?
Well,
there's,

661
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:51.920
there's a whole population of people who are younger than me that never got

662
00:42:51.921 --> 00:42:54.920
smallpox vaccines,
right?
You don't have it.

663
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.080
You don't have any immunity to smallpox.

664
00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:00.230
You don't have any reason to have immunity to smallpox.
Uh,

665
00:43:00.231 --> 00:43:05.231
and so you would be susceptible to infection by this organism in addition,

666
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.250
even people I got vaccinated 40 years ago,
right?

667
00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:13.730
Is My vaccines still protective?
Probably not.

668
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.100
And so even people that got vaccinated,

669
00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:21.101
most of us either have questionable or no protection against the virus at this

670
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:25.280
point.
And who,
where would,
if,
if it was,

671
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.860
if it was converted into a weapon,

672
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.270
where would the vaccines to protect the rest of the country come from?

673
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.890
There's no company that's making smallpox vaccine anymore because there's no

674
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:40.400
reason to make smallpox vaccine because nobody would buy it.
Right.

675
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.440
Cause there's no naturally occurring smallpox.

676
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:47.570
And so there was great concern that we were vulnerable in this way because the,

677
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:51.770
the,
uh,
the,
the disease is still a disease that could affect people.

678
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.550
There are still,
there are still some,
um,

679
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.010
some active,

680
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:02.420
a smallpox virus specimens kept in the world.

681
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:03.770
And um,

682
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:08.660
and there are two sources of small or two places where smallpox is stored.
Now.

683
00:44:08.661 --> 00:44:13.661
One is in the u s at the Centers for disease control where there is a sample of,

684
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.200
of uh,
very ola,
which is kept,
you know,

685
00:44:18.201 --> 00:44:21.290
frozen on ice in a heavily guarded facility.

686
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:25.160
And there's another sample which is in,
uh,
in,
in Russia,

687
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.560
part of the former Soviet Union,
uh,

688
00:44:27.561 --> 00:44:31.860
where there are samples that were stored and these samples are used for

689
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:34.950
scientific purposes,
um,
there,
um,

690
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:38.220
and they are kept track of very closely.

691
00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:42.090
But because there's still s smallpox that exists on the planet,

692
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:47.120
there is some concern that that could be obtained and used,

693
00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:51.690
uh,
to develop a weapon.
So that's,
that's the reason for it.

694
00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.100
Shortly after this.

695
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:58.080
And why did that come up 2002 because of what happened in 2001 is why that

696
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:00.930
became a concern there.

697
00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:03.810
The government after this time did,
uh,

698
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:08.250
did issue contracts to manufacturing companies to produce new quantities of the

699
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:09.030
virus.

700
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:14.030
They also found some stockpiles of the virus from the 1950s that they still had

701
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:16.800
on an army base in Maryland,
I think.

702
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:19.770
And they tested those to see if they were still active and they were.

703
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.280
And so there's been an active effort to,
uh,

704
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.640
to reestablish a,
a,
the,
the,

705
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.360
the process of smallpox vaccination in case that's needed.

706
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.770
And there are even some military personnel now who get immunized against

707
00:45:34.771 --> 00:45:39.120
smallpox in the event that when they're going into areas they might be,

708
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:43.650
they might be exposed when they're in a combat areas.

709
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:46.560
And so I,
I give you this example to say,

710
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:49.200
even though tremendous progress was made,

711
00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:54.201
and this is one example that without fail people would say is a marvel of

712
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:58.590
medicine.
And uh,
and,
uh,
bioengineering,
uh,
that,

713
00:45:58.591 --> 00:46:03.450
that it's still something to keep track of.
And there are still opportunities,

714
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.780
uh,
to use what we know about this to develop even better methods.

715
00:46:06.781 --> 00:46:10.440
I think the smallpox vaccine we ne we made now,
we'd probably be better,

716
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:14.390
more effective,
uh,
and uh,
and a safer,
uh,

717
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.980
than the vaccines we made in the fifties.

718
00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.570
So I'm going to continue talking about vaccines on Thursday in particular,

719
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:25.020
we're going to focus at the beginning on polio virus,

720
00:46:25.021 --> 00:46:27.810
which is another great success story,

721
00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.770
but we're a very different approach to vaccine development was used.

722
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.610
And that will be instructive in thinking about what vaccines in the future might

723
00:46:35.611 --> 00:46:36.444
look like.

724
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:42.160
<v 2>Questions?
Great.</v>

725
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:43.040
See you on Thursday.
