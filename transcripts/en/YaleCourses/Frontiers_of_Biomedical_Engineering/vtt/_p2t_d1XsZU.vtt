1
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.110
There were a few things I didn't get to finish last time on talking about a

2
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.870
particularly gene transfer in,
um,
in,
uh,
mammals.

3
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.990
And I want to finish with that and then start on the topic for this week,

4
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:29.640
which is,
uh,
an introduction to cellular physiology and,
uh,

5
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:34.110
in particular cell culture technology or how you culture cells outside the body.

6
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.850
And,
um,
so this is the slide that I left on,
uh,
last time.

7
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.340
Um,
and the idea here was to use plasmids,
which I talked about,

8
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.780
uh,
last Thursday to introduce genes into animals.

9
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.940
And here the,
uh,
the,

10
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.941
the plasma is directly injected into the cell and the cell is a,

11
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.650
uh,
a fertilized egg.

12
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160
And so you take a fertilized egg and you directly inject plasma DNA into the

13
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.010
pronucleus into one of the pronucleus pronuclei and hear this solves a major

14
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:11.581
problem,

15
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:15.990
which I'm going to talk about just at the beginning of class here in a slide or

16
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:20.910
two,
is,
uh,
how to get DNA into cells.

17
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.390
And we talked last week or the week before about the plasma membrane and

18
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.730
something about the chemistry of the plasma membrane,
lipid biolayer.
Uh,

19
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.770
that stable in water because it's arranged in such a way that the hydrophilic

20
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:43.521
parts of the lipid molecules are exposed to both the outer and the inner surface

21
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:49.980
of the cell.
But there's lipid chains in between,
right?

22
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:54.981
So cell membranes are lipid rich layers that can exist in water.

23
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.040
And because of that,
they're barriers,
right?

24
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:03.000
They separate the inside of the cell from the outside of itself and only certain

25
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.030
kinds of molecules can pass through a cell membrane.

26
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.770
It has to be small and it has to be lipid soluble in order for it to pass

27
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:15.000
through a through a cell membrane.
Well,
plasma DNA is neither of those.

28
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.750
It's very water soluble and it's a big molecule,

29
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.750
a very big molecule.
And so it can't naturally get in,

30
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:24.480
decide sells on its own.

31
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.910
And we talked about this a little bit in section last week.

32
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.810
When you eat vegetables or meat,

33
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:34.620
you're eating a lot of DNA,
but that doesn't enter the cells of your body.

34
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.100
All right?
Because of the barrier properties of cell membranes.

35
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.550
So to get genes and gene transfer vectors into cells is a problem here.

36
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:48.270
The problem is solved by injecting it directly into the cell shown here.

37
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.470
And then,
uh,
that's one,
that's one issue with gene delivery.

38
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.550
The second issue is that the gene vector,
in this case,

39
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:01.551
the plasmid has to be compatible with the cells that you're trying to express

40
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:02.764
the gene in.

41
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.490
And that means that the cells have to be able to replicate the DNA on the

42
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.910
plasmid.
So in order to make many more copies of it,

43
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.330
so it has to have an origin of replication,
which we talked about last time,

44
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:18.400
which is compatible with the cells.

45
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.670
And it also has to have a promoter for the gene that the cells can recognize.

46
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.220
And in this case,
the promoter,

47
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.800
which is a sequence of DNA that is positioned right in front of the gene of

48
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:33.634
interest.

49
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.990
The promoter is the Beta lactoglobulin promoter in this case,

50
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:40.150
and Beta lactoglobulin as a milk protein.

51
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.960
So you're taking advantage of a promoter system or a gene activation system that

52
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.780
this species knows about because adult animals can make milk

53
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.800
and when they make milk,
they,
uh,

54
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.940
they have the signals for turning on the Beta lactoglobulin promoter.

55
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:03.520
And expressing the gene of interest.
Okay.

56
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.220
So both of those things have to be correct,
right?

57
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:10.330
You have to be able to get the DNA into the cell has to be incorporated into a

58
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:15.040
vector of some sort and the vector has to be compatible with the species and the

59
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:19.210
cells that you've provided the DNA to.
So in this case,

60
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.410
if everything goes right,
you inject the DNA into the pro nucleus,

61
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:27.940
you implant this fertilized egg into a foster mother.
Uh,

62
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.310
the mother gives birth to an offspring,

63
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.070
it develops and when it develops,

64
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.000
this foreign DNA is in the offspring.

65
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.830
And when the,
when this,
uh,
animal makes milk,

66
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.440
it makes all the normal milk proteins,

67
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.050
but it also activates your gene of interest as well.

68
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.280
And so you could collect your gene of interest in the milk.
Right?

69
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.770
That makes sense.
This,

70
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:57.010
this concept of introducing foreign genes,

71
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.190
genes that are made of recombinant DNA into animals using this kind of technique

72
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.830
is widely used in biomedical research.

73
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.010
And one of the ways that it's used is to take the fertilized egg from an animal,

74
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.520
let's say a mouse.
Usually it's a mouse.

75
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.790
And inject in a vector that contains a gene that,

76
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.270
uh,
that is involved in human disease of some sort,
right?

77
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.510
So one of the big problems with studying human diseases is that you can study

78
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:33.310
how they occur in people,

79
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.090
but there's only a limited amount that you can learn from people.
You know,

80
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.340
if animals get a similar disease,

81
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:42.760
then you can learn about that disease progression in much more detail in the

82
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.460
animal,
right?
So,

83
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.490
but unfortunately there aren't good animal models for many of the diseases that

84
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:55.780
we'd like to study.
Alzheimer's disease is a good one,
you know,

85
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.000
millions of affected by Alzheimer's disease.

86
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.100
Other species don't get Alzheimer's disease,
right?
And,

87
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.850
but you can produce animals that have a disease that's similar in some ways to

88
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:12.851
Alzheimer's disease by taking the genes that are involved in Alzheimer's and

89
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.240
introducing them into mice,
for example.

90
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.470
And you do that by expressing the genes in the mice in,

91
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.060
in the way that I described on the last slide.

92
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.250
And it's shown a little bit more detail on this slide.

93
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.230
And those animals that you produce are called transgenic animals because they're

94
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:35.231
expressing usually at high levels a trans gene or a gene that's not normally

95
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:38.030
present in their species.

96
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.650
Well,
how would you accomplish this kind of,
uh,

97
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.510
how would you accomplish gene transfer in adult humans?
Right.

98
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:54.040
Those two examples I just gave you one headed directly inject,
um,

99
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.050
a,
uh,

100
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.620
a gene containing vector into the pro nucleus of a fertilized egg.
Um,

101
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.210
and you don't have that opportunity and adults,

102
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.420
you already have an adult organism and you'd like to get the gene transferred.

103
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.940
Well,
before we talk about how to do it,

104
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.460
and we don't have perfect ways to do it yet,

105
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:14.430
but I'll describe some of the ways that are used.

106
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.810
I want to talk just briefly on this slide about what the goals for gene therapy

107
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:20.644
might be.

108
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.070
And there's a variety of different ways to think about using gene therapy and

109
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.780
they're,
they're illustrated in this picture.
Um,

110
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.820
one way is to replace a gene that's defective in,

111
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.650
uh,
disease.
And uh,

112
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.680
so usually this is a disease that's caused by a defect in a single gene.

113
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.340
So we talked about sickle cell anemia last time.
That's an example.

114
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.850
Another example is cystic fibrosis and cystic fibrosis is a disease that affects

115
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:52.090
many organ systems,

116
00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:57.091
but particularly the lung and you get cystic fibrosis because one protein that's

117
00:07:57.731 --> 00:08:01.930
made by your lung epithelium is not expressed properly.

118
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.240
You're able to make the protein but the protein doesn't function properly.

119
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.680
And so what you could potentially treat cystic fibrosis by providing the correct

120
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.840
gene and providing it to all the cells of the lung epithelium.

121
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.090
Um,
so because of this,

122
00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:26.470
because cystic fibrosis is a disease that's caused by a single gene defect,

123
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.910
uh,
there's been great interest in trying to treat cystic fibrosis with gene

124
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:35.050
therapy.
And the idea would be to try to give,

125
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.820
usually in the lungs,

126
00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:40.060
people have thought about this because that's where the main manifestations of

127
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:41.110
the disease occur.

128
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.070
And introduce a gene vector into the lungs,

129
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:50.071
perhaps by having a patient inhale it or by somehow instilling it into the lungs

130
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.930
in such a way that the,

131
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.960
these gene vectors get taken up by cells and the gene gets expressed throughout

132
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.400
the,
the lung.
And so this might be a plasmid,

133
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.040
it might be a plasmid that contains a promoter that works in lung cells and that

134
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.750
has the cystic fibrosis gene.

135
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.160
Well now how would you get the gene into the cells here?

136
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.480
But one way you can get it is by mixing the gene with lipids,

137
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.570
with lipid molecules and special lipids that do this are called cat ionic

138
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:28.050
lipids,
their lipids.
But they also have a charged portion,

139
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:32.700
a positively charged portion,
which interacts with DNA.
And so your form DNA,

140
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:37.170
lipid complexes.
And because the DNA is complex with lipids,

141
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.980
it's more soluble and membranes and more likely to enter cells.

142
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.360
So that's one way to do it.
And we'll talk about another ways in just a minute.

143
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.081
But you get,

144
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:49.320
the idea here is to deliver the gene that you're interested in directly to the

145
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:52.470
tissue where it's being used.
And in this case,

146
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.370
the idea is to introduce a gene that's missing.
Now,

147
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:59.790
in other cases you might want to introduce a gene that's not even normally

148
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:01.890
present in people.

149
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.220
And you're doing that because you want to treat disease in a different way.

150
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.750
And one way that that's done is by introducing genes into cancer cells,

151
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:14.850
genes that aren't normally expressed in any mammalian cell,

152
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.740
but that will cause the cancer cell to die.
And this example here,

153
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.150
the idea is to introduce a gene into tumors,

154
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.590
cells of a tumor,

155
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.540
and it's a gene that allows you to deliver a drug that's not active,

156
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.260
but the gene causes that active,

157
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.790
that inactive drug to be converted into an active form that kills the cell.

158
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.210
So this is called a suicide gene.

159
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.950
Basically you're introducing this gene into cells that when you give the right,

160
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:51.450
inactive drug that will cause the cell to make chemicals that kill it,

161
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.070
right?
Does that make sense?

162
00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.990
And so this is a way of introducing cyto toxicity or cell killing ability into a

163
00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:01.020
cell.
And that's,
that's been used to treat many kinds of cancers,

164
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:04.320
particularly cancers of the brain.
The problem is the same.

165
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:08.520
How do I get the gene that I want into only the cells that I want?
Right?

166
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.990
And you could see that it would be a problem here if the gene that you were

167
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:17.340
trying to give to the cancer cells also went to normal cells,
right?

168
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:20.910
That would be a problem.
And this is a common problem in gene therapy.

169
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.350
You would like to get the gene that you're interested in expressed in some

170
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:28.650
population of cells within the body but not in other cells.

171
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.500
So making gene therapies specific is a key problem and making it work.

172
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.800
So these are two examples.

173
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:41.220
I just gave you a introducing genes that affect the life of a cell,

174
00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:44.940
either by making it express a protein that it's not making properly.

175
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.600
That's important too.
It's life or by intentionally killing a cell,

176
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:51.780
by having an express,
a,
a fatal gene.
Uh,

177
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.800
the other examples on the bottom of the slide here are,
uh,

178
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.000
introducing genes that affect neighboring tissues.

179
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.020
And so a one a way to do this might be too,

180
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:07.230
if you're trying to treat a heart that has disease and usually it's disease in

181
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.060
one of the coronary vessels or the blood vessels that serve the heart,

182
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:18.040
that provide blood to the heart.
Coronary artery disease is one of the major,
um,

183
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.960
major causes of death in,
um,
in,
uh,
western countries.

184
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.270
Um,
and uh,
it,

185
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:29.320
it occurs because blood flow gets reduced in that blood vessel,
right?

186
00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:32.590
And so the heart muscle,
which is actively beating all the time,

187
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.440
needs large quantities of oxygen provided by blood,

188
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.360
can't get the blood through the vessel.

189
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.510
So here at concept is to introduce a gene that causes the process of new blood

190
00:12:44.321 --> 00:12:48.070
vessel growth.
If you could introduce that gene,

191
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.580
you'd make the chemical,
in this case,

192
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:55.780
it's a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor.

193
00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.520
The name of the molecule isn't important,

194
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.450
but it's a molecule that stimulates the heart to produce new blood vessels

195
00:13:01.451 --> 00:13:05.020
around it,
right?
So this is introducing a gene.

196
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.960
It's a natural gene,
uh,
but it's not,

197
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.500
it's a natural gene that's found in humans and is actually expressed all over

198
00:13:11.501 --> 00:13:13.410
your body in different levels,
uh,

199
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:17.800
but you're concentrating it or overexpressing it in one particular region of

200
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:22.240
tissue in order to have a particular effect,
right?

201
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.890
So you're taking a normal gene in your overexpressing it or expressing it more

202
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:31.891
abundantly than normal in one particular spot of the body to have an effect

203
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.710
at one.
Last example here is,
um,

204
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.130
that you might want to,
um,
put a,

205
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.810
put a gene in that makes a protein in a tissue that doesn't ordinarily make it

206
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.450
so that that tissue can make large quantities of the protein and serve sort of

207
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:56.830
as a source of that protein as a drug.

208
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:02.530
So the example might be insulin,
right?
Your pancreas normally makes insulin.

209
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.490
Diabetics who,
whose pancreas does not function properly,

210
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:08.250
so don't make enough insulin,
uh,

211
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.320
don't have enough insulin present for normal glucose metabolism so they can't

212
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:16.120
handle sugars properly.
Uh,

213
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.130
but what if you injected the gene for insulin into their muscle so that their

214
00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:25.300
muscle cells in one particular location started making insulin?

215
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.010
Right?

216
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:32.010
Then that insulin would accumulating the muscle and to the blood and circulate

217
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:33.820
all over the body.

218
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:38.350
And so you'd turn the muscle into an insulin making tissue.

219
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.030
Right.
Okay.

220
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:44.380
So those are some examples of different strategies for using gene therapy and

221
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:46.080
people.
Well,

222
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.020
I talked about the pro problem of using plasmids in,
um,

223
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.190
in gene therapy that you,
you,
it's very difficult to get them into cells.

224
00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.720
There are other vectors that are very efficient at getting DNA into cells.

225
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.660
Viruses in particular,

226
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.800
are very effective at delivering their viral DNA into cells.

227
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:16.670
So if you catch a cold,
you get exposed to someone who has,
um,

228
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:21.620
who has,
uh,
a virus that's causing an upper respiratory infection.
Uh,

229
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.840
they cough near you.

230
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.920
That virus enters your respiratory system,

231
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.040
it infects cells of your respiratory system,

232
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.460
and those viruses replicate.
They basically make many,

233
00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:39.461
many copies of their DNA and they make all of their viral proteins and they

234
00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:43.070
assemble into new viral units.
Right?
Well,

235
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:47.480
what if you could hijack that virus to carry genes that you want?

236
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.853
Right.

237
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:53.640
And you could do that by using the techniques we described with,

238
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.800
with uh,
with uh,

239
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:59.801
restriction enzymes and [inaudible] to cut and paste the viral

240
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.350
genome so that it contains the,
um,

241
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.800
the gene of interest to you.

242
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.700
So you make a recombinant virus that has all the normal components of the virus

243
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:19.760
but also has a gene that you want,
right?

244
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.360
And now all you have to do is introduce that virus into an organism and the

245
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:29.510
virus will do what it naturally does,
which is infect some cells.

246
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.950
Now the other nice thing about viruses is not only are they very efficient,

247
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.730
but most viruses are specific for certain kinds of cells.

248
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.810
The kinds of viruses that we get when we have colds are very good at,

249
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:45.550
at infecting the respiratory system.
If you get a,

250
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.920
if you get a flu that affects your,
uh,

251
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:53.180
your intestinal system than those viruses are infecting gut cells.

252
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.980
There's other viruses that infect cells of the brain,
of the kidney,
of the liver.

253
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.950
Hepatitis is a virus that specifically affects the liver.

254
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.550
So viruses are often specific to certain kinds of cells.

255
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:09.850
And that is also an advantage of using them as gene therapy vehicles because

256
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:14.280
they will only infect cells that they are,
uh,

257
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.240
that they have an affinity for that they're prone to affect.
Um,

258
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.870
this picture here,
we're going to come back to this later in,
um,
in,
uh,

259
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.620
two weeks when we start talking about vaccines and we're going to talk about how

260
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:31.250
you make vaccines for viruses.
And so in,
in doing that,

261
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:35.390
we're going to think about the,
the life cycle of a virus.
A,

262
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:40.280
this is a life cycle of a particular class of viruses called retroviruses.
Uh,

263
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:45.110
you know about retroviruses.
The most famous and important one at,

264
00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.070
at this time is HIV,
which is a retrovirus.
This shows the,

265
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.293
the,
uh,

266
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.380
greatly magnified compared to the size of a cell because viruses are much,

267
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:57.120
much smaller than cells,
right?

268
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.210
They might be a hundred nanometers or so in diameter,

269
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.420
whereas a sale is 10 microns or so in diameter.

270
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.720
So these very small particles are able to specifically recognize certain kinds

271
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:09.954
of cells.

272
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.850
They enter the cell after recognizing they fall apart inside the cell.

273
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.860
They reproduce their DNA or their genetic material using,

274
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.930
using a host mechanisms.
They,
in some cases,

275
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:27.690
they integrate their DNA into the host chromosome.

276
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.060
That's what a retroviruses do.

277
00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:35.570
And they make a viral proteins because they've made many copies of their genome

278
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.570
and they've made all the proteins that are necessary to,

279
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.990
for a assembly of a new virus than this cell can make many new viruses.

280
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.360
Right?
So that's another advantage of using viruses as a gene therapy vector.

281
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.740
They can reproduce.

282
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.690
And so you only need to give a few of them in order to make many,

283
00:18:57.691 --> 00:19:02.670
many inside the body.
So why,
why,

284
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.900
uh,
why isn't that the solution,
uh,
to,
uh,
gene therapy?

285
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:12.240
If you can genetically engineer viruses like this and viruses have all those

286
00:19:12.241 --> 00:19:15.120
good properties as gene therapy vehicles that I described.

287
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:19.620
Why isn't this a solution?
Well,
there are problems with viruses as well.

288
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.250
Um,
that,
um,
retroviruses for example,

289
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.440
can only insert,

290
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.210
can only transduce and express their DNA in cells that are dividing.

291
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.420
And so if it's not a cell that's going through division,

292
00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:37.870
you can't use a retrovirus to,
uh,
to express the protein.
Uh,

293
00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.420
they integrate their DNA into the host genome when you might not want to make

294
00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:45.360
that kind of a change right in the,
in the cell.

295
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.170
And so these are some problems with retroviruses.
It's because of this.

296
00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:52.620
People have sought other kinds of viruses to use as vectors and one that's

297
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:55.200
commonly used as an add no virus ad,

298
00:19:55.201 --> 00:19:59.850
no viruses are viruses that give a upper respiratory infections.

299
00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:03.150
They cause colds.
Um,

300
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.900
they can transduce non dividing cells.
So that's a good part.

301
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.440
They can insert genes into non dividing cells and cause those genes to be

302
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:13.380
expressed.
But a problem with vi with,

303
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:17.040
with Adeno viruses is that your immune system recognizes them.

304
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.760
And if your immune system recognizes the virus,

305
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.180
then it can attack the virus and eliminated from the body.

306
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.690
Now normally that's a good thing because if you're out in the world and you get

307
00:20:27.691 --> 00:20:31.920
infected with ad,
no virus,
you recover from it,
right?

308
00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:33.360
Your immune system can get rid of it.

309
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.920
But if you're trying to use that virus as a gene delivery vector and your body

310
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:41.970
gets rid of it,
then the therapy has failed,
right?
It's ended.

311
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.630
And so people have tried to produce viruses that are different ad no viruses,

312
00:20:47.801 --> 00:20:52.060
for example,
that your immune system can't recognize.
But because of this,

313
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.690
because of,
uh,
the natural properties of viruses,

314
00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:00.190
which sometimes are unwanted,
like in retro viruses and,
uh,

315
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.680
and the natural properties of your immune system,

316
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.560
which can cause you to reject viruses,
uh,
we've had,
uh,

317
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.400
great problems in making,
uh,

318
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:14.550
making viruses that are both safe and effective for gene therapy in people.

319
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.570
I,
uh,
talked about,
uh,

320
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.130
just not using viruses but using plasma DNA together with the lipids.

321
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.270
And that's another strategy for a gene therapy.
And,
um,

322
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.720
and we'll talk later about other kinds of vehicles,
uh,

323
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.990
when we talk about new methods for delivery of drugs.

324
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:36.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

325
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:41.610
<v 0>So that's what I wanted to say.
And finishing up,
um,
in,
in finishing up,</v>

326
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.590
uh,
last week's topic of DNA technology

327
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:49.870
and what I want to do for the rest of the time,
uh,

328
00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.600
today is talk about a little bit about cell physiology,

329
00:21:53.601 --> 00:21:56.780
but I'm not going to say too much,
uh,
for a couple of reasons.

330
00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.860
I think most of you know something about the sort of architecture and normal

331
00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:04.100
structure of a,
of a cell and the components within it.

332
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:08.900
And the chapter chapter five has a good description of that.

333
00:22:08.901 --> 00:22:11.600
For those of you who want a refresher.

334
00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:16.760
So we'll talk a little bit about the principles of a sale or physiology and then

335
00:22:16.761 --> 00:22:17.820
I'll move,
uh,

336
00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.790
next time to talking about how you culture cells outside of the body and what

337
00:22:22.791 --> 00:22:23.810
that's useful for.

338
00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:30.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

339
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.920
<v 0>So I,
I used,
I said this sentence in one of the first two classes,</v>

340
00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:40.630
all cells are the same.
And,
um,
and uh,
you know,

341
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:41.201
that's true.

342
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:46.201
We talk about cells as being kind of the fundamental unit of humans and other

343
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.070
multicellular organisms.

344
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.370
And why do we talk about them as the fundamental units?
Uh,

345
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.550
because cells on their own are alive.

346
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.290
They can do the things that we associate with life.
They replicate,
they,
uh,

347
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.290
they reproduce,
they,
uh,

348
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.400
they metabolize right,
they can move,

349
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.910
they can grow and they can use nutrients and make wastes.
Um,

350
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:15.640
and they work cooperatively in order to,
uh,
perform some function.

351
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:21.140
And,
uh,
this is a picture that I showed you before,
but basically,
um,

352
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.720
uh,
tells you something that you already know that humans are made up of organ

353
00:23:25.721 --> 00:23:28.210
systems,
organs and organ systems.

354
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:31.360
Those organs are composed of tissues.

355
00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:36.670
What I didn't mention before was the four major types of tissues which make up

356
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.770
the organs of our body muscle tissues and the function of muscle tissues is to

357
00:23:43.001 --> 00:23:47.900
do work to in order to do work,
uh,

358
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:48.920
nervous tissue.

359
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.210
And the function of nervous tissue is to communicate right using a electrical

360
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:56.720
impulses primarily to communicate epithelial tissues,

361
00:23:56.721 --> 00:24:00.680
which form linings in the body.
So your skin is an epithelium tissue.

362
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.400
The lining of your gut is an epithelial tissue.

363
00:24:04.401 --> 00:24:06.620
The linings of all the glands in your body,

364
00:24:06.621 --> 00:24:11.570
like the pancreas are epithelial tissues and connective tissues which,

365
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.460
uh,
are responsible for holding all these things together into one unit.

366
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:18.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.600
<v 0>So all cells are the same.</v>

368
00:24:19.601 --> 00:24:24.601
And I say that because any cell within you or within me is the same in many

369
00:24:26.171 --> 00:24:29.920
respects,
right?
It has a cell membrane.
If I looked inside,

370
00:24:29.921 --> 00:24:33.700
it has the same kinds of components inside.
Um,

371
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.580
it has the same DNA inside the nucleus.

372
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:38.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

373
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.050
<v 0>But let's take a step back and ask,</v>

374
00:24:41.051 --> 00:24:44.950
are all kinds of cells really the same?

375
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.160
And start by talking about two cells that I know,
you know,

376
00:24:48.161 --> 00:24:52.980
are quite different cells that I took from a human and sells that I,

377
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.710
that are in a bacterium,
right?
So what's,

378
00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.790
what are the differences between a bacterial cell and a human cell?

379
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:02.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

380
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.920
<v 0>What are some of the differences between the bacterial cell and a human cell?</v>

381
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:10.860
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

382
00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:13.560
<v 0>the bacterium doesn't have a nucleus and in fact,</v>

383
00:25:13.561 --> 00:25:18.000
they don't have very well formed a organelles in general.

384
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:18.990
Uh,

385
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.990
human cells have well-described organelles inside of them.

386
00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:26.940
And,
and you took biology in high school.

387
00:25:26.941 --> 00:25:29.640
You learn the names of these organelles and their principal functions,

388
00:25:29.850 --> 00:25:34.110
the nucleus,
the endoplasmic reticulum,
the Golgi apparatus,

389
00:25:34.111 --> 00:25:36.270
Mitochondria,
lysosomes.

390
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.810
So there's those things are all reviewed in the chapter in the book.

391
00:25:39.811 --> 00:25:42.900
I'm not going to talk about them in detail,
but please look at that.
Uh,

392
00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:47.880
to remind yourself of those kinds of specialized sub cellular units,

393
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:52.830
which are present in cells,
in humans,
but not present in bacteria.

394
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.070
Now,
why aren't they present in bacteria?

395
00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.090
<v 1>Okay,</v>

396
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:01.750
<v 0>why don't,
why don't bacteria need a distinct nucleus?</v>

397
00:26:01.751 --> 00:26:05.920
And that's necessary in a,
uh,
in a human cell.

398
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:11.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

399
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.100
<v 0>Or what else is different about,</v>

400
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:21.660
about human cells and bacteria other than these formed organelles?

401
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:31.010
Human cells don't have a cell wall,
but,
but,
um,
most bacteria do.

402
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.950
There are different kinds of a cell walls in bacteria,

403
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:38.750
but they have a rigid cell wall and our,
and our cells don't have a rigid cell.

404
00:26:38.751 --> 00:26:43.440
While we have a fluid lipid like cell wall.
Why,
why is that the case?

405
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:50.180
Well,
you can think about the cell wall of a bacterium as its skeleton,
right?

406
00:26:50.181 --> 00:26:53.270
It's what protects it from the mechanical forces that are out in the world.

407
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.070
We have other ways of protecting.

408
00:26:55.071 --> 00:26:59.240
Many of our cells are inside our body protected by,
uh,

409
00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.990
by specialized cells,
uh,
of our skeletal system.

410
00:27:02.991 --> 00:27:06.170
And so they don't need that kind of mechanical strength.

411
00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:08.043
<v 1>Right?</v>

412
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:11.131
<v 0>Well,</v>

413
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:15.210
another important difference between human cells and bacterial cells as their

414
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:16.044
size.

415
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:20.580
Bacterial cells are small one to two microns in diameter.

416
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:24.660
And this shows a picture of a,
of a common,
a bacterium called [inaudible].

417
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:29.470
And this is,
this is a bacterium that's a,
uh,
normally present in,

418
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:33.750
in humans.
It colonizes all of our intestinal systems.
Uh,

419
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.030
and so it's,
it's a,
it's a common,

420
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.690
it's a common bacterium and most strains of e coli are not harmful to people.

421
00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:45.810
In fact,
they provide us with some beneficial properties.
Um,

422
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.320
a human cell shown here on the,

423
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.400
on the opposite side has these formed organelles that I talked about a minute

424
00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.850
ago.
Mitochondria,

425
00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.050
Golgi endoplasmic reticulum nucleus.

426
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.980
It's encased within a membrane,
a cell membrane,

427
00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.980
which we talked about the structure of and um,

428
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.850
and it's much larger than a bacterium.
It's 10 to 30 microns,

429
00:28:11.851 --> 00:28:15.600
let's say instead of one to two microns.
So almost 10 times bigger.

430
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.690
One of the reasons why,
um,

431
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.600
why human cells have compartment is because,
uh,

432
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:28.140
their functions are segregated into regions,
right?

433
00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.290
The nucleus contains all the DNA.

434
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.560
And so the early stages of gene expression transcription happen inside the

435
00:28:36.931 --> 00:28:39.730
nucleus where all the DNA is,
right?

436
00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.230
And one of the reasons why you would want to segregate things into certain

437
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:48.231
regions is that molecules have to move in order to accomplish these things,

438
00:28:48.481 --> 00:28:53.370
right?
Molecules have to move from one place to another and in general,

439
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:57.150
inside of the cell,
molecules move by a process called diffusion.

440
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.530
They move from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration by

441
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:06.531
this natural flow down a concentration gradient and movement down.

442
00:29:07.501 --> 00:29:12.501
A concentration gradient occurs fairly rapidly over short distances like um,

443
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.570
like a micron or so like the size of a bacterium.

444
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:22.490
Diffusion mixes things very well,
but as the size gets bigger,

445
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.890
defect diffusion becomes very slow.

446
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.970
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

447
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.990
<v 0>right.
And you're familiar with this.
If I had,</v>

448
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:35.050
if I had a jar of acetone or some kind of a volatile liquid,

449
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.260
let's say I have perfume,
I have a jar of perfume and I sit up here.

450
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.250
If the room was still,

451
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.320
the molecules of perfume would diffuse out of this jar and they'd start moving

452
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:52.321
through the room and those of you in the first row would smell it within a few

453
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.130
minutes.
Sometime later you'd smell it one row back.
Sometime later.

454
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:00.070
And the farther away you get,
the longer it takes.

455
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:03.280
But because of the physics of diffusion,

456
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.310
it doesn't go linearly with distance.
That is,

457
00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:09.610
it doesn't take one second to go the first and then two seconds to go.

458
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.650
The second three seconds to go to third.

459
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.130
It varies with the square of distance.

460
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:20.170
So it goes in order to go twice as far takes four times as long.

461
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.010
And these details aren't important.
It is described in your book,

462
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.210
but then the thing that is important to know is that diffusion occurs fast over

463
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:31.480
short distances.
But because of the physics of diffusion,

464
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.400
it occurs slowly over longer distances.
And because of that,

465
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:41.550
you can't count on molecules moving rapidly over the size of a cell that's 10 to

466
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:45.880
30 microns in diameter.
Because of that,

467
00:30:45.881 --> 00:30:47.620
in order to have efficient function,

468
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:52.480
then you group all the like activities together,
right?

469
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:53.920
That's why that's,

470
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:58.950
that's one way of thinking why animal cells have cells from animals and humans

471
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.140
have a sub cellular compartments.

472
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.250
Another thing that's different about a human cells and um,

473
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:12.330
and animal human cells and bacterial cells is that many bacterial cells can

474
00:31:12.491 --> 00:31:16.090
swim.
And can exist in suspension.

475
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.120
That means just suspended in a fluid.
In fact,

476
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:23.950
that's their preferred state is suspended in a fluid where nutrients are widely

477
00:31:23.951 --> 00:31:28.090
available to them and where they can swim from one spot to another in order to

478
00:31:28.091 --> 00:31:32.890
get the nutrients they need or in order to run away from toxic compounds.
Right?

479
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:34.420
And if you're a bacterium,

480
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:37.780
you're whole life is about swimming to nutrients and running away from things

481
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:41.800
that would kill you.
Right?
Human cells.

482
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:46.801
Most human cells don't function very well in suspension if you take cells from

483
00:31:49.181 --> 00:31:54.160
my skin and disperse them and we will talk about ways to do that next time.

484
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.980
And you tried to maintain them in a beaker.

485
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.880
Even if that beaker had all the nutrients that skin cells needed,

486
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.520
they wouldn't survive very well in solution.

487
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.930
They tend to need to be stuck to a surface in order to survive.

488
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.680
And that's what this picture on the bottom shows you.
Here it's,
it's a,

489
00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:16.330
it's a picture of cells actually a growing and moving in cell culture.

490
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.450
This is a cell from connective tissue called a fiber fiberblast.

491
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:23.370
And instead of being round like this cartoon of a cell,
uh,

492
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:28.300
when you have the selling culture in a,
in a plastic or a glass dish,

493
00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.960
it tends to stick to the dish and spread out.

494
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:36.970
So it looks much more like a,
like a pancake,
a funny shaped pancake,

495
00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.720
uh,
but at pancake than a sphere,
what,

496
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.160
and this property of cells in culture is called anchorage dependence,

497
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.690
that the cell needs to be anchored to a surface in order to function properly.

498
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.070
That's another difference between,
uh,

499
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.010
between human cells and bacteria.

500
00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:01.030
Now what does that have to do with the life of a cell inside the body?
It's this,

501
00:33:01.031 --> 00:33:04.240
this picture on the bottom shows the cell stuck to plastic.

502
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.440
Certainly that's not what it's like when it's inside the body.

503
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.170
While it's true that it's not stuck to plastic,

504
00:33:11.171 --> 00:33:15.490
but it is stuck to other materials and the other materials that it stuck to

505
00:33:15.491 --> 00:33:20.440
include other cells that surround it.
And this complex,

506
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:21.310
um,

507
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:25.990
matrix which surrounds all of the cells in our body called extracellular matrix.

508
00:33:25.991 --> 00:33:30.600
And I'll get to that in just a few moments.
So in some senses,

509
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:34.230
most of the cells in our body are stuck to a surface.

510
00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.820
They're stuck to his surface that's provided by the environment that's around

511
00:33:38.821 --> 00:33:41.760
them,
right?
They're not swimming free in solution.

512
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:45.441
Well,
you know,

513
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:50.441
that cells in our body can reproduce and most of you have probably at some point

514
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:52.760
or another,
uh,

515
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:57.761
learned about the cell cycle or the process of a cell going from,

516
00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.480
uh,
being a single cell to being,
uh,
two cells and,
um,

517
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:08.030
that's shown schematically here.
Let me talk about the bottom,
uh,
uh,

518
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.200
diagram first,

519
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:14.201
which shows the process of my tosas and my ptosis is an orderly sequence of

520
00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:19.871
events by which one parent's cell becomes two daughter cells.

521
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.280
And several things happened during my tosas.
First,

522
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.940
when a cell enters the process of my Tosas,

523
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:33.020
it already has twice.
It's the DNA that it needs,
right?

524
00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:37.190
So before a cell enters might ptosis,
it has to have synthesized its DNA.

525
00:34:37.191 --> 00:34:41.500
So it has two copies of all of its chromosomes.
Uh,

526
00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:46.660
so what happens during my tosas is that the cell is able to separate this double

527
00:34:49.251 --> 00:34:53.720
set of chromosomes into two sets.

528
00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:55.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

529
00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.750
<v 0>And that happens,
uh,
in,
uh,
in,</v>

530
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:03.510
in a way that's shown in this cartoon here.
It's separates those,
uh,

531
00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.630
duplicated chromosomes to two sides of the cell,
physically separates them.

532
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:11.910
And the sale itself pinches off to form,
uh,
to,
uh,

533
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:16.330
new cells where if this happens,
it correctly,
uh,

534
00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.070
each of the new cells has exactly the same composition as the,
as the,

535
00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.720
as the parent sl.

536
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

537
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.891
<v 0>Well,</v>

538
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:29.700
my ptosis is one event that happens during this larger event called the cell

539
00:35:29.701 --> 00:35:30.534
cycle.

540
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:35.650
It's usually shown like a clock is shown here where a time zero,

541
00:35:36.351 --> 00:35:37.184
which is at the,

542
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.700
here is right at the end of my tosas where you have two new cells that are

543
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:43.860
formed.
So if I followed one of them,

544
00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:48.030
it is in a phase that's called a g one first.

545
00:35:48.031 --> 00:35:53.031
And this is a resting phase before it enters the process of synthesizing new DNA

546
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.060
in preparation for another round of mytosis.

547
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.420
A G two is a phase that indicates the gap between when DNA synthesis occurs and

548
00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:06.330
when the next mitotic event occurs.
Right?

549
00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.870
And so if sales were actively proliferating,
that is,

550
00:36:09.871 --> 00:36:14.040
you had a population of cells that are actively PR proliferating.

551
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.640
They would be going through continuous rounds of the cell cycle,

552
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.990
new cells or form.
They weighed a bit,
they synthesize DNA,

553
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.700
they weighed a bit,
they divide and on and on and on.

554
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:31.620
Uh,
well not all of the cells in your body are dividing at any one time,

555
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.680
right?
Not all the cells are dividing.
In fact,

556
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:39.090
cells in your brain don't proliferate it.
All right?

557
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.310
Some small subsets do,
but most of the cells in your brain don't proliferate.

558
00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:48.450
And that's because they get trapped at one portion of the cell cycle.

559
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.730
They get arrested in the g one phase,
for example,

560
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.880
and they never progressed through to the s phase where they synthesize DNA,

561
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:00.970
right?

562
00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:05.970
So cells can stop in their lifetime at some point in the sales cycle and persist

563
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.030
for long periods of time.

564
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:18.150
Well,
this process of cell proliferation or cell division is,

565
00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:19.170
um,

566
00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:24.170
is of course very important during development of an embryo and during

567
00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:29.970
development of the embryo.

568
00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.330
It goes from being a single cell,

569
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:39.390
the fertilized egg to being a multicellular organism,

570
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.580
uh,
with the,
with billions of cells in it.

571
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.600
And those billions of cells come from successive rounds of cell division.

572
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:52.943
<v 1>Now</v>

573
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.350
<v 0>I said before that all cells are the same.
And when I talked about,
uh,</v>

574
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.420
my Tosas,

575
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.910
I talked about cells making a perfect copies of each other.

576
00:38:03.911 --> 00:38:07.240
So each parent's cell becoming two daughter cells that are the same.

577
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:12.520
And so if,
uh,
if that was all that was happening,

578
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:15.340
that an embryo would just be many,

579
00:38:15.341 --> 00:38:19.930
many cells that are all identical and you know,
that's not the case,

580
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:20.740
right?

581
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.740
So cells start to change and they change in complex ways so that eventually

582
00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.640
when,
uh,
when a fetus is born,

583
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.900
it has some cells that make up its brain.
Some that make up the,

584
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.880
some that make up the liver and the skin and all those cells are different in

585
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:40.900
important ways.

586
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

587
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:42.520
<v 0>Well,</v>

588
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.520
I'm going to talk next week or next time on Thursday about the processes that

589
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:52.810
lead to differences between cells.

590
00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:54.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

591
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:58.450
<v 0>The general word for that process of making differences between cells is</v>

592
00:38:58.451 --> 00:38:59.680
differentiation.

593
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:01.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

594
00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.520
<v 0>When cells become</v>

595
00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:03.650
<v 1>okay,</v>

596
00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.620
<v 0>more like cells of the mature brain,</v>

597
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.040
they're said to differentiate into brain cells.

598
00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:13.520
When they become more like the liver,
they differentiate into liver cells.

599
00:39:13.521 --> 00:39:17.750
And so we're going to talk about that process,
uh,
more,
uh,
next time.

600
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.060
What I want you to,
uh,
remember,
uh,

601
00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:26.140
now is that abundant cell proliferation takes place during development.

602
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:28.820
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

603
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.820
<v 0>All of the cells that are reproduced during development are the same in certain</v>

604
00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:36.530
ways.
They contain the same DNA.

605
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.440
They're all progeny of the same fertilized egg,

606
00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:45.490
but differences are acquired within specific cell populations during the process

607
00:39:45.621 --> 00:39:46.460
of development.

608
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:48.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

609
00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:53.730
<v 0>Some of those differences in cells are obvious if you look at the cells in an</v>

610
00:39:53.731 --> 00:39:56.220
adult organism.
And in fact,

611
00:39:56.221 --> 00:40:00.990
some cells are very different from the cells that are,
uh,

612
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.390
are proliferating early in development.

613
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.280
And one example of a very different sell is a red cell or red blood cell.

614
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.540
These are the cells that,
uh,
that give blood.
It's red color.

615
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:17.780
They make up about a 45 to 50% of the volume of blood is red cells.

616
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.360
And they're red because they contain a,

617
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:26.880
a special protein called hemoglobin,
which is very concentrated inside the cell.

618
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.790
And Hemoglobin as you know,
is an oxygen carrier.

619
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.770
And so red blood cells concentrated bags of hemoglobin which circulate in your

620
00:40:34.771 --> 00:40:38.780
blood and they carry oxygen.
Well.
Um,

621
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.980
it was not very hard for me to draw this red blood cell here cause it's just an

622
00:40:42.981 --> 00:40:43.760
oval.

623
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.150
And one reason I draw like an oval is that that's basically what it looks like

624
00:40:47.151 --> 00:40:50.510
if you look at it.
And one of the most obvious things about our red blood cells,

625
00:40:50.511 --> 00:40:54.530
it doesn't have a nucleus,
it has no a nucleus.

626
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:59.900
And so red blood cells are terminally differentiated cells.

627
00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.920
They have become as different as they can be.
In fact,

628
00:41:02.921 --> 00:41:05.620
they're no longer capable of reproducing a,

629
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.440
all they can do is exist as red blood cells and then die.
Right.

630
00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:14.620
So they've lost one of the essential characteristics of the cells that are the

631
00:41:14.781 --> 00:41:17.390
same that I talked about earlier.

632
00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.733
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:23.460
<v 0>That's just an example of a cell that in it's very mature or differentiated form</v>

634
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.190
is quite different from other cells inside the body.

635
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:31.720
On the other side of this diagram,
I show a picture of a neuron.
Um,

636
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:35.000
this is just an example of what a neuron might look like.

637
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.810
Here's the nucleus in the middle of the cell body.

638
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:43.190
And what if you looked at a picture of a variety of different cells that were

639
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.350
isolated from adult organisms.

640
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:49.040
You would recognize this immediately as a neuron or something that's like a

641
00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:54.041
neuron because of the many small thin projections that come out of the body of

642
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:56.084
the cell.

643
00:41:56.390 --> 00:42:00.620
And neurons have these projections because one important property or one

644
00:42:00.621 --> 00:42:03.890
important function of neurons is to communicate with each other.

645
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:07.280
And the way that they communicate with each other is by physically touching each

646
00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:07.820
other.

647
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:12.080
And the way that they connect across distances is by having these processes that

648
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:16.280
extend from one place to another.
So like many cells,
uh,

649
00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.360
in neurons,

650
00:42:17.361 --> 00:42:22.361
the shape of the cell is intimately related to its function within the organism.

651
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:24.860
And that's obvious when you look at neurons.

652
00:42:24.861 --> 00:42:27.470
And it will be obvious when we look at other kinds of cells as well.

653
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.760
Because of this,

654
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:34.090
often a biologist can discriminate between different kinds of cells that they

655
00:42:34.431 --> 00:42:38.700
see in a section of a tissue,
for example,
uh,

656
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:40.280
merely by its shape

657
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:46.070
and the characteristics that it has.
And so one could easily,
for example,

658
00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:49.130
differentiate between a red cell and a neuron.

659
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:52.850
But as skilled biologist who's looked at many,

660
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:56.780
many different sales could differentiate between different types of neurons,

661
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.980
maybe by the different branching patterns that these processes had,

662
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.920
or how many processes were on a different kind of neuron.

663
00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.270
You'd be able to tell something about its function and probably something about

664
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:12.710
where it came from.
And you might be able to tell just by looking at it,
what was,

665
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.860
if there was a disease,
what was wrong with it?

666
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.700
And Inter in between these two pictures,

667
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:24.560
I show a picture of a fiberblast fibroblasts are specialized cells that exist in

668
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:25.850
connective tissues.

669
00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.330
So the connective tissue was one of those four main types of tissue.

670
00:43:29.331 --> 00:43:33.510
They're supporting material,
supporting tissues that surround,
um,

671
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:37.880
other cells in the body and give the cell and give the body much of its

672
00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:42.830
mechanical property.
One of the important functions of a fiberblast is to,

673
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:46.760
uh,
is to allow for healing of wounds.

674
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.720
And this shows a fibroblasts that is very stretched out.

675
00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:56.270
And remember when I showed you that picture of cells attached to plastic a few

676
00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:00.350
minutes ago,
I said those were fibroblasts that were growing on a culture dish.

677
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.050
If,
um,
if I looked within the skin,
one of the lower layers of your skin,

678
00:44:06.051 --> 00:44:09.470
the connective tissue layer,
you'd find many fiberblast there.

679
00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:14.360
And they're just waiting in a more rounded shape than this just waiting,

680
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.590
uh,
to do their job.
And their job begins.

681
00:44:18.591 --> 00:44:20.990
If you happen to cut yourself for example,

682
00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:24.950
or you get a wound and when you get a wound,

683
00:44:24.951 --> 00:44:27.920
several things start to happen first,
hopefully your blood clots.

684
00:44:27.921 --> 00:44:32.921
And so that stops you from dying from loss of blood there.

685
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.560
But,
um,
but your body tries to heal this wound that's created.

686
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:40.710
And one of the first steps in that healing is that fiber blast.

687
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:45.711
Like this cell crawl into this space that's created by the wound and they grab a

688
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:50.580
hold of both sides of the wound and contract and try to pull it together.

689
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:56.910
To do that,
they have to be able to stretch out and they have to be able to pull.

690
00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:00.730
And if you look at this picture of this fiberblast,

691
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:03.930
you can imagine that it's firmly stuck up here.

692
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.290
It's firmly adherent to the surface here.

693
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:12.180
It's firmly adherent at the back here and in between it's trying to pull these

694
00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:16.290
ends closer together.
You can imagine that that's what it's doing.
And in fact,

695
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:20.640
that's one of the functions of fibroblasts.
So this is another example of,

696
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.100
uh,
of,
uh,
uh,

697
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.690
of how the shape of a cell can tell you something about its function,

698
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:32.640
how you can discriminate between different cells by looking at how they,
uh,

699
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:36.090
how they look in,
uh,
in,
uh,

700
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.280
in their native environment.

701
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.860
So humans are collections of cells.
All cells are the same in important ways,

702
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.890
but cells acquire differences during development.

703
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.510
And so we are a collections of billions of cells.

704
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:55.110
What holds us together so that when I leave the room,
uh,

705
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.450
most of my sales go with me.

706
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.440
What holds all these cells that are doing different things together?
Well,

707
00:46:01.441 --> 00:46:05.790
one thing that holds the cells together is that they're able to adhere to each

708
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:10.770
other.
That cells that form tissues often have junctions,

709
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:12.180
uh,
that,
uh,

710
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:16.140
that hold them together so that they don't fall apart and they,

711
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:21.120
and they exist as a solid piece of tissue.
And so this diagram is supposed to,

712
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.090
supposed to make you think about the intestinal tract.

713
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:30.200
This tube that runs through our bodies and allows us to acquire nutrients from

714
00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:35.520
the environment.
And uh,
this to this hollow tube,

715
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.120
which food passes through is made up of many,

716
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:41.250
many epithelial cells,

717
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:47.150
which directly abut one another and would be a flat sheet except that it's

718
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:50.970
rolled up into a tube,
right?

719
00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:55.620
And it's this tube like structure,
which is made of many,

720
00:46:55.621 --> 00:47:00.621
many epithelial cells all directly adjacent to each other is what separates the

721
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.640
outside world from our internal bodies,

722
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.350
right?
We take bits of the outside world like food and we swallow them,

723
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:15.270
right?
And One can imagine that when they're inside this tube here,

724
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:19.980
there's still really outside the body,
right?
If the,
if the,

725
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.340
if it passed directly through the tube and nothing happened to it,

726
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:25.590
it would come out to the outside world.
Again,

727
00:47:25.591 --> 00:47:29.680
there's a continuous path from the outside world,
right?

728
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:30.910
Right through the intestine.

729
00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:36.100
That food only becomes part of us if it gets absorbed through the intestinal

730
00:47:36.101 --> 00:47:37.570
wall.
That is,

731
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:41.200
if it can be absorbed through this layer of epithelium,

732
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.390
right?

733
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:47.500
So what happens in the intestine is that food gets broken down into constituent

734
00:47:47.501 --> 00:47:51.430
molecules.
Some of those molecules are absorbed into our bodies.

735
00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:56.610
They become part of us and the rest get we would get rid of and they remained

736
00:47:57.191 --> 00:47:59.380
part of the outside world,
right?

737
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.220
So it's these cells that are sitting at the surface here that are responsible

738
00:48:05.351 --> 00:48:08.980
for determining what becomes part of us and what stays outside.

739
00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.510
And one of the ways they can do this is that there's no space in between these

740
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:18.070
cells.
This cell can only be an effective barrier

741
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.240
if there's no way to get past it,
right?

742
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:26.890
And so cells of the epithelium are actually welded to one another through these

743
00:48:26.891 --> 00:48:30.970
junctions called tight junctions.
And these junctions,

744
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:33.730
these red dots here actually made up of proteins.

745
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.510
Some are synthesized by one cell summer synthesize by each other and they lock

746
00:48:38.511 --> 00:48:41.620
together to form a very

747
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.810
tight barrier,
uh,

748
00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:50.830
to form a tight junction between the two cells.
And because of that,

749
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.020
if,
uh,
if I eat something that's rich in glucose,
uh,

750
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:59.920
so it has lots of sugar molecules that sugar molecules can't pass between the

751
00:48:59.921 --> 00:49:02.620
cells,
that's how tight the junctions are.

752
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.610
Not even a small molecule like glucose can pass between them.

753
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.740
In order for glucose to enter our body,

754
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:13.860
it has to go through the cells in order for it to get inside the cells and go

755
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:14.980
through them.

756
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:19.340
There have to be transporters which specifically allow glucose to pass into the

757
00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:22.660
cell and then out into our body.
Right?

758
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:27.790
So there's a couple of features of cellular physiology,
which are shown here.

759
00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:32.970
One is that cells form tissues that are mechanically intact mechanically,

760
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.960
they have mechanical integrity because they,
uh,

761
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:39.910
they can adhere to one another.

762
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:41.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

763
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:46.100
<v 0>And the other is that this kind of adherence gives the tissue a property that's</v>

764
00:49:46.101 --> 00:49:48.560
useful.
In this case,
the property is,

765
00:49:48.561 --> 00:49:52.250
it can serve as a barrier to,
uh,
to,
uh,

766
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.870
nutrients from entering our body.

767
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:55.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

768
00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:59.720
<v 0>The other reason why cell state together is that they're surrounded by a matrix,</v>

769
00:49:59.721 --> 00:50:04.130
this called extra cellular matrix and that Matrix has properties,

770
00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.810
um,
that um,
vary in different locations in the body,

771
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:13.400
but basically it's a highly hydrated or water rich Gel.

772
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:18.680
And so,
uh,
you know what Jello is?
Everybody knows what Jello is,

773
00:50:18.681 --> 00:50:23.200
right?
Uh,
it's usually colored because there's food dye in it,
uh,

774
00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:26.270
but it wouldn't be colored in.
It's natural state.

775
00:50:26.271 --> 00:50:31.271
Jello is a hydrated solution of Collagen and it contains a lot of water.

776
00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:38.750
Uh,
piece of Jello,
uh,
has probably 99% water in it,

777
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:43.280
but it has a shape,
right?
If you make Jello,
um,
and you,

778
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.940
you make it right then once it's set or jelled,

779
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.930
it has mechanical properties.
You,

780
00:50:48.931 --> 00:50:51.320
if you made it in a cup and you tried to pour it out,

781
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:55.610
it was still have the shape of the cup when it came out.
And because of this,

782
00:50:55.611 --> 00:51:00.020
my mother used to make Jello that had fruit suspended in it,
right?
And the,

783
00:51:00.021 --> 00:51:02.960
and the fruit doesn't sink to the bottom like you'd expect it to sync through

784
00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:04.970
water,
but it stays suspended inside.

785
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.000
Anybody's mother make Jello with fruit in it.

786
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.910
So that's how cells exist in extracellular matrix.

787
00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:16.340
Extracellular matrix in most tissues is,

788
00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.140
is abundant in Collagen and other proteins like Collagen.

789
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:24.140
This collagen is highly hydrated.

790
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:27.860
It forms a Gel that has water properties,

791
00:51:27.861 --> 00:51:31.130
but it also has solid properties.
Right.

792
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:35.360
We'll talk about exactly what a gel is later when we talk about biomechanics and

793
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:40.361
cells are suspended within it and the extra cellular matrix or the college in

794
00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:46.181
jail gives the tissue integrity and in part determines its mechanical

795
00:51:46.821 --> 00:51:48.230
properties.
Do you have a question?

796
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.030
So where does the college and come from?

797
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.150
The college and is excluded by cells themselves.

798
00:51:56.151 --> 00:52:00.950
So the matrix is made by cells.
In fact,
fibroblasts,

799
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.300
which I talked about before,

800
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:07.301
are very good producers of Collagen and they produce the Collagen Matrix within

801
00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:12.020
which they live
and some cells digest Collagen.

802
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.870
And so what,
what ex,

803
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:19.220
what extra cellular matrix you have in any particular tissue?
Is there,

804
00:52:19.221 --> 00:52:23.060
because there's a balance between it being produced by one kind of cell and

805
00:52:23.061 --> 00:52:27.350
digested by another and you're in this sort of state of dynamic equilibrium.

806
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.670
Okay,
I'm going to stop there and we'll continue on Thursday.
