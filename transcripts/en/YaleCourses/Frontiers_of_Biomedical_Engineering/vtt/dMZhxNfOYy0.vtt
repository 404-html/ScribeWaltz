1
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.750
So this week we're going to talk about about biomechanics.

2
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.250
Let me do this a different way.
Sorry.
Uh,

3
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.260
we're going to talk about biomechanics and the reading is chapter 10.

4
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.320
I think on your syllabus it says chapter 10 and 13,

5
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:28.860
but we're really only going to talk about chapter 10 during class.

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.990
And then our section on Thursday will also involve two aspects of biomechanics,

7
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:35.970
talking about materials,
properties,

8
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.070
which is what I'm going to focus on in the lecture today.

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.400
And thinking about some elementary gait analysis gate to ga it or how,

10
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.700
uh,
how humans walk and run and the mechanics of that.

11
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.010
A particular kind of motion.

12
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.580
So this is like many of the other topics that we've covered,
uh,
in,

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.130
uh,
in the course.
A very big subject.

14
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.280
And some of you I have no doubt are going to go on to,

15
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.400
to study biomechanics in greater detail.

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.550
So I've picked a couple of things that I thought were interesting to sort of

17
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.310
teach you sort of the elements of mechanics.

18
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.300
How do I use physics to think about biological materials and um,

19
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.390
and uh,

20
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.830
and how organisms live in a physical world.

21
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.290
And so today we're going to talk about properties of biological materials in

22
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.220
particular to,
uh,
properties,
elasticy,
city and viscosity.

23
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.560
And we'll talk about how most real biological materials,
your skin,

24
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.110
your brain,
the,
um,

25
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.900
the gel that makes up the interior portion of your,

26
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:50.730
I have both of those qualities.
They're both viscous and elastic,

27
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.160
and they exhibit something that we call visco elastic city.

28
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.340
And so by the end of the lecture today,

29
00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.120
you should know a little bit about what visco elastic city is and how materials

30
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.100
that have that property behave and the,

31
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:06.060
and most biological materials have the that property.

32
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.810
And then on Thursday we're going to talk about locomotion.

33
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.680
How do animals move in particular,
how to humans move?

34
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.920
And we'll talk about three kinds of motion.
Uh,

35
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.660
the most interesting one may be flying that humans don't do unaided.

36
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.950
Uh,
but it's interesting to think about how flight is possible from a mechanical

37
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.090
perspective.

38
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.050
How do organisms release themselves from the gravitational field and learn how

39
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:34.860
to move,
uh,
in,
uh,
in a flight.

40
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.830
We'll talk about swimming and we'll talk about running

41
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.770
or walking.
So first,

42
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:46.770
the mechanical properties of biological materials.

43
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.540
And these are the two questions that I want to focus on during the lecture
today.

44
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.810
And,
uh,
the two questions that you should be able to answer by the end.

45
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.680
What is the lasting city?
How do would I measure the plasticity?

46
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.680
How would I quantify?

47
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.620
Elasticy city might be other ways to think about that question.

48
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.570
And what is visco elastic city?

49
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.260
How do visco elastic materials differ from elastic materials?

50
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.980
And how does that make them different in biological,
um,

51
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.030
when,
when,
when they're part of a biological organism.

52
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.510
So we're going to think about this simple experiment that's a,
that's shown,
uh,

53
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.950
uh,
schematically on the top here in panel a of this diagram.

54
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.060
So we assume we have some material and this could be anything,

55
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.030
but let's think about it in the simplest possible way.

56
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:38.730
It's some uniform material,
uh,
uh,
at least initially.
Uh,

57
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.860
so it may be it's a steel,

58
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.300
maybe it's rubber plastic,
maybe it's some biological material,

59
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:50.560
like a muscle or some other kind of tissue,
skin,

60
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.470
an artery.
And,
um,

61
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.510
but let's just think about rubber for the beginning.

62
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.990
Maybe even a rubber band and you hang the rubber band from some solid support

63
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:06.340
that's unmovable,
like the ceiling here.

64
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.340
So we have some way of a fixing this solid material to the ceiling and we can

65
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.860
measure some properties of the material,
mechanical properties of the material.

66
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:18.160
For example,
it has a length and it has a cross sectional area.

67
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.490
And when we do mechanical testing,

68
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:26.110
we're trying to understand how that material behaves when it's exposed to

69
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:26.944
forces,

70
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.870
right when it's exposed to the forces that encounters in the physical world.

71
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.740
And so we want to set up an experiment where we can apply a force uniformly and

72
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:43.570
measure the result of that force simply.

73
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.400
And so the experiment I show here is just to hang a weight on that material

74
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:51.070
that's suspended from the ceiling,
that rubber band,
for example,

75
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.230
I hang a weight on it.
And so that w that weight

76
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.540
apply some force to the material,
right?

77
00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:02.350
Because it's gravity is gonna pull it down with some force based on its mass.

78
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.060
And for most materials,
certainly for rubber bands,
if I put them on the,

79
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.600
fix them to the ceiling that way.
And attached to weight.
What would happen?

80
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.920
They would lengthen,
they'd get longer because they're exposed to that weight.

81
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.320
And so I've applied a force

82
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.540
and I've experienced a defamation,
right?

83
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.430
I've applied a force and the material has deformed and I'm going to quantify

84
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:32.200
that and I can quantify that fairly easily because I chose a simple material

85
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.650
that had a constant cross sectional area from the top to the bottom.

86
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.590
So I'm going to assume that that cross sectional area,

87
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:40.540
it doesn't change when it deforms,

88
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.690
but I hang the weight on it and the length increases.

89
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.710
So the length is now l plus Delta l.

90
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.920
And so I can quantify the defamation here by defining a property called strain.

91
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.750
And the strain is just the change in length divided by the total length.

92
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.910
Now important what length we use here and we we're,

93
00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.140
we're going to use the initial length as the length,
right?

94
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.410
So the strain is the change in length divided by the length in the unstressed

95
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:21.470
position.
Unstressed orientation on stressed condition,

96
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.870
that's the right word.
S does that make sense?

97
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.910
So this is a measure of how much it deforms.

98
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.320
And we're going to define the stress and stress is just force per unit area.

99
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.710
Cause you can imagine if I hang the same weight on this material,

100
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.470
if it's a material that has a large cross sectional area,

101
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:43.250
it's very thick or it's a material that's very thin,

102
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.550
then it's defamation is going to be different because that force is going to be

103
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:50.060
distributed over either a big area or a small area.

104
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.020
And so the stress is just equal to the force per area.

105
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.040
And we're going to assume that we arranged it in some way that it's uniform over

106
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:02.240
the area
so it makes it so the experiment makes sense.

107
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.130
Hanging from the ceiling,
suspended one,
one,
one end is held rigid.

108
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.470
I put a weight on it,
I watch it to form,

109
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.450
I measure the defamation that occurs as a result of applying that stress.

110
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.100
Okay.

111
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.020
Now to analyze how this material behaves under different stress conditions,

112
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.510
right?
So I might want to know how does the muscle of my thigh behave when it

113
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:30.290
experiences different kinds of affirmations,
right?

114
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.220
What stress builds up when I stretch it out,
for example.

115
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.300
Um,
because I'm interested in the mechanics of running.

116
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.740
And so what I want to know is what is the defamation that occurs in this

117
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:47.570
particular muscle when I've applied different forces are different stresses to

118
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:48.404
it.

119
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.700
And so the way that I would measure that is by just applying different forces,

120
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.020
right?
Start with,
start with a small force at a larger force,
at a larger force,

121
00:07:57.021 --> 00:08:01.280
and then measure the defamation at each of those conditions.
And if I did that,

122
00:08:01.281 --> 00:08:05.930
I could plot on this diagram here.
Stress versus strain.

123
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:08.763
<v 1>Okay,</v>

124
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.490
<v 0>now the strain.
Remember just Delta l over l the stress,</v>

125
00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.230
just the force divided by the area.

126
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.850
But I would get different points on this curve and each one would represent a

127
00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:22.720
different experiment where I added a different force and eventually I could draw

128
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:23.980
a line through it.

129
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.860
Now think back again to the first example I said the simple example just to

130
00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:32.830
rubber band.
If you did this experiment with a rubber band,

131
00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:35.500
you hung different forces on it.
What would you see as you,

132
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.470
as you put more weight on,

133
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.650
the rubber band would stretch more and more and more.

134
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.750
So the strain would go up and in fact up to a certain amount of force.

135
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.610
If I measured the strain that results from forces,
I would get a straight line,

136
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.180
<v 1>okay,</v>

137
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.130
<v 0>I could plot stress versus</v>

138
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.130
<v 1>strain and I would get a straight line and that a material that behaves that way</v>

139
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:03.600
is called an elastic material.

140
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.540
<v 0>That's,
that's an elastic material,
a perfect elastic material.</v>

141
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.160
I could apply those forces,
it would stretch out,
and if I took the forces away,

142
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:15.540
it would go right back up again.

143
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.230
And at the end of the experiment of adding more weight than taking the weight

144
00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:23.770
off the material be exactly the same as how it started.

145
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.510
That's an elastic material that's perfectly reversible,
right?

146
00:09:28.511 --> 00:09:30.340
A perfect elastic material.
Now,

147
00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:34.300
I could tell you everything you need to know about the elastic properties,

148
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.690
that material by giving you one number,
the slope of this line.

149
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.420
Because once you knew the slope of this line,

150
00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:44.380
you could draw the curve that represents all of it's stress strain behavior.

151
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.290
So instead of someone else having to do this experiment again,

152
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:51.270
you could just tell them,
oh,

153
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.360
for those rubber bands I measured the elasticity and the elasticity or the slope

154
00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.750
of this line is some number.
He this,

155
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:05.720
this letter he is called the elastic modulus or the Young's modulus.
And um,

156
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.710
it's,
um,

157
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.120
it's a characteristic of the material for this material in this particular

158
00:10:12.121 --> 00:10:16.070
geometry.
That's the elastic modulus,
that and,
and,

159
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:19.920
and someone who knew that would know how to predict how that material behaves,

160
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.890
at least under the conditions in which you did the experiment.

161
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.810
Does that make sense?
Now,
if you've studied physics in the past,

162
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:29.700
I assume most of you have in high school,

163
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.610
then you've thought about perfect elastic materials.

164
00:10:32.611 --> 00:10:35.880
What did you call a perfect elastic material in physics?

165
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.480
What do you remember studying a perfect elastic material in physics

166
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.870
a spring?
That's exactly what it spring is.
And when you talked about springs,

167
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.380
you talked about a spring constant,

168
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.830
which was how to relate the force to the elongation.

169
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:57.160
This is exactly the same thing,
but it's sort of described in a different way,

170
00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.120
right?

171
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.030
Because now you're talking about a real material that has cross sectional area,

172
00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.100
not an imaginary spring,
but when you thought about springs and spring constants,

173
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.820
you were thinking about this exact same physical process.

174
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.730
We're just describing it in a different way now.
And in fact,

175
00:11:12.731 --> 00:11:16.580
by the end of the lecture,
we'll come back to thinking about springs as,
um,

176
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.030
as a way of idealizing or describing,
uh,

177
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:24.070
materials that have complex properties.
Okay.

178
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.181
Until this spring,

179
00:11:25.181 --> 00:11:30.181
the imaginary object that you talked about in physics is just an idealization of

180
00:11:30.551 --> 00:11:34.660
real materials and how they really behave when forces are applied to them.

181
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.070
<v 1>Okay?</v>

182
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.510
<v 0>Okay.
If you continue to add force,
then at some point,</v>

183
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.070
at some point the material's not going to behave perfectly elastically anymore

184
00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:49.090
and you'll see that because it's not a straight line anymore,
it's not linear.

185
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.870
So it still might be elastic,
but it's not linearly elastic.

186
00:11:52.871 --> 00:11:55.330
So can't describe it by just the slope anymore.

187
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.430
And at some point for any material,

188
00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:59.770
you could add enough weight that it's going to fail.

189
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.240
<v 0>And,
uh,</v>

191
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.240
you could define the stress at failure when the material physically breaks or

192
00:12:07.701 --> 00:12:12.701
the strain at failure when it physically doesn't function as a material anymore

193
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:13.701
for the rubber band.

194
00:12:13.701 --> 00:12:18.380
You had so much force that it breaks and there's some weird behavior that starts

195
00:12:18.381 --> 00:12:19.970
to happen,
uh,
when it,

196
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:24.940
when it's in that mode of starting to fail in that,
um,

197
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.490
some of the assumptions that we made don't hold any longer.
For example,

198
00:12:28.491 --> 00:12:31.970
the assumption that the,
that the cross sectional area stays the same.
You know,

199
00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:34.970
if you stretch out a rubber band,
if you stretch it so,
so,

200
00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:39.320
so much the cross sectional area is going to start to cave in at one point.

201
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.200
Not along the whole rubber band but at some point.

202
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.530
And so it doesn't even behave,
uh,

203
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.350
in the way that stress continuously goes up with strain any morning.

204
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.640
And that's because of the way we've defined it.

205
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

206
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.210
<v 0>Okay.
The simple experiment makes sense.</v>

207
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.950
So lets imagine then that we're doing this experiment where we've got the

208
00:13:01.951 --> 00:13:04.920
material attached to the ceiling and it's a,
it's a,

209
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.890
it's a rubber band still and we're adding weight to it.

210
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.090
And so one way to think about that is that we're going from the 0.0 the totally

211
00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:15.000
unstressed material and we're adding more weight.

212
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.210
We're going up towards point a here,
right?

213
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.420
And so we're moving towards point a by adding more weight to the material and

214
00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:27.270
it's stretching out as we're adding more weight,
we're applying more stress,

215
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.030
we're experiencing or observing more strain.

216
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.720
If I go up to point a,

217
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:39.710
I can come back down from point a by taking the weights off and the material

218
00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:44.550
will follow exactly the same path back along the same stress strain curve.

219
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.370
So I could stretch the material,

220
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.790
I could return the material to its original state,
I could stretch it,

221
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.460
I could return it to its original state.
That's a,

222
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:57.030
that's a reversible elastic material at the beginning.

223
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.680
It's you at the beginning,
it has one property,
you stretch it out,

224
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.290
you let it come back and it's the same as it was at the beginning.

225
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.240
That's a perfectly elastic material.
If you overstretch and material that is,

226
00:14:09.241 --> 00:14:11.100
you go instead of point B,

227
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:15.870
you add so much weight instead of point a you add so much weight that you go up

228
00:14:15.871 --> 00:14:19.560
to point B.
When you take the weight off,

229
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.240
it might not follow the same stress strain behavior coming back down and in this

230
00:14:24.241 --> 00:14:28.350
case it follows this different curves,
the dotted line here.

231
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.840
Now what does that mean?
What?

232
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.250
What would you really have observed when you did this experiment that ended up

233
00:14:35.251 --> 00:14:38.010
being plotted this way that I was adding weight,

234
00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:41.790
I was stretching out the material and I stretched it so much that I actually

235
00:14:41.791 --> 00:14:46.650
changed the material.
It can't go back to its original shape anymore,

236
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.670
but when I take the weight off,
it's permanently deformed,

237
00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.580
right?
When I take the weight off,

238
00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:59.140
it follows this line back and even at zero stress,

239
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.030
it still has some defamation,

240
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.570
meaning it's longer than it was when I started.

241
00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.080
And you've had this experience with rubber bands or balloons.

242
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.710
If you play with it enough,
you stretch it,
you stretch it,

243
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.080
you're really stretch it and now it doesn't go back to its original shape

244
00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:17.230
anymore.
And if you look at the rubber band,
it physically looks different.

245
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:21.160
There might be a part that's narrower or the texture of it looks different

246
00:15:21.161 --> 00:15:22.840
because it's stretched in one direction.

247
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.560
Or you physically deformed the material beyond its Plat,

248
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.360
beyond its elastic limit.

249
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.050
And you've created what's called a plastic defamation.

250
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.370
You've changed the material so it's not the same anymore.

251
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.870
Okay.
And that's going beyond the elastic limit,
which in this case might be a,

252
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.680
and you've,
you've created not just an elastic defamation,

253
00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:50.340
but a plastic deformation that materials now forever changed.

254
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.540
Maybe there's some ways that you can get it back,
but probably not.
It's like,
Yep,

255
00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.590
anybody have a slinky
that's a,
that's a sixties toy,

256
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.590
right?
And play with slinkies,
but maybe had slightly,

257
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:06.680
they used to be wire and you could cut yourself on them and now they're plastic,

258
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:07.603
right?
But they're,
these,

259
00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.130
I need a nod that somebody else besides me knows what it's slinky is.
And,

260
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.240
and you're supposed to be able to make it walk down the stairs,

261
00:16:15.241 --> 00:16:18.540
but it doesn't ever really work.
Uh,
but if you take a slinky,

262
00:16:18.541 --> 00:16:20.600
you could stretch it out and they'll go back and stretch it out and go,

263
00:16:20.601 --> 00:16:21.930
it's back.
But what if you have your brother,

264
00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:25.200
your sister grab it and you pull it all the way across the room,
right?

265
00:16:25.201 --> 00:16:28.950
The material gets physically deformed.
It doesn't go back any longer.

266
00:16:28.951 --> 00:16:31.440
That's a plastic deformation of the slinky

267
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.630
phone cords the same way.
So you have a lot of experience with this in your,

268
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.400
in your real life,
you've used a phone that has a wire on it,
right?

269
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:47.610
Coiled.
Yeah.
Um,
so,

270
00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.330
so if,
if we're just talking about elastic materials,

271
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.980
that means materials that have the property of elastic city and they haven't

272
00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:59.520
been deformed beyond their elastic limit,
then I can stretch him.

273
00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.260
They'll come back,
stretch them,
come back.

274
00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:04.560
And I can do that as many times as I want and I'll always get the same material.

275
00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.010
You could classify materials that are,
um,

276
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.130
that are elastic into different properties.

277
00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.000
And now we're not just thinking about rubber bands,

278
00:17:15.001 --> 00:17:16.650
but we're thinking about every material.

279
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:21.980
And so most materials have some elasticy it and over a certain range of stresses

280
00:17:23.071 --> 00:17:27.480
they will deformed elastically,
steel deforms elastically.

281
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:31.110
You don't think about it doing that and you've got to apply really hard stresses

282
00:17:31.111 --> 00:17:32.000
in order for the form.

283
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:36.270
But it does deform elastically would does under some conditions,

284
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:41.510
bones do all materials do under at least some range of stress conditions,

285
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.880
but some are going to be what's called more compliant.

286
00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.240
That is there that at a given stress at it given force application,

287
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.670
they deformed more.
That's a compliant material.

288
00:17:53.671 --> 00:17:58.671
One that's very stretchy or very elastic or stiff one that doesn't deform very

289
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:02.430
much.
When it stresses Diplo applied,

290
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.490
it's a stiffer material and less compliant material or brittle that is d deforms

291
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.660
even less and we'll break rather than uh,
rather than stretch very much.

292
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.171
Okay,

293
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:17.640
so you could define different classes of materials based on this property of

294
00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:18.480
elasticy it.

295
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

296
00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.590
<v 0>So that's one part of what I wanted you to understand today.</v>

297
00:18:24.591 --> 00:18:25.940
What's an elastic material?

298
00:18:25.941 --> 00:18:29.660
How would I characterize it and what does it mean to be an elastic material?

299
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:35.350
The second thing I want to think about is is viscosity and viscosity is a

300
00:18:35.361 --> 00:18:39.920
property that we associate with fluids,
right?
We,
we've talked about viscosity,

301
00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:43.670
we talked about uh,
the viscosity of,
of,
uh,

302
00:18:43.671 --> 00:18:46.730
of blood flowing through arteries for example,

303
00:18:46.731 --> 00:18:50.840
on how viscosity contributed to the resistance of a vessel,

304
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:55.250
right?
It was,
it's,
it's in that relationship between pressure drop and flow.

305
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:56.751
Well,

306
00:18:56.751 --> 00:19:01.751
let's think about another experiment where we have a fluid and we want to

307
00:19:02.781 --> 00:19:04.280
measure its viscosity.

308
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.530
That is we want to measure what's its resistance to flow of the fluid.

309
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.810
And so a way to do that experiment,

310
00:19:11.811 --> 00:19:14.180
and it turns out that there's a lot more practical ways than this,

311
00:19:14.181 --> 00:19:17.450
but here's one way to do the experiment is to take a table like this one,

312
00:19:17.451 --> 00:19:20.840
a solid surface that's not going to move and,
and,

313
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.120
and spread the liquid all over the surface.

314
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.650
Now let's forget for a minute about the fact that this table is only so wide.

315
00:19:27.651 --> 00:19:29.600
It's a fluid is going to flow off the edges.

316
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:34.810
And let's assume that I could put a layer of fluid on here and it would stay and

317
00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:38.210
then I could put another desktop on top of it.

318
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.790
So what I've created is a space between two desktops,

319
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.680
one which is fixed to the floor so it won't move.
And the other,

320
00:19:48.681 --> 00:19:53.530
which is floating on top of a layer of fluid.
It's makes sense.

321
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.110
And so now you could imagine if you could do that,

322
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:59.230
if I had a layer of fluid here and another desktop sitting on top,

323
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:04.240
I could apply a force this way parallel to the surface.

324
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.560
And the thing would move easily,
right?
If it was water,

325
00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:12.970
it would move very easily.
If it was alcohol,
the fluid,
it would move very easily.

326
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.820
If it was molasses,
it would move,

327
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:20.850
but I'd have to apply more force in order to move the desktop on the surface,

328
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.440
but I could do it.
Right.
Um,

329
00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:29.260
so what you're really doing in that experiment I just described is the same

330
00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:33.160
thing as the experiment we did when we hung the rubber band from the bill from

331
00:20:33.161 --> 00:20:37.390
the top of the ceiling here is that I've applied a force and I've measured a

332
00:20:37.391 --> 00:20:38.224
defamation.

333
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:43.230
Now the forest and the defamation are different in this case because now in

334
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:46.360
applying a force,
not intention,

335
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.790
right before I was talking about only applying forces,

336
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:56.110
intention to create a tense and force in the material.

337
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.690
Now I'm applying a force in sheer,

338
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.540
I'm trying to move one plate relative to another plate and I'm trying to move

339
00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:06.900
them across each other,
right?

340
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.940
So that's a sheer force and the defamation is not a defamation like it increases

341
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:14.014
in length.

342
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.370
The defamation is that the wall on top moves

343
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.230
and it moves continuously,
right?

344
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:26.350
Imagine if I start to apply,
I have this set up here.

345
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:30.550
The desktop is on top of the layer of fluid on top of the desktop below,

346
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.850
and I somehow apply a constant force to that top plate,

347
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.540
that top desktop.
It's going to continue to move.

348
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:44.890
As long as I apply a constant force,
it'll move.
It will move,

349
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.360
it will move.
Eventually I'd fall off the desk here,
right?

350
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.350
So what's created is not a strain.

351
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.360
What's created is a velocity.

352
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.110
<v 1>Okay?</v>

353
00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:01.280
<v 0>The top plate is going to move and if I apply a constant force,</v>

354
00:22:01.281 --> 00:22:04.430
a constant shearing force to the top plate,
I will,

355
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.700
I will measure a velocity.

356
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:10.920
Does that make sense?

357
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.160
What's really happening in the fluid here is that within this fluid,

358
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.730
when I put the apply the force on the top plate,

359
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.960
the molecules of fluid that are right next to the top,

360
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.560
let me call it a plate now instead of a desktop,
because that's a shorter word,

361
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.010
that molecules of fluid that are right next to this top plate.

362
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.920
When I start to move it,
they move along with the top plate.

363
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.810
Those molecules of fluid experience some friction with a top plate,

364
00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:43.950
and when I moved the top plate,

365
00:22:43.951 --> 00:22:48.900
they move along with the molecule is a fluid that are just below that.

366
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.280
Also want to move along with it because there's some friction between the

367
00:22:53.281 --> 00:22:57.930
molecules inside the liquid,
right?
There's some friction,

368
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:03.800
but it's not perfect friction it slips and viscosity is a measure of how Slippy

369
00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.360
the fluid is.
Different layers of fluid,

370
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.870
how easily they slide by one another when they're shared.

371
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.090
So water,

372
00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:19.200
because it has a low viscosity compared to molasses,

373
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:23.040
those layers of water are going to move easily over one another.

374
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.910
Whereas in molasses there's more friction between the layers and so it's harder

375
00:23:26.911 --> 00:23:27.744
to move.

376
00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:35.240
And in either case what will happen is that when I apply the forest,

377
00:23:35.241 --> 00:23:36.270
the the law,

378
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.480
the packets of fluid up near the top are going to move along with the top plate.

379
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.060
The ones a little below it are going to move a little slower.

380
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.140
The ones below it are going to move a little slower than that.
Slower than that,

381
00:23:45.141 --> 00:23:45.831
slower than that,

382
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:49.790
slower than that until the ones at the very bottom don't move at all because

383
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:52.250
they're experiencing friction from the bottom plate.

384
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.580
<v 1>Right?</v>

385
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:55.413
<v 0>So if I could look,</v>

386
00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.010
if I could look microscopically at what happens when I share this top plate over

387
00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:02.440
the bottom plate,
within the layer of fluid between,

388
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:07.180
I've created a velocity gradient where the fluid is moving very fast,

389
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.780
near the top plate,
slower in the middle,

390
00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.570
and not at all at the surface of the bottom plate.

391
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:16.690
And by doing this,

392
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.720
I can measure the force that's required in order to establish that velocity

393
00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.520
gradient,
right?

394
00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.320
And I'm going to make the same kind of plot here that I made in,
in,
in uh,

395
00:24:29.321 --> 00:24:33.760
stress versus strain for,
uh,
an elastic material.

396
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:38.890
But I'm going to plot different things instead of,
uh,
stress,

397
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.450
tension,
tensile stress,
I'm going to plot sheer stress.

398
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.550
And that is the amount of force that I've applied on this wall in order to get

399
00:24:48.551 --> 00:24:52.090
it to move divided by the cross sectional area of the wall.

400
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.680
So it's the amount of force I had to apply in order to set this thing in

401
00:24:56.681 --> 00:25:00.160
constant motion divided by its cross sectional area.

402
00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:05.730
And what I'm going to plop down here is the rate of defamation because there is

403
00:25:06.821 --> 00:25:10.270
no limit to the defamation here.

404
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.720
As long as I apply the force,
it's going to continue to slide.

405
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.130
<v 1>Okay?</v>

406
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.860
<v 0>So I can't measure the strain because it will continuously to form.</v>

407
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:20.020
There's no end to it.

408
00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:25.620
What I can measure instead is the maximum velocity divided by the thickness,

409
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.770
the gap between the two walls or the height of the fluid.

410
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.940
So this velocity divided by height is a measure of the rate of defamation.

411
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.450
<v 1>Does that make sense?</v>

412
00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.370
<v 0>Okay.
So the kind of the same thing,
right?</v>

413
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:49.760
I did an experiment set up a different way,
apply to force,

414
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.620
measured a defamation in this case,
sheer stress and rate of defamation.

415
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.500
And what I'd find here is that over a certain length,

416
00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.660
over a certain range of forces,
I would get a straight line.

417
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.080
And the slope of that line is this property called the viscosity.

418
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:12.010
And for fluids that have a high viscosity like molasses or honey,

419
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:18.730
I have to apply a lot of force in order to achieve a certain velocity for fluids

420
00:26:20.451 --> 00:26:22.220
that are less viscous like water.

421
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:26.930
I don't need to apply so much force in order to change that same velocity in

422
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:28.700
order to achieve that same velocity.

423
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:31.940
<v 1>Does that make sense?</v>

424
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:36.540
<v 0>So here's another kind of material and there are biological materials that</v>

425
00:26:36.541 --> 00:26:39.930
behave this way.
Their mechanics are like this blood is one of them.

426
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:45.170
Blood is a viscous material and if I put between this here and I did this

427
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:46.374
experiment,

428
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:51.150
I would see roughly this behavior that as I increase the force,

429
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.100
I increase the velocity and it's linear and I could measure the viscosity.

430
00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.960
Now it turns out that blood is a little bit different in that it turns out that

431
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.730
unlike water,
if I apply even the smallest force,

432
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.850
the plates going to move when it's water between here,

433
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.670
if it was blood,
it turns out that per small forces,
it doesn't move at all,

434
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.050
that I have to apply a certain amount of force in order to get it to move.

435
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:24.900
Why do you think it would be different for blood then for water?

436
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.390
What can you imagine that's different for blood?

437
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.430
The creates the situation that had very small forces.
It doesn't move at all,

438
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:35.010
but it has some yields,

439
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.930
force or yield stress that one has to get over in order to start it in motion.

440
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.860
What's different about blood and water?
It's thicker than water,

441
00:27:45.861 --> 00:27:49.090
right?
You know that from
the Bible,

442
00:27:49.091 --> 00:27:53.410
isn't that where blood is thicker than water code?
I don't even know.
Justin

443
00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.880
has large molecules and red blood cells and it has red blood cells at a fairly

444
00:28:00.881 --> 00:28:03.670
high volume fraction.
About 50% is blood cells.

445
00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.400
And it turns out that to get those blood cells rolling,

446
00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:10.750
to get them moving out of each other's way requires a certain amount of force.

447
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:16.450
And in fact,
when,
when blood is stagnant,
even if it's anti coagulated,

448
00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:20.680
the blood cells tend to form structures where they align with one another.

449
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:25.540
And so it's hard to get that moving.
But for most of it's,

450
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.460
for most of its,
uh,

451
00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:31.720
for most of the Shear stresses that are biologically important,

452
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.400
blood behaves is a viscous liquid.
It's about three times as viscous as water.

453
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.220
Okay,
so that's viscosity.

454
00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:45.290
So you know about [inaudible] and this guy and uh,
and uh,
viscosity.

455
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.230
So let's take,
let's go back now to the material I talked about at the beginning.

456
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.730
And let's assume now that it's not a,
uh,
it's not a perfect elastic material,

457
00:28:55.731 --> 00:29:00.200
but it's a material that is,
um,
that is different than that.

458
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.560
And let's do the experiment in a different way

459
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.940
or look at it and in a different way where I,

460
00:29:07.941 --> 00:29:11.930
I'm still hanging the material from the ceiling and I'm still applying a force

461
00:29:11.931 --> 00:29:14.150
to it and I'm asking how it deforms.

462
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.990
But now instead of just looking at his total defamation,

463
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.580
I want to look at how the defamation changes over time.

464
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:26.100
And time is an important variable in most biological processes.

465
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:30.060
You care not only about how much defamation I get when I apply a force,

466
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:33.990
but you care about how quickly I achieved that defamation,
right?

467
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.620
And how quickly materials can physically move when forces are applied.

468
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.970
So if this is a perfect elastic material like rubber band or like the springs

469
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:45.790
you learned about in physics,
when I apply a force here,

470
00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.050
it instantaneously changes its length.
Deformations formations are instantaneous.

471
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:52.900
They take no time at all for a perfect elastic material.

472
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.220
And so how much would the deformation occur?
Well,
you,

473
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.320
it would depend on the elasticity,
but as soon as I added that force,

474
00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:02.290
it's going to stretch out bang to that length and it's going to stay there.

475
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.670
You know,
real materials don't behave like this but,

476
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.600
but our perfect elastic material does,

477
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.810
if the material is visco elastic,

478
00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:14.560
meaning it has properties of both the plasticity and viscosity,

479
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.530
like a muscle say,
um,

480
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:22.450
like the fluid that's inside your eye.
If I apply a force,

481
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:25.540
it's going to exhibit two different behaviors.

482
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.440
First it's going to elongate instantaneously,

483
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.660
just like the perfect elastic material wood.

484
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.990
And then it's going to continue to uh,
along gate slowly

485
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.400
it's going to continue to elongate.
And so I've shown that here,

486
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.830
if I look at the length versus time,

487
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.030
it's going to instantaneously along gate to some extent and then it's going to

488
00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:47.740
slowly keep deforming.

489
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:54.750
Now that behavior where I apply a force and it goes initially out to here,

490
00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.770
looks like elastic material.
The behavior where it continually starts,

491
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.880
continues to stretch out over time and gets longer and longer and longer.

492
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.180
That looks like a viscous material.

493
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.790
That's how a viscous material would behave.

494
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:14.410
I apply a force and it continuously to forms with some rate,
right?

495
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:15.843
And so this,

496
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.320
this material is behaving like an elastic solid and like a viscous liquid.

497
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.693
Both.

498
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.770
It's what we call a visco elastic material and most biological materials have

499
00:31:26.771 --> 00:31:27.580
that property.

500
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:32.380
They have some viscosity that is they deformed continuously under stress and

501
00:31:32.381 --> 00:31:36.820
they have some elasticy Catie,
they to form elastically under stress.

502
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.970
Another way to do this experiment would be not to hang a weight and then measure

503
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.780
what,
what,
what,
um,
what defamation occurs,

504
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.710
but to instead do the experiment as is shown in this diagram here,

505
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.150
which is stretch the material out suddenly and then measure the force that's

506
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:56.710
required to hold this apart

507
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.530
for an elastic material.
You'd get the same result.
If you,

508
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.260
if you apply a strain that is,

509
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:07.900
I just pull this up to some length,

510
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.550
it's going to take some force to do that and all the forest gets applied

511
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:13.660
instantaneously.

512
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:18.640
And then after that I just maintain the forest and I hold the material there for

513
00:32:18.641 --> 00:32:22.840
a visco elastic material behaves differently and that an initial response will

514
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:26.070
be like an elastic solid.
It will,
it will you,

515
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:31.000
you stretch it out to its strain and it's going to take the same force to open

516
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:33.100
it up,
to stretch it out,
to deform it,

517
00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.550
and then the material's gonna Relax and start to flow,

518
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:43.530
which what you would measure is that the force required to hold it at this

519
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:48.790
defamation starts to drop over time as the material itself rearranges and

520
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:53.630
deforms in order to accommodate that strain that you've put in it.

521
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.540
Does that make sense?

522
00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:01.160
So two ways to do the experiment to different ways of looking at
viscoelasticity.

523
00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:05.030
One is you apply a force and now you can see continuous defamation.

524
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.530
The other is that you apply a defamation and you see a change in force required

525
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:11.450
to hold that defamation over time.

526
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.430
It turns out that not all this go elastic materials exhibit the same behavior,

527
00:33:21.431 --> 00:33:26.431
but there's a range of viscoelastic properties in that some viscoelastic

528
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.810
materials behave more like elastic solids,

529
00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.860
some behave more like viscous liquids and some behaves somewhere in between.

530
00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.540
And physicists have figured out ways,

531
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:47.710
models that they can use to explain how viscous materials behave.

532
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.220
And you could imagine that this would be important in biomedical engineering,

533
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:56.260
right?
For example,
if I want to understand how the leg works,

534
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.390
then a important part of how the leg works as a machine is understanding the

535
00:34:01.391 --> 00:34:04.710
properties of the leg muscles,
right?

536
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.930
How they uh,

537
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:11.960
how they differ form under stress and how when a stresses are applied to them,

538
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:14.490
how that changes their shape,

539
00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.010
how that's essential for,

540
00:34:18.011 --> 00:34:22.060
if a muscle is going to contract and apply a force to your leg,

541
00:34:22.061 --> 00:34:27.061
then you need to know how the strain or defamation of that muscle relates to its

542
00:34:28.091 --> 00:34:32.620
ability to create a force,
right?
To pick up the leg for example,
or to move it.

543
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.613
<v 1>MMM.</v>

544
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:39.610
<v 0>So I'd like some way to describe that mathematically.</v>

545
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.530
I'd like some way to describe the stress strain behavior of complicated

546
00:34:44.531 --> 00:34:47.110
biological materials like muscles.

547
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:52.450
And so one way to do that is to build models based on elements that I

548
00:34:52.451 --> 00:34:55.780
understand.
So I understand the spring.

549
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

550
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:59.930
<v 0>I understand the spring and if it was a perfect,</v>

551
00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.940
if the muscle was a perfect elastic material,

552
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:06.500
I could describe all of its behavior by its spring constant or it's elastic

553
00:35:06.501 --> 00:35:10.700
modulus and I would know everything about its stress strain behavior,

554
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.810
but muscles don't behave like strings because they have some viscous properties.

555
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:19.790
So what's a,
what's a simple example of a viscous material?
Well,

556
00:35:19.791 --> 00:35:23.810
I gave you this example of the,
of the plate sliding over the,

557
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:28.530
over the layer of fluid.
Uh,
well there's another model that,
um,

558
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.870
that physicists use to describe a viscous materials.
And maybe you've seen this,

559
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.540
it's an element that you don't really encounter in life.

560
00:35:35.541 --> 00:35:36.950
You encounter things like springs.

561
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.780
You don't encounter things like dash Potts very often.

562
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.500
And that's what this is called.
This is a dashpot.

563
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.970
And a Dashpot is a idealized physical model of a viscous liquid.

564
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.050
And one way to imagine it is that it's a cylinder.

565
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.830
The black cylinder here inside of a hollow cylinder.

566
00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.620
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

567
00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.460
<v 0>So it's uh,
it's,</v>

568
00:35:58.461 --> 00:36:03.461
it's a cylinder inside of a hollow cylinder and there's some friction between

569
00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:09.320
the outside wall of the black cylinder and the inside wall of the hollow

570
00:36:09.321 --> 00:36:12.740
cylinder.
There's some well behaved,

571
00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:18.100
well known friction between the inside of the hollow cylinder and the outside of

572
00:36:19.311 --> 00:36:22.190
the inner cylinder.
Now then,

573
00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:27.191
if I apply a force ply force down here in that direction to this Dashpot,

574
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:29.960
what's going to happen is that the inner cylinder,

575
00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:34.490
it's going to slide over the outer cylinder,
slide through the outer cylinder,

576
00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:39.950
and for a constant force,
since this is a,
this is a well behaved,

577
00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.640
the friction between here as well known and well behaved,

578
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.150
it's going to just slide with a uniform velocity,

579
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:51.560
the inner cylinder over the outer cylinder.
Does that make sense?

580
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.980
So this dashpot is an idealized physical model for how a viscous liquid behaves.

581
00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.770
I apply a force and it continuously deforms.

582
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

583
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.140
<v 0>Now it's a,
it's better as a thought experiment than a real experiment.</v>

584
00:37:06.141 --> 00:37:09.590
Cause you can imagine making things that behave like real,
real springs.

585
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:13.220
Real dash would be hard to make.
Why?
Because eventually,

586
00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.370
no matter how long your outer cylinder,
why should eventually come out of it,

587
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.410
right?
So it's a real dashpot.

588
00:37:18.411 --> 00:37:21.920
If it's going to to form for a long time would have to be infinitely long as

589
00:37:21.921 --> 00:37:24.800
well.
So it's better as a thought experiment than a real thing to build.

590
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:29.600
But you get the thought experiment,
right?
So I have a spring here.

591
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:31.310
How will it behave when I put a force on it,

592
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.610
it's going to deform instantaneously to a certain length.

593
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:38.660
The length will depend on the force,
the Dashpot I apply a force to it.

594
00:37:38.661 --> 00:37:42.590
How will it behave?
It's going to slowly deformed over time,

595
00:37:42.591 --> 00:37:46.940
continuously with a constant rate,
but it will never stop deforming.

596
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:53.510
What would happen if I put a spring and a dashpot together like this?

597
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.540
That is,
I have a solid wall here.

598
00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.010
I first attach the spring and I attach it Dashpot to the wall to the spring.

599
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.660
And now I apply a force.

600
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.300
Well this spring dashpot combination is going to have elastic properties.

601
00:38:08.301 --> 00:38:09.890
It's going to have biscuits,
properties,

602
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.370
but it's going to behave in a certain way.
When I applied the force,

603
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.550
the force is going to be applied over the whole structure at once.

604
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:22.700
And so the the spring is going to fully experience that force and it's going to

605
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:23.563
stretch out.

606
00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.710
The spring is going to fully experience that force and it's going to stretch
out.

607
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.600
And then the Dashpot is also going to experience that force and it's slowly

608
00:38:34.601 --> 00:38:35.434
going to,

609
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:40.940
so what I would observe experimentally if I could build this spring dashpot a

610
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.100
combination is I'd see,
uh,

611
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.530
initial defamation and then continuous defamation after that.

612
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:52.810
And this is an example of one kind of visco elastic behavior.

613
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:57.790
If I took my muscle and I did measurements on it and I found experimentally that

614
00:38:57.791 --> 00:39:01.780
it behaved like this,
then I would say,
oh,

615
00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:06.781
I can describe how the muscle behaves by this simple thought experiment,

616
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:10.690
this simple mathematical construct of a spring.

617
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.400
And a dashpot connected together.

618
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:14.623
<v 1>Okay,</v>

619
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.513
<v 0>that makes sense.</v>

620
00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.590
Well that's not the only way that you could create a viscous that you could

621
00:39:19.591 --> 00:39:22.800
create an imaginary viscous visco elastic material.

622
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.420
I could also attach the spring and the dashpot in series.

623
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.480
That is a touch both the spring and the Dashpot to the wall,

624
00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.110
have a little strut connecting them and then apply the force that way.

625
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.233
<v 1>Right.</v>

626
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.490
<v 0>How would this material behave?</v>

627
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.480
It would behave differently because when the force is applied,

628
00:39:44.481 --> 00:39:46.940
the spring would like to stretch out but it can't.

629
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:53.420
It can't because it's constrained by the dashpot which only deformed slowly.

630
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.990
So the spring would like to deform,

631
00:39:56.110 --> 00:40:00.500
would like to take all of the forest and deformed,

632
00:40:00.501 --> 00:40:04.160
but it can't because the dashpot physically takes time to move.

633
00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:09.470
It can only to form at some rate.
So in the initial period the dash bought is,

634
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:13.700
is taking all of the force.
Right.

635
00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:16.880
And what you would see initially is a slow defamation.

636
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.940
<v 0>Now while the dashpot would like to keep deforming forever,</v>

638
00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:28.090
this thing can't because the spring has a limit to how much it can stretch.

639
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.330
And so when you get up to the elastic limit of the spring or,

640
00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:37.310
or the elasticity of the spring,

641
00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.850
the spring is going to be taking all of the force

642
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.070
and the Dashpot,
then we'll have no force on it and it will stop to forming.

643
00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:49.200
So,
uh,

644
00:40:49.201 --> 00:40:54.201
Bisco elastic material that behaved like a spring and a dashpot in series would

645
00:40:54.421 --> 00:40:55.500
have this behavior.

646
00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.520
It would not have any initial defamation.

647
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:04.230
It would differ form slowly at first and then it would reach some maximum

648
00:41:04.231 --> 00:41:06.390
defamation,
like an elastic solid,

649
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.870
but it would be evolving over time.

650
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.553
<v 1>Right.</v>

651
00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:13.910
<v 0>This makes sense.</v>

652
00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:18.980
Now these are two simple models of materials that have viscous and elastic

653
00:41:18.981 --> 00:41:23.630
properties.
And so now I could measure real materials and I could see,
well,

654
00:41:23.631 --> 00:41:26.480
do they act more like this?
Do they act more like this?

655
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:31.550
And I could use these thought constructs in order to describe those materials

656
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.660
and I could learn about the materials,
behave under unusual conditions.

657
00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:38.090
That way I could predict start to predict how they behave.

658
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:43.720
It turns out that most real visco elastic materials don't obey either this model

659
00:41:43.941 --> 00:41:47.150
or this model,
but you can build more complex ones,
right?

660
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:51.020
You could imagine having a a spring and a dashpot on this side and just a

661
00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:54.920
dashpot over here.
Or You can imagine having three elements in series.

662
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:59.900
You could imagine all sorts of different ways of putting viscous elements and

663
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.250
elastic elements together to define an imaginary material.

664
00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:08.660
You could then predict how that imaginary material is going to behave and you

665
00:42:08.661 --> 00:42:11.660
can see how close it is to Rio materials.

666
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:16.760
What I want you to remember from this is a couple of different things.
One,

667
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:18.680
we talked about elasticy at the beginning,

668
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.960
how to purely elastic materials behave.

669
00:42:20.961 --> 00:42:23.690
You know that how to purely viscous materials behave.

670
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.030
You understand that real materials,

671
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.550
real biological materials have our viscoelastic,

672
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.030
they have both elastic and biscuits properties,

673
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.890
but that doesn't mean just one thing.
That can mean a whole range of behaviors.

674
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.020
It's possible in some cases to define that whole range of behaviors by building

675
00:42:42.021 --> 00:42:46.310
simple thought experiments are simple models like these spring dashpot

676
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.760
combinations.
But in general,

677
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.380
the viscoelastic real visceral elastic materials we see are more complex than

678
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:55.400
any of the,

679
00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:00.680
they have more complex behaviors than any of the idealized models we put

680
00:43:00.681 --> 00:43:03.080
together.
Although sometimes they come very close

681
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.070
questions.

682
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.250
Okay.
If you,

683
00:43:12.251 --> 00:43:16.990
if you looked for the homework assignment over the weekend and then you look at

684
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:21.490
it today or yesterday,
you will have noticed that it changed.
It became simpler.

685
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:26.230
So I decided that first I had a homework assignment that had two parts.

686
00:43:26.231 --> 00:43:28.720
The first part of it was to,
uh,

687
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:33.750
was to write an introductory paragraph for your paper and an outline for the

688
00:43:35.201 --> 00:43:36.250
rest and turn it in.

689
00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:40.090
And then there was some problems related to the material for this week from

690
00:43:40.091 --> 00:43:40.960
chapter 10.

691
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:46.030
What I decided to do instead was asking you just to focus on your papers this

692
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.030
week and just turn in that introductory paragraph and the outline.

693
00:43:49.031 --> 00:43:50.620
That's all the homework for this week.

694
00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:55.150
And then we'll put off the homework assignments on this topic.

695
00:43:55.151 --> 00:43:59.500
And what we'll talk about Thursday.
That won't be due until next Thursday.
Okay.

696
00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.830
So I'd like for you to really focus on your research papers this week.

697
00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:06.640
We'll come back,
like do the homework set next week,
and then the week after that,

698
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:10.510
there won't be any homework except just to finish your research papers and that

699
00:44:10.511 --> 00:44:11.710
will be the week that it's due.

700
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.520
But just wanted you to keep that in mind because I know that timing and

701
00:44:18.011 --> 00:44:21.640
balancing all of your responsibilities to different courses is critical at this

702
00:44:21.641 --> 00:44:26.240
time of the year.
Questions about that?
Or,
or about,
uh,

703
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.160
what I talked about at the beginning.
Instructions for the paper here.
Reviewing

704
00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:34.210
good.
See on Thursday.
