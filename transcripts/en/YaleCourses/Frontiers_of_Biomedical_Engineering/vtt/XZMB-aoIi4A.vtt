1
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.233
Uh,

2
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.780
this week we're going to talk about renal physiology.

3
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.680
So renal is kidney physiology,

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.370
the study of the,
uh,
the function of a kidneys.

5
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.680
And we're going to talk mainly about how they work,

6
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:30.300
when they're working correctly and what functions they perform in the,

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.910
in the body.
And,
uh,
you probably know,
uh,
that there,
uh,

8
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.800
important.
Uh,
but,
uh,

9
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:40.770
hopefully by the end of the lecture today you'll know exactly why they are so

10
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:44.890
important for your overall state of health.
And,
um,
and you,

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.590
you won't live very long without a near normal kidney function.

12
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.690
And,
um,
the,

13
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.200
the reading on this is chapter nine and in section we'll talk about a,
uh,

14
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.080
biomedical engineering innovation,
uh,

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.860
that over the last 50 or 60 years or so has really changed,
uh,

16
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.190
changed the quality and duration of life for patients that have kidney disease.

17
00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:11.700
And that's kidney dialysis or renal dialysis.

18
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.860
So we'll talk about that on Thursday afternoon.

19
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.680
So this is just an outline of the things that we're going to cover.
Uh,

20
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.460
during the,

21
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.260
during the lecture today and on Thursday we're going to talk about sort of just

22
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.330
gross aspects of the urinary system,
uh,
the kidney,
the bladder,

23
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.700
and the tubes that connect these things.

24
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.240
I'll talk a little bit about the differences between plasma.

25
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.420
Plasma is the fluid that circulates in your body.

26
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.780
And we thought about a circulation of fluids in the body the week before spring

27
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:49.260
break.
Uh,
we talked about the heart and the blood vessels in the and the blood.

28
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.950
And so the main fluid of interest there was plasma.
This,

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.010
this fluid that blood cells circulate in the main fluid will be interested in,

30
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:01.170
in renal physiology,
his urine.

31
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.300
And this is a fluid that's produced by the kidneys,

32
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.890
stored in the bladder and then excrete it from the body.

33
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.760
And it's one of the primary mechanisms that your body has for getting rid of

34
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:16.080
waste and regulating the composition of fluids like plasma.

35
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.120
Okay.
Um,
and we'll,
I'll talk a little bit more about that in just a second,

36
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.670
uh,
to,
to,
to understand how it works.

37
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:27.000
We'll talk about the anatomy of the kidney on the gross level and on the

38
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:31.050
microscopic level.
And it has an amazingly sophisticated organization,

39
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.000
which is critical for its function.

40
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.360
So if you understand the anatomy of the kidney,

41
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:38.250
you understand a lot about how it works.

42
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.600
And then we'll talk about specifics about how urine is created in the kidney and

43
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:45.260
processed.
And um,
and um,

44
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.810
it turns out that all of these processes are important for maintaining your

45
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.260
health.
And as I mentioned,
we'll talk lastly about about dialysis,

46
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.470
which is a extraordinarily effective but not quite perfect means,

47
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.800
uh,
for,
uh,
for um,
keeping people that have kidney failure in good health.

48
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.020
So I've shown you a picture like this,
maybe exactly this picture,

49
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:11.090
a picture like this before,
but this is sort of a,
a,

50
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.060
a block diagram or an engineering view of the human body.

51
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.540
And so you can see the outside world is the things that surround this red and

52
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:23.680
blue labeled,
uh,
uh,

53
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.640
box and the inside of the body is inside.

54
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.760
We talked last time we were here,

55
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.520
we talked about the circulatory system.

56
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.120
And so this mechanism for circulating fluids around in the body,

57
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:40.300
and we talked about how that works and why that's so important.

58
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.190
You'll remember that when we talked about the nervous system,

59
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.870
which uh,
which controls a lot of body functions.

60
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.370
We talked about both in the nervous system and the cardiovascular system,

61
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.930
how important certain ions were for the function of those cells.
In particular,

62
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:03.460
we talked about sodium and potassium,
sodium and potassium,

63
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.810
which are present in the case of sodium at high concentration outside of cells,

64
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:10.030
low concentration inside potassium,

65
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:13.300
the reverse high concentration inside low concentration outside.

66
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.070
In order for those cells to function for a nerve cell to send a signal down an

67
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:22.840
Axon or for a cardiac muscle cell to a contract,

68
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.730
those concentrations of ions have to be present,
right?

69
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.490
And they have to be the way that I described,

70
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:35.020
you have to have high extracellular sodium,
low intercellular,

71
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.130
hi intracellular potassium,
low extra cellular.
All right?

72
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.600
So if your sodium and potassium levels are not correct,

73
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.410
you can't make an action potential in the way that we described before.

74
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.670
Heart doesn't beat brains,
can't send signals,
right?

75
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.840
So all of that physiology we talked about in the nervous system and the heart

76
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.020
depends on having ion concentrations in your body at the correct level.

77
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.600
So how is that maintained?
Well,
one way you could make do,

78
00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:08.500
you could think about if you have a box like this,
if this is your body,

79
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.450
you could think about maintaining it by just knowing exactly how much sodium and

80
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:17.140
potassium to eat every day so that you always keep the right amount,

81
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.990
you know you're going to lose some,
you lose some fluids.

82
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.390
So if you knew exactly how much to eat,

83
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.350
you could regulate concentration that way,
but that would be,

84
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.070
that's difficult to do.
Right?
And we,
and you know,
we don't do that.

85
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.020
We eat in general excess sodium and excess potassium.

86
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.920
So somehow our body is keeping these concentrations at the right level.

87
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.920
How does it do that?
Well,
that's really the main function of the kidney.

88
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.480
The main function of the kidney is to sense how much sodium and potassium there

89
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:50.320
is in your body.

90
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.770
And then to extract the amount that's not needed in order to maintain the levels

91
00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:00.020
at the constant concentration.
That's needed,
right?

92
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.650
So the main function of the urinary system,

93
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:07.580
which is shown as this part of the diagram over here,

94
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.740
is to detect what's in the plasma,
what's in the blood,

95
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.150
and think about it in terms of sodium and potassium concentrations.

96
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.380
But there are many,
many other elements that are also controlled.

97
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.530
So it detects what's there and it removes what's not needed.
That is it.

98
00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:31.531
It removes what is in excess of what you need to have the proper concentration,

99
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.150
<v 1>right?
Um,</v>

100
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.630
<v 0>now you could imagine doing that in two ways.</v>

101
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.300
Let's just think about sodium concentrations for,

102
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.770
for if your sodium concentration is too high,

103
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.430
right?
Too High,
so it needs to come down,

104
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.140
then the kidney could either excrete more sodium or excrete less water,

105
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.370
<v 1>right?</v>

106
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.870
<v 0>And you know that the kidney gets rid of waste by getting rid of urine.</v>

107
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.050
And urine is mostly water,
right?

108
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.670
And so you can control concentration in the body by either changing how much of

109
00:07:08.671 --> 00:07:13.671
the molecule you keep or how much water you retain or how much water you lose,

110
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.270
right?
And so all of these things are linked together in some way.

111
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.980
The kidneys set here in intimate contact with the circulatory system.

112
00:07:22.981 --> 00:07:23.970
We'll talk about that.

113
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.290
In order to perform this function of regulating concentrations of things in the

114
00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:30.420
blood,
it needs to see a lot of blood.

115
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.800
And so blood flow to the kidney as essential.
And you'll see that it's anatomy,

116
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.310
puts it in a good position to see a lot of the blood flow.

117
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.600
And then it does some transformations.

118
00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:46.590
It does some functions we'll talk about over the course of the next couple of

119
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.650
days.
It then produces a fluid called urine.

120
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.280
You have a reservoir for urine in your body called the bladder.

121
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.260
That's basically just a storage vessel for urine that's produced by the kidneys.

122
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.070
And then you excrete that and what's in that excluded,
flew and urine,

123
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.940
mainly water,
salts and organic ways.

124
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.650
Now what organic ways are,
uh,
are uh,
eliminated by the kidneys.

125
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.600
Well,
think about metabolism,
right?
You're breaking down sugars,

126
00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:17.130
you're breaking down proteins,

127
00:08:17.131 --> 00:08:20.400
you're using those raw materials to build other molecules.

128
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.290
But there are waste products of that process of breaking down and building

129
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.940
backup molecules.
So the the a waste product of sugar metabolism,

130
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.540
you know is carbon dioxide,
right?
Where does the the,
the,

131
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:39.180
the final form of carbon in the body is carbon dioxide and you get rid of that.

132
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.630
Not In the kidney largely,
but mainly in the lung by breathing out co two,
right.

133
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:48.690
The main product of nitrogen metabolism and where does nitrogen come from comes

134
00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:53.460
from proteins that we eat and in the Western world and develop worlds.

135
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.840
We eat a lot more protein than we for building new proteins.

136
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:02.220
We have protein rich diets and so you have a lot of waste products from proteins

137
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.073
that accumulate.

138
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.370
In particular the waste product of nitrogen and all amino acids have nitrogen.

139
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.910
The end product of metabolism of amino acids or proteins is a molecule called

140
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:17.850
urea and so your Reia is,

141
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.940
that is an example of an abundant organic waste that's eliminated by the

142
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:27.540
kidneys.
It's not volatile.
It's not a gas like carbon dioxide,

143
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:28.620
so you can't breathe it out.

144
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.970
It has to be eliminated in water and it's concentrated in the urine.

145
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.860
If concentrations of your REIA get too high and you're in your plasma,

146
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.980
it becomes toxic,
right?

147
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.320
And so one of the main functions of the kidney is to get rid of end products of

148
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:50.550
nitrogen metabolism like urea to keep the level low enough that they don't cause

149
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.770
any toxicity.
Okay?
So that's,
that's a couple of,

150
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.770
as you can see now,
very important functions for the kidney,

151
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.670
getting rid of a waste product of natural metabolism that would otherwise be

152
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.990
toxic to the body,

153
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:08.991
that's urea and regulating the concentrations of ions like sodium and potassium.

154
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.270
And we could add calcium and phosphate and magnesium,

155
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.710
but regulating the concentrations primarily of sodium and potassium,
uh,

156
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.430
so that the other organs in your body can function in the right way.

157
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.420
And we call that,
uh,
we call that function.

158
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.520
Maintaining the internal environment,
maintaining the internal mill,

159
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:37.521
you maintaining the internal fluid composition at some constant level so that

160
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:43.050
the other organs can function properly.
Okay,

161
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.530
so let's think about the a anatomy a little bit and it's shown on this slide,

162
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.610
the words at the top of the slide.
Just tell you what I,
what I already told you,

163
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:59.030
you know,
uh,
probably that your kidneys,
you have two of them,
um,

164
00:10:59.070 --> 00:10:59.970
and uh,

165
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:02.940
one on the left and one on the right and they set sort of right below your rib

166
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:07.740
cage in the back there in the back part of your abdominal cavity of space.

167
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.000
It's called the Retroperitoneale,
uh,

168
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.020
a position in your body.

169
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.990
And if you remember from the circulatory system,
the heart is right here,
right?

170
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.630
The heart is in the center,

171
00:11:20.631 --> 00:11:24.390
slightly to the left side of the chest and coming out of the heart,

172
00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:29.391
the cardiac output comes out through the aorta and the aorta is initially

173
00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:31.890
directed upwards,
right?
And then it,

174
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.950
and then it curves and goes down through the abdomen here.

175
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.870
So if I trace the path of the aorta,
it starts in the thorax,

176
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.960
you know,
between the lungs,
moves down here,

177
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.040
crosses through the diaphragm and into the abdominal space.

178
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.930
So this is the abdominal aorta and you can see that the kidneys are positioned

179
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:56.650
on either side of the abdominal aorta.
Now the,
the,

180
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:58.840
the flow through the abdominal aorta is quite high.

181
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:00.760
This is one of the main vessels,
right?

182
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:02.790
And there are some branch points before him there.

183
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:06.190
So there's some blood that goes up to the head and the upper parts of the body,

184
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:07.030
but the,

185
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:12.030
but the major portion of the cardiac output flows down your abdominal aorta.

186
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.550
And there are two main branches off the abdominal aorta right here called the

187
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:23.470
renal arteries and the renal arteries feed blood to the kidneys directly.

188
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.900
So the kidney is in a great anatomical position to receive a lot of the blood

189
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:32.890
flow.
And it does is my very minute to minute,

190
00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:37.580
depending on your state of health and your level of activity.
Uh,

191
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.370
but it receives on average about 25% of the cardiac output.

192
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:47.380
Cardiac output was,
you remember what the cardiac output number was,

193
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.000
a good number to keep in your head,
five liters per minute.

194
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.020
And so it's receiving over one liter per minute of blood.

195
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:02.050
Each of the kidneys are so that,
that's a lot.
Um,
if blood goes in,

196
00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.070
blood has to come back out.
It comes back out through to a renal veins,

197
00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:07.520
one from each kidney,
uh,

198
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.320
which carries the blood back to the Vena Cava and then back up to the heart.

199
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.450
So the kidney is in a privileged position with respect to the circulatory system

200
00:13:16.451 --> 00:13:20.680
so that it can receive a lot of the flow.
The,
the uh,

201
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:24.280
the blood vessels aren't shown on this diagram because I wanted to make it clear

202
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.490
in this diagram,
what are the,
uh,

203
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.770
the all the components of the urinary system,
but you can see the renal artery.

204
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.980
This is a blowup of the kidney over here across sections.

205
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:40.240
So you could see inside the kidney is not surprisingly kidney shaped,

206
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.140
kidney shaped.
And um,

207
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.990
and so it kind of wraps around this central core.

208
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.640
And in the central core,
here's the renal artery,
which is bringing blood in.

209
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.070
The one labeled for here,
the renal vein,

210
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:56.680
which is taking blood out is labeled number five.

211
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:02.230
And inside that renal artery splits into many smaller arteries,

212
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:06.810
which split,
which spread this blood flow throughout the,
the,
uh,

213
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.270
the bulk of the kidney,
right?

214
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.940
The renal vein carries a blood back out

215
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.360
and back to the Vena cave.
As I mentioned.

216
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.100
Now there's one other vessel which emerges from this,
uh,
bless you.

217
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.060
That emerges from this,
uh,
from this section of the kidney.

218
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.650
And this is called the uritor labeled number six here.

219
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.160
And this is the vessel through which urine flows

220
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.730
and that your in flows out of the kidney.

221
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:41.731
And then down down you can see this uritor one from each kidney flowing down

222
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:47.710
into this sac called the bladder.
That's the bladder.

223
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.560
And then the bladder has another vessel which,
uh,

224
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:54.320
which connects to the outside world called the urethra.

225
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.520
So urine is produced kit continuously by the kidneys.

226
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.630
Urine is continuously flowing,
although the rate might change with time,

227
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.510
it's continually flowing into the bladder.

228
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.760
The bladder is an expandable reservoir.
It expands,

229
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:15.400
collects urine until you're ready to release it,
right?

230
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.330
And then it's released through the urethra to the external environment.

231
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.780
So you have a picture of the anatomy.

232
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.800
There are a couple of functions I didn't talk about and we won't talk about

233
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:31.190
really,
uh,
in,
uh,
our,
our time on this subject.

234
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.000
The kidney also has a very important function in regulating blood pressure.

235
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:40.340
And we won't talk about that.
It also secretes some hormones,
uh,

236
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:44.870
that,
uh,
that uh,
um,
aid in a red blood cell production.

237
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.930
So there are some other functions aside from the ones we talked about,

238
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:50.510
but I'm going to talk about the main ones I've emphasized already.

239
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:57.320
Okay.
So you have a picture,
uh,
for,
uh,
for,

240
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.660
for the anatomy of the kidneys and where they sit.

241
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.780
And you will remember that for each kidney.

242
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:07.070
Now we'll just assume that they're each identical for the rest of our discussion

243
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:10.370
today.
And for each kidney,
there's blood coming in,

244
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.770
there's blood going out and there's urine coming out.
And so one way,

245
00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:17.600
and we've talked about this a little bit before,

246
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:21.500
but if you were an engineer just trying to analyze this system,

247
00:16:21.501 --> 00:16:25.460
our question was how does the kidney do what it does,
right?

248
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.690
One way to try to understand what it does is to,

249
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.740
is to treat it very simply.
Let's just say it's a,
it's a black box.

250
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:36.590
I don't really know anything about what goes on inside.

251
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.670
What I know about is that there are flows going in and out.

252
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.400
There's the renal artery that flows in,

253
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.830
there's the renal vein that flows out and there's the ureter which can,

254
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.150
which carries urine away.

255
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.670
And let's just look at what goes in and what comes out and see what we could

256
00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:56.180
learn about the function of the organ or what it must do just by looking at

257
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:58.820
those at those inputs and outputs.

258
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.810
And this is a common mode of engineering analysis.

259
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.290
So if we looked more carefully at what's flowing into the kidney,

260
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.460
there's a blood and at flows through,

261
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:15.050
and I mentioned a lot of blood goes through the kidney.
The astonishing rate,
uh,

262
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:15.710
that,
uh,

263
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:20.060
each of your two kidneys received 1700 liters of blood per day,

264
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:22.640
which flows continuously,
uh,

265
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.630
from the aorta into the renal arteries of that,
you know,

266
00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:29.480
the blood is composed of blood cells and plasma.

267
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.540
So if we just looked at the plasma,
about half of that volume,

268
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:37.250
slightly more than half of that volume is plasma,
right?
What's in plasma?

269
00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.460
Mainly water proteins like albumin and antibodies and salts like sodium and

270
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:48.920
potassium bicarbonate.
And waste products like urea.

271
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.600
So if we measured what the concentration was,

272
00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:55.440
the average concentration of each of those things in the renal arteries,

273
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:58.860
we could calculate how much flows in every day.

274
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.240
And so plasma 950 liters per day.
So that's nine,

275
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.850
that's almost a thousand liters of water per day,
right?

276
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.240
Flows through your kidneys.
Um,

277
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.140
a 133 milli moles of,
uh,

278
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.690
of sodium per day.
Uh,

279
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.750
less potassium per day because there's less potassium,
right?
Concentrations,

280
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.450
sodium high potassium is low,
and the extra cellular fluid,
a lot of bicarbonate,

281
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.340
the main Ph buffer in the blood,

282
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.960
and quite a lot of urea 500 grams of urea.
And remember,

283
00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:36.510
this is a waste product,
so your body needs to get rid of this.

284
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.630
So that's what's flowing in to each kidney.
What comes out,

285
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.400
we could think about analyzing by looking at what comes out in the urine.

286
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.570
And so if we collected the urine and measured the concentrations,

287
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:56.070
what comes out is about 1.5 liters per day of water,

288
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.900
of fluid volume.
Uh,

289
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.720
what comes out in terms of sodium,
about 103 millimoles per day.

290
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.160
So of the hundred and 30,

291
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:09.690
3000 millimoles of sodium that go through the kidneys each day,

292
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.430
your,
uh,
kidney gets rid of about a hundred millimoles,
right?

293
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:16.620
So it's looking at a lot of sodium,

294
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.850
figuring out how much you need and then excluding the little bit of excess that

295
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:24.690
you have because of excess that comes in in your diet.

296
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.630
Generally we eat more salt than we need to keep alive,
right?

297
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.290
Uh,
with a potassium,
uh,
50 millimoles per day.

298
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.740
So it's still a small fraction of what comes through by carbonate.

299
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:42.490
Small fraction of what comes through.
And urea.
Now there's a lot,
right?
52,
uh,

300
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.310
compared to 475.
All right,
so,
um,

301
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.990
so a sizable fraction of the urea gets eliminated every day.

302
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.590
Now these numbers that are percentages over here,

303
00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.920
what I did was I just took the total amount that you eliminate the total amount

304
00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:02.761
that's eliminated.

305
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:07.560
So 1.5 liters per day and figured out what percentage that was of the total

306
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:10.050
water that the kidney sees every day.

307
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:16.130
So 1.5 liters per day is 0.16% of 950 liters per day.

308
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.830
So your,
you,
your,

309
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.840
your kidney excretes 0.1% 0.16% of the water that flows through it,

310
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.330
a pretty small fraction,
but,
and,

311
00:20:31.331 --> 00:20:35.100
and a similar small fraction of sodium,
more of potassium,

312
00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.780
much less of bicarbonate,
and 11% of the urea that goes through.

313
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.080
So how could the kidney do this?
Right?

314
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.910
How did the kidney do this?
And you know,
something,
how does the kidney work?

315
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.440
How does it,

316
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:51.460
<v 1>okay,</v>

317
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.360
<v 0>how does it,</v>

318
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.280
how does it separate the molecules that it wants to excrete from all the

319
00:20:57.281 --> 00:20:59.290
molecules that are passing through here?

320
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.810
So what must this look like inside in order to accomplish this task?

321
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.220
And you can learn a lot about it just by looking at these numbers.

322
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:10.660
How does it work?

323
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.083
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.750
<v 0>Osmosis or,</v>

325
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:21.590
<v 1>okay,</v>

326
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.490
<v 0>what's Osmosis?</v>

327
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

328
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.370
<v 0>Right.
So it's um,
it's uh,</v>

329
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.570
osmosis is separation across some membrane where you have a semipermeable

330
00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:38.520
membrane and that's a good,
that's a good idea.
Um,
there,

331
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.960
there is osmosis that goes on and we're going to talk about it.
Now.

332
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.420
Last Moses is a really critical,
uh,

333
00:21:43.421 --> 00:21:48.060
way that the kidney functions at the microscopic level and we'll uh,

334
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.670
we'll talk about that.
Um,
but there's,

335
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:55.840
there's another sort of more cruder level of function that I'm thinking about.

336
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.600
A simpler level of function.
How do you,

337
00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.690
what was your vision of how the kidney works when you came in here?

338
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.930
What is your kidney do?
Filters.
Yeah,

339
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.060
it's a filter,
right?
How do filters work?

340
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:13.530
How does it filter work?

341
00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.130
Yeah,
so,
so,

342
00:22:22.131 --> 00:22:27.050
so a filter works because it has some property that if you put a liquid on top

343
00:22:27.051 --> 00:22:27.740
of it,

344
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.950
some of the components of the liquid will pass through and some of them won't.

345
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.110
And generally we think about filters.

346
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.200
What physical principle does it use to keep things on one side or to decide what

347
00:22:38.421 --> 00:22:39.254
passes through?

348
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.030
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

349
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:41.740
<v 0>what,</v>

350
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.740
what property of molecules size generally filters work based on size.

351
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.580
There are mechanical and they have holes in them and those holes are of a

352
00:22:53.631 --> 00:22:57.410
certain size and so only molecules that are smaller than that size can pass

353
00:22:57.411 --> 00:22:59.470
through,
right?
So now,

354
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.210
now that would make sense for the kidney because what's in the,

355
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.280
what's in the blood that you don't want to pass through?

356
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.450
You don't want blood cells to pass through and those are large,
right?
Those are,

357
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.900
those are five or 10 microns in diameter.
You don't want those to pass through.

358
00:23:11.901 --> 00:23:16.901
So let's have a filter that keeps blood cells on one side and only allows,

359
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.860
uh,
things that are smaller than blood cells to go through.
You also have,
um,

360
00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.130
proteins in your blood and those are generally large molecules,
right?

361
00:23:25.131 --> 00:23:28.160
You have albumin,
you got the antibodies,

362
00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.480
you have lots of lipid proteins,
you have lot,
you have insulin,

363
00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.330
you have lots of proteins that are in the blood.

364
00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:38.540
And those have important functions inside your body.
They're hard to make,

365
00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:42.270
you don't want to lose them.
And in general,
the filter is,
uh,

366
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.480
such that proteins don't go through.

367
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.610
Small Molecules can go through,
glucose can go through,

368
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:54.590
it's this much smaller molecule.
But do you want glucose to go through?
In fact,

369
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:59.210
I haven't even listed it here.
I have d.
What'd you want glucose to go through?

370
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.740
Probably not because you,

371
00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:07.690
I mean you worked hard to gather your food and eat it and you want to extract

372
00:24:07.691 --> 00:24:11.170
the energy from glucose.
Uh,
you don't want to lose a lot of it,

373
00:24:11.171 --> 00:24:15.520
so you'd like to keep that in.
But it's a small molecule.
In fact,

374
00:24:15.521 --> 00:24:20.521
it's not so much bigger than a urea or sodium or potassium or by carbon at these

375
00:24:22.781 --> 00:24:25.540
are all the,
these are all fairly small molecules.

376
00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.180
They all pass very easily through the filter.

377
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:33.700
So if your kidney was just a filter,
what would you expect to see in the,

378
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.840
in the,
uh,

379
00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.580
<v 1>okay.</v>

380
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:41.440
<v 0>In,
in the urine in particular,
what would these percentages be?</v>

381
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:44.230
If the kidney act as a filter?

382
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.070
If I tell you that all of these molecules are smaller.

383
00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

384
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.430
<v 0>Are small enough to pass freely through the kidney filter?</v>

385
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:54.643
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

386
00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.030
<v 0>Sorry.
Percent higher or,
or</v>

387
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.960
sorry.
Willmon did you say?
Well,

388
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.500
they'd all be the same,
right?
They,
they'd all be the same percentage.

389
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:16.880
If the kidney was just a filter and everything passed through that was smaller

390
00:25:16.881 --> 00:25:18.080
than a certain amount,

391
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.260
then then what you should see in the urine is just the same exact same

392
00:25:23.361 --> 00:25:27.830
percentage in the urine as is in the plasma,
right.

393
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:33.230
If your kidney was just a filter and it just allowed urea and bicarbonate and

394
00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:36.260
potassium and sodium and water to pass through,

395
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.680
then you should have the same fraction of water,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

396
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.390
These percentages wouldn't be different.
They'd be whatever they needed to be.

397
00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.780
Now,
what's the most important thing here?
Getting rid of the toxic compound.

398
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.590
Got To get rid of the toxic compound.
Otherwise you get sick.
Right?

399
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:56.570
So if the kidney was just a filter and I needed to get rid of 11% of the urea,

400
00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.730
then I would have to also lose 11% of the water.

401
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:03.090
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

402
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.500
<v 0>right.
And it's simple filter.</v>

403
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:10.600
If I want to get rid of 11% of the urea and the urea is dissolved in water,

404
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:14.560
they both pass through the filter that I'd have to get rid of 11% of the water.

405
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.760
So let's say 11% is about a hundred times this,

406
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:23.120
a hundred times a 0.16%.

407
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:28.280
So that would mean this number has to be a hundred liters per day.

408
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.010
What's the problem with having a urine output of 100 liters per day?

409
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.730
That's a lot.
And so could you sit through a class that's 50 minutes long?

410
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.100
Probably not.
So,
um,

411
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:49.560
how is there a one liter bottle get somebody has bottles.
How,
how big is,

412
00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:51.120
that's probably bigger than a leader writer

413
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.840
just about a leader.
So,
um,

414
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:10.040
so you would p a hundred of those per day.

415
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.230
So your bladder is,
can be a pretty good size,
but,

416
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.920
but it's not big enough to hold a hundred liters.
Right?
Your body is not

417
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:25.100
that big.
Um,
and,
and so a problem if your kidney was a,

418
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:29.300
with a simple filter is that you would have to be,
um,

419
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.650
you would have to be losing water screening water all the time.

420
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.190
And the flip side of that is for you not to shrink,

421
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.120
you've got to beat consuming that amount of water.
All right?

422
00:27:41.121 --> 00:27:46.121
So if the kidney was a simple filter and you needed to get rid of urea and

423
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.590
assuming that these numbers are your appropriate numbers for,
then,
uh,

424
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.190
then you would have to,
uh,

425
00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:56.630
then you'd have to pee out over a hundred liters per day and you have to drink a

426
00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.770
hundred liters of water per day in order to maintain your volume,
right?

427
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.840
Because what happens if you lose too much volume,

428
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:07.550
then you're ion concentrations go out of whack as well because they're not

429
00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:10.160
dissolved in the right,
uh,
volume of water.

430
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.080
So your kidney must have some other mechanism,
uh,

431
00:28:15.081 --> 00:28:20.081
besides being a filter and in particular it has to recover things that you need,

432
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.740
right?
So filtration is an important part of it,

433
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:30.470
but it also has to be selective in some way.

434
00:28:30.471 --> 00:28:32.960
And filtration is not selective enough.

435
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.910
Filtration is not selective enough because there are lots of molecules that are

436
00:28:37.911 --> 00:28:39.260
about the same size,

437
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:43.820
some that are toxic and some that are essential for health and you can't

438
00:28:43.821 --> 00:28:48.760
separate them just based on size.
Um,
just another example of,

439
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.940
of that,
if we looked,

440
00:28:49.941 --> 00:28:53.450
another way to look at how the kidney works is to look at relative

441
00:28:53.451 --> 00:28:58.280
concentrations in the plasma and the urine.
Ordinarily,
the kidney is very,

442
00:28:58.281 --> 00:29:01.130
very good at,
at,
um,
at,
uh,

443
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.150
keeping glucose out of the urine.
Even though it's a small molecule,

444
00:29:05.151 --> 00:29:09.370
it gets filtered,
uh,
along with urea,
uh,
the kidney,
uh,

445
00:29:09.371 --> 00:29:14.371
saves it somehow so that it's abnormal to have any urine in your,

446
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.550
any glucose into your urine.

447
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.010
Even though you have high concentrations in the plasma,

448
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.900
you get rid of quite a lot of sodium,

449
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.450
a tremendous amount of urea as we mentioned,
and uh,

450
00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:29.300
create and he has another waste product that turns out to be important for

451
00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:31.910
reasons we won't really talk about very much.

452
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.940
So how does it work if it,
if it,
if,
if it's not just a simple filter,

453
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.880
we'll filtration is an important part of it.
So occurs in the kidney.

454
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.500
It's the initial separation that happens where,
uh,
where,
um,
uh,

455
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:51.370
molecules that your kidneys processing gets separated from the blood.

456
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.010
Plasma filtration is the important first step.

457
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:55.600
And we'll talk about that in a few moments.

458
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.870
But this filtration does not directly produce urine.

459
00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.630
And you know what the problem with that is?

460
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:04.510
It's you'd have to produce too much urine if that was the only thing that

461
00:30:04.511 --> 00:30:09.490
happened instead the kidney reabsorbs.

462
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.500
So after the filtration step,
it takes the fluid that's produced by,

463
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.690
uh,
by,
uh,
filtration

464
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.190
and it looks at that fluid and it decides what things the body can use.

465
00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.810
Water,
glucose,
sodium,
potassium,

466
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.030
and it reabsorbed them back into the blood.

467
00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.910
So filtration is the first function.
Reabsorption is the second function.

468
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.440
And if you're filtering a hundred liters per day and you're only creating one

469
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:46.030
liter of urine,
that means that there's a lot of reabsorption going on,
right?

470
00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:49.240
Most of the water that gets filtered through the kidney gets reabsorbed.

471
00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:53.340
Only that small fraction 0.1% gets,
uh,

472
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.140
gets excreted in urine.
So we're going to call the,
uh,
the,
the,
the,
uh,

473
00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:03.190
the filtrate or the fluid that gets produced by filtration.

474
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.390
That's,
that's fluid that wants to be urine,
right?
It once it,
it,

475
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.190
it wants to be your in some day,
but it's,
that's what it aspires to.

476
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.250
It aspires to be your end,
but it's not quite urine yet.

477
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.880
And the important role of the kidney is to make that is to extract back out the

478
00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:24.640
fluids that are in this sort of want to be urine.

479
00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.180
The things that it can use to produce a very concentrated,

480
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.010
a waste stream.

481
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.080
The kidney also directly secretes some compounds.

482
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:38.320
There's some compounds that aren't filtered very effectively or as effectively

483
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:39.760
as we need them to be.

484
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:44.200
And so the kidney has mechanisms for taking molecules directly from the blood

485
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:49.120
and,
and,
and pumping them into the urine.
And that's,
uh,
that's a little,

486
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:49.650
that's a,

487
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.960
that's a specialized function that's a little bit beyond where we need to go.

488
00:31:52.961 --> 00:31:55.720
I wanted to show it to you for w where we have time to go.

489
00:31:55.721 --> 00:31:58.780
I wanted to show it to you for completion.
If you go on to study

490
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.010
physiology,
uh,
you'll learn a lot about this,

491
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.440
but there's filtration reabsorption.

492
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:09.520
This accounts for the majority of what happens in terms of processing to form

493
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.560
urine,
but there's also secretion.

494
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:14.650
And then finally the year end that goes to the bladder and is eliminated.

495
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.360
Um,
okay,
so just coming back to this picture again.
Uh,

496
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.160
the renal arteries,
uh,

497
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:28.480
about 180 liters of that fluid that comes in per day is filtered.

498
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.100
So this is,
uh,

499
00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.110
was about 900 and some leaders of plasma that goes into the kidneys.

500
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.140
Of that 180 liters are filtered,

501
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.660
meaning whatever the filter portion of the kidney is,

502
00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:46.430
180 of those leaders or a fairly substantial fraction passes through the filter.

503
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.980
You only lose about 1.5 liters per day of urine.

504
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.480
And that means that the kidney is reabsorbing 178.5 liters per day,

505
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:02.890
<v 1>right?</v>

506
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.200
<v 0>So that's an astounding amount of work,</v>

507
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:10.890
both to filter this quantity of fluid and then recover that fluid back takes a

508
00:33:11.561 --> 00:33:15.570
lot of energy and um,
and uh,

509
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.120
we'll see that there's a lot of action that's going on inside the cells of the

510
00:33:19.121 --> 00:33:21.130
kidney to allow this to happen.
Uh,

511
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:25.390
but you should be very grateful because if your kidney did not do this work for

512
00:33:25.391 --> 00:33:26.200
you,

513
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.380
then there were a lot of activities that you would have trouble participating
in,

514
00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:30.730
right?
If you had to,

515
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.990
if you had to be constantly worried about peeing and drinking,

516
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.540
you couldn't wait to do it,
right?

517
00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.420
Cause you've got to do it all the time in order to maintain this balance.

518
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.400
A life would be very different.

519
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.533
<v 1>Okay.</v>

520
00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.170
<v 0>And this is the problem when the kidneys begin to fail,</v>

521
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.110
if you're not filtering,

522
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.080
secreting and UB reabsorbing this much water,

523
00:33:53.081 --> 00:33:56.890
which the kid needs do through very active energy consuming processes,

524
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.090
then what happens?
Concentration of urea goes up,

525
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:07.150
concentration of sodium and potassium gets out of whack and your health very

526
00:34:07.151 --> 00:34:09.280
quickly deteriorates.
Alright.

527
00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.940
So you cannot live a healthy life very long without all of these things

528
00:34:12.941 --> 00:34:14.710
happening continuously.

529
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:18.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

530
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.310
<v 0>How does the kidney accomplished these functions?</v>

531
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.280
What it accomplishes it through,

532
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:28.380
through a a marvelously elegant machine called the nephron.

533
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.070
And a Nephron is the functional unit of the kidney.

534
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.010
And I'm going to show you in a diagram in a moment.
Uh,
this is sort of the,

535
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.140
a picture a cartoon of the kidney.
If you turned it on its side,
right?

536
00:34:41.141 --> 00:34:45.460
It's sitting up this way and it's kidney bean shape and I turned it on its side.

537
00:34:45.461 --> 00:34:49.780
So this part,
the capsule is pointing up that's up here.

538
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:53.230
And the inner part or the Mandala,
the part where all the,

539
00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:58.620
where all the vessels come in is pointing down and oriented within each,

540
00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.490
within each,
um,
each kidney are a million,

541
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:08.550
over a million of these functional units called nephrons and nephrons are just a

542
00:35:10.001 --> 00:35:14.830
series of tubes that are arranged in a very specific configuration.

543
00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:19.090
And we'll see in the next slide that nephrons look slightly different.

544
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.270
There are nephrons of these million,

545
00:35:22.271 --> 00:35:24.640
there are different populations that look slightly different,

546
00:35:24.641 --> 00:35:29.020
but they all have the same basic anatomy.
And uh,

547
00:35:29.021 --> 00:35:31.090
I'll just trace through the anatomy here,

548
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.120
starting at this little tuft at the top of the nephron or near the top of the

549
00:35:36.371 --> 00:35:40.250
nephron.
So the capsule is a structure called the glomerulus.

550
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:46.100
And the Marea lists is where the blood carrying tubes and the urine carrying

551
00:35:48.331 --> 00:35:50.670
tubes meet the glow.

552
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:54.180
The Glow Marea list is where these two sets of Tubules,

553
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:59.181
meat and the [inaudible] list is the structure in which filtration takes place.

554
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.040
So what you see here is a ball,
which is basically a sack.

555
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.370
And so you imagine a sac that is in closing sort of,
uh,
uh,

556
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.890
tuft or tumbleweed of blood vessels.

557
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:21.210
So there's blood that's coming into this tuft of capillaries and there's blood

558
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:23.220
that's going out.
You can't really see it here,

559
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.710
but there's blood that's coming in,
this blood that's going out.

560
00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.870
Each of these Tufts is really a,
a branch of the renal artery,

561
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.830
right?
I showed you the picture of the renal artery comes in,

562
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.020
it branches at branches,
at branches.

563
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.140
It branches a million times and there are one of one of those million branches

564
00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:45.360
goes to each a glomerulus.

565
00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

566
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.770
<v 0>And it forms a Tuft of capillaries there.</v>

567
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.700
And this capillary is surrounded by a sack when I better do it the same way.

568
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:57.240
So not to get into the capillary comes in,
it's surrounded by a sack.

569
00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.690
Filtration occurs across these capillary walls.

570
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

571
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:07.070
<v 0>And how does filtration occur?
Filtration occurs by pressure drop.</v>

572
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.400
Filtration occurs by a pressure drop.

573
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.510
So the same physical force that's moving blood through your circulatory system.

574
00:37:14.511 --> 00:37:18.470
We talked about blood pressure generated by your heart within these,

575
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.090
within this tuft of capillaries,
this blood is pressurized,
right?

576
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:28.160
It's pressurized because it's not that far from your heart,
right?

577
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.000
There's not that much resistance between where pressures formed in your heart.

578
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.290
And this tough in the sack outside is a low pressure.

579
00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:41.440
Now this is a different kind of a pressure drop because we'd been thinking about

580
00:37:41.441 --> 00:37:45.730
a pressure drop along a tube,
right?
High pressure here,
low pressure here.

581
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.960
So fluid flows through the tube instead.

582
00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:54.250
Now we have high pressure inside of a Tuft of capillaries and low pressure

583
00:37:54.251 --> 00:37:57.010
outside.
So the pressure drop is not along the tube.

584
00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.930
It's across the wall of the tube.

585
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:06.240
And if there's a pressure drop across the wall of the tube and the wall is

586
00:38:06.241 --> 00:38:10.080
leaky,
then water can move across.

587
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.340
So it moves from inside the tube outside.
High pressure inside the tube,

588
00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:15.450
low pressure outside.

589
00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.810
This is where the filtration function of the kidney takes place in the

590
00:38:20.811 --> 00:38:21.920
capillaries of the glove.

591
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.310
Mary and the capillaries of the glomerulus are leaky there holes in them.

592
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:27.710
And so if there's high pressure on the inside,

593
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:32.300
low pressure on the outside fluid can flow through and anything that's small

594
00:38:32.301 --> 00:38:36.970
enough to fit through these holes can pass through with the
okay.

595
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.350
And so that,

596
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:43.330
that hundred liters per day that's filtered occurs in these 1 million,

597
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.020
uh,
go marry a lie of the 1 million nephrons in each kidney.

598
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:53.100
This space that's in this sack here is where the first differences between urine

599
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.630
and plasma are created,
right?

600
00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:02.370
Because the fluid that accumulates in this sack outside the Glen Maria lists by

601
00:39:02.371 --> 00:39:04.540
filtration is different from plasma.

602
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.320
It's different from plasma.
In what way?
Well,

603
00:39:09.321 --> 00:39:14.321
it only has molecules that are small enough to pass through the filter.

604
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.590
And so it only has molecules that are below a certain size.

605
00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.520
So plasma has blood cells,
has red blood cells,
has white blood cells.

606
00:39:23.521 --> 00:39:26.730
It has proteins,
glucose ions,

607
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.230
but the urine only has things that are smaller than a certain size.

608
00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.320
So imagine a cutoff in molecular weight and everything that's below that is

609
00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:39.990
present.
Everything that's above it is not present.

610
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.910
How does the concentration of sodium in the glomerulus compared to the

611
00:39:44.911 --> 00:39:49.911
concentration of sodium in this space in this want to be urine space?

612
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:52.081
Well,

613
00:39:52.081 --> 00:39:56.850
the concentrations the same at this point because what you have here is just to

614
00:39:56.851 --> 00:40:01.851
filtrate and if the molecule is very small like water or like sodium,

615
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:04.860
then all the molecules are going to pass through.

616
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.580
There won't be any difference in concentration on either side of the filter.

617
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:10.370
<v 1>Okay.</v>

618
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:15.370
<v 0>So what does this fluid look like at this point of the tube of the beginning of</v>

619
00:40:15.591 --> 00:40:17.120
the urine flow pathway?

620
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.950
It looks like what's called an ultra filtrate of plasma.

621
00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.870
It looks like plasma,
but with just the big molecules,
the big stuff removed,

622
00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.930
the concentration of everything else would be the same.

623
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.253
That makes sense.

624
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:41.220
So after filtration,
this fluid passes through this,
uh,

625
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:45.410
through this winding set of tubes,
uh,

626
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:49.410
these whining set of tubules.
Now these are called the kidney tubules.

627
00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.600
This is not blood that's flowing through here now,

628
00:40:51.601 --> 00:40:56.520
but this is the fluid that wants to be urine and it flows through.
And the,

629
00:40:56.521 --> 00:40:59.400
these tubules in the kidney are divided into segments.

630
00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:03.360
The first segment is called the proximal convoluted tubule.

631
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:08.850
It's called convoluted because it twists around its proximal because proximal

632
00:41:08.851 --> 00:41:11.790
means near.
And this part of the tube is near the goal.

633
00:41:11.791 --> 00:41:16.590
Mary Alice proximal convoluted tubule.
The fluid flows through it.

634
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.600
Fluid flows down this loop and this loop extends from the top near the cortex of

635
00:41:22.711 --> 00:41:25.650
the kidney down toward them,
the dollar and then up again,

636
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:32.520
right,
there's a loop.
And this loop is called the loop of Henley,
H,
e n,
l,
e,

637
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.230
after,
um,
an anatomist who uh,
who described it first.

638
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:41.660
So it's called the loop of Henley.
And then there's another region here,

639
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.930
which is another twisting,
winding tubule,

640
00:41:46.350 --> 00:41:49.650
another convoluted tubule,
but it's far from the Golem aerialist.

641
00:41:49.651 --> 00:41:52.070
So this is called the distal convoluted tubule.

642
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.980
And then finally that distal convoluted tubule flows into a straight duct that

643
00:41:57.981 --> 00:42:02.000
goes down through the mandala called the collecting duct.

644
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:07.610
And this collecting duct dumps directly into the ureter,

645
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:11.450
which carries urine to the bladder.

646
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.960
So there's a lot of action here,
right,
that the,
uh,

647
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:22.970
an ultra filtrate of plasma is formed in this space.

648
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.230
This space,
by the way,
is called Bowman's space.

649
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:29.900
After another anatomist who first discovered it,

650
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:34.670
the space where the filtration occurs into is called Bowman's space.
Uh,

651
00:42:34.671 --> 00:42:38.660
the urine flows through the distal convoluted tubule through the loop of Henley,

652
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.980
I'm sorry,
through the proximal convoluted tubule,
down the loop of Henley,

653
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:48.040
backup the loop of Henley through the distal proximal distal convoluted tubule

654
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:52.130
into the collecting duct and then out to the ureter and the bladder.

655
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.400
Now what's happening?
Why this,

656
00:42:55.401 --> 00:43:00.401
why this complicated series of tubes arranged in this way and it,

657
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.670
and actually if we looked at the,
uh,
the,

658
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.550
the microscopic anatomy in each of these tubes,

659
00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:12.551
that's what's shown here is what do the cells look like that form these tubes at

660
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:14.780
different regions of the nephron.

661
00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.830
And one thing that you could notice and that anatomist noticed when they started

662
00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:22.280
studying the kidney is that these tubes all look are,

663
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.280
these tubes are all composed of cells that look slightly different.

664
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.450
And the reason that they look slightly different is because they're performing

665
00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.670
different functions.
And uh,

666
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.310
the details are the functions that they're performing are beyond the scope of

667
00:43:37.311 --> 00:43:39.440
what we're going to talk about it you'll be responsible for.

668
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:40.640
I'll mention a few of them,

669
00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.990
but one way to think about it is that different parts of the tubule have

670
00:43:44.991 --> 00:43:49.991
different functions in terms of reabsorption of molecules from the urine.

671
00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.420
That the main task of the nephron after this filtration step is to recover the

672
00:43:57.891 --> 00:44:01.910
things that the body is still needs to recover.
Sodium,

673
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.450
to recover glucose,
to recover a potassium,

674
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:07.610
and to recover most importantly water.

675
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:13.370
So that you don't have to be drinking constantly in order to remain healthy and

676
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:17.900
different parts of the tubule are responsible for different elements of that

677
00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:21.980
reabsorption process.
It turns out it's not quite so simple as that.

678
00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:25.910
You couldn't say glucose is here,
sodiums here,
potassium's here.

679
00:44:25.911 --> 00:44:27.650
It's not quite that separated.

680
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:32.890
But they function in sort of a coordination in order to accomplish this overall

681
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.870
process with each part of the tubule performing slightly different functions to

682
00:44:38.941 --> 00:44:43.520
do that.
Here's the picture that I promised earlier,

683
00:44:43.521 --> 00:44:45.870
why just wanted to show you what I've been showing you.

684
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.720
The kidney turned on its side,

685
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:51.600
so here you'd be laying down on your side,

686
00:44:51.601 --> 00:44:54.150
I guess in the abdominal aorta is coming down here.

687
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:59.010
Blood flowing up to this kidney.
Uh,
here's the,
um,
the capsule,

688
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:04.100
here's the Mandala and here's all the nephrons arranged in this up and down a

689
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:09.950
pattern along the breadth of the,
of the kidney.
And,
um,

690
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.370
this just shows that there are glow marea lie these small Tufts everywhere

691
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:17.850
throughout the,
this upper region of the,

692
00:45:17.851 --> 00:45:19.950
of the kidney that there are,

693
00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:24.980
that all of these glow Mary lie our branches of a branch of the renal artery and

694
00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.670
that,
uh,
nephrons,
you could see in that cartoon I showed you before.
Uh,

695
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:32.550
here's one nephron shown.

696
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:36.930
Here's the Glomerulus list and here's the proximal convoluted tubule.

697
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.980
And you can see in this more elaborate drawing just how convoluted it is that

698
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:44.970
there are many,
many,
these are quite long tubules.
Uh,

699
00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:49.830
so there's a long pathway for fluid to flow through and that's in order to give

700
00:45:49.831 --> 00:45:53.130
the kidney cells time to perform this,
uh,

701
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.520
this function on all of the fluid that is flowing through the kidney.

702
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:02.670
This is kind of a complicated picture and I'll let you look at it at your

703
00:46:02.671 --> 00:46:05.160
leisure.
These are posted on the classes server.

704
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.400
What I want to show you mainly as this figure down here,

705
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:12.600
and this is a picture of the filter in the kidney.

706
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:16.940
Now where does the filter reside in the kidney?
It's at the it,

707
00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:18.120
it's the capillaries.

708
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:22.680
It's the walls of these capillaries that formed these Tufts in the GL,

709
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:23.514
Mary Alice.

710
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:28.260
And this picture is a scanning electron micrograph that was taken by,
uh,

711
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:30.210
by taking one of these capillaries,

712
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:34.470
cutting it open and then spreading it out so you could look down on the surface.

713
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:37.350
So here we're like looking from the,

714
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:42.351
actually from the outside of the tube in and what you see is holes

715
00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:48.270
and these are physical holes that are of a size that allows small molecules to

716
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:52.470
pass through and but keep blood cells and large molecules on the other side.

717
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:57.660
And so the kidney really is a filter in an important sense and it functions just

718
00:46:57.661 --> 00:47:01.950
like a coffee filter or any of the synthetic filters you might use,

719
00:47:01.951 --> 00:47:06.951
which are just mainly made of materials that have many small holes in them,

720
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.400
right?
And that's what this,
uh,
this,
uh,
tubule looks like.

721
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:17.070
So there is a filtration of function in order to perform this filtration

722
00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:21.240
functionality mentioned that you need to have pressure,
right?

723
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:25.380
You got to have a pressure drop in order to filter and that pressure drop is

724
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:27.210
generated by the heart.

725
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.820
But here's an interesting thing.
We look,

726
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:35.110
we talked about pressure drop in the circulation.
Remember when we talked,

727
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.000
uh,
before spring break

728
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:43.710
about where is the main resistance to pressure or to flow along the vessels of

729
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:50.890
your cardiovascular system?
Pressures generated by the heart.

730
00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.790
If we think about the left side of the heart,
blood flows into the aorta,

731
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.800
into large arteries,
arterials,
capillaries.

732
00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:05.260
That's where exchange takes place back into venules,
veins,
back to the heart.

733
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:10.210
Where was the main pressure drop?
The main source of resistance,
which,

734
00:48:10.211 --> 00:48:14.320
which one of those elements had the largest resistance?
Do you remember

735
00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.550
somebody's Brian?
Did you

736
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:21.563
<v 1>perfect?</v>

737
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.850
<v 0>The capillaries have a sizable resistance but not the most.
And,
and,</v>

738
00:48:25.851 --> 00:48:30.090
and it is important because it's the place where your number size is regulated

739
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:35.750
so that you can adjust flow rates most sensitively here in the arterials are the

740
00:48:36.871 --> 00:48:37.980
small arteries.

741
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:43.800
And it turns out that the glomerular capillaries are the capillaries of these

742
00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:48.600
Tufts sit in a unique position between two sets of arterials,

743
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.500
arterial that leads into the next,

744
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:55.350
into the glomerulus and an arterial that leads out of the Glomerulus.

745
00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.870
And because of that,

746
00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:02.430
if you have this tuft of capillaries that sitting on either side of an arterial,

747
00:49:02.431 --> 00:49:05.970
now what did arterials do?
They were the right size,

748
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:07.500
the right physical dimension,

749
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:12.090
so that they created a fairly substantial resistance to flow.
That's one thing.

750
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:17.210
They're the right size to create a fairly substantial resistance to flow and

751
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:22.110
they can expand and contract and so they can adjust their resistance and what

752
00:49:22.111 --> 00:49:23.910
happens when they adjust their resistance,

753
00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.450
they change the overall pressure drop for that segment.

754
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:32.490
And by changing the pressure drop,
you can change how much flow occurs,
right?

755
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:33.810
Well,

756
00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:38.810
the glomerular capillaries sit here between two arterioles and they can

757
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:44.390
independently regulate their size and what that allows the individual nephron to

758
00:49:45.181 --> 00:49:49.380
do is to adjust.
What's the pressure inside?

759
00:49:49.381 --> 00:49:50.970
It's glomerular capillaries.

760
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:56.790
If I want the pressure to be lower,
then I squeeze in on this one,

761
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.290
the one that's leading in,
I get more of a pressure drop across that arterial,

762
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.030
so the pressure's lower coming out.

763
00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.740
If I want the higher pressure drop on the glomerular capillaries,

764
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:12.060
I expand this so that I don't have as much resistance.

765
00:50:12.061 --> 00:50:13.650
I don't have as much of a pressure drop.

766
00:50:13.651 --> 00:50:17.430
I have higher pressure in the glomerular capillaries.
Now,

767
00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:19.380
why would that make a difference?

768
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:25.140
Because remember these glomerular capillaries sit inside this capsule where

769
00:50:25.141 --> 00:50:29.210
there's a low pressure.
If I have a pressure here,
low pressure here,

770
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:33.710
I get filtration.
If pressure goes up inside here,
but stays the same out here,

771
00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.430
I get more filtration.
Pressure goes down,
I get less.

772
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.760
So every individual nephron has a mechanism for regulating how much fluid it

773
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:46.610
filters at any particular time.

774
00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:53.450
And it does that by regulating the arteries on either side of the culinary alert

775
00:50:53.451 --> 00:50:55.520
Tuft.
Okay.

776
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.390
I'm going to stop there and then we'll continue next time talking a little bit

777
00:50:59.391 --> 00:51:01.640
more detail about how the,
uh,

778
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.090
how the kidneys do this task of recovering molecules that you need

779
00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.970
<v 1>questions.
Good.</v>

780
00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:12.720
See you on Thursday.
