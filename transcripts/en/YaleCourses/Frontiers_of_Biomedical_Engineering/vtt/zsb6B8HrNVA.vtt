1
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.510
So today we're gonna continue talking about imaging.

2
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:20.511
Last Tuesday on Tuesday I talked mainly about about imaging using x-rays and the

3
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:26.040
conventional sort of x ray,
which a chest x Ray,

4
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:28.830
which leads to a projected image.

5
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.460
And so you understand the limitations of,

6
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.170
of projected images and from x-ray's,

7
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.570
something about the physics of how an x ray image is formed based on,
uh,

8
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.280
x rays passing through your body.
And depending on what tissues,

9
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:46.890
what types of tissues the xray passes through,

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.870
some of that extra energy will be absorbed and therefore only a fraction of it

11
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:56.400
is available to pass all the way through your body and expose the x ray film.

12
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.100
And we're going to talk about several alternate forms of imaging today,

13
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.480
many of which are similar to CT imaging.

14
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.440
Now CT imaging as a special form of x ray imaging,

15
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.710
where you rotate the source of x rays and the detector around the object you're

16
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:21.891
trying to image around the patient and you take images at a large number of

17
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.650
angles and using mathematical approaches,

18
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:30.651
you reconstruct the three dimensional image from those multiple.

19
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.340
<v 1>Okay,</v>

20
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.600
<v 0>two dimensional,
um,
projections,
right?</v>

21
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.960
And that mathematical process is called reconstruction from back projections and

22
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.290
um,
and it results in a three dimensional image in a CT,

23
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.060
a slice of the,
of the,
um,

24
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.420
of the object of the patient is obtained by rotating the source and the detector

25
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.120
around that axial location.

26
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.910
What we're going to start with is talking about an alternate to,
uh,
to Ct.

27
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.860
<v 1>What happened?
Did it go out?
It was on at the</v>

28
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.350
beginning.
Right.

29
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.153
Okay.

30
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.870
<v 0>Um,
we're going to talk about an alternate to,
uh,</v>

31
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.820
to CT that doesn't use,

32
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.510
<v 1>okay.
It's there.</v>

33
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.420
It's there but not good.
Is it?

34
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.433
Yeah.

35
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.930
<v 0>Sorry.
It's just take me a minute here.</v>

36
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.683
<v 1>Hopefully.</v>

37
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.623
Is that look better?

38
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.630
<v 0>Well,
we'll go with it anyway.</v>

39
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.990
All right.
It looks a lot better.
Okay.

40
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.000
We're going to talk about an alternate to CT,

41
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.150
which forms the same kind of images that is images of an axial location,

42
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.350
maybe a transverse image,
a slice from the body.
Um,

43
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.450
we'll be imaged using a technique called magnetic resonance as an alternative

44
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:23.670
to,
uh,
to using x rays.

45
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.080
And we talked last time about one of the problems with x rays that x-ray's had a

46
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:32.730
lot of beneficial qualities for making images.
They pass through tissues,

47
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.210
they allow you to look inside their absorbed selectively by tissues have

48
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:37.140
different density.

49
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.350
They're able to expose x ray film and all of those properties make them uh,

50
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.050
very good for uh,
for forming images.

51
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.620
The problem is that x-rays x ray radiation is a form of ionizing radiation.

52
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.720
It can,
uh,
that can cause damage to cells and tissues in the body.

53
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.320
And so one has to be careful about how much dose you expose a particular patient

54
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.170
to in magnetic resonance image imaging,

55
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.210
use magnetic fields and radio frequency radiation non-ionizing forms of

56
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.230
radiation in order to,
in order to form an image.
Uh,
but the,
uh,
the,

57
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.560
the,
uh,
the,
the kind of image you form is the same.

58
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.320
You form a three dimensional image of objects.

59
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.270
But since the physics is different,

60
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.450
the things that create contrast or your ability to see one object from another

61
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.440
in an MRI image are different than in a CT image.
In a CT image.
What forms?

62
00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:42.441
The contrast is the absorbance of X-ray's by the tissue and so your lungs,

63
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.730
which are mostly air allow x rays to pass through relatively easily and so and

64
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:50.401
so.

65
00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:55.401
They're different from soft tissue like blood or the muscle tissue of your heart

66
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.960
which absorbs some of those rays and they're different from bone which absorbed

67
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:04.700
a lot of those x rays and so its density of the tissue absorbance of the x rays.

68
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.440
That leads to contrast.

69
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.090
One of the things I didn't talk about last time was that sometimes physicians

70
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:16.040
when they want to make images of objects where there's not a lot of intrinsic

71
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.160
contrast like say you want to look at the intestine,

72
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.060
but if you take an x ray of the abdomen,

73
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.900
everything appears like soft tissue.
Everything looks about the same.

74
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.800
If you however,
fill up the intestines with air,

75
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.620
if you fill up the intestines with air by feeding heir to the patient or by

76
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:38.840
somehow getting air into the intestinal track,

77
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.110
then that image will appear dark where that area is and you can create contrast.

78
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:46.550
You can see what's inside of the intestine that way.

79
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.200
Another way you can do it is by having the patient drink something that absorbs

80
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:56.100
x very readily.
And that's something is usually a solution of a Barium,
uh,

81
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.050
colloidal Barium solution that is very ray dense.

82
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.840
So you can create contrast that way.

83
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.830
That's a digression,
but something I didn't mention last time.

84
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.610
It is mentioned in the chapter.
What I want to talk about,
Mr,

85
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:14.780
is a different way of forming images uses a different kind of physics.

86
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.200
And so the elements of intrinsic contrast are different.

87
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.180
We'll talk about what makes a,
what makes a Mr images images,

88
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.430
um,
in,
in a few moments.

89
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:30.230
But bone does not appear well on Mri images,

90
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:34.220
whereas bone appeared very well in x rays and a cts for example.

91
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.110
So if you've taken chemistry,

92
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:42.860
some chemistry rather in,
in,
in college or in high school,

93
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:46.640
you've probably heard of Nmr nuclear magnetic resonance.

94
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.900
It was discovered by chemists as a way of,

95
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:53.410
of analyzing chemical samples.
And uh,

96
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.960
it turns out that if you put certain,
uh,
nuclei,

97
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.020
if you put certain atoms in a magnetic field,

98
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.310
some of them will align with the magnetic field because they have a magnetic

99
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:07.490
dipole.
Adams have a dye magnetic dipole.

100
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.310
So hydrogen atoms,
protons,

101
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.190
uh,
have an odd number of nuclei,
uh,

102
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:20.420
of neutrons or protons.
Because of that,
they have a dipole,

103
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:23.480
a magnetic dipole.
You put them in a magnetic field.

104
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.460
They will align with that magnetic field.

105
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.470
And if you then perturb the molecules that are aligned with the magnetic field

106
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.510
using radio frequency waves or other magnetic fields,

107
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:36.800
we'll talk about this in a moment.

108
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.160
Then you can measure something about the properties of the atom.

109
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.640
And chemists use this because it turns out that if you align all the hydrogen

110
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.330
atoms or protons in a sample,

111
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.600
if you align them in a magnetic field and then you stimulate them with the right

112
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:59.130
kind of radio frequency,

113
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.370
they will respond by producing a radio frequency of their own by producing an

114
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:07.320
energy emission of their own.

115
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.970
That energy emission is that radio frequency wave lengths and you can detect it

116
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.820
and protons that are in different environments will respond slightly

117
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:22.590
differently.
So a proton that is,
or a hydrogen,

118
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:27.300
I'm going to say Proton instead of hydrogen atom because that's easier to say,

119
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.180
or hydrogen ion,
uh,

120
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.520
a proton that's in a fatty solution will behave differently when stimulated in a

121
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:41.181
magnetic field and one that's in water and one that's in bone will behave even

122
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:42.450
differently than that.

123
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.580
So the properties that you can measure by this process called nuclear magnetic

124
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:52.380
residents depend not only on the Adam that you're stimulating hydrogen in this

125
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:53.130
case,

126
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.130
but the microenvironment or local surrounding that the Adam finds itself in.

127
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.480
And so if you talked about this in chemistry,

128
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.570
you might talk about distinguishing different hydrogen ions that are associated

129
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:13.170
with an alcohol molecule or with a benzene ring and how ones that are in

130
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:16.680
different positions on the molecule will actually respond differently,

131
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.620
give you what chemists called different chemicals shifts.

132
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.810
So it's that same phenomenon that's being used here to create images.

133
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:30.060
And it was discovered in 1946 that atomic nuclei could absorb.

134
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:34.020
And readmit radio frequency energy and particularly when they were aligned in a

135
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:35.010
magnetic field.

136
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:39.570
And that led to this discovery of the nuclear magnetic resonance concept led to

137
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:42.120
the Nobel Prize in physics in 1952.

138
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:47.070
It's called nuclear magnetic resonance because it involves,
um,

139
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:51.660
it depends on the particular properties of the Nuclei of atoms.

140
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:54.660
That is the number of protons,
the number of neutrons.

141
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.960
It's magnetic because a magnetic field is required in order to align the ions

142
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:05.250
and is called resonance because you're looking for a resonance between the,
uh,

143
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.590
the excitation of these molecules.

144
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.520
These aligned molecules aligned in a magnetic field,

145
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.310
which are exciting them with radio frequency waves.

146
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:17.940
And you're looking for a particular resonance between the magnetic field that's

147
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:22.740
applied and the stimulation that you give with radio frequency.

148
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.230
Now when I was introducing the subject,

149
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:27.690
I didn't call it nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,

150
00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:30.510
I called it magnetic resonance imaging or Mri.

151
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:35.511
And that's the common name that's used for making medical images using this,

152
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.160
uh,
particular physical approach.

153
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.960
And why do you think the name was changed from nuclear magnetic residence to Mri

154
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.850
during the 1980s?
When this technique started to be used in people.

155
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.580
So anything with nuclear doesn't sound so good.

156
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:56.830
You don't want anything with nuclear done to you,

157
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.260
probably because of other uses of Nuclei and uh,

158
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.650
and concerns about nuclear sources of energy and that kind of thing.

159
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.960
So the name was changed,
but,
uh,

160
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.530
but I don't want you to be confused because the phenomenon is the same.

161
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.120
So to,
uh,

162
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:18.340
perform magnetic resonance and to make magnetic resonance images,

163
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.060
you need a very strong magnetic field.
And magnetic fields,

164
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.750
if you remember from physics,
are measured in a unit called Tesla.

165
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.230
And most of the clinical units that are used to perform magnetic resonance image

166
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.810
images have,
uh,

167
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.850
have magnetic fields ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 a Tesla.

168
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.170
And,
um,
uh,
Tesla,

169
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.830
another unit for that is the Gauss and the conversion factors shown here.

170
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.430
But just to put it in perspective,
you know that the earth has a magnetic field.

171
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.810
That's why campuses work has a magnetic field.
And so if you have a compass,

172
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:56.080
which is just a device that detects the earth's magnetic field,

173
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.480
always aligns with north,
for example,

174
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.260
the magnetic field of the earth is about 0.3,

175
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.670
gauss or um,
and it ranges between 0.3 and 0.6.

176
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:09.670
So a Gauss is a,
uh,
is,
uh,

177
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.410
that would convert to 0.6.
Gauss converts to 60 Micro Tesla,

178
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.640
right?
So 60 times 10 to the minus sixth Tesla

179
00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.500
is the magnetic field of the earth.
We're talking about much,

180
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:28.180
much higher magnetic fields than that,
right?
And so,

181
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.930
um,

182
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:33.580
you'll need to know this because you're going to go down and visit the,
uh,

183
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.760
the Amr research center at Yale this afternoon.

184
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.560
And magnetic fields of this strength can interact with other magnetic objects

185
00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:46.180
like credit cards that you might have in your pockets or keys that you have in

186
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:48.970
your pockets.
And so when you enter an Mr Suite,

187
00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.670
you have to make sure that you're not carrying anything metal,

188
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.870
wearing anything metal w are carrying anything magnetize that has a risk of

189
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:59.950
being demagnetizes with it because these are very strong magnetic fields.

190
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.210
Because of this.

191
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:06.300
The MRF facility that you will see here at Yale is in the basement of the

192
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.440
Anglian Center.
And usually these,
uh,
these machines are in the basement.

193
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:14.380
So if you go to hospital and you have an Mr,
uh,
taken,

194
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.960
usually go down to the basement.
And why is that?

195
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.840
Because they're put in rooms that are specially shielded,

196
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.430
their specially shielded so that the magnetic fields cannot penetrate outside of

197
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:25.264
the room.

198
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.320
And that's so that people that are walking by in the street don't have their

199
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:31.240
credit cards erased,
right?

200
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.720
People that are walking by in the street don't have metal objects pulled out of

201
00:14:34.721 --> 00:14:37.510
their hands right by the strong magnetic fields.

202
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.640
And so this is one of the risks for people that work around nuclear magnetic

203
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:46.330
resonance imaging is that the fields are so strong that any,
uh,

204
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.960
any metal object that's in the vicinity of the magnet can become a projectile.

205
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.820
And so they're very cautious about metal.

206
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.840
Another reason why we asked you not to take any stuff that's unnecessary with

207
00:14:56.841 --> 00:15:01.370
you when you go down to the,
um,
to the,
to the amyloid center this afternoon.

208
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.910
So the magnetic fields are very strong.

209
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:09.680
Anybody had an MR image taken Wilma?
Yup.

210
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.720
Several of you.
Um,
and so it was a device might not look exactly like this,

211
00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:17.540
but look,
something like this.
So this looks similar to the,

212
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.570
to the cat scanner I showed you last time.

213
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.560
And that there is an instrument with a,
uh,

214
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.580
basically a big cylinder with a cylindrical hole in the middle.
And this,

215
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.700
uh,
this whole,
this is where the patient is going to go.

216
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.380
The patient will be lying,
uh,
on this,
uh,
on this,
uh,
cart.

217
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.680
And this will act like a conveyor belt that will move the patient inside the

218
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:46.040
cylinder.
And,
um,
it's,
it's close fitting.

219
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.910
You don't want the size of the cylinder to be too far away from the patient

220
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:54.410
because you want the magnetic field forces and the radio waves that are emitted

221
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.220
by the ions.
And you're by the atoms in your body to be very close to the,
uh,

222
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.350
to the detectors that are measuring it.
And because of this,
when you're inside,

223
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.440
uh,
many people,
I don't Wilmette did you experience this?

224
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:10.340
You feel claustrophobic when you're inside the machine because you're in a very

225
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:13.850
confined space and the images take some time to acquire.

226
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.160
So the quality of the image depends on the strength of the magnetic field and

227
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:22.100
how long you acquire the image.

228
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:27.160
If you have more time to wait,
you can get a better image,
right?

229
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.850
And so there's a trade off between building magnets that are incredibly strong,

230
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.880
which is very expensive and a time for the patient to be inside the instrument,

231
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.510
to acquire an image that has a high quality.

232
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.570
So surrounding this,

233
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.600
a cylinder are coils and coils many miles of coils of wire and uh,

234
00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.920
electrical field electricity passes through these wires in order to create a big

235
00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.450
electromagnet.
And large magnetic fields within this,
uh,

236
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.450
machine.

237
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.800
Now the other thing about the machine is that the operator can control the

238
00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:08.720
strength of the magnetic fields.

239
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.200
It can control stimulation of the object with radio frequency waves and it can

240
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:19.070
control what radio frequency signals it picks up from the object as well.

241
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:21.710
And one of the advantages of Mr,

242
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.280
we'll see a little bit more about this as we go through the physics is that it

243
00:17:25.281 --> 00:17:26.300
can be tuned.

244
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.100
You can tune the imaging method in order to look at the kinds of things that you

245
00:17:31.101 --> 00:17:33.800
would like to look at.
Okay.

246
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.880
And that turns out to be one of the powerful things about Mr. So people are

247
00:17:37.881 --> 00:17:42.881
still discovering new ways to look at the resonance between the magnetic field

248
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.500
and its effect on Adams and the radio frequencies that are generated to learn

249
00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:52.800
how to make new kinds of images.
And we'll talk about some of that as we go.

250
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:58.300
So the magnetic resonance that's most done in people for clinical imaging,
uh,

251
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.610
takes advantage of the fact that our bodies are largely water and all those

252
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:07.200
water molecules have hydrogen atoms associated with them.

253
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.330
And so there's a lot of hydrogen in your body and hydrogen atoms are susceptible

254
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.450
to magnetic resonance and they so because they contain this dipole moment that

255
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:19.950
will align in the magnetic field.

256
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.300
And so what happens in magnetic residence is that you're placed in a very large

257
00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:25.200
magnetic field.

258
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.620
Many of the hydrogen nuclei in the molecules within your body align with this

259
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.010
magnetic field.

260
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.520
And then the machine sort of tips those aligned molecules out of alignment.

261
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.280
And if that's done properly,
you will start a kind of motion in these molecules,

262
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:50.820
what's called a procession where the molecules move like a top.

263
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.200
And when they are performing this kind of motion within the magnetic field,

264
00:18:55.201 --> 00:18:57.750
they're trying to get back to their preferred alignment.

265
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.710
But they're doing that in this top like fashion.
If you have many,

266
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:06.360
many atoms that are all processing in the right way,

267
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.070
they will emit radio frequency waves that you can detect in this cylinder

268
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:11.904
outside.

269
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.320
So this shows it sort of schematically you have Adam's inside your body.

270
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.930
These are,
these are a hydrogen atoms,
for example.

271
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:27.110
You place the body within a strong magnetic field and these atoms align so that

272
00:19:27.271 --> 00:19:30.720
they're parallel with the magnetic field,
which is going from top to bottom.

273
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:35.640
Here you stimulate these atoms with radio frequency waves and you knock them out

274
00:19:35.641 --> 00:19:36.474
of alignment.

275
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:40.650
Now you can't just stimulate them with any radio frequency wave.

276
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.680
That radio frequency wave has to be exactly right for the Adams that you want to

277
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.670
move.
It has to be,
uh,

278
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:52.200
has to be radio waves that are at the correct frequency or wavelength to

279
00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:56.370
stimulate these particular,
these particular atoms.

280
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.620
And that's one of the things that makes mrs so,

281
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:02.730
so versatile in that if you stimulate them with one frequency,

282
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.510
you can manipulate hydrogen atoms.

283
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.910
If you stimulate them with another frequency,

284
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.750
you can stimulate other Adams.

285
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.820
Now the reason why most of the images you'll see are based on protons or

286
00:20:17.821 --> 00:20:22.821
hydrogen nuclei is because hydrogen is so much more abundant than everything

287
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.550
else in your body.
And so you get a good signal with that.

288
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.750
If you are stimulating other kinds of atoms,
you wouldn't get as strong a signal.

289
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.060
You wouldn't be able to make as good an image.
Okay.

290
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.150
So you stimulate these atoms with the radio frequency.

291
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.330
They begin this motion or this procession,
and this just,

292
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.950
this just shows schematically that this procession is like a top,

293
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.190
they're out of alignment,
the,
the,

294
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.070
the nuclear rotating and they're eventually coming back to their equilibrium

295
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:53.830
position,
which would be aligned with the magnet again.

296
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.190
And so what you measure in the,
uh,

297
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.220
in the Lmr device is this relaxation from the excited or tipped position,

298
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.090
relaxing back to their equilibrium or aligned position.
Now,
if you go on,

299
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.280
if any of you go on to study quantum mechanics or you try to study the physics

300
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:19.260
of medical imaging,
particularly Mr in more detail,
you'll,
uh,

301
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.500
you'll learn that this,

302
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.660
this simple description I gave you is not entirely accurate.
It's,
uh,

303
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:30.340
it's,
it's,
it,
it's not inaccurate,
but it doesn't describe the whole thing.

304
00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:34.750
It's really a quantum mechanics phenomenon that's happening with the molecules

305
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:38.620
here.
And it can't be described completely unless you have the sort of tools of

306
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:40.690
quantum physics to describe it.

307
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.880
But this is a sufficient way of thinking about,
uh,
the,
what's going on in here.

308
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:51.160
So what you measured then is the relaxation of these excited molecules back to

309
00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:52.360
their align state.

310
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.020
And you can measure that because as these molecules are processing,

311
00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:00.580
they're emitting radio frequency radiation,
which you can detect now.

312
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.780
So this involves magnetic fields,
strong magnetic fields.

313
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.780
It involves radio frequency radiation,

314
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.660
the kind of radiation that uh,

315
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.250
that radio stations used to broadcast signals that are picked up by antennas,

316
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.030
right?

317
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:21.030
And so these are generally presumed to be safe for biological tissues.

318
00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:26.220
There is no ill effects that we know of,
have exposure to,
uh,

319
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.880
to exposure to magnetic fields or radio frequency radiation at these
wavelengths.

320
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.320
And so it doesn't have the same concerns that x ray radiation or other kinds of

321
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:37.900
radiation,
which I'll talk about a few minutes have.

322
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.630
So this is some examples of Mr Images.

323
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:45.640
These are Mr images that are taken at different locations in the,
in the brain.

324
00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.480
And remember now that the patient is being,

325
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:54.810
is being conveyed on this table into the core of the instrument.

326
00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.850
And measurements are made only on the part of the body that's inside the

327
00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:03.400
instrument.
And so just like in CT image,

328
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:08.350
you move the patient through and you take images of different slices through the

329
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:10.720
patient.
Right now if,
uh,

330
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.950
if the patient is having a,
uh,

331
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.450
a brain or a head Mr Scan,

332
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.410
you would just put them in until you went through this part of the body.

333
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.540
If you're doing it in the abdomen or the leg,

334
00:23:22.541 --> 00:23:25.840
you would just scan that part of the body.
And this shows,

335
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.150
this shows then images,

336
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:32.980
transverse images at various locations.
Moving down,

337
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.180
this is,
this is a near the top of the head.
This is a little further down.

338
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.560
You can see the ventricles,

339
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.830
I think actually these two images might be the s from the same location,

340
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:46.220
but they show you one of the features of Mr that is by looking at different

341
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:50.930
relaxations or stimulating with different pulses of radio frequency,

342
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.840
you can see different kinds of contrast.

343
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.220
So in this image you can see more clearly the distinction between gray matter

344
00:23:58.221 --> 00:24:02.000
and white matter.
In this image,
you don't see that so clearly,

345
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.990
but you see better the distinction between brain tissue and the cerebral spinal

346
00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:09.530
fluid that's in the ventricles.
So the,
the,

347
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:11.030
the point is that the,

348
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:15.230
that the technique can be tuned to see what you would like to see best.

349
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:19.130
Right.
And then going farther down in the brain,

350
00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:22.070
you see now you're seeing some of the bones of the,

351
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:27.100
of the face and the cerebellum back here or a lower section of the brain.

352
00:24:27.471 --> 00:24:31.460
So this is a section probably from somewhere in here and this is even lower down

353
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.650
than that.
Okay.

354
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.570
So these are just examples of some magnetic residence images.
As I mentioned,

355
00:24:38.571 --> 00:24:42.320
magnetic residence is not so good at looking at bone because bone doesn't have a

356
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:44.900
lot of water in it.
It doesn't have a lot of,

357
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.910
so it doesn't contribute a lot of signal,

358
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.330
but it's very good for looking at differences between soft tissues.

359
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.540
And remember in CT soft tissues like the muscular wall of the heart and the

360
00:24:56.421 --> 00:25:01.421
blood that's inside the heart look roughly the same and you can't distinguish

361
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:02.421
those.

362
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:07.220
Well there's not intrinsic contrast with Mr. There is intrinsic contrast because

363
00:25:07.221 --> 00:25:11.180
those prop,
the properties of those different tissues are,
are different.
Uh,

364
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.073
by this method.

365
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.880
A newer form of magnetic resonance imaging is called a functional Mri imaging

366
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:23.120
and it uses the same machine.
It uses the same approach,

367
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.300
but instead of designing your radio frequency pulses so that you look at the

368
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:31.250
static structure,

369
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:36.260
you design it so that you're particularly sensitive for looking at flowing blood

370
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.480
and uh,

371
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:43.481
and you can actually measure the velocity of blood flow in different regions of

372
00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:44.720
the brain.

373
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.160
Now you can do that because blood contains a lot of water and this is water

374
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:54.020
that's not static,
just staying in one place in the brain,

375
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:58.790
but it's moving through blood vessels and you can detect the motion of the blood

376
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:00.920
vessels with this,
uh,
with this technique,

377
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.600
it can also tell the difference between saturated and de Saturated blood.

378
00:26:05.601 --> 00:26:09.680
What saturated blood here,
I mean blood that's saturated with oxygen.

379
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.460
So it's loaded up with oxygen,
desaturated blood,

380
00:26:13.461 --> 00:26:15.410
his blood that's had the oxygen removed.

381
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.520
Now if you can measure blood flow and you can measure differences between

382
00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:21.920
saturated and desaturated blood,

383
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.160
that means that you can monitor within a small region of tissue how much blood

384
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:31.460
flow is going through,
how much oxygen is being consumed,

385
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:37.100
so you can measure locally what's the rate of oxygen consumption in a tissue.

386
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.920
Now,
if you know oxygen consumption,

387
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.800
then you know something about metabolic activity in that tissue.

388
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.280
A region of tissue that's consuming a lot of oxygen is doing a lot of work right

389
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:55.440
in the brain.
If you find regions of tissue that are consuming oxygen,

390
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.340
that means those are regions of tissue where there's a lot of energy being

391
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.900
consumed.
Those are regions of tissue where there's a lot of neural activity,

392
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.920
a lot of brain cells doing what brain cells do,
right?

393
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:12.990
So it's called functional Mri imaging.
Because through this approach,

394
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.720
one can look inside the brain,
for example,

395
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.410
and find regions that are performing functions.

396
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.120
So an experiment that,
well,
the other thing about Fmr I,

397
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:28.110
before I talk about the experiment is that instead of just looking at anatomy,

398
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:32.480
now this is a high resolution picture of the anatomy of brain and Fmr.

399
00:27:32.481 --> 00:27:33.780
I images fuzzier.

400
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.340
You don't have as high a resolution and that's because you want to take images

401
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:41.400
fast.
You want to take images fast,

402
00:27:41.401 --> 00:27:43.950
you don't want to wait a long time and you want to be see,

403
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:48.520
you want to see how the image changes with time,
right?

404
00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.530
In a static image.
When they took a picture of Wilma for example,

405
00:27:52.531 --> 00:27:56.040
they kept her inside the machine for awhile so that they could get a really high

406
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:59.820
resolution image of the structure in her brain,

407
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.600
but she was asked to remain very still because you don't want to have any
motion.

408
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.120
You want just a picture of the statics and Fmr.
I you,

409
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.940
you want to take a picture faster,

410
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
but then you want to look at how it changes with time because it's these changes

411
00:28:14.281 --> 00:28:18.300
in time that allow you to look at things like oxygen consumption.

412
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.080
You have to look over time in order to measure that,
right?

413
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.480
So in an Fmri,
in one kind of FM Ri imaging,

414
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.130
you look at blood oxygen level,
that's a measure of neural activity.

415
00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.000
When blood oxygen goes up,
a neural activity goes up,

416
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.870
the extraction of oxygen goes up and the I signal goes up.

417
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.480
So here's an example of an Fmri image and actually the,

418
00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:49.740
the Fmr images and shown here,
the FMRI image would be a blurry one,

419
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:51.840
like the one I showed you in the last slide.

420
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.950
But you might find regions where there's high levels of activity,

421
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.660
high levels of activity,

422
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.800
and you were in super impose those on a static image of that same brain.

423
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.750
So here are two kinds of imaging were done.
One was the high resolution,

424
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:11.751
Mr Imaging to get a picture of the anatomy and then this more rapid time

425
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.620
sequence of images to find out where oxygen consumption was occurring.

426
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:21.360
And what was discovered was that oxygen consumption is occurring in this

427
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:25.930
location here and this location here,
and this is known to be a,

428
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:26.760
uh,

429
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.760
a certain area of the brain called Broca's area that's involved in a speech.

430
00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.380
Um,
I don't remember whether it's in,
in,
um,

431
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.770
in hearing and decoding speech or in producing speech.

432
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:42.610
I think in hearing and decoding speech,

433
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:45.910
but I don't remember in this particular example,

434
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.490
mixed speech was,
uh,
was,
uh,

435
00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.940
while the patient was being image,

436
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:57.030
they were being exposed to a speech that included a mixture of languages,

437
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.480
both Spanish and English.
In this picture,

438
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.190
they were only listening to Spanish.

439
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.740
In this picture there were only listening to English.

440
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:11.680
And what you see is that when they're the mixed under the mixed condition,

441
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:13.300
when they're hearing both Spanish and English,

442
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:17.440
there's a certain portion of the brain that's more active than it is with only

443
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:20.590
Spanish and only English.
And from this you could,

444
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:25.591
can conclude that this part of the brain must be involved somehow in the special

445
00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:29.020
activity that was happening at this point here.

446
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:34.270
That is some kind of a mixed language experience and many,
many,

447
00:30:34.271 --> 00:30:35.200
this is this.

448
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:40.260
As you could extrapolate from this and you could imagine that this approach

449
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.800
where you could look at what areas of the brain become active during certain

450
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:46.210
sorts of activities,

451
00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:51.250
certain sorts of behavior when certain emotions are elicited has become a very

452
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:53.110
powerful tool in psychology.

453
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.890
So you can do psychological experiments while patients are getting Fmri scans

454
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.690
and you can find out what parts of the brain are involved in that kind of

455
00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:06.190
psychological response.

456
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:10.210
And so this imaging is teaching us a lot more than just what is the normal

457
00:31:10.211 --> 00:31:13.360
structure of tissue in this case the brain looks like,

458
00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:17.830
but how does it really work in a functioning animal like a person.

459
00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.810
So that's a very brief introduction to,
to,
to Mr Imaging.

460
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:24.640
There's a lot more to learn about this.

461
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.210
You'll learn more about this and you'll see some of these instruments this

462
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.990
afternoon.
And um,
and uh,
there's more detail in the book as well.

463
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.280
A second kind of imaging which shares and advantage with Mr with Mr in that it

464
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:44.251
does not involve a ionizing radiation is ultrasound imaging and ultrasound

465
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:50.521
imaging is different from the others we've talked about in that there is no

466
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.500
electromagnetic radiation involved.

467
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:58.720
You're not using light or different forms of light.
Here.

468
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:03.721
You're using sound to create images in stead and sound is pressure waves that

469
00:32:05.201 --> 00:32:08.380
transmit through a medium.
When I'm talking up here,

470
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.330
my vocal apparatus is creating waves of pressure in the air which get

471
00:32:13.331 --> 00:32:15.750
transmitted through the room,
right?

472
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:20.470
And you can understand them because the waves of preset pressure that I'm

473
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:25.471
creating stimulate your eardrums at the right frequencies and you convert that

474
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:28.840
into sound.
Ultrasound uses much,

475
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:33.160
much higher frequencies of sound than our ears can detect,
right?

476
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:37.490
So we detect,
I forget exactly what the range is,
but up to,
um,

477
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.640
up to I think 40,000 hertz or,

478
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:42.860
or cycles per second is the frequency.

479
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.750
And this is in the megahertz range or millions of hertz range.

480
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.470
So it's,
it's higher frequency sounds.
Then you can hear.

481
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:57.100
So some have very short of these,
uh,
of these,
uh,

482
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:03.370
of these high frequency sound waves have very a short wave lengths and so they

483
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:08.681
can penetrate through tissues and ultrasound allows for good imaging of

484
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:12.830
anatomical structure and it's also a fast imaging method.

485
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.280
And so it can allow you to look at motion in ways that are difficult to do using

486
00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:21.530
some of these other techniques.
And I'll,
I'll tell you about that.

487
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:26.480
So the way that ultrasound works is you have to get sound waves propagated into

488
00:33:26.481 --> 00:33:30.200
the body and you do that through a special device called an ultrasound

489
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:34.550
transducer and the transducer is placed right on the surface of your body.

490
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:35.780
It might look like a cylinder,

491
00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:40.730
like a probe that's placed against the surface of your body and usually not even

492
00:33:40.731 --> 00:33:42.590
just placed against the surface of your body,

493
00:33:42.591 --> 00:33:47.591
but it's placed with some kind of a gel or a liquid gel such that the probe

494
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:52.460
comes in very good contact with your skin.

495
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:58.390
And that's because sound waves don't transmit very easily across interfaces,

496
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.950
right?
If I put something up between my voice and you then,

497
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.490
then the sound waves don't transmit as well,
right?
You can't hear it.

498
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.490
Sound waves bounce off interfaces.

499
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:15.440
So you want to get the sound to go into the skin,
you have to put the transducer,

500
00:34:15.441 --> 00:34:18.230
which is producing the sound waves right up against the skin,

501
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:22.970
and you don't want a gap of air in between.
And that's why you put the Gel.
Okay?

502
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:27.290
Now this transducer has a special material in it that's called a pizo electric

503
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:28.603
material.

504
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.600
And Pizo Electric materials have the property that if you put a voltage through

505
00:34:32.601 --> 00:34:36.200
them,
they,
they,
they resonate or they physically move.

506
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.350
And in addition,

507
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:43.160
if you stimulate a pas electric material with a,

508
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:47.420
with a moving wave,
it will,
it will,
it will create a voltage.

509
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.820
So voltages get transmitted into movements.
And in this transducer,

510
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.650
the movement gets transmitted into sound way is what produces the sound waves

511
00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:01.160
that get transmitted into your skin and through your body.

512
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:07.210
The transmit because these pizo electric materials can both can both form sound

513
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.740
when they're stimulated and they can detect sound and converted into

514
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.770
electricity.
When they're stimulated by sound,

515
00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.780
then the transducer is both sending out sound waves and receiving sound waves

516
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:25.460
back,
right?

517
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:30.970
So these work basically by the same principle that an that an echo works.

518
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.550
If I,
if I shout

519
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:40.770
in the right kind of a room where there's nothing to absorb the sound between me

520
00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:42.630
and the back wall,
the sound,

521
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:46.830
we'll hit the back wall and it will be reflected back to me and I will hear that

522
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:49.410
sound some time interval later.

523
00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.050
But you've all had the experience of hearing an echo.

524
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.720
The same thing happens here.

525
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:59.900
You transmit sound into the skin and it moves forward until it hits an interface

526
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.730
and sound doesn't move so well across interfaces,
right?

527
00:36:05.731 --> 00:36:08.580
So a moose to your skin and it goes down and it hits the bone.

528
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:12.360
There's an interface between materials here that have two different properties,

529
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.560
skin,
muscle,
bone,
and in each one of those interfaces,

530
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:18.300
some of the sound bounces back.

531
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:23.280
And since the detector is most sending sound and receiving sound,

532
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.970
it sends out a sound wave and then it gets the sound back and it can determine

533
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:33.450
how long it took for the sound to come back.
Right?

534
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:39.410
If I know the speed of sound and I know how long it took for an echo to return,

535
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:45.320
I can calculate how far away the object was that created the echo or the

536
00:36:45.721 --> 00:36:47.520
interference.
Right?

537
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:53.150
So ultrasound works by sending out sound waves that bounce back are received and

538
00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:59.070
the machine calculates how long it took for this echo to go out and come back.

539
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.750
And then it knows there must've been some kind of an object at that distance

540
00:37:03.751 --> 00:37:06.600
away.
Does that make sense?

541
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:11.910
So ultrasound mesh creates echo time maps and,

542
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.280
and calculates depths from that.

543
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

544
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.430
<v 0>I'm sorry,
I'm having lots of technical issues today.</v>

545
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

546
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:33.323
<v 0>Something happened,
right?</v>

547
00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:38.040
So here's an ultrasound image of the heart and it's the heart turned upside
down.

548
00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:42.600
So this is,
this is vaguely familiar to you from from a few weeks ago,

549
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.190
but um,
the um,

550
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.690
the atria are on the top and the event or the [inaudible] on the bottom and the

551
00:37:48.691 --> 00:37:49.920
ventricles are on the top.

552
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.700
And that's just to show you it in alignment with this image here.

553
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.930
And so the probe is placed on the chest for example,

554
00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.840
and it's moved from side to side at one location.

555
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:05.250
And so what you see is an image of what the probe can see as it moves,

556
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.280
as it sort of sweeps out this cone where the sound is moving and what you see is

557
00:38:10.381 --> 00:38:14.760
that there are boundaries between light and dark regions here and those

558
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:19.680
correspond to boundaries in the tissue.
And so you can see the right atrium,

559
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.810
you can see the right ventricle.

560
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:25.230
Over here you can see the left atrium and the left ventricle because the white

561
00:38:25.231 --> 00:38:30.060
region is the muscular tissue of the heart and the darker region is the blood

562
00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:34.830
that's within the heart.
Now you'll notice that it's kind of a,

563
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.990
it's not a sharp image like the images that I showed you with CT or the images

564
00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:44.980
that I showed you with Mr. It's a noisier image and there are,

565
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.710
there's a lot of sort of white spots or dark spots,

566
00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:51.220
spots throughout it and those are things that are called speckles.

567
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.930
These are talked about in your book,

568
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:56.530
but there are random sources of,

569
00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.880
of interference with the ultrasound image.

570
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:07.210
The reason why ultrasound is useful is because you can watch things with time

571
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.710
and so you can see motion in static pictures.
It looks like a very noisy image.

572
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.780
But if you are watching this in real time,

573
00:39:13.781 --> 00:39:18.430
you would see the motion of the heart and the speckles wouldn't be as obvious

574
00:39:18.431 --> 00:39:22.020
because you'd be noticing more how the walls of this,
uh,

575
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.090
of the ventricle move for example,
in time.

576
00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.820
And that would be very clear from the image.

577
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:31.900
What would also be clear to you is the motion of the valves.

578
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:36.310
And we talked about the very critical role that valves play in the function of

579
00:39:36.311 --> 00:39:38.500
your heart.
If your valves aren't working right,

580
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:40.300
you can't make an efficient heartbeat.

581
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.180
That is a heartbeat that produces a cardiac output.

582
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.470
And so and so ultrasound imaging has been one of the,

583
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:52.530
one of the most used tools for looking at valve disease in that event it's

584
00:39:53.711 --> 00:39:57.820
called Echo cardiography.
You ever heard of that term?
Echocardiography,

585
00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:02.140
which is basically ultrasound of the heart and it's used principally to look at

586
00:40:02.141 --> 00:40:06.280
the function of your valve,
the mitral valve and tricuspid valve here.

587
00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.840
If this was a video image,

588
00:40:07.841 --> 00:40:11.830
you would see the valance opening and closing in correct coordination,

589
00:40:11.831 --> 00:40:16.660
hopefully with the contraction of the heart.
So ultrasound allows you to,

590
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:20.460
to,
to look at motion and so to see things that are moving,
uh,

591
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.120
that would be difficult to do with other techniques.
You also know,

592
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.580
and probably all of you in this room have,
were,

593
00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.870
were pictures were taken of you when you were in utero.

594
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:37.260
And ultrasound imaging is a very common form of fetal monitoring.

595
00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:38.104
Now,
uh,

596
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.160
where almost every woman who is pregnant has at least one ultrasound image taken

597
00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:47.470
at some course during the pregnancy just to make sure that the pregnancy is

598
00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:51.760
proceeding properly.
And this is an example of an ultrasound image.

599
00:40:51.761 --> 00:40:54.250
It looks the same way and ultrasound image of an infant.

600
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.840
This is the kind of machine,

601
00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.030
the ultrasound imaging machine that you might find in,
in,
in obstetrics,

602
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.690
uh,
um,
office.
And,
uh,

603
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:07.090
you can see in this particular case that,
uh,

604
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:12.130
here's the head of the fetus.
Here's an arm,
here's the torso.

605
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.800
Again,
it's not a very sharp image.
Uh,

606
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:20.880
but if you were watching this in real time as the technician move the probe

607
00:41:21.041 --> 00:41:24.760
around on the pregnant woman's abdomen,
you would see the,

608
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:29.650
the baby moving and you would be able to distinguish parts much more easily in

609
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:33.350
that way because you're moving both the probe and the baby's moving and you're

610
00:41:33.351 --> 00:41:37.130
seeing things from different angles in real time as it's happening.

611
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:41.150
So this is a very,
a common technique.
I wouldn't be surprised if many of you,

612
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.420
if you don't have a picture of yourself in Utero,
in your scrapbook,

613
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:49.660
probably your mother has one somewhere.
Um,
all,
uh,
infants,
uh,

614
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.460
of your age where,
uh,
where we're ultrasound.

615
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.230
Ultrasound is also a good technique for looking at flow.

616
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.610
And when you look at flow,

617
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:03.320
you're taking advantage of something called the doppler effect and you've in

618
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:06.040
physics probably heard about the doppler effect.
Uh,

619
00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.470
a simple way of thinking about it as if you're standing on the street and

620
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.220
there's,
uh,

621
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:14.150
there's an ambulance coming towards you or a car that's coming towards you and

622
00:42:14.151 --> 00:42:17.180
the horn is honking.
As the car is approaching you,

623
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:22.270
you hear a certain frequency of sound that changes as the car passes.

624
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.440
The frequency of the sound that you hear depends both on the frequency of the

625
00:42:27.441 --> 00:42:31.640
sound that's being emitted by the siren and the speed that the ambulance is

626
00:42:31.641 --> 00:42:35.270
moving relative to you.
So when the,

627
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.520
when the ambulance is moving towards you,

628
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.690
you hear a frequency that's offset from the real frequency of the siren.

629
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.910
What's moving away from you?
It's offset even more.
Right?

630
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:49.790
And you can hear that.
And so if I'm doing ultrasound imaging,

631
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.990
imaging with sound waves of an object that's moving away from the probe,

632
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:59.770
I can detect both where it is and how fast it's moving by the frequency of the

633
00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:03.230
signal that's returned to the probe.

634
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.110
<v 1>Okay.</v>

635
00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:09.130
<v 0>And that allows you to image the rate of blood flow through vessels.</v>

636
00:43:09.131 --> 00:43:11.800
And that's shown in this picture here.

637
00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.610
So you can measure the rate of blood flow through the carotid arteries,

638
00:43:15.611 --> 00:43:16.444
for example.

639
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:20.520
And that turns out to be a very useful technique for patients that have a

640
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.390
cerebrovascular disease.

641
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:27.550
They're getting atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries in the important

642
00:43:27.551 --> 00:43:31.390
vessels going up to their neck that can be measured through their neck,

643
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:34.660
up to their brain.
That can be measured using ultrasound.

644
00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:36.210
<v 1>Okay.</v>

645
00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.700
<v 0>Okay.
So those two methods,</v>

646
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.760
magnetic resonance ultrasound have the big advantage that,
um,

647
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:45.120
that they don't involve ionizing radiation.

648
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.510
Magnetic resonance imaging in general takes a long time,

649
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.640
requires very expensive equipment.

650
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:55.410
Ultrasound imaging can be done in real time.
You can take pictures,

651
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.110
images of the inside rapidly.
The,

652
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:01.260
the equipment is not so expensive.

653
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:05.880
So any doctor's office can have an ultrasound machine.
Um,

654
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.740
the image quality is not as high,
but you can image things that are in motion,

655
00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:15.300
right?
So there's,
so these,
these imaging,
uh,
uh,

656
00:44:15.301 --> 00:44:19.500
approaches are used for different applications because of the advantages that

657
00:44:19.501 --> 00:44:20.400
each one has.

658
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.070
<v 1>Okay.</v>

659
00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:27.270
<v 0>I want to talk briefly about nuclear medicine and I'm going to have to go</v>

660
00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.110
fast here.
Uh,
about nuclear.

661
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.910
And this does use a form of ionizing radiation.
In particular gamma rays.

662
00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:41.580
Gamma rays are produced by nuclear events events inside the nucleus.

663
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:46.500
In particular,
they happen when radioactive isotopes decay.

664
00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.420
When radioactive isotopes,
like a xenon one 33,

665
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:54.450
technetium 99,
iodine one 2023.

666
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.510
These are unstable isotopes of these molecules.

667
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:59.640
And so with a certain frequency,

668
00:44:59.641 --> 00:45:04.080
they will decay back to their more stable form.
When they decay,

669
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.430
they emit a form of radiation called gamma radiation.

670
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:12.720
Many of these and gamma rays,
you remember on the electromagnetic spectrum,

671
00:45:12.721 --> 00:45:15.780
they were up there with x rays.
High frequency,

672
00:45:15.781 --> 00:45:19.500
short wavelength radiation penetrates easily through tissue,

673
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.740
but is also an example of ionizing radiation.

674
00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:27.980
Now the difference between nuclear medicine and what's called nuclear medicine

675
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.770
and conventional x rays is in x-rays.

676
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:37.040
The X ray source was outside of you and you were being bombarded with x rays in

677
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:39.750
nuclear medicine.
The Ex,
the,

678
00:45:39.751 --> 00:45:42.840
the gamma ray source is injected inside of you.

679
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:46.740
And what you measure is the amount of radiation that comes out.

680
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.230
Now what's the advantage of that?
Well,

681
00:45:49.231 --> 00:45:54.231
the advantage is if I can find radio isotopes that concentrate in certain

682
00:45:55.231 --> 00:46:00.231
regions of your body and I inject those isotopes into you and then measure where

683
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:05.130
they are,
I can measure the function of that particular region of your body.

684
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.370
And the first imaging that was done was done in the thyroid.

685
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:12.360
And your thyroid actually has a very,
uh,

686
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:15.570
active mechanism for concentrating iodine.

687
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:17.760
And because of that,

688
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:21.840
if I feed somebody radioactive iodine,

689
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:26.520
that iodide will accumulate in their thyroid gland,
which is in your neck.

690
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.400
And the rate at which it accumulates.

691
00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:33.300
And the pattern at which it accumulates can indicate whether you have a healthy

692
00:46:33.301 --> 00:46:35.220
or a or a disease,
thyroid.

693
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:40.430
And if I then take images of the thyroid after I've injected the radioactivity

694
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:44.340
and I looked to see if the radio activities there and how fast it gets there and

695
00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:46.200
how fast your body removes it,

696
00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:50.100
then I can learn something about how your thyroid is functioning because of its

697
00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:52.350
ability to concentrate iodine.

698
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:55.530
That's one example of it,

699
00:46:55.830 --> 00:47:00.360
but imagine you have a chemical that accumulates in the brain and accumulates

700
00:47:00.361 --> 00:47:02.880
only in certain areas.
For example,
you have a,

701
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:08.030
you have a chemical that's related to the neurotransmitter dopamine and you give

702
00:47:08.101 --> 00:47:12.510
it to a patient that you suspect of having Parkinson's disease or Parkinson's

703
00:47:12.511 --> 00:47:16.740
disease involves the brain neurons that process and use dopamine.

704
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.070
And so if this radio chemical goes up into the brain,

705
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.780
it's going to interact with those cells that are involved in Parkinson's
disease.

706
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.230
By watching how this molecule moves around in the brain,

707
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:33.410
I can learn about how your brain is processing dopamine and if it's responding

708
00:47:33.941 --> 00:47:37.750
in a normal sort of way.
Right?
Does that make sense?

709
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:42.340
So the advantage of nuclear medicine is that you're designing very specific

710
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:46.360
kinds of radioactive molecules that you can put into the body.

711
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:51.400
The molecules are designed to eliminate some kind of biological function,

712
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.480
not structure.

713
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:56.680
And then I measure the time course of how those objects,

714
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.800
how those radio labeled compounds move through your body.

715
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:03.640
Um,
there are several ways of measuring it.

716
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:07.990
I'm just going to show you the simple one here.
Um,
not simple one,

717
00:48:07.991 --> 00:48:12.970
but a very powerful one called positron emission tomography.
And here the,
uh,

718
00:48:12.971 --> 00:48:17.290
the chemical that's admitted is a special radio isot tro tope that emits not

719
00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:22.010
gamma rays but,
but another.
Um,
but another,
uh,
um,

720
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.710
nuclear,
another particle called a positron.
And when positrons are admitted,

721
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.500
they will move through tissue until they hit an electron.

722
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:32.140
But positive trends don't have to move very far.

723
00:48:32.141 --> 00:48:34.660
There's lots of electrons around in a,

724
00:48:34.661 --> 00:48:37.870
in tissues and win a positron hits an electron,

725
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.700
they annihilate one another and they generate to gamma rays which move in

726
00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:47.560
opposite directions.
And so if I have a positron emitting substance in the brain,

727
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:52.090
it will emit gamma rays,
which can be detected.

728
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:55.150
And because I'm detecting one here and one here,

729
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.450
I know exactly where the source came from.
Right?

730
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:02.110
I can trace it back along the lines where I detected the gamma rays and I can

731
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:05.650
find out where the positron emitting element was.

732
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.860
And so I can make very nice maps of the brain like these that show you where the

733
00:49:11.531 --> 00:49:15.130
positron emitting isotope accumulates in the brain.

734
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:19.390
And this is called pet imaging.
Um,

735
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.500
I'm going to skip over this one which tells you a little bit about the economics

736
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:26.410
of these different modalities.
Ultrasound,
as I mentioned,

737
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:31.411
was cheaper CT cost more Mr in general costs more pet imaging costs even more

738
00:49:32.321 --> 00:49:36.580
because you have to generate radio isotopes locally at the source too.

739
00:49:36.581 --> 00:49:40.240
And so in general you need a cyclotron or some kind of a machine to generate

740
00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:41.770
these radio isotopes as well.

741
00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.770
And there are other things you have to think about if you're thinking about,
uh,

742
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:49.360
installing these is how much do they cost to operate and how,
um,
how,
um,

743
00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.710
how much does it cost to operate,
how,

744
00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:56.080
how heavily do technicians have to be involved in order to keep them working?

745
00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:59.230
The last thing I want to talk about his optical imaging.

746
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.030
And as I mentioned last time,

747
00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:03.940
I think that during your lifetime we're gonna see a lot new,

748
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:07.420
a PR of new approaches for using light to image inside the body.

749
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.570
That's a problem,
right?
Because light doesn't penetrate through your body.

750
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:13.600
It bounces off,
most of it bounces off.

751
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:16.750
And that's why we can see each other because we're seeing the reflected light

752
00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:21.690
off of a different objects.
Uh,
but uh,
but uh,
but you can use,
um,

753
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.530
you can use a light to look at biological objects and you can look at them in

754
00:50:26.531 --> 00:50:29.060
great detail this way.
And that's what microscopes do.

755
00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:34.240
They allow you to use light radiation in order to look at magnified images of a

756
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.100
biological objects.

757
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:42.280
And we've gotten very good at designing microscopes that allow us to look at in

758
00:50:42.621 --> 00:50:46.670
very sophisticated ways that biological objects on the stage of a microscope.

759
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.480
And this just shows you an image.
It's actually very similar to the,

760
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.990
to the CT scans or Mri Scans I showed you before.

761
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:58.370
And that these are different optical sections taken from a pollen grain.

762
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:02.570
Appalling grain is very small,
right?
But,
and here's an image from the bottom,

763
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.760
moving up,
moving up,
moving up.

764
00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.870
This shows you all the three dimensional detail of this particular,
uh,

765
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:09.733
pollen grain.

766
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.860
You can reconstruct in three dimensions and see what it looks like on the

767
00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:16.640
outside or you could look and see what it's like at any point in its interior

768
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:20.750
structure.
We're very sophisticated it using light to make images like this.

769
00:51:20.751 --> 00:51:25.040
Now on microscope stages and one can take very beautiful pictures of biological

770
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:29.180
objects like cells with different kinds of optical techniques.

771
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.420
Here is um,
this is familiar to you.

772
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:36.650
This is a gold medalist and I told you what it [inaudible] was last week,

773
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:40.130
but this shows sort of the tuft of capillaries inside of [inaudible] image by

774
00:51:40.131 --> 00:51:44.870
light microscopy.
Well,
how do I take advantage of this kind of microscopy?

775
00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.720
But look at these kinds of images inside people.
Well,

776
00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:49.040
we don't know how to do that yet,

777
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:52.880
but we do have some technologies for looking at using light to look inside.

778
00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:55.130
And the main one is called endoscopy.

779
00:51:55.310 --> 00:52:00.310
And endoscopy involves objects called fiber optics and fiber optics allow you to

780
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:03.740
not only focus light through a lens,

781
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.930
but to take that light and bounce it down and optical shaft,

782
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:09.681
right?

783
00:52:09.681 --> 00:52:14.681
So I could take a light beam and shine it here into a fiber.

784
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:17.030
That fiber has a special coating on it,

785
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:21.650
which then allows the light to bounce all the way down the,
the uh,

786
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:22.543
the fiber.

787
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:26.840
I can bend the fiber and because the bouncing depends on the coding and not the

788
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:31.730
shape of the fiber,
the light will turn with the fiber,
right?

789
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:35.480
This south fiber optics work is described a little bit more detail in your book.

790
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:40.070
And so one can design devices like this endoscope and this endoscope,

791
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.690
you can look through this end here.

792
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.700
It has a light source and that light source shines through fiber optics that,
uh,

793
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:50.090
that you can bend around and that light comes out the outside.

794
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.370
If the light comes out the outside,

795
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:55.340
it hits some biological object and then bounces back.

796
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:57.080
Light reflects light and you can see it.

797
00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:00.740
And so you can look inside objects where you can put this endoscope.

798
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:04.580
So this end descope is designed to go,
you know,
a patient will swallow it.

799
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:08.810
And so this end will go down in their mouth,

800
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.820
past their vocal cords,
through their esophagus,
into the stomach,

801
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:17.600
and then out of the stomach into the duodenum or the first part of the small

802
00:53:17.601 --> 00:53:20.450
intestine.
And that's what's shown here.
This is the valve,

803
00:53:20.451 --> 00:53:24.290
this leading from the stomach into the duodenum or the first part of the,

804
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.440
of the small intestine.

805
00:53:25.441 --> 00:53:30.090
And you can see what the lining of the small intestine in the stomach looks
like.

806
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.830
And so this has been a very important,
uh,

807
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:36.800
diagnostic approach for using light to image the lining of the stomach.

808
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.770
What would you be looking for?
Things like ulcers,
things like cancers,

809
00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:45.990
any kind of disturbance in the normal anatomy of the,

810
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.760
of the lining of the gut.

811
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000
And I think you're going to see a lot of new methods beyond this for using light

812
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:57.900
to look inside people as well.
I'll stop there.
Thanks.
