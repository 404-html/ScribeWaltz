1
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.380
Today we're going to continue to talk about a cell communication.

2
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.390
And I'm going to talk about,

3
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:22.140
take sort of the general concepts that we talked about last time and talk about

4
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:26.790
how they apply in,
in to,
uh,
to physiological systems,

5
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.540
the nervous system first,
and then the immune system.
And this is a,
uh,

6
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.910
a lead in to what we'll talk about next week.
We're going to start talking about,

7
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.200
um,
about vaccines,
which is really,
um,

8
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.020
really sort of applied immunology,

9
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.260
trying to take a immunological concepts and put them into action or to engineer

10
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:51.750
them in some way.
And so we'll talk about that next time.

11
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.050
So,
um,
what I want to start with the,
uh,
with a nervous system,
and this is a,

12
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:03.000
this is a picture of a neuron.
Um,
this is,

13
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:07.800
this particular neuron has been filled with a fluorescent dye so that it's so

14
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:12.490
that it's colored,
uh,
green.
And I'm using it just to make the point,
uh,

15
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630
which you already know about that.
Uh,

16
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.780
the nervous system is a complex in,

17
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.990
it performs a complex set of functions and it's able to do that because there

18
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.991
are cells like this particular cell that have shapes that are suited to their

19
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:35.460
function.
And in this case,
the shape is there's a cell body in the center here.

20
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:40.461
So this is where the nucleus is and where all the transcription production of

21
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.480
proteins that take place here.
And then around this cell body,
there's,

22
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.510
there's an elaborate set of processes which extend out from the cell body and

23
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:54.690
they go in various directions.
And if you look throughout the nervous system,

24
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.290
you would,

25
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.290
you would find cells that look different in different regions because of where

26
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:01.980
they're situated in the brain.

27
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.260
But they'd all have some of the same features that is a cell body with many

28
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.600
processes that meet in the cell body.

29
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.980
Now what this enables these cells to do is to communicate with very specific

30
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.140
other regions of the nervous system.
So this cell,
wherever it's setting,

31
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.530
what's,
say,
wherever it is positioned within the nervous system,

32
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:27.420
let's say it's in the,
in the Cortex,

33
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.450
some whale where or the the outside surface of the brain is able to communicate

34
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:38.300
with a region of the brain that's in this direction or region in this direction

35
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:43.050
or region in this direction or region in this direction.
And so,
so one way that,

36
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.880
uh,
that neurons in particular are able to communicate with other cells in the

37
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:51.330
nervous system,
share information,
integrate information,

38
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.570
decide what to do next is that they are physically connected to other different

39
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:57.481
cells.

40
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:01.990
And so part of the complexity of the nervous system is the complexity of this

41
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.740
interconnection of cells.
Now,

42
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.610
if we look at this schematically and so again,
this is the schematic.

43
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.100
It doesn't represent any particular,
uh,

44
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.280
particular neuron in the body but just meant to represent as functions that all

45
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:21.610
of them have.
Here is the cell body up at the top of the diagram here.

46
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.550
And you could,
you could distinguish,
uh,

47
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.580
between some properties of these processes that extend out in that most of them

48
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:34.480
are what are called dendrites.
And one of these processes,

49
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.790
especially one is called the Axon.

50
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.140
And the way this cell works as an information processing unit is that the

51
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:49.600
dendrites which extend out in all these different directions are receiving

52
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:54.601
information from other cells which is integrated at the position of the cell

53
00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.640
body.
And then that integrate and then that information,

54
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:05.170
that integrated information is passed on to another cell through the Axon.

55
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.760
And so information flows from the dendrites through the cell body,
uh,

56
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.110
down the Axon.
And uh,

57
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.020
that's what this Arrow at the,
um,

58
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.610
at the right shows the direction of the flow of information.

59
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.150
And we're going to talk in in some detail,
not a very high level of detail,

60
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:30.151
but it's some in some detail about how this communication takes place between

61
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:35.191
cells and how the information is passed down one of these cells,

62
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.570
uh,
today.
So some,
um,
um,

63
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.700
terminology,
some of which I've already given you cell body,
dendrites,

64
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.870
axons.

65
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.990
If this is the particular kind of Axon that is myelinated than it might have,

66
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.960
uh,
uh,
a,
uh,
a,
a layer of,
of a,

67
00:04:56.961 --> 00:05:01.930
a special substance called Myelin,
uh,
in she thing the Axon.

68
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.310
And that just allows information to move more quickly from one end of the cell

69
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:09.850
to the other.
And that can be important because in some cases these,

70
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.710
these processes are very long right there.

71
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.370
There are processes that go from my nervous system,

72
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.440
from my brain and spinal cord out to the,

73
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.710
out to the tips of my fingers that allow me to move muscles.

74
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.090
They are down to your toes.
And so these cells can be many,
many feet long.

75
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.260
These processes can,

76
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:30.421
well the,

77
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:35.421
the mechanism that the cell uses to transmit information along its self along

78
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:39.340
this process,
which goes from my brain to my fingers,
for example,

79
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.900
is through an electrical signal called an action potential.

80
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.100
And we're not going to talk about this in great detail.

81
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:51.970
There's some detail in your book if you go on,
uh,
to take,
uh,

82
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.650
particularly the course that's offered here called physiological systems.

83
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.360
Uh,
you'll learn a lot about action potentials.

84
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.880
And what the mechanisms for generating them are and,

85
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.090
and but I'm only going to say a few words here to sort of uh,

86
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.100
to sort of orient you in the,
the subject.

87
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.300
But all membranes are,
are um,

88
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.830
<v 1>yeah,</v>

89
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.630
<v 0>electrically charged.
They,
they carry a potential that is,</v>

90
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:26.040
if you could,
if you could,
if you had a tiny,
tiny electrical meter and you could,

91
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.190
and you could put one electrode on one side of the cell membrane on the

92
00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:31.920
extracellular side and one on the intracellular side and measure,

93
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.240
you would measure a potential difference and just like a battery,

94
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.890
you'd measure it potential difference.

95
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.240
And that potential difference is generated by the movement of Ions,

96
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.430
principally sodium and potassium across the membrane.
Now sodium,

97
00:06:47.431 --> 00:06:50.400
potassium don't know ordinarily move across membranes,
right?

98
00:06:50.401 --> 00:06:53.130
They're charged molecules.
They can't dissolve,

99
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.440
they can't permeate through a cell membrane,

100
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.670
but they go through because there are channels that allow them to pass through

101
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:00.563
in the membrane.

102
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.860
And so all cell membranes have these channels within them and under their

103
00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:09.090
resting conditions,
sodium is moving from outside to inside.

104
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.180
Potassium's moving from inside to outside and because there are ions moving back

105
00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:15.121
and forth,

106
00:07:15.121 --> 00:07:20.121
there's a current that flows and there's a electrical potential that's

107
00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:25.080
generated.
Now this is in the resting state of all cells.

108
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.190
There's some membrane potential and neurons have this resting meant memory in

109
00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:33.390
potential also.
And if you measured it for most cells it's about,
you know,

110
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:38.420
between minus 60 and minus and minus 90 millivolts.

111
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.040
And for this particular cell here,
it looks like it's about minus 75 millivolts.

112
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.190
<v 0>So the inside of the cell is a little bit more negative than the outside.</v>

114
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

115
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.270
<v 0>Now what happens during an action potential is that that membrane potential</v>

116
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:59.650
changes very rapidly and,

117
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.760
and it,
it changes from being negative to being more positive.

118
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:11.010
<v 0>And that change happens because something gets triggered in the membrane.</v>

120
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.400
And what gets triggered is a voltage gated sodium channel,

121
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.700
which is shown here.
And I remember we talked about these last time.

122
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.850
Voltage gated channels are channels that would allow the passage of sodium in

123
00:08:26.581 --> 00:08:31.470
this case,
but they can exist in two states,
a close state and an open state.

124
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.580
And when an action potential is initiated,

125
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.030
these ion channels go from there close date to their open state when they open,

126
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:47.090
sodium can now pass through the balance of sodium movement relative to potassium

127
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:53.361
movement changes because there's this resting movement of all these molecules

128
00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:57.600
anyway.
But that balance dramatically when these iron a gated,

129
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.660
when these gated ion channels open and that results in a dramatic change in the

130
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.710
membrane voltage,
the potential across the membrane,

131
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.270
and that's shown here by this rapid rise in membrane potential.

132
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.280
Now that rapid rise is called depolarization and the membrane is said to be in a

133
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:22.281
depolarized state because it's less polarized or less negatively charged,

134
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.820
read,
polarized as negatively charged.

135
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.020
It's less negatively charged a than it is in its resting state.

136
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:32.760
Okay,

137
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.760
so that happens and if I was looking at a region of membrane that was

138
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:39.480
experiencing an action potential,

139
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:44.630
I would see a voltage change and just the way it's shown in this graph here now,

140
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.010
if,
if that,

141
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.210
if that potential changed and it's stayed changed forever,

142
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.190
then the cell would never go back to its resting state.
And that would be,

143
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.570
you could have a cell that did that,

144
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.080
but that would be a cell that could only send one signal,
right?

145
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.190
It sends its signal,
it's signal,

146
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.720
the signal that it sends is this change in voltage and once it changes,

147
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.160
maybe it's all done.

148
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.610
And that would be a bad design for our nervous system where we want to use cells

149
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:17.940
over and over again.
So they're able to recover from this change in potential.

150
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.610
And that's shown functionally here.

151
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.870
But recovery means that this sodium channel becomes closed again.

152
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.310
Now it's more complicated than that because it's not just sodium channels that

153
00:10:30.311 --> 00:10:34.240
are involved.
There are potassium channels also and the,
the uh,

154
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.530
the interplay between sodium channels,
opening of potassium channels opening.

155
00:10:38.531 --> 00:10:40.540
This is described in some detail in your book.

156
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.240
We're not going to talk about those details in the class here.

157
00:10:43.241 --> 00:10:47.200
I want you to sort of understand this really at the level that I've described it

158
00:10:47.201 --> 00:10:50.350
here,
that there's a local change in the membrane.

159
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.340
That local change involves opening of channels that allow ions to pass through

160
00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:58.300
regions where they couldn't pass through before.

161
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:04.230
That results in a change in voltage and that voltage moves from one end of the

162
00:11:05.741 --> 00:11:07.390
cell to the other.

163
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.900
That action potential is initiated here,

164
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.990
up in this region.

165
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:19.290
This part of the cell becomes depolarized because it,

166
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.820
because it gets the message that it's supposed to be polarized because of all

167
00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:27.460
the inputs that impinge on these dendrites.

168
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:28.990
<v 1>Okay?</v>

169
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.470
<v 0>Right?</v>

170
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:33.220
So it's collecting information from all these dendrites under the right series

171
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:35.770
of signals.
The cell body integrates.

172
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:40.660
All that information says time for me to fire an action potential that happens.

173
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:42.490
<v 1>Okay,</v>

174
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.840
<v 0>that membrane potential changes here and the change in membrane potential here</v>

175
00:11:46.841 --> 00:11:51.841
is so dramatic that it changes the membrane potential here and here and here.

176
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:57.060
And that change potential flows down the surface of the axon eventually reaching

177
00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.350
this output region.

178
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.300
So the flow of information is really a flow of electrical potential and it goes

179
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:09.100
in one direction only.

180
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.750
It goes from the region of the cell where the dendrites are down through the

181
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:14.584
Axon.

182
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.810
We're gonna come back and talk about the action potential a little bit more when

183
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:23.800
we talk about how the heart works because the heart,

184
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.750
when it's a contracting,

185
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.270
the muscle cells also use action potentials to initiate contraction,

186
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.960
right?
And,
uh,
and when we measure Ekg,
Geez,

187
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.630
what we're measuring is the activity of all these cells within our heart

188
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.360
performing action potentials.

189
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.740
Now in the heart action potential is moving from one heart muscle cell to

190
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:56.170
another.
Over the surface of the heart.

191
00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.040
In the brain action potentials are moving down processes,
uh,

192
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.340
down to single cell process,
uh,
for example.
So a,

193
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:10.990
so action potentials are used by tissues in different ways to send signals from

194
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:15.520
one cell to another or from one end of one cell to another end of the cell.

195
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.040
<v 2>That's it.
It makes sense.</v>

196
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.390
<v 0>So we'll come back to this in our example,</v>

197
00:13:22.391 --> 00:13:25.690
in the cardiovascular system when we're talking about the heart and we'll talk

198
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:30.640
about how to measure a collective group of action potentials using EKG and well,

199
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.630
you'll actually get to measure,
um,
EKG is on each other,
uh,

200
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.350
during a section that week.
We talk about that.
Well,

201
00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:43.000
what happens when the signal gets to the end of the,
of the Axon?

202
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.070
How do,

203
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:50.070
how do cells pass the signal from themselves to the next cell in the heart?

204
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:56.560
It turns out that the cells of the heart are electrically coupled together.

205
00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.160
So if an action potential moves down this sell,

206
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.800
it directly moves into the next sale.

207
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.730
And so there's a continuum of electrical connection in the heart that allows an

208
00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:13.270
action potential to sweep across the surface of the heart and for the heart to

209
00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.690
beat in a coordinated fashion in the nervous system.

210
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.430
It doesn't work that way and it doesn't work that way for a variety of reasons.

211
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:26.610
But the main reason is that you want some decision to be made at each space

212
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:32.540
between two cells,
right?
You want decisions to be made there so you,

213
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.550
so you need some additional mechanism for decision making at the point of

214
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:42.910
contact between the Axon of one cell and the dendrite of another.

215
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.390
Well that specialized region.
Now in this diagram here,

216
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:48.340
this is the Axon of one cell.

217
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.120
The first cell in a sequence and that acts on meets the dendrite of another cell

218
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:59.950
and a special region called a synapse.
And the synapses,

219
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.960
just this anatomical region of contact between two adjacent cells in the nervous

220
00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:07.934
system.

221
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.080
And it varies in its structure among cells of the nervous system,

222
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:17.930
but all but,
but all synapsis have some properties in common.

223
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.740
One is that there's a physical space in between the two cells.

224
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:27.340
So the Axon of what's called the presynaptic neuron or the neuron that's

225
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:30.380
bringing a signal into the synapse,

226
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.080
the Axon terminal,

227
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.500
it's physically separated from the dendright of the next cell.

228
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:38.710
<v 2>Okay.</v>

229
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:42.250
<v 0>And that space is about 20 to 40 nanometers.</v>

230
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:43.810
It's not a very big space,

231
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.310
but it's a significant space and it's called the synaptic cleft and it's filled

232
00:15:48.311 --> 00:15:49.600
with extra cellular fluid.

233
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.370
Now another thing that you'd find if you looked inside the axon terminals of any

234
00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:55.870
of these pre synaptic membranes,

235
00:15:55.871 --> 00:16:00.871
you'd find lots of vesicles or small membrane bound compartments that contain

236
00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:03.310
special chemicals called neurotransmitters.

237
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:08.740
And Neuro transmitters are molecules you've heard of like Acetylcholine,
uh,

238
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.560
like a dopamine,
like serotonin.

239
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.320
They're small molecules that,
uh,

240
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:19.350
that whose principal function in the body is to carry signals from one cell in

241
00:16:20.801 --> 00:16:23.320
the nervous system to another.
Now,

242
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.310
how they carry signals is that these neurotransmitters act as lie gans.

243
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.030
And when an action potential comes down,

244
00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:33.760
this presynaptic Axon,

245
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.220
when it reaches this point here,

246
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.710
it sets off the process of these vesicles dumping their context into the

247
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.880
synaptic cleft.
So this process,

248
00:16:45.881 --> 00:16:50.290
which is shown schematically here as a vesicle fusing with the cell membrane and

249
00:16:50.291 --> 00:16:51.460
then dropping,
it's,

250
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.520
it's a neurotransmitter only happens when an action potential reaches the end of

251
00:16:56.681 --> 00:16:57.514
the Axon.

252
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.750
So neurotransmitter release is stimulated by the electrical activity that

253
00:17:04.451 --> 00:17:06.670
reaches the end of the Axon.

254
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.560
When these vesicles dumped their contents contents into the synaptic cleft,

255
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.990
the concentration of these lie gans rise.

256
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.950
And another characteristic of the synapse is that the postsynaptic membrane.

257
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:24.610
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

258
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:27.280
<v 0>The postsynaptic membrane,
the membrane of the cell,</v>

259
00:17:27.281 --> 00:17:31.750
which is going to receive the signal has receptors on it.

260
00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.150
And those receptors,

261
00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:39.180
some fraction of them are specific for the lie gand that the presynaptic cell

262
00:17:40.991 --> 00:17:41.824
releases.

263
00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:43.420
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

264
00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:47.200
<v 0>it's a lot of words here.
Long words,
presynaptic postsynaptic.
But,
uh,</v>

265
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.160
pre post you get idea,
Kaitlin,

266
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.130
<v 3>I'm just curious before</v>

267
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.740
this map where things don't,

268
00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:02.050
<v 0>they're,
they're actually stored in these bicycles and so,
and they,
they,</v>

269
00:18:02.051 --> 00:18:04.850
they get into the vesicles in a variety of different ways.

270
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.890
In some cells they're recycled.

271
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.400
That is the sales able to take up the neurotransmitter after it's released and

272
00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:11.234
restore it.

273
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:16.040
But most often there are enzyme systems inside the presynaptic membrane where

274
00:18:16.041 --> 00:18:20.390
those neurotransmitters are synthesized,
they're synthesized,

275
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.330
they're packaged into vesicles and then they're just waiting.

276
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.940
And so if you looked,
if,
if you could look inside a,
a pre synaptic,

277
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.380
um,
um,
axon terminal,

278
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.040
you would find one of the characteristics is that that is loaded with these

279
00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:40.550
vesicles and they're just sitting there waiting to receive an action potential

280
00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:43.310
so that they can immediately dump their contents.

281
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.150
And so one of the things you know about the nervous system is fast,
right?

282
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.070
I decided to move,
I can move right away.
And,

283
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:54.800
and so in order to have fast transmission,

284
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:59.360
you do that by transmitting electrical signals.
That happens pretty quickly.

285
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.680
You're right.
You know,
you turn on your lamp.

286
00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:05.240
It happens pretty fast because because current can flow very quickly through

287
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.980
wire or through a charged a solution of ions.

288
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.260
So that process happens fast.
But you also need this neurotransmitter

289
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:21.060
release and activation to happen fast so that you can have rapid activity.

290
00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.350
Did I then answer?

291
00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.660
So now in this cartoon here I've shown a variety of different receptors and just

292
00:19:31.331 --> 00:19:32.540
to show,
uh,
did,

293
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:37.590
just to remind you of the different families of receptor molecules that could be

294
00:19:37.901 --> 00:19:42.220
involved in receiving and translating a signal.
Uh,

295
00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.970
but in general for each neurotransmitter that released,

296
00:19:45.971 --> 00:19:49.270
there'd only be one population of receptors.
It's ready to receive it.

297
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:53.980
And in some cases it might be a re a ligand gated ion channel.

298
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.000
And wouldn't that be convenient,
right?
Because if it was,

299
00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.980
if it was a neurotransmitter activated ion channel,

300
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.220
what would happen when the neurotransmitter bound here is it would generate an

301
00:20:08.291 --> 00:20:12.160
electrical signal because it would you open the ion channel and you would allow

302
00:20:12.161 --> 00:20:16.120
ion fluxes and you would change the membrane potential in just the way I

303
00:20:16.121 --> 00:20:17.650
described for the action potential.

304
00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.000
So this is a mechanism by which an electrical signal comes here.

305
00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.610
It gets translated into a chemical signal,

306
00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.050
the chemical diffuses across the gap and reinitiate a chemist,

307
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:32.590
an electrical signal in the next cell.
And that's one way that it happens.

308
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.530
It can also happen,
uh,

309
00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:39.100
in other ways it could be a g protein coupled receptor we should talk about last

310
00:20:39.101 --> 00:20:39.311
time,

311
00:20:39.311 --> 00:20:43.540
which indirectly activates another ion channel to start the electrical signal.

312
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.200
So why do this?
Well,

313
00:20:47.201 --> 00:20:51.820
one reason to do this is because on each post synaptic neuron,

314
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:57.030
there might be many axons coming together at once and each one might be

315
00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:59.350
generating a different kind of signal,

316
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.220
right through maybe even different neurotransmitters.

317
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:09.030
And so because this post synaptic neuron is going to be receiving different

318
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:14.860
signals from different cells,
it's decision about what to do next.

319
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.460
And the what to do next is either create an action potential or not create an

320
00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:24.070
action potential.
So it makes a binary decision.

321
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:26.620
Either I create an action potential or I don't.

322
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:31.900
But that decision could be based on many inputs,
right?

323
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:33.850
Not just on input from one cell.

324
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.440
And it could be the integration of many different chemical signals.

325
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.840
And because of that,
because they're not directly wired together,

326
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.950
but because there is our decisions and integrations occurring at each junction,

327
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:57.340
uh,
the,
the potential operation of the nervous system becomes diverse,

328
00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:03.070
right?
So you have both a diversity in the physical connections,
right?

329
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:07.120
Anyone's cell is potentially contacting lots of other cells and you have a

330
00:22:07.121 --> 00:22:11.260
diversity and the chemical changes that occur as a result of any of those

331
00:22:11.261 --> 00:22:12.094
connections.

332
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.870
And that's what leads to some of the complexity of function of the nervous

333
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:17.704
system.

334
00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.970
And when I talk about the immune system for the rest of the time here,
and,

335
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.860
and again,

336
00:22:26.861 --> 00:22:30.670
the point today is not for you to understand in detail all these mechanisms,

337
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:35.800
but to understand how those basic concepts we talked about last time,
uh,

338
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.500
basic concepts of cell communication,

339
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:43.690
if arranged in the right kinds of ways,
can lead to complex outcomes.

340
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:44.800
Right?
That's,

341
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.460
that was the point I was trying to illustrate in the nervous system,

342
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.620
in the immune system.

343
00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:55.180
You could think of it as an even more complex set of outcomes that occur.

344
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.800
And the outcomes that occur are,
um,
are,
uh,

345
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.750
protective outcomes in general.

346
00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.000
Our immune system's function is to,
uh,

347
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.600
keep us healthy in the face of an environment where there are lots of things

348
00:23:10.601 --> 00:23:11.890
that could potentially harm us.

349
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.380
And so the study of immunology is the study of mechanisms that your body uses to

350
00:23:17.381 --> 00:23:22.381
protect itself from mainly from foreign pathogens like viruses and bacteria.

351
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.850
And so some words that are useful in this discussion.
A host,

352
00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.970
a host is the organism that you're interested in defending.

353
00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.260
And it could be you or me or,
uh,
or some typical,
uh,
person.

354
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.340
Uh,

355
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:41.340
foreign is then any molecule or set of molecules or substances that are foreign

356
00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:46.790
to the host.
They don't belong there.
So could be a foreign,
uh,

357
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.200
foreign proteins from a virus could be,
uh,

358
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.750
could be a foreign,
uh,
foreign,
um,

359
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.310
elements from a bacterium.

360
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.470
It could be that one of your cells has become mutated,

361
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.720
is now abnormal.
And so doesn't belong in you anymore.
It's,
it's,

362
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.370
it's foreign,
right?
It's not part of the host or not a normal part of the host.

363
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.430
So all those things would be considered foreign.

364
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.250
And we're going to use this special word antigen.

365
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.730
An antigen has a very particular meaning.

366
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:25.130
It's molecules or pieces of molecules,

367
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.260
often derived from foreign pathogens which stimulate an immune response,
right?

368
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.370
So antigens are molecules or pieces of molecules that stimulate an immune

369
00:24:34.371 --> 00:24:37.100
response.
Any molecule can be an antigen.

370
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:41.180
The food that you eat is full of antigens,
right?

371
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.630
Microbes that try to,
uh,

372
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.610
to try to live in your body are full of antigens.

373
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.180
Pieces of your own cells are antigens as well.

374
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.050
They're just antigens that belonged to you.
And so you don't normally,

375
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.320
you don't normally mount an immune response to antigens that are part of you.

376
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.080
And we'll talk about how that happens a little bit as we go through here.

377
00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:06.050
So in general,

378
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.170
you think about the immune system protecting against different classes of

379
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.900
pathogens and uh,
and uh,

380
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:16.880
several classes of pathogens are shown on this,
uh,
on this table.

381
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:22.060
And so you're familiar with some of these bacteria like Salmonella or the

382
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:27.350
mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis,
um,
are shown here.
Uh,

383
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:32.240
viruses,
you know,
about viruses,
uh,
very yola we're going to talk about next week,

384
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:36.440
which causes smallpox,
influenza,
flu,

385
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:40.970
which causes the flu and HIV of course,
which causes aids are some examples,

386
00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.590
a fun guy,
which don't often cause,
uh,
cause,
um,

387
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.000
infections in people with healthy immune systems but can under some

388
00:25:50.001 --> 00:25:54.320
circumstances and can be tremendous problems in patients that have,
uh,

389
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:59.180
that have weakened immune systems and parasitic,
a parasitic,

390
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.720
um,
um,

391
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.810
organisms like protozoa and worms,
which are,
um,

392
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.200
which can cause a terrible diseases.

393
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.180
Malaria is one that causes much disease worldwide.
Uh,
schistosomiasis,

394
00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:18.470
uh,
which is a worm that lives in,
in a river waters,
uh,

395
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.820
causes a terrible diseases,
uh,

396
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:26.010
that are still prevalent in many parts of the world.
Uh,
so just a,

397
00:26:26.011 --> 00:26:28.310
an introduction to the classes of,
of,

398
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.760
of potential foreign invaders that our immune system tries to defend us against.

399
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:39.020
And because it's working to defend us against many different kinds of potential,

400
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.270
uh,
assaults.
Uh,

401
00:26:41.271 --> 00:26:46.200
the immune system has a diverse repertoire of responses that uses,
uh,

402
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:47.940
in the face of these assaults.

403
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:52.560
And so one kind of response is called the innate response.

404
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:56.520
And innate means that it's present from the beginning,
right?

405
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:59.580
So this is an immune response that doesn't have to be activated.

406
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.960
And we're used to thinking about immune risk responses that have to be
activated,

407
00:27:03.961 --> 00:27:08.040
right?
You get a,
you get a vaccine for chicken pox,

408
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.910
it gets injected and sometime later you're going to be protected against it,

409
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.160
right?
Or you get a cold,
right?
The cold virus,

410
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.660
uh,
takes hold,
the viruses start replicating inside of you,

411
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.580
and it takes some time for immune system to gear up to eliminated,

412
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.450
right?
So we're used to thinking about responses that take some time,

413
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.790
but innate responses are there from the very beginning and they can,
uh,

414
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.590
they can fight,
uh,
um,
uh,

415
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.300
against foreign pathogens immediately.
And it's mainly,

416
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:47.190
these functions are mainly performed by a set of cells called macrophages,

417
00:27:47.191 --> 00:27:49.500
neutrophils and natural killer cells,

418
00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.050
which are circulating throughout your body all the time,

419
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:57.200
ready to destroy anything that they recognize as not part of you.

420
00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.790
So that's the innate response.
We're not really going to say much about that.
Uh,

421
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:04.510
here,

422
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.810
there's a little bit about it in the book and if you go on to study immunology,

423
00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:12.580
you'll learn that this is one of the most important and rapidly evolving areas

424
00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.880
of,
of,
uh,
the study of immunology.
And in fact,

425
00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:18.930
the people who have been most important in,
um,

426
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:23.530
in understanding how the innate immune system works.
Our people here at Yale,

427
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.290
<v 1>um,
that</v>

428
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.940
<v 0>the immune system that we're used to thinking about is called the adaptive</v>

429
00:28:30.941 --> 00:28:33.580
immune system.
The adaptive immune system.

430
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.220
And the adaptive immune system does just that.

431
00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:41.290
It changes or adapt in response to an insult or a threat.

432
00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.641
And,
uh,

433
00:28:42.641 --> 00:28:47.410
so this is the kind of immune response that gets activated only when it's needed

434
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:53.280
and then it will stay activated for some period of time and eventually disappear

435
00:28:53.321 --> 00:28:57.940
again.
And there are two types of adaptive immune responses,

436
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.680
uh,
and they're called humoral immune responses.
And humoral,
uh,

437
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.130
comes from the term humors.
Uh,

438
00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:11.250
and it used to be that we thought about a disease as being caused by the balance

439
00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:13.660
of humor is in our blood.

440
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.920
You could have good humors and you could have bad humors.
And if those humors,

441
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.050
whatever they are got out of balance,

442
00:29:20.051 --> 00:29:23.200
then you've got sick if you had too many bad ones compared to good ones.

443
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:28.060
And so humoral refers to immunity in the blood and it's,

444
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.230
it's um,

445
00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:35.320
it's immunity that's in the blood in the form of antibodies.

446
00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.430
And we're going to talk a lot about antibodies over the next,
uh,
week or so.

447
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:43.120
But antibodies are specialized that as you know,

448
00:29:43.121 --> 00:29:47.260
are designed to bind to antigens or foreign molecules inside the body.

449
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:48.520
I'll say more about that in a minute,

450
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.410
but the humoral immune response involves antibody production and antibodies are

451
00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:56.470
made by a subset of cells called [inaudible] cells.

452
00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

453
00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.850
<v 0>B cells.
Okay.</v>

454
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.440
The other part of the adaptive immune system is the cell mediated immune system.

455
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.540
And this is an immune system.

456
00:30:06.541 --> 00:30:11.541
That's where that doesn't involve antibodies but involves cells that are

457
00:30:11.851 --> 00:30:16.851
activated in response to a Foreign Antigen and that utilize cellular means to

458
00:30:18.271 --> 00:30:19.104
get rid of it.

459
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.800
And usually the cellular means that they get rid of is that instead of an

460
00:30:22.801 --> 00:30:24.150
antibody being produced,

461
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:29.360
you activate a population of cells that will specifically go and hunt down the

462
00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:30.894
foreign,

463
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.790
the foreign antigen or more commonly cells that contain the foreign antigen.

464
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.930
Now why do you need a cell mediated immune response if you have an antibody

465
00:30:39.931 --> 00:30:44.370
response?
We'll talk about that in a few minutes,
but we're going to,

466
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.330
one of the reasons why,
uh,

467
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:51.120
you'll see why sell mute mediated responses are important is because antigens

468
00:30:51.121 --> 00:30:55.350
can appear in your body in different ways and the way that they appear in your

469
00:30:55.351 --> 00:31:00.270
body tells the immune system something about where they came from.
And uh,

470
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.850
we'll,
we'll learn more about that in a moment.

471
00:31:02.851 --> 00:31:07.560
But basically it allows the immune system to distinguish between viral and

472
00:31:07.561 --> 00:31:12.060
bacterial pathogens and respond appropriately depending on the type of pathogen

473
00:31:12.061 --> 00:31:16.410
that's there.
So the main effector cells in cell mediated immunity,

474
00:31:16.411 --> 00:31:19.350
the t cells that do the main business are called t cells.

475
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.730
Now t cells are also involved in humoral immunity,

476
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.940
but they're not the end result.
Right?

477
00:31:26.941 --> 00:31:30.750
The end result and humoral immunity is B cells producing antibodies.

478
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:35.960
The end result or the molecules that carry out the function in a cell mediated

479
00:31:36.181 --> 00:31:41.010
immunity are,
are t cells either,
um,
either,
um,

480
00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:42.790
<v 1>okay,</v>

481
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.010
<v 0>let me talk about different types of t cells in a moment,</v>

482
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:50.011
but either cells that are called CD four positive cells or CD eight positive

483
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.943
cells.

484
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:57.390
So why do you have these different kinds of responses and what the reason is

485
00:31:57.391 --> 00:32:01.800
that that because of the ways that different microorganisms,

486
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.930
uh,
take,
um,

487
00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:10.620
the ways the different micro organisms reproduce and damage cells and tissue

488
00:32:10.621 --> 00:32:14.280
within your body,
you need different ways to respond to them effectively.

489
00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.020
So think for a minute about what happens if you get infected with the virus.
Now,

490
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:23.400
a virus is not capable of reproducing on its own.
So if you,

491
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.880
if you've got a virus into your body somehow and it didn't enter any of

492
00:32:26.881 --> 00:32:30.030
yourselves,
it would cause no damage,
right?

493
00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:35.031
Because it could not reproduce and it's reproduction of the virus and passage of

494
00:32:35.731 --> 00:32:37.410
that virus onto new cells,

495
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.380
which causes the problems with disease that we associate,

496
00:32:42.381 --> 00:32:45.070
right?
They often kill the cells that they,
in fact,

497
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.090
and that's a problem with viruses.

498
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:52.810
So a virus isn't troublesome until it infects a host cell and when it infects a

499
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:54.621
host cell,

500
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:59.621
it becomes troublesome because it takes over some of the host machinery for DNA

501
00:33:00.531 --> 00:33:04.910
synthesis,
transcription and translation and starts making more viruses.

502
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.110
And this happens largely in the cytoplasm of the cell.

503
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:15.320
So how is your immune system going to recognize that this virus is there causing

504
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.730
bad results?

505
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:21.140
If it's living inside of a cell and doing all this business inside a cell where

506
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:24.230
antibodies can't get to it,
right?

507
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:29.260
Antibodies are outside of cells circulating in your extra cellular fluid.

508
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:30.561
Well,

509
00:33:30.561 --> 00:33:34.340
the way that your immune system recognizes it is that all of the cells of our

510
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:38.330
body express a molecule on their surface.

511
00:33:38.331 --> 00:33:40.370
A membrane protein called the MHC,

512
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:45.371
one complex and MHC one is a word.

513
00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:51.280
MHC stands for major histocompatibility complex and it's one of the things that

514
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:55.670
distinguishes my cells from yourselves,
from your parents cells,

515
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:59.330
from your roommate cells,
is that each one of ourselves,

516
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:05.180
one of the things that distinguishes them is the kind of MHC molecules that all

517
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:08.450
of my cells make.
It's what makes my cells,

518
00:34:08.451 --> 00:34:11.330
my cells and your cells,
your cells.

519
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.600
And it's the reason why you can't do organ transplants between people that

520
00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:18.770
aren't immunologically matched.

521
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.570
Because if you take an organ from one person and put it in another,

522
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.570
if their MHC molecules don't match,

523
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.720
then the immune system recognizes the immune system of the host recognizes,

524
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:35.600
ah,
this is not the right MHC for me.

525
00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.390
And the immune system tries to destroy those cells.

526
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:44.060
So one of the functions of MHC is to indicate which cells belong inside your

527
00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:46.250
body,
which cells don't.

528
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:52.130
The other thing that it does is that when a virus is inside these cells making

529
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.230
its proteins,

530
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:59.470
some of those proteins get processed or digested into small fragments that are

531
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.480
themselves antigens.

532
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.190
And those antigens get expressed together with MHC one.

533
00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.010
So one of the other things that MHC one does in addition to marketing yourselves

534
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:13.844
as your own,

535
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.740
is that it's capable of making combinations with all the different molecules

536
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:20.900
that are present inside the cell

537
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:27.320
and expressing them on the surface and sort of showing them to the outside

538
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:29.930
world,
right?

539
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:35.230
And it's showing them to the outside world in combination with MHC one.

540
00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:41.630
Okay.
And the immune system,
some cells of the immune system in particular,

541
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:46.810
this class of t cells called CD eight cells have receptors which recognize MHC

542
00:35:48.471 --> 00:35:49.304
one,

543
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:50.860
<v 1>okay?</v>

544
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.860
<v 0>And they're capable of recognizing MHC one together with foreign antigens.</v>

545
00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:02.430
And when these CD eight t cells see your MHC one together with an antigen that

546
00:36:02.831 --> 00:36:06.730
doesn't belong in you,
it creates a immune response.

547
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.810
And the immune response is directed at killing this cell.

548
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.300
And the notion is if there's something foreign that's being produced inside this

549
00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:17.870
cell,

550
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:21.500
then that cell must have been corrupted in some way and it has to be getting rid

551
00:36:21.501 --> 00:36:25.190
of,
it could have been corrupted because of virus was inside of it.

552
00:36:25.191 --> 00:36:29.030
So it was making foreign proteins and that's making the cell look foreign

553
00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.780
because some of that foreign protein is on the surface with MHC one,

554
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.620
it could be foreign because it's become malignant.

555
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:41.840
Maybe it got mutated and it's making the wrong kinds of proteins,
right?

556
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.310
Cancer cells often do that.

557
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:48.440
And so those wrong proteins get presented on MHC one and your immune system can

558
00:36:48.441 --> 00:36:50.330
kill the cell because it's a tumor cell,

559
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.463
<v 1>right?</v>

560
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:57.350
<v 0>So this is a way for the immune system to recognize things that are going wrong</v>

561
00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.010
inside itself,
protected from antibodies.

562
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:04.173
Um,

563
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.320
other kinds of micro organisms reproduce and cause tissue damage in a different

564
00:37:09.321 --> 00:37:12.980
way.
If you get bacteria under your skin,
right?

565
00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:17.870
If you get a cut and somehow that cut gets bacteria gets inside there,

566
00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.260
the bacteria can reproduce on their own,
right?
They're,

567
00:37:21.261 --> 00:37:24.860
they're fully functional organisms that can reproduce on their own and they can

568
00:37:24.861 --> 00:37:27.740
start growing outside of any cell.
And that's what they do.

569
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:31.820
They live extracellularly well,
you're a Nate immune system,

570
00:37:31.821 --> 00:37:32.810
tries to get rid of them.

571
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:37.280
The innate immune system composed of neutrophils and macrophages.

572
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:39.710
These are cells that are crawling around your body all the time,

573
00:37:39.711 --> 00:37:43.460
ready to eat bacteria.
And when they do that,

574
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:48.530
they can actually engulf the bacteria in a process called phagocytosis and break

575
00:37:48.531 --> 00:37:52.490
the bacteria down into,
um,
into antigens.

576
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.990
And then those antigens get expressed with Mhc,

577
00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:01.130
just like they did in all the other cells inside the host.

578
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.400
But particular cells of the innate immune system have a different kind of MHC

579
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.140
called MHC two.

580
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

581
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:15.770
<v 0>And when t cells recognize a foreign antigen that's combined with MHC two,</v>

582
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:23.270
they know that that antigen must've come from one of these professional,

583
00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:25.570
<v 1>okay.</v>

584
00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:30.570
<v 0>Phagocytic cells digesting bacteria or some other extra cellular,</v>

585
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.720
um,
invader.

586
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.190
<v 1>Right?</v>

587
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:41.190
<v 0>And because this antigen gets expressed in the context of Mhc to your immune</v>

588
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:43.660
system responds differently.

589
00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:44.910
<v 1>Okay.</v>

590
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:48.210
<v 0>Now there's a lot of words here,
right?
I mean there's a lot of words,</v>

591
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.240
there's a lot of abbreviations,
there's a lot of players.

592
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.020
And the details are not particularly important to us.
Some of them in your book,

593
00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:57.540
and I hope you read about them cause it's really interesting,

594
00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.250
but the main points are that for us here,

595
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:07.080
that this is a very elaborate form of cell communication that is,

596
00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:11.910
has the same essential characteristics that we talked about last time in that

597
00:39:11.911 --> 00:39:13.320
there are receptors,

598
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:15.160
<v 1>okay.</v>

599
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.110
<v 0>That are presenting signals which now other cells receive.</v>

600
00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:22.100
<v 1>Okay.</v>

601
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:27.020
<v 0>Those receptors are more complicated than the ones we thought about before.</v>

602
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:31.070
The logins are more complicated than the ones we thought about before.

603
00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.150
And the reason for that complexity is because your immune system needs to be

604
00:39:35.151 --> 00:39:39.770
able to respond to all the potential foreign invaders that we could encounter.

605
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:40.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

606
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:44.930
<v 0>It's not just a limited number of things that might happen,</v>

607
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:50.420
right?
And so it's evolved these sort of,
uh,
mechanisms,
uh,

608
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:54.620
in order to allow it to respond to a wide variety of,
uh,

609
00:39:54.621 --> 00:39:59.180
of potential molecules and to respond in the same way,

610
00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:02.053
<v 1>mmm.</v>

611
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:08.630
<v 0>In a coordinated way that somehow knows where those foreign molecules came from.</v>

612
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:12.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

613
00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:13.011
<v 0>And importantly,</v>

614
00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:16.970
it's able to distinguish foreign molecules from your own molecules,
right?

615
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.170
So read about this,

616
00:40:18.171 --> 00:40:22.610
but please don't worry about all of the details because the details aren't so

617
00:40:22.611 --> 00:40:23.990
important for what we're going to talk about.

618
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.550
And he says that and then he shows an even more detailed picture.
Um,
but um,

619
00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.180
what I want to show you on this slide is just the simple part of it.

620
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:35.630
I talked last time about mh and the last slide about MHC one.

621
00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.600
So this is a cell that's infected with a microorganism,

622
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.920
is infected with the virus.
Let's say it's infected with influenza virus.

623
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:48.010
So that virus is reproducing inside cells of your respiratory tract.

624
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:52.520
You've got the flu,
you've got influenza in your upper respiratory tract,

625
00:40:52.521 --> 00:40:56.180
your cells are making more influenza that gets,

626
00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:01.210
that gets presented in the context of Mhc one on cells within your body.

627
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:07.340
And immune cells recognize it and they recognize it by a very special form of

628
00:41:07.341 --> 00:41:12.341
receptor ligand interaction where the ligature is MHC one with the foreign

629
00:41:12.831 --> 00:41:17.831
antigen and the receptor is a receptor called the t cell receptor complex.

630
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:20.750
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:25.640
<v 0>T cell receptor complexes able to recognize on uh,
um,
on</v>

632
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:31.070
one population of t cells able to recognize MHC one,
uh,

633
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:34.400
together with foreign peptides on another type of T-cell,

634
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.120
able to recognize MHC two with,
uh,
with,
uh,

635
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.800
other types of foreign antigens.

636
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:41.790
<v 2>Okay.</v>

637
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.300
<v 0>What happens when that recognition takes place is that your immune system gets</v>

638
00:41:45.301 --> 00:41:50.301
activated and the activation that happens usually involves two things.

639
00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:54.630
It involves proliferation,
which we talked about last week.

640
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.600
So when the right signal is received right,

641
00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:02.630
the right t cell finds your host's cell with a foreign virus in it,

642
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:10.710
the first thing that happens is that this t cell becomes activated and it starts

643
00:42:10.711 --> 00:42:15.030
reproducing,
making more copies of itself.
So reproduction,

644
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.020
proliferation,

645
00:42:16.021 --> 00:42:21.021
cell growth happens and then those cells become more differentiated.

646
00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:26.160
They become more mature and they mature into,

647
00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:30.030
in this case,
they mature into cytotoxic cells.

648
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.300
<v 2>Okay.</v>

649
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.320
<v 0>They mature and cytotoxic means cyto cell,
toxic killing.</v>

650
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.770
They mature into cells that are capable of killing other cells.

651
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.980
<v 2>Okay?</v>

652
00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:46.090
<v 0>But you don't want to generate a lot of cells that just start killing every cell</v>

653
00:42:46.091 --> 00:42:48.970
inside your body,
right?
So here's where the,

654
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.880
where the intelligence of the immune system comes in,

655
00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:57.090
is that these cytotoxic t cells that are generated only kill cells that have

656
00:42:57.731 --> 00:42:58.960
this signal on it.

657
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.990
They only kill cells that have the signal which stimulated them,

658
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:06.750
<v 2>okay?</v>

659
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:11.670
<v 0>Right?
So they don't start killing all the cells in your respiratory system.</v>

660
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:14.970
They only kill the cells that are harboring the virus.

661
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.690
They know that these cells are harboring the virus because those cells have

662
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.720
foreign antigens on their MHC one.

663
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.720
<v 2>Okay?</v>

664
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.170
<v 0>Does that make sense?
Uh,
in the same way,
uh,</v>

665
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:31.440
cells get activated,
but these are different cells.

666
00:43:31.441 --> 00:43:35.160
These are t helper cells that get activated by MHC two

667
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.660
helper cells don't become tied cytotoxic cells,

668
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:44.750
but they help B cells become antigen producing antibody producing cells.

669
00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:50.250
So this kind of recognition leads to,
in effect,
what's the effect cell killing.

670
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:54.960
This kind of recognition leads to another effect.
What's the effect?

671
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.370
Antibody production.

672
00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:01.560
Why are antibodies useful for bacteria?

673
00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.930
Because bacteria are outside of cells and when antibodies bind to them,

674
00:44:06.931 --> 00:44:08.100
they can neutralize them.

675
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:14.450
They can't always neutralize viruses because the viruses are predominantly

676
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.490
inside cells.
Right?

677
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.240
That's why you need two kinds of immune responses.

678
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.120
We're going to talk a lot about antibodies.

679
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:27.590
We're going to talk about antibodies in a section and I want it to at the end of

680
00:44:27.591 --> 00:44:29.120
the course,
um,
uh,

681
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.990
one of our last section meeting every year we get together and we talk about

682
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.140
which sections did you think were useful and which parts,

683
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.500
which sections were not so useful.
The section where you do today,

684
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:43.140
it's always the most popular section of the year.

685
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.700
You'll know why after the section.
But um,

686
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.310
and you can tell me afterwards if you think you figured out why,

687
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.510
but it involves thinking about antibodies and how to use antibodies in

688
00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:57.270
technology.
Well,
let me just say for the rest of the time,

689
00:44:57.271 --> 00:45:00.990
where do antibody has come from?
Naturally they come from B cells.

690
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:06.030
They come from B cells that are activated with a specific antigen and the

691
00:45:06.031 --> 00:45:10.230
antibodies that are produced from these B cells are also specific for the

692
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:11.064
antigen.

693
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:17.400
An Antigen expressed in the context of MHC stimulates your immune system.

694
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.690
One of the results of that stimulation is that B cells,

695
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:25.050
a particular subset of B cells gets activated.

696
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.380
What happens when they're activated?
As they start to reproduce,

697
00:45:28.381 --> 00:45:33.270
they make more and more and more B cells and those B cells also mature.

698
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:36.420
They differentiate and that's what's shown on this slide here is the

699
00:45:36.421 --> 00:45:40.530
differentiation of those immature B cells into mature B cells.

700
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.220
What do immature B cells do?
They just wait.

701
00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.320
They wait for their time.

702
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:51.300
They wait until you are in danger from a particular antigen.

703
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:56.220
When you get exposed to that particular antigen,
they say,

704
00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.330
I'm on,
it's my time.
They differentiate.

705
00:46:00.331 --> 00:46:03.840
They make many copies of themselves and the,
I'm sorry,
they proliferate.

706
00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.490
They make many copies of themselves and then they differentiate into antibody

707
00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:14.300
production machines and the antibodies they make are all specific to the antigen

708
00:46:15.091 --> 00:46:19.530
that stimulated them.
So that's shown here.
A B cell gets stimulated,

709
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:23.760
matures into an antibody producing factory.
Antibodies look like this.

710
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.710
They're big,
uh,
proteins.

711
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:28.680
If you looked at them under a microscope or if you looked at him and cartoons,

712
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:31.850
they're shaped like the letter y and uh,

713
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:36.710
one part of them is all common.
The parts at the end of the wise are,
are,

714
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:37.980
are,
are variable.

715
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:43.550
What's variable about them is that they bind to a specific antigen.

716
00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:47.160
They bind to the antigen that stimulated their production.

717
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:51.840
So I have a bacteria infection,

718
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:53.580
stimulates my immune system.

719
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:58.500
I start making antibodies that bind to an antigen specific to that bacteria,

720
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.840
<v 1>right?</v>

721
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.090
<v 0>Well,
help me against other bacteria,
but only against the one that I've got.</v>

722
00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.480
How do they recognize it?
Because at the end of the Y,

723
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:09.580
there's a special region of the antibody,

724
00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:14.640
the antigen binding region that is highly tuned for binding to the antigen that

725
00:47:16.031 --> 00:47:16.680
stimulated,
yeah,

726
00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.513
<v 1>dumb.</v>

727
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:26.280
<v 0>And we're going to talk more about now how to use antibodies in section today.</v>

728
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:30.820
One of the beautiful things about anti antibodies is that one,

729
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:34.600
your immune system is able to make antibodies against all the thousands,

730
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:38.760
10,000 hundred thousand different pathogens that you'll come into contact with

731
00:47:38.761 --> 00:47:39.594
in your lifetime.

732
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:45.120
And so our bodies are capable of making antibodies that are tuned for all the

733
00:47:45.311 --> 00:47:49.900
potential antigens that we come into contact with.
That's amazing,
right?

734
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:54.490
That we,
that we have this capacity to respond and you respond only when needed,

735
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.510
right?
From a technological perspective,

736
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:03.690
antibodies are incredible tools because antibodies are molecules that are

737
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:09.310
specifically designed to bind to a particular antigen or a particular chemical.

738
00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.030
<v 2>Okay?</v>

739
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:13.190
<v 0>It's something just happened.
So,</v>

740
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.040
so what if you could manufacture antibodies?

741
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.620
What if you could manufacture antibodies?

742
00:48:18.621 --> 00:48:20.600
Don't worry about how they work in the immune system,

743
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.390
but what if you could manufacture antibodies,

744
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:28.870
then you could make a chemical and antibody that is capable of binding to a

745
00:48:30.321 --> 00:48:31.910
specific other chemical.

746
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

747
00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:37.430
<v 0>And you could use that for things and it turns out you can use that for lots of</v>

748
00:48:37.431 --> 00:48:38.090
things.

749
00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:43.090
You can use it to detect the presence of small amounts of chemicals anywhere.

750
00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:49.430
And we'll talk about how to use antibodies in that fashion,
um,

751
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:52.100
later,
uh,
today.
Uh,
in section

752
00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:55.183
<v 2>questions,</v>

753
00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:01.400
<v 0>one last word of encouragement.
As I say it again,</v>

754
00:49:01.401 --> 00:49:05.030
there's a lot of words in this chapter.
There's a lot of concepts,
uh,

755
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.660
focus on the things that I talked about in class,
not the details,

756
00:49:08.661 --> 00:49:12.710
the basic concepts,
focus on the concepts of receptors and lie gans.

757
00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:17.570
I wanted to show you this slide here on the homework.
Um,
I realized that this,

758
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:22.600
that this I'm thinking about antigen antibody combinations and the mathematics

759
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:28.450
of how strongly an antibody binds to a specific antigen is maybe something

760
00:49:28.611 --> 00:49:31.850
that's new to you.
And there's,
uh,
this,
uh,

761
00:49:31.851 --> 00:49:35.390
this diagram comes directly from your book,
from one of the boxes in the book,

762
00:49:35.391 --> 00:49:38.330
which described how you analyze antibody interactions.

763
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.510
If you have questions about this,
I hope that you've already,

764
00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.380
if you have questions taken advantage of the teaching fellows or come up after

765
00:49:45.381 --> 00:49:49.910
class,
I'd be happy to try to answer your questions now if you have time as well.

766
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:51.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

767
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:52.080
<v 0>In section.</v>
