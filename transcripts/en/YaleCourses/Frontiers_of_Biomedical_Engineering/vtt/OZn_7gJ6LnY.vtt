1
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.050
So this week we're going to talk about,
um,
drug delivery.

2
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.340
And this is chapter 14.
So this is an example of what I call them,

3
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:25.170
the textbook biomolecular engineering.
And,
um,

4
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.910
this is one of my favorite weeks of the course because this is my,
uh,

5
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.260
my research specialty is drug delivery.
And so what I want to do,
um,

6
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.693
today,

7
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
Thursday and then we'll continue in section is today I'm going to sort of set up

8
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.060
a set up the problem,
talk about some definitions to think about if one,

9
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.770
it's building drug delivery systems,

10
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.270
think about some basic concepts in drug delivery.
And we're going to do that by,

11
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.300
by thinking about a sort of common modes of drug administration and why some of

12
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.940
them work with some drugs and not with others.
And,
uh,

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.350
so sort of lay the foundations today and then on,
um,

14
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.460
on Thursday we'll talk about what's new in drug delivery and what things you can

15
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:11.520
expect in the future,
things that are still being built.

16
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.420
And then you'll get to make some drug delivery systems in,

17
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.470
in section on Thursday afternoon.
So,
um,

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.890
this is really a logical extension of what we started talking about last week

19
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:30.420
when we moved from talking about the immune system and how it operates to,

20
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.080
uh,

21
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.080
to administration intentionally of vaccines to alter the immune system or to

22
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.120
change your body's response.

23
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.980
And in some senses you could think about delivery of a vaccine like delivery of

24
00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:44.670
a drug.

25
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.670
We're introducing something not naturally in the body into the body in order to

26
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:52.050
have some kind of biological effect.

27
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.800
So it's the same thing as delivery of a drug.
And we,

28
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.590
and we also thought about delivery in a variety of ways.
We thought about,
uh,

29
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.520
injection of vaccines like the,
like the smallpox vaccine.

30
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.320
We thought about oral administration of vaccine in the case of the,

31
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.510
the,
uh,
the,
uh,
oral polio vaccine.
And,

32
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.360
uh,
so I just wanted to show you this picture,
uh,

33
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.700
to remind you that you already know something about drug delivery.

34
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.780
What we're going to talk about is an extension of what we've started talking

35
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:27.600
about last week.
Now,
in the case of a vaccine,

36
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.220
you'll remember that the intent was to,
uh,

37
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.310
was to administer either proteins.

38
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.650
Usually proteins or whole viruses or we talked at the end of the class on

39
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:45.651
Thursday about administering DNA with the intention that you're going to bring

40
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.670
some new molecules into a special class of cells called antigen presenting
cells,

41
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.320
that those antigen presenting cells are going to be changed as a result of their

42
00:02:55.321 --> 00:03:00.321
experience with this vaccine such that they present new molecules on their

43
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.220
surface.
That's the change that comes about.

44
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.920
And then that change in this cell is going to stimulate changes in other cells.

45
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.100
If a humoral immune response or an antibody mediated immune responses generated,

46
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.160
then the change in antigen presenting cells is going to influence B cells to

47
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:20.380
differentiate and proliferate,
et cetera.

48
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.420
So this is an example of a very particular example of what happens when you

49
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:29.470
administer a drug as well.
Chemicals are introduced into the body.

50
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.530
The intent is usually to make some kind of a biochemical change in cells or or

51
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.820
maybe many cells in your body such that their function is altered in some way

52
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.440
that's helpful to you.

53
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.430
And we didn't really talk about it last week,
but,

54
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.270
but in some cases immunization really is like drug delivery,

55
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.510
particularly in the case of what's called passive immunization,

56
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.670
where instead of introducing a pathogen or a piece of a pathogen to an

57
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.810
individual,
you actually make antibodies outside of the individual.

58
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.710
So manufacture them in some ways and we talked about ways of manufacturing

59
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.711
antibodies a few weeks ago and then introduce those antibodies themselves into

60
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:16.081
the person to provide protection against whatever pathogen those antibodies are

61
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:17.230
directed against.

62
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.500
And if any of you have traveled to areas of the world where hepatitis a is a

63
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:26.680
common and parts of Asia for example,

64
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.830
you might have gotten a shot of Gamma Globulin,

65
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.740
which is really just antibodies that are enriched for anti hepatitis a activity

66
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.450
now that the difference between that and a vaccine is that that dose of

67
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:45.370
antibodies only last for a certain length of time about 30 to 60 days.

68
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.480
So you have to get the shot 30 to 60 days before you're going to be in the area

69
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.390
where you're exposed.
And the same way,

70
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:55.090
we're going to think a lot about the timing of drugs.

71
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:58.720
How long did their affects last,
what determines how long they last,

72
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.590
and what does it mean if you still need the drug,
when it's effect is gone.

73
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.880
How does taking subsequent quantities of the drug effect its concentration in

74
00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:08.110
your body,
for example.

75
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.870
So I'm going to start with some definitions and I realized that you can,

76
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.100
you can read this on your own and hopefully already have read some of this in

77
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:22.620
the,
in the chapter,
but just to make sure that we have the vocabulary right.

78
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.430
And some of these are words that you're familiar with,

79
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:29.050
like drug and a drug is any molecule which can be introduced into the body,

80
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:32.080
which alter his body function on a molecular level.

81
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.940
And so you're used to thinking about drugs you might take for a headache like

82
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.270
aspirin or Ibuprofen or if you have asthma for example,

83
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:46.560
you might take a,
you might take drugs that affect,
uh,

84
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.390
your bronchioles or the pathways,

85
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.500
the airways in your lung by dilating them.
So it's easier to get air in and out.

86
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.920
Um,
and so these are molecules which are introduced into the,

87
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.850
they make some kind of change in the body on a molecular level.

88
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.830
Pharmacology is the science of dealing with these interactions of molecules that

89
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:09.050
are introduced into the body.
Um,

90
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.580
and they're usually molecules that are generated from outside the body may be

91
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.110
synthesized in some way.

92
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.490
They might be molecules that are not ordinarily found in our bodies,

93
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.860
but are known to have some effects.

94
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.060
They might be derivatives of molecules that are naturally found in our bodies.

95
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:26.631
For example,

96
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:31.220
Parkinson's disease is treated by a derivative of the neurotransmitter dopamine.

97
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.510
And you're introducing something that looks very much like a natural molecule

98
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.650
back into the body to have an effect.

99
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.340
And toxicology is that branch of pharmacology that thinks exclusively about

100
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:44.900
toxic effects of the drug.

101
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:50.000
And one of the main challenges with developing drugs and drug delivery systems

102
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:53.000
is that drugs have unwanted effects,
right?

103
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:57.980
They have the effect that you desire at the tissue or within the cells,

104
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.080
uh,
that they were designed to affect.

105
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.660
But they can also have effects in other parts of the body.

106
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.840
And those effects are side effects,
right?

107
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.540
Those effects are toxicities or unwanted,

108
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.780
unwanted changes in the body as a result of the drug.

109
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.490
We're going to talk about two important,

110
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.610
different but related concepts called pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

111
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.960
Pharmacodynamics is the effect of a drug on a body and it's usually on the body

112
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:30.800
or on sales from the body and it's usually defined by a dose response curve.

113
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.850
Dose response means I give a certain amount of the drug and I see what effect it

114
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:38.360
has.
I give more.
I see what effect that has.
I give more.

115
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.600
I see what effect that has and you can imagine that's a very important thing to

116
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:46.601
define for any drug because you want to deliver the minimum dose that's needed

117
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.980
to produce the desired effect,
right?

118
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:51.260
You don't want to introduce any more than necessary,

119
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.500
and so understanding the relationship between dose delivered and biological

120
00:07:56.661 --> 00:07:58.550
response is very important.

121
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.740
Often that's done first on cells and culture.
For example,

122
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.950
you want to understand how a chemotherapy agent to potential agent for treating

123
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:11.870
tumors will affect tumors in a person.

124
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.160
The first thing you do is you might have some cultured tumor cells and you

125
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:19.160
expose those cells to different concentrations of the drug.

126
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.760
And you see at what dose do I begin to see cell death or killing of the tumor

127
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:29.060
cells.
That's one kind of dose response relationship.

128
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.310
Now you could understand probably that that might be very different if you

129
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:36.620
administer that same dose into a person.

130
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.960
And we're going to talk about why dose responses in people are different than

131
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:45.680
dose responses in cell cultures or in more artificial systems.

132
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.790
So the pharmacodynamic effect of a drug or,

133
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.170
or the study of pharmacodynamics is what does the drug do to the body and

134
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:58.230
usually as defined at specific doses.
What does it do?

135
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:04.100
Pharmacokinetics has to do with how your body handles the drug and the body has

136
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.150
exquisite mechanisms for getting rid of molecules.

137
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.360
Molecules that are produced naturally in your body only have a certain lifetime.

138
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:15.991
Likewise,

139
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:20.991
antibodies that we are molecules that we introduced from outside the body also

140
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:22.170
have a lifetime.

141
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:26.760
And that depends on the mechanism that your body uses to get rid of the

142
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.430
compound.
Well that,
um,

143
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.340
that manner in which the body handles a drug,

144
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.790
how the body changes the drug,

145
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:40.791
how it excretes the drug is called Pharmaco kinetics and that has to do with

146
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:44.460
what the body does to the drug,
not what the drug does to the body.

147
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.130
So that that's uh,
the easiest way to think about it.

148
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.920
One pharmaco kinetic concept that's very important is the concept of

149
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.820
bioavailability.
By have a dose of the drug,

150
00:09:56.821 --> 00:10:01.440
let's say a hundred milligrams of a drug and I administer it to an individual,

151
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.620
then how much of that drug actually gets into the body where it can be useful

152
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:14.670
and bioavailability is going to depend on how we administer the drug if we

153
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:19.671
administer it orally versus injected intravenously versus some of the other

154
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:23.940
routes of administration.
We'll talk about in a few minutes.

155
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:30.090
The main effect of changing the route of administration is to change the

156
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:34.740
bioavailability or how much of the drug actually reaches the active sites.

157
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.230
A related concept is biotransformation,

158
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.100
biotransformation re it refers to all the mechanisms that your body could use to

159
00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:49.530
convert a drug into something else.

160
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:55.430
And often that conversion of a drug into something else is an important part of

161
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:57.150
how your body gets rid of a drug.

162
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.400
And many biotransformation reactions happen in the liver.

163
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.880
The liver is a very active site of metabolism and chemical reaction and many

164
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:13.641
drugs that we take are converted into other compounds in the liver by cells in

165
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:16.680
the liver.

166
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.330
And often this conversion into another compound is the first step in your body

167
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:24.630
getting rid of it.
Sometimes it's the only step.

168
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.980
Sometimes your liver is able to convert a molecule into something that's

169
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:33.000
completely inactive,
right?
For example,

170
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.670
if you take alcohol,
which is a drug,
uh,

171
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.370
it's converted in the liver into other molecules which don't have the biological

172
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:46.320
effect of alcohol,
all right?
It's done by enzymes in our liver cells,

173
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.930
including the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.

174
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.540
Sometimes we won't talk so much about this,
but I want to to,
uh,

175
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.560
at least realize it,
is that sometimes we deliver molecules that are inactive.

176
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.520
They don't have any
response.

177
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:05.470
Your body doesn't have any response to them,

178
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.070
but we deliver them knowing that your liver is going to convert them into

179
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:09.910
something active,

180
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.200
that they're going to be bio transformed by some chemical reaction into an

181
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:15.940
active compound.

182
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.230
So it's another aspect of biotransformation.

183
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:22.511
Okay,

184
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:27.511
so I want to spend the next 15 or 20 minutes or so talking about how drugs are

185
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:30.880
administered and,
and in particular,
uh,

186
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.620
that question should be why are they administered in different,
uh,

187
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.940
in different ways.
Why is Ibuprofen,
uh,

188
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.050
taken orally for example,

189
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:46.260
but some antibiotics or chemotherapy drugs have to be injected directly into the

190
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:49.540
bloodstream.
So why is that do you think?

191
00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:52.270
Why are some drugs administered in different ways?

192
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:57.490
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

193
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.100
<v 0>it could be that you're targeting different parts of the body and so you want to</v>

194
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:04.630
deliver them at their site of action.
That might be one w one reason to do it.

195
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.660
And they are,
what are you changing?
You're changing,

196
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.990
you're changing the potential for side effects really,

197
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:13.300
or the potential for toxicity of the drug.

198
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:17.860
Because if you can deliver more of it at the site of action,
um,

199
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.000
then,
uh,

200
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.770
then less of it goes to the rest of the body where it met cause unwanted
effects.

201
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.770
So that's a,
that's a very good reason to target it.

202
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:39.160
<v 0>Sometimes there are biological barriers to drugs entering different parts of the</v>

204
00:13:40.401 --> 00:13:41.234
body.

205
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.300
Now we're going to start by talking about the body as sort of a single unit or

206
00:13:47.121 --> 00:13:49.940
compartment.
And when I introduce drugs into them,

207
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.690
those drugs are available everywhere.
But that's not true.

208
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:59.020
And there are some parts of the body that are protected from entry of drugs and

209
00:13:59.151 --> 00:14:02.030
the brain is the most famous of those,

210
00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.850
of those parts of the body that are protected.

211
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.050
And it makes sense that the brain is protected because,
uh,

212
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:14.110
because are the function of the brain depends on the balance of chemical

213
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:16.700
concentrations within it.

214
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.180
The concentrations of ions and neurotransmitters and any molecules that could

215
00:14:22.701 --> 00:14:25.670
potentially interfere with ions are neurotransmitters.

216
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.170
And so our brain chemistry has to be very tightly regulated in order for us to

217
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:34.820
stay awake and pay attention and do the things that we normally do.

218
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.370
In contrast,
the chemistry in our blood is changing throughout the day.

219
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.630
All right?

220
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:46.630
After you eat chemistry changes because molecules are absorbed from the,

221
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.050
from the intestine,
and as those molecules get processed,

222
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.390
the body concentration in the blood changes.

223
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:58.620
If your brain chemistry was changing in that same way,
right then you'd probably,

224
00:14:58.621 --> 00:15:02.360
you'd be slipping in and out of consciousness and you notice that you do a

225
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:03.890
little bit right after lunch.

226
00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:07.310
It's a little bit harder to pay attention then before a lodge because the

227
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:08.330
chemistry is changing,

228
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:13.510
but that change in chemistry is muted by the blood brain barrier or the fact

229
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:17.540
that molecules can't get very easily into the brain.

230
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

231
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:25.380
<v 0>Why,
why else might,
uh,
might drugs be administered in different ways?</v>

232
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.910
Think about insulin.
What do you know about insulin

233
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:32.423
as a drug?

234
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.970
<v 1>Yeah,
Kaitlin.</v>

235
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.450
<v 0>Speed of action isn't important,</v>

236
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.540
is an important thing and we're going to talk in a few minutes about some drugs

237
00:15:49.541 --> 00:15:52.330
were onset of action is very important.

238
00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:56.680
It needs to act very quickly and the way that you administer it has a big effect

239
00:15:56.681 --> 00:16:00.310
on how rapidly concentrations in the body rise.

240
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:05.180
And so some things you need to act very rapidly.
Uh,

241
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.840
you'll pick the motive administration to do that.

242
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.983
<v 1>That's right.</v>

243
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.700
<v 0>There's another issue with insulin,</v>

244
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.300
which,
which we'll come to keep that one in mind.

245
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.410
So this is a table,
but that's in the book.

246
00:16:22.411 --> 00:16:27.410
And I want to go through it relatively quickly because I think,
uh,

247
00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:31.340
you can,
you can read it and it's pretty understandable on its own.
But I,

248
00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:35.550
I wanna I want to use these specific examples of different routes of

249
00:16:35.551 --> 00:16:38.790
administration to think about the answer to this question.

250
00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:41.430
Why are drugs administered in different ways?

251
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.410
And more importantly to think about the biology or the physiology of your body

252
00:16:46.411 --> 00:16:49.800
that leads to these alternate forms of administration.

253
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.380
So one mode is intravenous injection and now we're going to talk,

254
00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.060
there are different kinds of injection,
right?

255
00:16:57.061 --> 00:17:00.150
You can put a needle into different parts of the body.

256
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.570
You can put it into a muscle,
you can put it under the skin.

257
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:07.110
You can put it actually into the spinal fluid that surrounds your,

258
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.360
that surrounds your spinal cord.
Uh,

259
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:15.410
intravenous injection refers specifically to a needle that's placed within the

260
00:17:15.601 --> 00:17:17.340
bloodstream within a vein.

261
00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.520
And so drugs are introduced directly into the bloodstream.

262
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.300
And the advantages of that should be obvious.

263
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.810
That's what was related to to Caitlin's comment.

264
00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.140
That drug is immediately introduced into the blood and so it's immediately

265
00:17:33.301 --> 00:17:37.410
distributed throughout your body and available for action wherever it's needed.

266
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.450
And so onset of action is very rapid.
In addition,

267
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.600
it's the bay bioavailability is 100%.

268
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.370
We've introduced the drug into the blood directly into your,

269
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.470
your circulatory flow.

270
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.040
And so all of the molecules that are administered to the patient are available

271
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.780
for action.
Now,
usually we were going to,

272
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.210
we think about bioavailability as the fraction of the drug that ends up in the

273
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:09.480
blood.
And you might say,
well,

274
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.060
but that might not be where the drug acts.

275
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.830
The drug might act in the brain or it might act in the kidney or it might act in

276
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:17.664
your muscles.

277
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.350
And being in the blood is not the same as being in those tissues.

278
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.920
And you're right that,
that's right.
Uh,
but,

279
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.580
but it's hard to measure those concentrations in individual tissues.

280
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:34.080
And so we defined bioavailability as the fraction of a drug dose that gets into

281
00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:38.940
the blood.
Now why wouldn't we do intravenous administration for everything?

282
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.610
Because if it is fast,

283
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.480
usually you don't want to wait for,
you know,

284
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.100
you want the drug to act as rapidly as possible.
Um,
and,

285
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.690
and you'd like all the drug molecules to be bioavailable.

286
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.350
You don't like all of them to be useful.

287
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:58.980
So why don't we use intravenous administration all the time?
Well,

288
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.930
it probably is obvious that,
that,
that not,

289
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.950
uh,
that that is not so easy to do that in general,

290
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.060
a safe intravenous administration requires trained medical personnel.

291
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:15.460
So usually you're in a doctor's office or a hospital,
uh,
you,

292
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.660
you don't do it yourself at home.
And,
um,

293
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.100
and there is a risk because you're introducing drugs and high concentration into

294
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:24.900
the blood.
Uh,
there's,

295
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:29.930
there's much more risk of overdose or toxicity because the concentration is

296
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:31.620
going to change very rapidly.

297
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.850
And even though you might know what the average response to a drug is,

298
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:45.540
right?
Average among a population of people,
we're all different,

299
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.370
right?
We're all different in ways that are important to how Drugs Act,

300
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.240
right?
And you know this,
if you take Ibuprofen,

301
00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:56.250
you read the dosage on the label,

302
00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:00.600
it will say something like if you're over 12 years old,

303
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:04.560
you take one dose and if you're under 12,
you take another dose,
right?

304
00:20:04.561 --> 00:20:09.561
So size of the person or age of the person is an important determinant of how

305
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:14.040
much dose you take.
Gender is often important determinant,
right?

306
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.720
Your overall state of health is an important determinant and you can't know

307
00:20:18.721 --> 00:20:23.410
those things for everybody,
right?
You could go on and on in this list and so you,

308
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.060
one individual might be more sensitive to doses of the drug than another.

309
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.810
If you're introducing all the drug at one time intravenously,

310
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.470
the potential for an unwanted response is higher.

311
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.940
It's a risk of infection because you're introducing something directly into the

312
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:43.930
bloodstream if it's not done properly and it's not comfortable,
right?
I mean,

313
00:20:43.931 --> 00:20:48.280
not most people don't want to have an intravenous injection,
right?

314
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:53.020
And so,
uh,
you might not do it in cases where even if it would benefit you.

315
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:58.300
And so those are disadvantages,
right?
Um,

316
00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.800
but it's,
it's,
uh,

317
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.830
but it's a very safe and effective and useful motive administration for some

318
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:08.530
kinds of compounds.
For example,
for antibiotics,

319
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.360
if you happen to have what's called sepsis or an infection that's spread into

320
00:21:13.361 --> 00:21:14.350
your bloodstream,

321
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.940
one of the only ways to combat those infections effectively is to introduce

322
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:20.860
antibiotics directly into the bloodstream.

323
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.130
Intravenous infusion is a similar,
it's a similar mode,

324
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.270
but now instead of a onetime injection with an intravenous injection,

325
00:21:31.271 --> 00:21:35.110
you have a syringe full of drug,
a needle in the,
in the,

326
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.280
in the circulatory system,
and you introduce the drug all at once in infusion,

327
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:44.281
you slowly pump the drug in and you might be pumping it in continuously over a

328
00:21:44.471 --> 00:21:49.420
long period of time,
maybe over hours or over days.
And,
uh,

329
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.430
so sometimes this is done,
you've seen on TV shows,
you know,

330
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:58.130
a bag of a solution hanging up on,
uh,
on a,
uh,

331
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:03.070
on a pole and,
uh,
and a tube going into a patient's arm.
And so this is,

332
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:03.460
uh,

333
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:08.460
an infusion where the infusion is driven by the gravity flow of fluid through

334
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:15.820
the tube into the,
into,
um,
into the patient's blood vessel,

335
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.920
right?
That's one example of an infusion.

336
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.420
Other examples are there might be a pump involved.

337
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:26.860
At some point you have a pump in between the bag of fluid and the,

338
00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.280
and the needle that goes into the arm.

339
00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:35.550
And in this way you can control the flow much more carefully,

340
00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.100
right?
You can control the flow much more carefully.

341
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:44.340
So one example of where that's done in the hospital is the molecule Heparin,

342
00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.210
which is an anticoagulant and it's needed for,
um,

343
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:54.340
for certain patients who are at risk of having blood clots,
for example.

344
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.150
And this might be um,
um,

345
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.120
they might be at risk for blood clots for a variety of reasons,

346
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:03.490
but you introduced the molecule Heparin,

347
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.090
which reduces the likelihood that clots will form only.

348
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.370
You need to have a continuous level of Heparin.

349
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:14.880
You need to have that Heprin concentration continuously at some level.

350
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:20.260
And so you continuously infuse it directly into the,
into the,

351
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.020
um,
into the circulatory system.

352
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:28.290
Now this is a very effective method for administering drugs because you're

353
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:34.891
slowly adding the drug and you're watching to see what concentration is

354
00:23:36.161 --> 00:23:40.330
maintained in the person and you're adjusting the rate by,

355
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:45.260
by tuning the pump until you get exactly the concentration that you want.

356
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.053
All right?

357
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:52.270
And then you can leave it there and as long as the patient stays roughly the

358
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:56.480
same,
then their concentration will remain roughly the same.

359
00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:01.720
And so you can expose them to a drug over a long period of time and have a

360
00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:05.990
biological effect that's constant over a long period of time.
And that's,

361
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.490
that's very useful in certain situations.
Like this one I've mentioned,

362
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.181
again,

363
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:15.680
it's 100% bio available and you have continuous control over plasma levels.

364
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.701
For example,

365
00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:21.020
what if you knew that the patient was more at risk of developing blood clots at

366
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:21.854
night?

367
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.410
Well then you'd put a programmable pump on it and you'd program the pumps so

368
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:32.390
that the rate of infusion increased during the night and then went down again in

369
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:34.400
the morning.
And in that way,

370
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:38.990
you could increase the concentration of drug at night and then decrease it,
uh,

371
00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:39.980
during the day.

372
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.000
And so you'd only be using the amount of drug that was needed for a biological

373
00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:44.750
effect.

374
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.410
And you'd be adjusting that biological effect for the needs of the patient in a

375
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:50.450
very sort of interactive way.

376
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:55.451
And you can imagine now extending that very simple approach with a needle in the

377
00:24:56.901 --> 00:25:00.780
bloodstream and a pump and a reservoir of fluid,
uh,

378
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.490
to deliver any pattern of drug that was needed for that individual.
Okay.

379
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:09.710
So what's,
what,
what,
why isn't that done all the time?
Well,

380
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:13.310
for the same reasons that intravenous infusion aren't done all the time plus

381
00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:16.940
some because this is even more complex,
right?

382
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.400
And so it requires continuous monitoring.

383
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.220
And so there have to be people there in case there is some unexpected event,
uh,

384
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.040
in order to turn off the pump or to adjust the flow.

385
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:31.250
And so that really requires hospitalization in most cases.

386
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:35.390
Now we're going to get the point next time we talk about some examples of

387
00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:38.130
infusion using pumps that can be,
uh,

388
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.460
that can be worn by individuals.

389
00:25:40.461 --> 00:25:45.310
They can leave the hospital with these pumps either implanted within them or uh,

390
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:50.150
or,
or,
or strapped to their belt for example.
But in general,

391
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:53.330
that's done only in unusual situations.

392
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.360
Subcutaneous injection and intramuscular injection are similar to intravenous

393
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:01.580
injection and that it's an injection from a needle.

394
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:04.400
It's a onetime introduce all the drug at once,

395
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.630
but you're putting the needle in a different place instead of intentionally

396
00:26:08.631 --> 00:26:12.530
putting the needle into,
into a vein so that you introduced drug into the blood.

397
00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.960
You put it either in a muscle,

398
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:20.570
right and you could feel like a muscle mass of your arm,
uh,
or um,
or,
or,
or,

399
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:23.630
or your backside if you've ever had an injection there.

400
00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:26.210
They don't do this so commonly anymore.
I'm not sure why,

401
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:31.310
but I can imagine why but,
but um,
but uh,
in,
into a,

402
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:31.901
into a,

403
00:26:31.901 --> 00:26:35.810
a muscle mass and then the molecules are absorbed from that muscle into the

404
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:39.760
blood or subcutaneously is subcutaneous cutaneous.

405
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.040
The skin sub is under.
This is an injection under the skin.

406
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.070
And so you could pull up on your skin a little flap.

407
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:50.160
You can sort of pull it away from the muscle and you'd insert the needle under

408
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:55.110
there and introduce a little reservoir of a drug solution underneath the skin.

409
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.550
Um,

410
00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:01.550
now this is how a diabetics administer insulin to themselves.

411
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.250
Usually they put a needle into the muscle and they inject a,

412
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.510
um,
a,
uh,
uh,

413
00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.830
a volume of an insulin containing solution into the muscle space.

414
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.830
I say on this sheet here,
that bio availability in that case is usually high.

415
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:20.490
Why is it,

416
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.330
why do you think bio Avila be able to be as high bioavailability is high for

417
00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:26.580
these,
uh,
particular modes?

418
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.580
Why is it high for intermuscular injection?

419
00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:38.710
And it might be 80% or 90%.
So it's not a hundred,

420
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.170
but it's pretty high.
Why is that?

421
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:51.060
How does the drug get into the blood from there?
If I injected into muscle,

422
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.320
Justin?
Yeah,
so,

423
00:28:03.321 --> 00:28:07.760
so your muscle is being perfused by blood all the time,
right?
It gets blood flow.

424
00:28:07.761 --> 00:28:09.350
There's,
there's arteries going in,

425
00:28:09.351 --> 00:28:12.440
capillary networks and veins that are collecting blood.

426
00:28:12.441 --> 00:28:15.290
So there's a very rich blood supply in muscle.

427
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:20.450
And so you injected into the muscle tissue and the drug just sort of percolates

428
00:28:20.451 --> 00:28:24.860
in or diffuses in to the blood vessels that are already there.

429
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:25.730
Now,

430
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:30.050
the effects tend to last longer than an intravenous administration because it

431
00:28:30.051 --> 00:28:34.850
takes some time for the drugs to move from this reservoir where you've injected

432
00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:36.890
them,
this little depot in the muscle,

433
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.810
it takes some time for the drugs to move into your bloodstream,
right?

434
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.140
And so you get a prolonged effect because of that,

435
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.780
not all of the drug is available at once.

436
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.120
You also don't get all the drug in because some of it is metabolized locally or

437
00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:57.650
it doesn't go into the blood vessels at all.
And so it doesn't get distributed.

438
00:28:57.651 --> 00:28:59.900
So bioavailability is not 100%,

439
00:28:59.901 --> 00:29:04.901
but it's often pretty high and it's not as hazardous because you're not actually

440
00:29:05.571 --> 00:29:10.460
introducing a needle into a vein.
It can be done,

441
00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.120
uh,
by,
um,
by,
uh,
individuals at home.

442
00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.160
And so diabetics can do this,
they can do it several times a day.
Um,

443
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:24.830
and,
uh,
but it's still uncomfortable and most people don't want to do it.

444
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.890
And you wouldn't do it if there was an alternative.
Right?

445
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.390
So why is there no alternative for insulin?
Why,

446
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.280
why do diabetics do it this way?

447
00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:37.990
Why did they inject insulin in this way?

448
00:29:37.991 --> 00:29:41.080
And I think most of you could understand that they would prefer not,

449
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.870
but would they prefer to do?

450
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.340
If you were a diabetic patient and you needed insulin,

451
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:53.110
what would you prefer to do?
Kate,
you prefer to take a pill,
right?

452
00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:57.250
You prefer to take a pill.
And that's the next one on the list is,
is oral.

453
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.860
Um,
uh,
administration.

454
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:03.520
You prefer to take a pill but you can't with insulin because insulin is a

455
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:04.354
protein.

456
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.640
Insulin is a protein that is digested in the,
uh,

457
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.930
in the intestinal tract.
And that's one of the functions of our,

458
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.500
of our gut is to digest foods that we,

459
00:30:17.501 --> 00:30:22.130
that we eat foods that contain proteins for example.
And so your,

460
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.420
your intestinal system is very efficient at breaking down proteins into their

461
00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:29.230
constituent amino acids.

462
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.250
And it does that so that you can extract amino acids from food and use them for

463
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:36.310
other things.
If the,

464
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.440
if a protein is a drug,

465
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.180
you need it to enter the bloodstream without being broken down.

466
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.300
When it's broken down,
it doesn't have the effect any longer.

467
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.600
And so insulin can't be delivered orally,

468
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.350
primarily because it's digested,
uh,

469
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.990
within the stomach and small intestine before it's absorbed.

470
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.240
Um,
another problem with,
uh,

471
00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:06.241
with developing a pill or oral forms of insulin is that large molecules like

472
00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:09.640
insulin,
which is a protein,

473
00:31:09.641 --> 00:31:14.641
has a molecular weight of about 5,000 are not absorbed very easily through the

474
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.270
intestinal wall.
And we talked about this several weeks ago.

475
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.900
Your intestinal wall is a,
it's a tube,

476
00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.830
it's a tube that the surface of the tube is made up of a continuous sheet or

477
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:30.700
monolayer of cells.
And these cells are connected by tight junctions.

478
00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.630
Remember that picture I showed you several weeks ago,
and because of that,

479
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:38.890
for a molecule to enter,
it has to be able to go through that monolayer of cells.

480
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:44.650
So even if insulin wasn't broken down to its constituent molecules,

481
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.210
it couldn't be absorbed very easily because it's a large molecule and only

482
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:54.211
molecules that are small and relatively lipid soluble can go through monolayers

483
00:31:55.421 --> 00:31:58.990
of cells like the epithelium of the intestine,
right?

484
00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:03.990
So there's two reasons why insulin is not very bioavailable when it's given

485
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:07.760
orally,
right?

486
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:11.960
And that's one way of saying insulin doesn't end up in the blood,
right?

487
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.010
Insulin is not bioavailable when delivered orally.

488
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:19.330
Some drugs are aspirin,
Acetaminophen,
Ibuprofen,

489
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:24.340
things that you might take routinely for muscle aches or headaches are,

490
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:27.430
are available orally.
They're small molecules.
They aren't,

491
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.680
they aren't digested appreciably or only a fraction of them are,

492
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:33.550
are,

493
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:38.020
are digested so that if you take 10 milligrams,

494
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.770
maybe five milligrams of them are not broken down in the gut and can be

495
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:46.550
absorbed,
right?
So,
uh,

496
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:50.450
one of the problems with oral administration is that drugs are degraded before

497
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:54.380
they're absorbed into the body.
Now we could tolerate that with aspirin.

498
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.770
And why do you think that's acceptable with aspirin?

499
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.550
To have some fraction of it broken down in the body,

500
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:05.510
broken down in the gut before it's absorbed.
Why is that acceptable?

501
00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:17.160
How much does aspirin cost?
Not very much.

502
00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:19.920
You don't think about it when you go buy a yellow,

503
00:33:19.921 --> 00:33:24.420
a couple of tablets of aspirin or you go buy a bottle of aspirin or Ibuprofen

504
00:33:24.421 --> 00:33:27.150
because it,
it costs something,
but it doesn't cost so much.

505
00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:32.450
And so if you had to pay two times as much because you lost half of it because

506
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:36.420
it was degraded before it got absorbed,
that might be okay,
right?

507
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:40.440
Because you're more likely to use it because it's a pill and not an injection

508
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:44.040
and you're willing to pay more for that convenience.
Right?

509
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.840
And so often,
uh,
drugs that are orally administered,

510
00:33:48.841 --> 00:33:50.940
they're not a hundred percent bio available,

511
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:52.980
only a fraction of it gets into your blood,

512
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.690
but they're molecules that can be produced cheaply enough that you can still

513
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.140
take a,
a dose that's larger than what you would need.

514
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.540
Knowing that half of it is not going to enter your body.
All right.

515
00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:07.210
Does that make sense?
Uh,

516
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.280
the other thing about about aspirin is that,
um,
it's,
it's,
um,

517
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:16.020
it's an,
it's not aspirin.
I'll use aspirin as an example,

518
00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:20.910
realizing that nobody uses aspirin for headaches anymore.
But,
uh,

519
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:21.773
but,
uh,
it's a,

520
00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:26.780
it's a good example because it's a molecule that's very safe and a safe drug is

521
00:34:28.081 --> 00:34:33.081
one in which the concentration at which it causes toxic effects is much higher

522
00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:38.910
than the concentration at which it causes good effects or the effect that you

523
00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:39.744
want.

524
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.470
So we know an aspirin that if you get your concentration up to a certain level,

525
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.910
your headache will go away.

526
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:52.220
You'd have to get a much higher level in your blood before you began to see side

527
00:34:52.221 --> 00:34:56.390
effects or unwanted effects.
And in,
um,
in aspirin,

528
00:34:56.391 --> 00:35:00.650
those side effects are that your ears start to ring because it starts to affect,

529
00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.090
uh,
the,
um,

530
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.170
your mechanisms of hearing the cells within your,

531
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.500
within your cochlea start to be affected by concentrations of the drug at a

532
00:35:09.501 --> 00:35:13.880
certain level.
But you have to take a lot in order to get up there,
right?

533
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:19.060
So this difference between an effective dose and a toxic dose is very important

534
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:22.720
for,
uh,

535
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.140
for drugs and drugs that have a big difference between the safe dose and the

536
00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:32.141
effective dose are ones that you can give to patients and trust them to take

537
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:33.944
safely.

538
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.880
You can imagine if the toxic dose was very close to the effective dose,

539
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.930
that might not be a drug that you would want to have patients administering

540
00:35:42.931 --> 00:35:43.764
themselves.

541
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:49.050
Because what if they accidentally take one too many pills or they take them too

542
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:53.220
close together?
Right?
They could produce toxic side effects.

543
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.640
So aspirin is an example where you have a big window between effective and toxic

544
00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:00.271
chemotherapy.

545
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:05.271
Drugs are drugs where there's a very narrow window between effective and toxic.

546
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.240
And so those are usually given with the,
um,

547
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:14.310
with the help and guidance of a physician.
Okay.

548
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.403
Um,

549
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:22.550
there's a similar motive administration called a sublingual or buckle.

550
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:27.390
And here,
um,
here the drug is not swallowed.
It's taken in the mouth,

551
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.730
but it's,
but you,

552
00:36:28.731 --> 00:36:33.180
you hold the pill or the capsule underneath your tongue and you allow it to

553
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:34.140
dissolve there.

554
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:39.890
And so the drug is enters your body because it's absorbed through the membranes

555
00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:44.220
in your mouth,
particularly the membranes under your tongue.

556
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:48.360
And this is a common mode of administration for Nitroglycerin.

557
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.990
If you have grandparents or,
or,
or,

558
00:36:51.991 --> 00:36:56.280
or friends who are older and have certain kinds of heart disease where they get

559
00:36:56.281 --> 00:37:00.630
chest pain,
they might carry with them tablets of Nitroglycerin.

560
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.940
And if they begin to experience pain,

561
00:37:02.941 --> 00:37:06.630
they'll put one of these tablets underneath their tongue and they'll let it

562
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:11.310
dissolve.
And there's a number of reasons for doing this.

563
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:15.300
And the most important one is that,
um,
when,

564
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:17.130
when you're taking a drug orally,

565
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:22.430
you're taking advantage of the mechanisms that your body has for getting food

566
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.340
and nutrients and you're using those mechanisms to get a drug.

567
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:30.360
When you're,
when,

568
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:34.740
when molecules are absorbed through your intestine,
they,
uh,

569
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:36.930
they go through the intestinal wall,

570
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.140
they enter the blood stream that surrounds the intestine,

571
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.380
and then the way that your anatomy is set up,

572
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.250
all of the blood flow from your intestine goes directly to your liver.

573
00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.740
It goes directly to your liver and from your liver.

574
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.820
It goes back into the Vena Cava and then to the heart.
Now why,

575
00:37:55.970 --> 00:38:00.970
why would you design a system like that where all the blood from your intestine

576
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.760
goes right to your liver?
First,
Justin

577
00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:10.700
purifying and processing of the stuff that comes from the intestine,

578
00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:15.560
stuff like food,
nutrients that are extracted from food,
sugars,

579
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:20.000
fats,
proteins,
right,
that are extracted from food that goes to your liver.

580
00:38:20.001 --> 00:38:21.050
Why do they go to your liver?

581
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:25.850
Because your liver is a very important metabolic organ and it is important for

582
00:38:25.851 --> 00:38:28.850
processing proteins and fats and sugars.

583
00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.380
And so by sending all those molecules that are absorbed from the intestine into

584
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.820
the liver,
first,
you get,
uh,

585
00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:39.850
you a jumpstart on processing of these molecules into the substrates that you

586
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:42.280
need for life,
right?

587
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.200
So that's a really good setup for nutrition.
But I also mentioned,

588
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:52.230
remember that biotransformation or breakdown of drugs often occurs in the liver.

589
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.170
And so if drugs are absorbed the same way that food is,

590
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.790
they go right to the liver.

591
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.480
And I'm pointing here because that's where my liver is,
right?

592
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.080
They go right to the liver and your liver starts to break it down right away

593
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.600
before it even gets to your bloodstream really,

594
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.610
before it circulates to the rest of your body.

595
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:14.590
And so I lose a fraction of drug because it's degraded within the gut.

596
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:19.000
I lose a fraction because it can't absorb very rapidly and I lose another

597
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:22.660
fraction because the liver breaks it down before it ever gets back to my heart.

598
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.470
Right?
And then your heart can circulate it.
Well,

599
00:39:26.471 --> 00:39:28.630
it turns out that the blood supply to the,

600
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.700
to the membranes in your mouth don't go to the liver.
It's,
it's unusual.

601
00:39:33.701 --> 00:39:38.170
They go directly into the superior Vena Cava and into your heart.

602
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:43.710
And so drug molecules that are absorbed in your mouth bypass the liver and they

603
00:39:45.011 --> 00:39:49.000
go directly to your,
the rest of your body first.
And then of course,

604
00:39:49.001 --> 00:39:52.270
they're going to end up in the liver as things get circulated around,

605
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.600
but they avoid going to deliver the first time.

606
00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.930
And that's called here on this graph,

607
00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.140
avoiding first pass metabolism in the liver.

608
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.740
This metabolism that occurs on the first shot right from the intestine is called

609
00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:09.160
first pass metabolism.

610
00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:14.400
Nitroglycerin would be very readily broken down in the liver and so this way it

611
00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:19.510
goes directly to the heart without ever having to pass through the liver and it

612
00:40:19.511 --> 00:40:23.260
can,
it can quickly treat heart disease.
Now,

613
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.960
why don't you do that with all sorts of things?
Uh,
well,
uh,

614
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.410
it only works for certain kinds of compounds,

615
00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:33.190
compounds that can be absorbed through those membranes in your mouth.

616
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.020
So they have to be very lipid soluble.

617
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.280
They also have to be very potent because one difference between your mouth and

618
00:40:39.281 --> 00:40:44.120
the intestine is that the surface area in your mouth is fairly small,
right?

619
00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:48.160
The surface area in your mouth is fairly small and so only a limited number of

620
00:40:48.161 --> 00:40:52.270
drugs can absorb through.
Whereas why is your intestine so long?

621
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.950
You know,
that your intestinal says he took it out and stretched it out.

622
00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:01.120
It would be a two,
but continuous tube that's about 30 feet long.

623
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.880
Why is your intestine that long packed into this small space so that it can have

624
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:11.350
a big surface area to absorb?
Lots of stuff.
All right.

625
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:16.300
Big surface area,
lots of absorption,
small surface area,
little absorption.

626
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.700
So it has to be a very potent drug in order to be absorbed at a sufficient

627
00:41:21.701 --> 00:41:25.180
concentration through this,
uh,
through this limited space.

628
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:30.280
So I think those are the main concepts that I wanted to introduce by thinking

629
00:41:30.281 --> 00:41:32.320
about these different methods of administration.

630
00:41:32.321 --> 00:41:36.220
There's more of them listed here.
Um,
some of them have to do with what,
what,

631
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:41.090
what Kaitlin mentioned,
if you want,
if you want a drug that works in the eye,

632
00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.040
for example,
a drug to treat glaucoma,

633
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.580
why take a drug orally and,

634
00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:51.380
and expose your whole body to the drug when you could just put drops in your eye

635
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:55.490
directly.
And that's how many glaucoma drugs are delivered.

636
00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:00.080
You might have eyedrops that you just put into the space underneath your eye,

637
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.190
for example.
Right.

638
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.480
And that's a more targeted delivery targeted because you are putting the drug at

639
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:11.600
the site where it's needed.
I'm sure you have examples of that.
You know,

640
00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:16.660
topical ointments like a antibacterial cream that you might put on something.

641
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.180
If you have a cut and you want to keep it from being infected,

642
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:24.620
you don't take antibiotics by mouth and have them all over your body.

643
00:42:24.621 --> 00:42:29.510
You put a little topical treatment on the site because you're targeting the drug

644
00:42:29.511 --> 00:42:30.920
to the site that you need.

645
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

646
00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:40.290
<v 0>And on the next slide,
there's some other more uncommon modes of administration.</v>

647
00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.920
Um,
rectal,
transdermal vaginal.

648
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.680
We won't talk very much about those.
Um,

649
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:51.360
but now and next week we'll talk about a special kinds of drug delivery systems

650
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:56.250
that are useful for certain kinds of administration.
Um,
like,
um,

651
00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:01.050
um,
um,
what are called controlled release implants.

652
00:43:01.051 --> 00:43:02.130
We'll talk about next time.

653
00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:03.723
<v 1>Okay.</v>

654
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.790
<v 0>Okay.
But I want to,
I,
I,</v>

655
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.590
I've given you a lot of words and I've tried to introduce a lot of concepts by

656
00:43:09.591 --> 00:43:11.300
thinking about things that you know about.

657
00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.060
I want to try to put this in some framework that allows you to think about a

658
00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:19.400
quantitatively what it means,
what these factors mean.

659
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.730
And so we're going to introduce drugs into a patient.

660
00:43:22.731 --> 00:43:27.050
And what we would like to know is how rapidly do those drugs become available,

661
00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.660
what fraction of the drugs become available,

662
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:33.740
and how long does the one dose we give last?

663
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.670
And as I mentioned,
that's complicated,
right?

664
00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:42.850
Complicated because our anatomy is complicated and complicated because we're all

665
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.980
different individuals and our anatomy and physiology differs.

666
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:51.040
And so it's a hard thing to do to describe how even one particular kind of drug

667
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:56.420
acts in a population of people is difficult.
And so we have to start somewhere.

668
00:43:56.421 --> 00:43:58.400
So we're going to start with a simplification.

669
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:03.670
And that simplification is that these complex things people can be represented

670
00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:09.760
by very simple
constructs.

671
00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.930
And the simple construct that I show here is that instead of a person,

672
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.080
we're going to consider the person to be a well stirred vat of liquid water,

673
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:24.940
for example.
Now how can,
how can you get away with that?

674
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:30.190
Well,
one way to say we can get away with it is that we are mostly water,
right?

675
00:44:30.191 --> 00:44:32.430
Our bodies are 90 water.
And so,

676
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.270
and so if you wanted to describe us sort of in the simplest possible way,

677
00:44:36.271 --> 00:44:39.750
we're water.
That's largely what we are.
We're structured water.

678
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:44.160
We've watered with a particular kind of shape and form,
but we're largely water.

679
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:48.540
And so we could describe where drugs go in the body by just thinking about how

680
00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:49.650
they dissolve in water.

681
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.700
And all you'd need to know is what's the volume of the water.

682
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:57.660
So if I give a dose,
what concentration do you get?
I give 10 milligrams.

683
00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:02.280
If your volume is five liters,
what's the concentration you achieve inside?

684
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.750
What did I say?
10 milligrams?
I forgot what number I said.
No,

685
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:11.040
10 milligrams divided by five liters,
two milligrams per liter.

686
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:17.070
That's the concentration.
And uh,
that,
that,
that's the simplest way to define it.

687
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:20.820
Now how can I get away with saying that we're well stirred and I indicate that

688
00:45:20.821 --> 00:45:24.420
in this,
in this simple drawing by having a,
this is a propeller,

689
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:26.160
that stirring the VAT of liquid.

690
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.060
How can I get away with saying we're well stirred?
Well,

691
00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:33.930
in some senses we are.
That's what our circulatory system does.

692
00:45:33.931 --> 00:45:37.500
And I'm going to talk about that in,
um,
in the weeks to come.

693
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.460
But our heart is a very effective,
uh,

694
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.790
our heart and our blood vessels are very effective system for distributing

695
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:49.210
molecules very rapidly throughout a large volume.
And so we are,
uh,

696
00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:53.280
we are stirred,
we are well stirred in certain senses.

697
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:57.510
Now you could object to this simple model for lots of different reasons,

698
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.020
but we're going to start with it because it's a very simple place to start.

699
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.230
And we're going to say then that we admit when we administer a drug,

700
00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:09.410
we're introducing a drug into this well stirred that of water that has a

701
00:46:10.141 --> 00:46:13.260
particular volume and we're going to administer some dos and we're going to

702
00:46:13.261 --> 00:46:17.430
produce some concentration.
And now what happens afterwards?

703
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:22.140
Does that concentration stay the same forever?
No,
it,

704
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.340
it doesn't because we,
our body has mechanisms for getting rid of drugs.

705
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.510
And we're going to describe that in our simple model by having an Arrow pointing

706
00:46:30.511 --> 00:46:34.260
out that tells you how,
um,

707
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:39.420
how that tells you that drugs are eliminated when they're within your body.

708
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:43.800
And we're going to make this a very simple process.

709
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:48.801
Also and say that drugs are eliminated in proportion to their concentration

710
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.420
in proportion to their concentrations.
So the more drug you have,

711
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.650
the faster it gets eliminated and as you have less and less drug,

712
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:03.450
it gets eliminated more slowly.
Now this,
uh,
this,

713
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:08.130
uh,
the simplest way to describe this is to say that the rate

714
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:10.710
<v 2>okay</v>

715
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.180
<v 0>of disappearance</v>

716
00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.860
of a drug is equal to some constant times the concentration,

717
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:24.910
the rate of disappearance of a drug is equal to some constant times the

718
00:47:24.911 --> 00:47:25.780
concentration.

719
00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.920
And this constant is called a constant.

720
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.920
And this is the concentration that would be within the body,
right?

721
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:40.270
This is a first order equation,
right?

722
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.440
It means that the rate at which the drug is eliminated is proportional to

723
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:49.441
concentration to the first power or linear with concentration as drug

724
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:54.970
concentration goes down.
SinceK is a constant for any particular drug,

725
00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.240
it's,
it's one number.

726
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:03.570
As the concentration drops from two milligrams per liter to one milligram per

727
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:08.500
liter,
the rate that your body eliminates it goes down by half as well.

728
00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.180
I like to think about this as as um,
uh,

729
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.990
you could think about concentration as money in your wallet,
right?

730
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.010
And the rate at which I spend money anyway is proportional to the amount that I

731
00:48:21.011 --> 00:48:25.330
have in my wallet as like when I have more,
I spend more.
When I have less,

732
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:28.930
I spend less.
And the last dollar goes very slowly,
right?

733
00:48:28.931 --> 00:48:32.950
The same thing here.
When you have a lot of concentration,
it gives your body,

734
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:37.590
gets rid of it fast and but the last molecules go out very slowly.
Okay.

735
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:44.190
If we take this simple model and then apply it and we introduced a dose directly

736
00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:46.780
into the body.

737
00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:51.781
Now this well stirred vat and we say that it has some volume and we say that

738
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:56.881
drug is eliminated with some rate constant k we could derive a simple equation

739
00:48:57.041 --> 00:48:58.750
and this is derived in the book,
in the,

740
00:48:58.751 --> 00:49:03.100
in the box at the back of the chapter that would tell us how concentration

741
00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:06.370
varies with time.
And that equation is shown here.

742
00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:10.030
The concentration is equal to the dose that I introduced,

743
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:14.560
which is m sub zero time divided by the volume of the body,

744
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.710
times e to the minus Kt,

745
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.550
whereK is this rate constant for disappearance of the drug.

746
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:22.990
Now if you don't understand,

747
00:49:22.991 --> 00:49:26.050
when you look at the book where this equation comes from,
it,

748
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:29.540
that's not important.
Some of you will and some of you won't.
Uh,

749
00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:32.230
but you could trust me that,
uh,

750
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:37.231
that this is the equation that results from those simple assumptions that I

751
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:39.543
talked about.

752
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:45.010
So c is the concentration that's available in your bloodstream or in this vat of

753
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.530
fluid that's available for action.

754
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.770
And M zero is the amount that's introduced.
And remember,

755
00:49:50.771 --> 00:49:55.480
I introduced it in a special way.
I injected it right into the body.

756
00:49:55.930 --> 00:50:00.220
I injected it all into the body,
the whole dose at time t equals zero.

757
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:05.110
I introduced it all into the body at once.
So it was all available to circulate.

758
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.380
That assumes the bioavailability is 100% and that I've introduced it all at one

759
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.910
particular time.
Right?

760
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.000
So what is this really a representation of?

761
00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:20.890
It's a representation of intravenous injection where I have a syringe and I

762
00:50:20.891 --> 00:50:25.240
inject all of the drug at once.
And in that case,

763
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:29.030
what this equation tells you is that the concentration immediately after you

764
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:34.031
inject the drug is the highest and after that it continually goes down and it

765
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:40.040
goes down in an exponential fashion with a,
with a,
um,

766
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:44.150
with a time course.
That depends on this constant k.

767
00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:46.850
Now does that make sense?

768
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:51.890
If I have intravenous administration of a drug that's eliminated by a first

769
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:54.920
order process,
as soon as I administer it,

770
00:50:54.921 --> 00:50:59.870
the concentration is a peak and after that it goes down and the rate at which it

771
00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:03.440
goes down depends on this rate constant.
K

772
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:09.140
and what I also show you here is that if I,
if I plugged into this equation,

773
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:13.160
I asked the question,
when does the concentration go down by a factor of two,

774
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.400
when does it go down by 50% I would look on this graph here and say 50% of the

775
00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:20.960
drug has gone by this time.

776
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:26.090
I could calculate that time at which the drug concentration goes down by half

777
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.410
and that's equal to the natural log of two over k.
This rate constant here.

778
00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:35.420
So when this number is smaller,
the half life is longer,

779
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.153
<v 1>right?</v>

780
00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:41.380
<v 0>So molecules with a high k are eliminated rapidly.</v>

781
00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:45.640
Molecules with a low k are eliminated slowly and uh,

782
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:50.380
and that half life is a good measure of how long the drug activity lasts in your

783
00:51:50.381 --> 00:51:50.681
body.

784
00:51:50.681 --> 00:51:55.510
It's a good way of thinking about how long I'd have to wait before I needed

785
00:51:55.511 --> 00:51:57.040
another dose,
for example.

786
00:51:58.810 --> 00:51:59.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

787
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:02.410
<v 0>What this graph shows you here is just plotted on a semi log plot.</v>

788
00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:06.540
The difference between these curbs,
if I had drugs with different halflife,

789
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.990
a drug with a half life of 600 minutes lasts a long time,
right?

790
00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:16.330
Concentration doesn't drop until a long time,
as many,
many hours.

791
00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.460
If it has a half life of 60 minutes,

792
00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:23.320
concentration drops to 10% of its initial level after a few hours.

793
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.280
And if I have a drug with a half life of six minutes,

794
00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:32.280
concentration drops to 10% of its initial level after only,
uh,

795
00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:34.440
only a few minutes.
And so,
uh,

796
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:38.620
we're going to take this model and extended next time and talk about more

797
00:52:38.621 --> 00:52:42.550
complicated modes of administration and talk about sort of new forms of drug

798
00:52:42.551 --> 00:52:46.480
delivery,
uh,
forms that you can expect to see in the next,
uh,

799
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:47.620
in the next few years.
