Speaker 1:          00:01          Samuel Johnson in his, uh, in the life of Milton and that, that's the life of Milton included in the packet. Um, but I've also included this on the handout. A Dr. Johnson wrote that paradise lost is one of those books which the reader admirers and lays down and forgets to take up again. And we're, we're, we're used to this, we've read enough Johnson to, to recognize a characteristic curmudgeonly, curmudgeonly nest when it comes to the subject of Milton. But I think there's something to this idea that we forget to take paradise lost up again after we've laid it down. Because to say that paradise lost is, is not exactly a page Turner is simply to say that we're already familiar with the plot. We know of course, how the story ends. And there's nothing for us in terms of the plot, at least to anticipate with all that much eagerness and our for knowledge of the stories and works continually, I think to reinforce our sense of God's fore knowledge of, of the end of the story.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And of course for knowledge of any kind, uh, makes the end seem inevitable. And, and I think the inevitability of an ending puts me Milton, uh, this idea, it puts Milton and a terrible bind. Any sense of the inevitability of the fall really makes it, it just makes hash, it makes nonsense of the notion of any strong sense of any strong feeling of Adams and Eve's freewill. And if, and if we're disappointed with the ending of paradise lost. And I think it's safe to say that Milton to is deeply troubled by the implications of an end. And so it's for, it's for all of these reasons that we can say that paradise lost is obsessed with the problem of its own, the problem of its own ending. Now we remember that Milton had devoted enormous sums of energy as a young man and anticipating his, his own, and he was contingent continually looking ahead to the, to the writing of a, of a poem that after times would not willingly let die.

Speaker 1:          02:04          You'll remember that, uh, that sentence from the reason of church government in the, in the 1640s, he looked ahead to a con, a political future in which the reformed government would usher in the reign of Christ at the end of time. And his early poems are filled with brief lyric narratives of, of anticipation. I'll, I'll just enumerate a few of those or will remind you of them. The Ne they naitivity owed had anticipated a few times. The apocalypse comas had anticipated, well had anticipated that the apocalypse as well, but it also anticipated the eventual marriage of the lady, uh, enlisted us anticipated among so many other things. The undying fame of the, of the poet and Adam too, in and books 11 and 12, Adam seems continually to be anticipating an ending, like, like the Speaker of the Nativity yoed Adam's always looking ahead to the Christian millennium or the, or the apocalypse and he's jumping ahead of himself. And Michael has always chiding him for this, for this enthusiasm. And Michael, it's as if Michael's job is to put the brakes on Adams anticipatory excitement.

Speaker 2:          03:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Given that role that Michael plays, I think it's all the more remarkable that it's Michael. This is our kill joy archangel who's just as bad, who's often just as bad as Adam in his own eagerness to jump ahead of himself as he tells the story of Michael himself is the angel of apocalypse from the book of revelation, as we learned from, from David's lecture on Friday. Um, that's the, the book of revelation is the book from which Milton has taken has lifted this character Michael and perhaps of his role in, in revelation, the Michael of Paradise lost seems incapable of keeping himself from the onrush of expectation as he narrates, as he narrates and what I'm supposed should be chronological order. But isn't that the story of future history? So Michael will narrate the story of the apocalypse. Four, count them four times over the course of the last books, once in a once in [inaudible] 11 and three times in book 12. And in all of this eagerness to, to, to imagine the final fulfillment of, of, of history, Michael seems almost in some way to be parodying Milton Zone tendency, his specialty, his own youthful tendency to offer those, uh, prophetic narratives of anticipation.

Speaker 2:          04:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:37          Now, Mike is, Michael's focused in the last two books is on God's,

Speaker 2:          04:41          okay.

Speaker 1:          04:42          He's essentially on God's providential control over the actions of the descendants of Adam and eve. And so it's not, it's not too difficult to see why these, why these books just structurally, um, are, are, are, are so troubling. Uh, Milton is in the incredibly awkward position of trying to reconcile divine providence with the, with the notion of freewill. This has been his challenge all along. And this is also the subject of a lot of Milton's musings in the theological treatise that he wrote at the same time that he wrote paradise lost the, the Christian doctrine. And, uh, so I'm going to have you turn in your Hughes, uh, to page nine 84 in the, in the Christian doctrine. Um, Milton devotes an entire chapter to the, to the problem of the seeming incompatibilities of divine providence and human freewill. And he finds himself continually knocking up against the representation of the providential God that he finds in the, that he finds in the Bible.

Speaker 1:          05:44          So this is a Christian doctrine. This is page nine 84 this is where Milton tries to carve out a space for freewill and the face of so much contrary evidence in scripture. This is on the, the top of the right hand column, I believe this is, yes, this is also on the handout. Okay. Milton speaking on a speaking about divine providence, which is obviously on some level, it's a sensitive subject, maybe a sore subject for such a strong believer in human freewill. And he's quoting here the scriptural accounts of the voluntary, what he calls the voluntary actions of the deity. Those moments in which God is acting out of his own inscrutable will. So here we have Melton. I'm acting writing very systematically voluntary actions. Second chronicles 10 15, this is an example. So the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was of God.

Speaker 1:          06:40          And then again from proverbs, a man's heart divides us this way, but Jehovah Directeth, his steps and man's goings are of Jehovah and the King's heart is at the hand of Jehovah as the river rivers of water. He turneth it, whither soever he will. And this from Jeremiah, Oh Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself. Now why, why would Milton do this? Why would he cite these that beside these scriptures for, from, from Milton's point of view and actually from the point of view of a lot of, uh, a lot of 17th century Christians, they would have, these would have to be bone chilling statements of the absolute divine control over our lives. The verses from scripture, the millstones quoting here at seem to admit of nothing like freewill. And they conjure an image of God who controls us as a puppeteer would control his, his puppets.

Speaker 1:          07:37          And this surely this has to make Milton nervous. And so after quoting instances of divine action, that seemed clearly, I think to counter the idea of the power of human freewill. Milton ads this, and it's utterly sublime in this. However, there is no infringement on the liberty of the human will, otherwise man would be deprived of the power of free agency. Otherwise, um, it's, uh, it's, it's slightly, uh, loose, uh, logic, but it's a, it's extraordinarily heartfelt. Milton is telling us once again that it has to mean what I know it should mean. It wouldn't make sense otherwise. Um, so, so we face his head on the most recalcitrant, recalcitrant passages of the Bible and he simply forces them to mean what he needs them to mean. And this is precisely the challenge that Milton has confronted with in books 11 and 12. The Bible had already written the story of man after the fall and for most of 11 and 12, Milton has really forced to amplify. He has, he's, he's, he's pretty constrained here to amplify and elaborate on the chapters in genesis. This is chapters four through 11 in the book of Genesis that released speed through generations of, in the, in the course of a few pages.

Speaker 2:          08:58          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:59          Now, the most important biblical texts that, uh, to my mind that Milton has to confront is the genesis account of the expulsion. This is the moment at which Adam and Eve are actually forced to lose their paradise. And this is of course, the moment that's heralded the, the loss that's heralded in the poems title. And so I think we have to assume that this, uh, this moment has a privileged position in Milton's poem. So this is the text as it appears in, in Genesis. And I've also included this on the handout.

Speaker 2:          09:30          Okay?

Speaker 1:          09:30          This is all we learn about the expulsion from genesis and the Lord. God said, behold, the man is become as one of us to know good and evil, and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever,

Speaker 2:          09:49          okay?

Speaker 1:          09:50          Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken.

Speaker 2:          09:56          Okay?

Speaker 1:          09:57          So he drove out the man by, by any standard, I think that we could comfortably identify as miltonic. This text portrays a god. That's the, that that's unjustifiable. Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:12          We've seen this argument before though. Um, you'll remember Satan, Satan had accused God of jealousy, uh, when, when Satan was tempting eve. And if Satan was telling you, God doesn't want you to eat the fruit because he doesn't want you to become a God like him, uh, uh, being with the superior knowledge of, of good and evil and [inaudible]. And we of course rallied to dismiss Satan's claim as yet another example of, of, of his tendency to lie and to deceive. But Satan is a, I mean, it seems that Milton Satan has only gotten this idea from the, from the words of God and the book of Genesis itself. What kind of God as genesis portray here, if not that of a vulnerable and in some way desperate deity who doesn't fact punish man out of out of a degree of, uh, of jealousy and maybe even maybe even vengeance. God here has to force Adam and eve out of the garden to keep them from encroaching on any more of his honor, any more of his privileges or of his territory to keep them from achieving the state of the mortality to the only God himself. And joys.

Speaker 1:          11:19          Now, as you can imagine, um, this biblical passage has been troubling to generations of, uh, of readers of the Bible and specially, but bill biblical scholars and, and the 16th century Theologian Calvin was when confronted with his passage was really forced to conclude that God was speaking. Ironically, here he doesn't actually mean w w what are you saying? Oh, you have to say something when you're, uh, when you're dealing with a passage like this. Um, but, but Milton's incredibly scrupulous here, any fields he feels compelled to reproduce this very dark, very dark genesis text in his own story of the expulsion. Uh, look at book 11 of Paradise Lost Line 93 in the Hughes edition. It's page four 35, and this is God speaking less therefore his now boulder hand reach also for the tree of life and to eat and live forever dream at least to live forever.

Speaker 1:          12:21          To remove him. I decree and send him from the Gordon, send him from the garden fourth to till the ground whence he was taken. And this has mean fitters, soil. And Milton depicts a god in this passage. Who has all of those and maybe even then some, oh, those anthropomorphic qualities of the, of the y'all way of so much of genesis and God to hear is distinctly human in personality. And, and he's, he's able without hesitation to intervene in the lives of, in, in the affairs of man, in order to, to effect his desire for punishment. And, and, and I take this to be precisely that type of God that Milton is trying to counteract or to do a way with throughout so much of the Christian doctrine of God who is all encompassing. We'll just steam rolls right over the freewill, the free agency of human individuals.

Speaker 1:          13:21          And, but nonetheless, we have this passage in the poem and you can, uh, it's not hard to see that the moment of expulsion is a crisis, a crisis moment in paradise lost. It's not only that point at which paradise gets lost, it's also that moment I think in which Milton is most hard pressed to, to depict who's a god, whose actions are justifiable, whose, whose behavior can be reconciled with all of the claims of reason that Milton wants to hold him too. And, and it's because of the moment of the actual expulsion is such a crisis that Milton provides us with an alternative understanding of it. Uh, and this, this, I believe this is the conversation between the father and the son at line 45 of book 11 page four 34 of the Hughes. The Sun is just pleaded with the father to show some mercy on the repentant Adam and eve and the father.

Speaker 1:          14:21          It's, it's, it's, it's wonderful. The father argues that he would like, he'd love to be merciful, but there are some things that are simply out of his control. Adam and eve, we'll have to leave the garden. And the, and the justification that God gives for their departure, I think is, is, is, is truly extraordinary. So this is line 48 of book 11 but longer in that paradise to dwell. The law I gave to nature him forbids those pure immortal elements that no, no gross, no unharmonious mixture, foul, eject him tainted now and purge him off as a distemper gross to as gross.

Speaker 2:          15:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:08          And, and, and we suddenly have a rationale for the explosion that's really completely opposed to the account of the explosion that had, that, that begins at line 93 and completely opposed of course to to it's original and the book of Genesis, where did Milton get this? He's made this up and suddenly, um, Milton has a god behaving really very differently. Uh, God is saying, well, I'd love, I'd love for them to stay in paradise, but you see there's nothing I can do. I establish this natural law in Eden whereby the pure immortal elements of paradise necessarily inexorably expel and purge anything a that's foul or tainted. And because of course, the fall bodies of Adam and eve are actually Fallon tainted the atmospheric mechanisms already in place in paradise are in the process as we speak of purging them from the garden. Uh, these, uh, they'll, the lines are, they're beautiful and they're, and they're shocking. Milton puts in God's mouth an explanation for the exposure of an, uh, of Adam and eve that really runs,

Speaker 1:          16:18          deliberately runs counter to the explanation in the book of Genesis and I think completely contradicts the one that God himself had given so publicly to the assembly of angels about 50 or so lines later. And it's an explanation that that completely counters the image of the jealous and vengeful God that, that Milton inherited from scripture. Milton is really resting this poem away, um, from, from its source and skip scripture and he's pushing it toward an entirely new genre. This is something much closer to what we would think of as science fiction. I think then, then any kind of anthropomorphic biblical narrative and, and Milton is taking a tremendous, uh, taking a tremendous risk and to embark on such a fanciful flight of mythmaking at such an incredibly important moment, um, has to be seen as consequential. And, and, and I think that Milton is taking this risk for the purposes of his theodicy.

Speaker 1:          17:18          His need to justify the ways of God to men here at last is an image of the God of God who expels Adam and eve from the garden for an entirely justifiable, a rational reason here at last is an image of a god who's not at all the evil puppeteer who deliberately forces the movements of his, of his human creatures. It's a, it's an entirely benign, it's almost an impersonal God who willingly subject himself to the law, to the law of nature, to the natural moral processes of nature that are inevitably at work in the garden.

Speaker 1:          17:57          This of course isn't the first time that we've encountered, uh, this, this, the, the force of contradiction. I'm in paradise lost throughout the poem. Milton has been opposing a competing notions of God opposing accounts of, of crucial events. Um, you'll remember a Rafi feels account of creation in, in book seven in which Milton had opposed the literal, the, the, the anthropomorphic story of genesis with his own really wildly original. I'm incredibly beautiful. A story of something like a natural self creation. And, and, and, and there are two accounts as I mentioned in the last class to accounts of, of Noah's flood, in, in Michael Zone, in Michael Zone, a history lesson. Events, events are continually being related twice and sometimes even three times in paradise lost. And, and the purpose of these narrative repetitions, um, I think has nothing to do with the Milton's desire to make this poem impenetrable, are just confusing.

Speaker 1:          18:58          Uh, Milton is juxtaposing on something like a systematic level, I think juxtaposing the poems, official, uh, theological reading of events with an alternative, what we can think of as a naturalistic or maybe a more rational reading of events. And He's struggling to represent a more palatable, more rational alternative to the arbitrary anthropomorphic deity who was so capable of jealousy. And these all too human motives, um, that he finds in the book of Genesis. So up to this point in Milton's poem, we really haven't known what to do with, uh, with all, with a lot of these conflicts and contradictions that the poem was presenting us with. Um, conflicting accounts of, of key moments in Christian history just seemed to be held and held in suspension in the, in the text. And it's often difficult to discern what we're supposed to, how we're supposed to interpret the relation between, um, uh, opposing views or among opposing views.

Speaker 1:          20:02          And I think this is a problem that we've been confronting all along is, is one version, right? And the other version and wrong is one version of satanic perspective on these events and the other is a divine view. What's the point of, of all of these oppositions and conflicts? Well, if those are the questions that we're asking and safe to say that Milton in his magnificent genius has already anticipated those, those questions. And I think here in the last books of the poem, Milton is struggling and to some to some effect to make some kind of sense of this problem. Michael presents a theory of reading that on some level can account for some of the confusions of, of paradise lost. And it's the, it's the theory of scriptural interpretation known as topology. Um, and, and, and it had been around for centuries and according to the type of logical interpretation of Christian history, characters and events in the Hebrew Bible, which Christians called the Old Testament, are seen as types of, of characters and events in the New Testament.

Speaker 1:          21:10          And this Mozart motive reading became a way for Christian readers of the Bible to reinterpret everything in the Hebrew scriptures as to appropriate the Hebrew scriptures, um, as an anticipation of the Christian truth that would be revealed. They believed, um, later in the gospel. Um, and this was a central way in which Christians could assert some kind of superiority over over Judaism in light of the fact that Judaism had this awkward but nonetheless, incredibly significant temporal priority, um, over Christian Christianity. Um, so typology becomes a big deal. And look at, uh, look at Milton's, uh, dealing with the typological perspective in Paradise Lost Book 12 Line three 10. This is page four, 61 in the Hughes. Milton looks at the Old Testament figure of Joshua and he's not making this up. This is, there's a long tradition of thinking of Joshua as a type of Jesus. And Joshua represents a in this reading and the early version of the Jesus that, that Christians come to call Christ.

Speaker 1:          22:19          And the full significance is of Joshua's life can't have been revealed in his own lifetime or actually during, during, during anyone's lifetime. In the Old Testament, the full significance of the old testament type isn't known until the emergence of the New Testament anti type, uh, the, the anti type being the Christian fulfillment of the HEBRAIC type. And in this case, the anti type is the birth of Jesus and, and Chris Christian exit gates. We're constantly mapping out elaborate systems of types and anti types as they, as they read the Bible. And there's a, there's a very interesting book on Milton's use of Topology, uh, by William Madsen, mad SCN called from shadowy types to truth. Look a look a little further up on page four 61, uh, this is Michael's actual theory of typology, a line 300 book 12. So true meaning in the, in the typological view of history, true meaning emerges over time by means of an historical process.

Speaker 1:          23:23          And this is how Michael articulates it. So law appears in perfect man. A bylaw. Michael means a mosaic law. The law dispensed on Mount Sinai in the Old Testament. So law appears imperfect and but given with purpose to resign them in full time, up to a better covenant, disciplined from shadowy types to truth, from flesh to spirit, from imposition of strict laws to free acceptance of large grace from survival, fear to filial works of law to works of faith. Christian history obeys a process whereby the shadowy types of the old testament or eventually revealed and all of their truth in the New Testament Old Testament law gives way to new testament faith and the laws of the laws of the flesh start to yield to something like a faith in the spirit. That's the, that's the message here. And Michael presents us, um, with the, the official theological understanding of the significance of Christian history and this is really the official doctrine of the revelation of all of the types and anti types that Michael has given us in this whirlwind history, um, of life after the fall.

Speaker 1:          24:40          Michael is also doing a lot more than that. Michael's theory of Reading Biblical history is also I think is also something like a theory of reading this very poem. He's giving us an interpretive key. I submit to some of the most, to some of the most difficult aspects of paradise lost the history of civilization that Michael offers us is filled with moments of, of, of seeming repetition. Joshua appears in the Old Testament, but he seems to point ahead to the new Joshua Jesus. In the, in the New Testament and these and these type of logical repetitions are closely related I think to the narrative repetitions that we, that we have in Milton's poem, narrative repetitions like the competing accounts of the creation or the competing accounts of the explosion. Um, the, these are things that we've looked at and the theory of the type of topology works to make sense on some level of some of the differences in some of the conflicts among these repeated narratives in Milton story.

Speaker 1:          25:46          Now we may have been confused, we may have been confused about what to do with the poems competing accounts, um, uh, various moments of, of Christian history. And this is why this is where the theory of typology comes in. The old fashioned anthropomorphic image of the, of the deity, the images that Milton inherits in large part from the, from the text as genesis begin to look like shadowy types, the shadow, we types of the old testament and the more modern, what we could think of is something like the quasi scientific rational explanation in the poem of certain events begins to emerge as something like a type of, as a new kind of truth that the shadow we types of, of Milton scriptural literalism. And there no question that that's an important component of this poem. Um, yield maybe they yield, uh, to the truths of the more scientific, the more naturalistic side of Milton's imagination.

Speaker 1:          26:43          It's not exactly the case that one version is wrong and the other version is right. We could think of one version as being an early literalist understanding of an event and the other as a, as a later, more, more rational, more sophisticated understanding of an event, uh, an entirely natural as opposed to a supernatural account of the forces at work in the world. And you can, I think you can see Milton inviting just this type of typological reading of his own poem. Um, at the conclusion of paradise lost. Look, let's look at the poems final assembly and just take a moment to be grateful that Milton has decided to give us a final simile after all of what we've, what we've been through with, with Michael. Okay. This is a line six 25 of book 12, page four 68 in the Hughes. Now, we've already had two anticipatory narratives of the expulsion so far.

Speaker 1:          27:47          Uh, and I'll, I'll just remind you of them. In the literalists narrative, God explains that the, the exposure will occur by means of Michael's actually shoving Adam and eve out of the garden. But you'll remember also that more naturalistic, that clausy scientific version of this story in which God explains that Adam and Eve are going to be ejected, ejected out of Adam by means of some certain atmosphere, Eric pressures. And here at the end of the poem, we have what I take to be the actual representation of, of the, of the real event. This is taking place on the literal level of the, um, uh, at the present moment of the story. And on the literal level of the genesis account, a line six, 25 for now two, nine, the archangel stood and from the other hill to their fixed station, all in bright array, the Cherubim descendant.

Speaker 1:          28:48          So you have these amp anthropomorphic beings, the chair of him, these angels, these armed angels descend to Earth to effect God's punishment of man. And, but no sooner has Milton given us this literal genesis based description of the expulsion. Then he embarks for a final time on, on a simile that really throws everything that he's just written into question. The Cherubim have descended there on the ground. Gliding materialists, uh, materials is like a meter there on the ground. Gliding materials as evening mist risen from a river or the marriage glides and gathers ground fast at the laborers. He'll homeward returning, look, look, pay, pay attention to what Milton is doing here. He's juxtaposing the descent of the angels with the ascent of, of, of the rising miss. The angels who are gliding materials, um, is being likened to the, the, the mist that's rising. And that also glides. And, and, and through this antithesis, he signals, I think to the reader that there are something like two competing perspectives on this

Speaker 1:          30:09          horrible but sir consequential event of the expulsion. There's the literalists, the anthropomorphic image of the descending angels. And you have something like the naturalistic image of the vapors and the myths of Eden that will eject Adam and eve by means of a kind of atmospheric reaction. And it's as if God's expulsion of Adam and eve from the garden. We're such a terrible event and certainly it is for us after our many weeks long investment. Now in Milton's, in Milton Story of Eden, I'm so terrible that Milton has compelled to suggest some explanation of it that actually absorbs God, uh, of any jealousy or any vengeance, any of those things that the genesis account, um, invites us to attribute to God. And you can see Milton struggling to make this event more compatible with, with his theodicy more compatible with what we can think of as the naturalistic side of his imagination. So where has Milton taken us in this, in this, in this beautiful. Similarly, he's returned us here at the end of book 12. He's returned us to one of the most beautiful similes of the entire poem. And that was the similarly with which he had ended book. One of paradise lost, um, book one that the end of paradise lost also features a labor. You'll remember the belated peasant who sees or dreams he sees Ferrio elves at twilight.

Speaker 2:          31:44          Okay?

Speaker 1:          31:45          Now Milton began paradise lost with the claim that he would assert, assert eternal providence and justify the ways of God to men. And it may very well have seen that the beginning of the poem, that the idea of, of God's Providence, of God's fore knowledge for seeing what's going to be completely at odds with the idea of man's free will, a god who knows what's going to happen and advanced. And I know I've made this argument a number of times simply isn't justified on some level. This is certainly what a lot of Milton's contemporaries thought and generations of readers of the Bible before Milton thought simply isn't justified. And setting up a paradise that he knows isn't going to last. That will have to be lost. But, but if we were struck by the difficulty of Milton's theodicy when we began the poem, that's because we had no idea then just how far Milton was going to be able to push our conception of God and our notion essentially of divine providence. Th Th th th the whole not the whole idea of divine providence has undergone an amazing transformation over the course of, uh, of paradise lost. Um, and it makes its final appearance in the poems. Final lines. Michael has just escorted Adam and eve to the eastern gate of paradise and then he's disappeared. Thank God we, uh, we say, and just before Adam and eve leave Eden forever, they look back

Speaker 1:          33:21          some natural tears they dropped, but wipe them soon. The world was all before them, where to choose their place of rest. And Providence, their guide, they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow through Eden took their solitary way. This, this exquisitely beautiful and quiet ending has always teased, uh, the, the, the readers of Milton's poem. And, and, and our puzzlement I think derives from the opposition here of ideas that really seem entirely at odds with one another. Adam has just been presented by Michael with a powerful vision of the workings PR precisely of the workings of divine providence in the universe. And we're not surprised to see Adam and eve departing the garden with Providence, their guide, given what we've just learned from Michael. But in the light of the presence of this guide, the final two lines of the poem,

Speaker 2:          34:25          okay.

Speaker 1:          34:26          Always seems so difficult to understand. They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow through Eden took their solitary way.

Speaker 2:          34:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:40          The, the, the, the, the 18th century a critic and classical editor, Dr. Richard Bentley was the, was the first reader, surely not the first reader to be puzzled by these lines, but he was the first Streeter to spell out the difficulties of these last two lines. Um, and, and, and, and look here on your handout. I'm Dr. Bentley had, had found the conclusion of the poem so conflicted that he suggested that Milton couldn't pee, couldn't possibly have been responsible for them. These are, once again, the lines as a peer in our texts are clearly the garbled product of the confused secretary, um, to whom Milton was dictating. So look at the handout. This is near the bottom third of the text. Bentley asks how the expression of the last two lines can be justified. I'm going to quote mentally here and how can the expression be justified with wandering steps and slow?

Speaker 1:          35:35          Why wandering erratic steps very improper went in the line before they were guided by providence. And it goes without saying, the Bentley gets everything almost consistently wrong when he talks about Milton. But you have to, you have to give him this. He's an amazingly astute reader of, of poetic tension and, and poetic contradiction. And it's an awfully good question. How can it be that Adam and eve are wandering at the same time that they're granted by Providence? Milton is able to pack into the final lines of the paradise lost. Really the central question of the entire poem. How can it be that human beings are free, free to wander if there's a providential force out there that seems to determine, uh, their, their movements. In other words, how can God's fore knowledge B squared or be reconciled with man's free will? This is a problem that has been gathering ground fast at our heels throughout our reading of, of, of paradise lost and it's here at the end that Milton makes a final attempt at resolution, a final attempt. This is his last chance at at reconciliation. Milton tells us that the world was all before them, where to choose their place of rest.

Speaker 1:          36:57          And it seems on a first reading that the guiding power of providence will assist them in their choice of a place, a place of rest. But, but it, but of course it's more complicated than that. The word providence in this sentence can I think also be the object of the verb to choose.

Speaker 1:          37:19          Adam and Eve are not only choosing a place out of their own freewill, it's also possible that they're also choosing providence. And I think this possibility, this, this secondary syntactical possibility is a, is a really daring and radical remove on, on Milton's part, even the most absolute certainties of divine for knowledge. This enormous institution of, of, of God's Providence, even that can be subsumed within the all encompassing power of the human capacity to choose freely. Adam and Eve not only have a paradise within them, happier if our, perhaps they also have a providence within them. And surely that is happier far as well. You'll, you'll notice on the bottom of the handout that that Bentley proposed at the last lines of paradise lost, um, be rewritten this. And so he gives us what he is. So, um, must've been what Milton actually dictated but had gotten miss transcribed. Um, and so, uh, so Bentley wants to do away with all of the ambiguity and he suggests these lines as an alternative. Then hand in hand with social steps their way through Eden took with heavenly comfort cheered.

Speaker 1:          38:46          Oh yeah, no, you have to hand it to him. You, I mean, of course it goes without saying that he's a terrible, he's a terrible poet, but you can see what he's trying to do. He's trying to reconcile the entire poem with a much more familiar, uh, Sunday school image of, of divine providence. Bentley is just so much more orthodox than our Milton. And he wants to imagine a God who is still capable of offering assistance and constellation but also punishment for from above a god who is still capable of intervening in the realm of nature. And Milton I think wants very much to resist that. And, and the world of paradise lost by the end is, is, is an almost entirely secular world. The new world order that this great religious poem has prepared us for is on some level, the, the, the secular world of, of modernity.

Speaker 1:          39:42          Our world, Adam and Eve are solitary here at the end of the poem because there's no longer a personal, uh, an anthropomorphic deity whose in a position to intervene in, in, in, in their lives. Now they may drop some tears in in leaving paradise, but they leave behind that shadowy type of the personal arbitrary deity from the book of Genesis. They are free now as Milton is free to choose providence by which I mean they can choose an alternative image of providential guidance, an alternative understanding of that. Now Dr. Bentley takes issue with also an issue with the term wandering here because he assumes that the word wandering has to have its evil fallen connotations that it did for Adam and book 10 wandering steps for Dr. Bentley or necessarily erratic steps since after the fall. Of course, the whole concept of wandering and all the freedoms that wandering implied have become suspect, but now at the end of the poem,

Speaker 1:          40:51          Milton's attempting to reassert the innocent meaning of the word wander. All of the dock trinal structures of the poem have been internalized by Adam and eve. By the end of the poem at some level, this was the point of Michael's history lesson. They, they, it was his attempt to compel their internalization of provenance and wandering can be seen as sanction now and is innocent now because wandering is predicated on something like an internalized providential guide and it's, it's, and we knew this had to be the case. Eve was right all along. Wandering is in the end, perfectly allowable in Milton's universe. And we get to the end of this biblical epic not with prophecy. Uh, but we're, we, we ended the poem in the mode of romance wandering this, this is an ending that's not an ending at all. But Milton successfully resists the drive to closure.

Speaker 1:          41:54          Now we didn't know, of course, when we started reading the poem, just what Milton could have meant by his desire to assert divine providence to assert eternal providence. And I may assert a turtle. I may assert eternal providence and justify the ways of God demand. He told us in the first and vocation, but the significance of this claim becomes clearer by the time we get to the end of the poem. We move from a shadowy type of the claimed closer to something much more like it's the truth. And there's a sense in which Milton's claim to as cert eternal providence find it may find its ultimate meaning. This is, this is one critical conjecture and I'm quite taken with it may find its ultimate meeting in the original there, the root sense of the word as Cert, the verb to assert, and you can see this from the bottom of the handout, comes from the Latin Verb Asur Ray rhe um, to, to remove from service to declare a slave free and ultimate is declaring this slave providence free.

Speaker 1:          43:03          And so I'll, I'll conclude here with a consideration of why, what that alternative meaning of the verb assert might actually portend there. There's, there's the obvious arrogance in this assertion that that Milton might on some level is assuming the role of the slave master, a slave owner placing providence in the role of a slave. That's, you know, that's identifiably miltonic I guess. But there's another sense in which Milton can be seen as asserting divine providence asserting eternal providence. He's liberating a conception of providence that has been enslaved and silenced by Orthodox Christian theologians. It's as if the notion of providence had been enslaved by the literal minded doctrinaire readers of genesis. And Milton wants us to know that it is our good fortune as readers of paradise lost, that we have John Milton, John Milton, like some wandering knight in a chivalric romance to come to come to the rescue.

Speaker 1:          44:03          You'll, you'll, you'll remember, you'll remember the note on the verse that Milton had depended to a later printing of paradise lost explaining why his poem didn't rhyme. And Milton told us there that he was, he was saving poetry from the troublesome and modern bondage of rhyming. Milton was liberating poetry from a type of enslavement, but Milton is trying to save us as readers. Two, I think just save us from our enslavement, freeing us from the shackles of what he takes to be, are the shackles of, of religious orthodoxy from normative social and poetic conventions to save us from the shackles of the, of the tyranny of literary tradition. Um, he is attempted in paradise lost to free us. Finally from the troublesome and modern bondage of literary reading. Okay. I'm going to end the, the lecture on Paradise lost there, but I have a word to say about the reading for after the Thanksgiving break. Do give yourself some time with the first two books of paradise lost. You might, you won't, you won't be the first to think if you think this, that Milton is writing in shackles, uh, when he writes his sequel to pet paradise lost. But you have to give yourself a little bit of time to appreciate the severity of this poem. It's uncompromising aesthetic discipline because by d only by doing that will you develop what I know will be your ultimate affection for its mmm delicious peculiarities. Okay. Have a good, have a good break.
