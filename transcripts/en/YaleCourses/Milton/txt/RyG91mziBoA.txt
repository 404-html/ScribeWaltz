Speaker 1:          00:02          Traditionally in Renaissance Literature, the muses, and this will be familiar to many of you, the muses are thought to be the daughters of memory. And the the nine muses up on Mt. Helicon that's where the musicians are believed to have lived, are the offspring of the goddess of memory. Um, who's name in the Greek is [inaudible] and [inaudible], whose name is, is, uh, is spelled with some difficulty, is spelled on the, on the lower part of your handout. Now there's an, there's an important, there's an important reason for this genealogy. The idea that the muses or the daughter of [inaudible] Mazda knee, the goddess of memory in the, in the renaissance, the most important source of, of poetic inspiration was often believed to be the poets, the poet's own memory, the degree to which the poet could call up or just out of sheer recall, literary toe point or commonplaces literary commonplaces stored in his or her a memory from a lifetime, from a lifetime of reading and, and Milton himself.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And this, this seems to be true, is said to have had one of the most capacious, one of the largest memories and English letters he seems to have, or this is the, the, the effect that we get, I think for meeting reading, Milton, um, is this notion that he seems to have had one of the largest, he's largest memories a imaginable and that he's remembered just about everything he's ever read. Now we know that Milton was blind by the time probably, well before that time he began writing paradise lost. And therefore of course he was an unable to read. And even though there were people, mostly young men, uh, willing and able to read to him, it's clear that the vast quantity of learning that gets poured, the all that air you addition that gets poured into the pages of paradise lost. It's clear that this is not a product of Milton's.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Last minute review of the classics, uh, this learning springs from the recesses of, of Milton's memory. I take this to be an undeniable fact. Uh, but this is easy for us. It's easy for us to say. It's easy for us to say that it's Milton's memory, which is the fount of so much of the poems Aryeh edition. It's easy. It's easy for us to say that it was Milton's memory that fast facilitated, uh, his grasp of the Christian and the classical traditions. But, but I, but I think Milton would probably feel a little uncomfortable with our easy attribution of so much of the poems learning to, to his memory. And that's because to suggest, just think of it to suggest that Milton is relying on his memory as he composes. So elusively and so dependently in a lot of ways. So, so much of paradise lost to say that is simply to say that the poem has just been generated by Milton and, and not by God.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Milton has expended, we know a considerable amount of energy in establishing what he wants us to. I'm assuming what he wants us to believe is the, is the divine authority behind the poem. This poem, Milton tells us again and again has been authorized by that same holy spirit who, who had inspired Moses to write the book of Genesis and so to, in order to make a claim for such a, an extraordinary claim for divine authorization. Milton has to defend against this notion that I just began this lecture with the idea that memory is on some level really at the source of, of Milton's poetic inspiration because to rely on memory as simply to admit in in some sense is to admit that this is just one more epic. It's to admit that this is in fact a late epic and that it derives from a close studious student like imitation of the great epics of homer and Virgil.

Speaker 1:          04:03          Now you'll remember from our discussion of the opening of vocation to paradise lost that insistent bid that Milton was making, uh, the, the bid to be first. His adventure is song is one that with no middle flight intends to soar above the Yoni and mount while it pursues things on attempted yet in prose or rhyme. And so Milton and it was so with such pride that he declared that this poem was going to soar above all of its classical predecessors. But the, but the, but the category pros or rhyme is a, it's a large one covers just about everything I, I would have to say. And, and the, the, the literary spectrum from pros to rhyme of course would have to, would have to include the Bible as well. And there's even the suggestion here that that Milton will be pursuing things on attempted yet even in, even in holy scripture.

Speaker 1:          05:00          And that is an extraordinary claim for the poems, originality. But it's a difficult claim because even as Milton, even as Milton makes this claim, he's, he, he, he manages to undermine its force. Um, and, and, and Mirror Hughes a usefully notes this in a, one of the notes at the bottom of the page that Milton in that line, uh, things and attempted yet in proser rhyme, Milton is actually alluding to the opening of another, uh, another romance epic. This is the Orlando Furioso by, by, by the great 16th century Italian poet. Ariosto. What does that mean? That Milton has borrowed this claim for an absolute originality for he's, he's taken it from somebody else. And in doing so, I think he's, he's doing this deliberately and he's exposing some of the darker ironies

Speaker 1:          05:53          behind his own literary ambition. Oh by, and, and it's, it's a, it's good sort of questions that gets raised in such a problematic illusion. How do you set out to write an original poem within such a conventional genre like the epic? What does it mean to, to, to, to be inspired to write by the Christian Holy Spirit when, when you're at epic in fact just imitates a whole array of classical pagan conventions and how can you write an original poem when you're literary consciousness is essentially made up of the memory of all the things that you've read before. So this is what I'll be proposing over the course of this lecture. That memory is a problem that paradise lost is continually confronting a, so much of the pathos of Satan's fallen condition involves his painful memory of that blissful state in heaven from which he had he had fallen. And, and, and the problem of memory is just as important to the psychological damage dynamics of the, of the fall of Adam and eve. But as, as we will see when we look at book four but surely it's the problem of the poets memory, uh, that that's the most troubling in in paradise lost Milton's own faculty of memory. This is, this is the, this is the idea that I'm going to be a floating here. Milton's own memory seems to provide something like or pose a stumbling block, an obstacle for his attempt to write an original divinely inspired poem. And so I want to suggest in this lecture is something that will initially sound, I assume like a peculiar formulation. There's a strange way in which Milton has to imagine himself losing his memory,

Speaker 1:          07:37          losing his memory if he's actually going to open himself up to the muses inspiration, the inspiration of the Christian. They haven't news. And there's a sense in which Milton we'll have to forget everything he's learned up up to this point. And there's some important signs, I think, especially in the first two books of paradise lost of what we can think of as Milton's. It's a literary fantasy, a literary fantasy of forgetfulness.

Speaker 2:          08:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:02          So you as a, as, as, as, as you may well have gleaned from your reading, the first books of the poem are particularly absorbed with the idea of forgetting because more than any other part of paradise lost, they display. So ostentatiously the remarkable scope of Milton's Milton's own memory of these books are, are without, without question, more heavily as elusive that than any other books in the epic. They are steeped in the entire literary tradition of the underworld journey that, that stretches from the Odyssey of homer up through a Virgil's Aeneid and of course up through all of the renaissance romance epics. And it's, it's, it's important to remember that that Milton will, this is probably an invariable truth, but I will, um, I'll qualify it nonetheless that Milton volt imitate his predecessors, uh, only with a difference. He usually will. He usually takes pains, for example, in, in his great depiction of hell in books one and two.

Speaker 1:          09:08          Um, he takes pains to avoid the standard epic scenes of the torture of the dam, for example, with which we're familiar. Um, if we've read homer or virtual or, or of course, uh, Dante much later, but there are, there are nonetheless a few details from the classical underworld that he seems to have lifted more or less, more or less wholesale. And one of them, look this, I'm going to ask you to look at page two 46 in the Hughes. This is line five 82 of book to one of these little details that Milton has has lifted rather, um, rather directly is the, is the, is that of the river leafy, the river of oblivion that was believed to run a flow in the underworld. And it's a river that I think that all classical writers and a lot of renaissance writers, uh, are very comfortable placing in the underworld.

Speaker 1:          10:05          So this is book two line five 82, uh, Milton far, far off from these slow and silence stream leafy, the river of oblivion rolls her watery labyrinth where of who drink forthwith. His former state and being forgets, forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. So in this context, the river of oblivion serves an obvious purpose in, in, in this, in the context we have here in book two to drink from this river would allow the fallen angels to forget their, their fallen state, to forget the fact of their fallenness from there. More blissful former condition. And on some level it would forgetfulness would just ease, uh, the grievous newness of this miserable new psychological dynamic, um, with which they are tormented. But there's also I think a deeper sense in which Milton in which Milton himself might want to drink from this slow and silence stream.

Speaker 1:          11:06          If Milton could silence, see what you think of this. If melted can silence all of his literary memories, perhaps he could better guarantee his fresh intake of inspiration from, from the Christian heavenly muse. A, it's a, it's a fantasy of course, because no such Bryant brainwashing is going to be possible. Um, just as the fallen angels, if you look at line six oh seven, just as the fallen angels will be barred from drinking, their fill of the river. Leafy forgetfulness is impossible. The fallen angels, they wish and struggle as they pass to reach the tempting stream with one small drop to lose in sweet forgetfulness, all pain and whoa all in one moment and so near the brink. But fate with stands and to oppose the attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards, the Ford and of itself, the water flies all taste of living white as once it fled the lip of Tantalus.

Speaker 1:          12:11          Yes, it's an amazing passage because in a lot of ways I think Milton is actually enacting, directly enacting for us the reader, the the impossibility of such sweet forgetfulness. As soon as he describes the impossibility of forgetting a flood of classical figures, pores, pores into his own narration, and they, and they, and they pour it with such a force. I think that Milton permits, I think this is a significant rift that that fishers are fractures the otherwise seamless text that, that we, that we have in book two. There's, I'm convinced that there's something very strange going on. Standing in the leafy of Milton's hell is none other than the classical figure that figure from classical mythology, Medusa, uh, you, you know, Medusa, she has the power with her snaky locks to turn men into stone. And so she, and so this seems to be unique. Milton, Milton, I don't, I don't know of any predecessor that Milton had for this.

Speaker 1:          13:08          Um, Medusa having been placed by Milton in the river, leafy in the Christian underworld, uh, can prevent, of course, the fallen angels from drinking the waters of oblivion, such as her power. But we have every right to ask what Medusa. This is a figure from Greek mythology, what Medusa is doing in a Christian, in a Christian hell. There are of course, dozens of figures taken from the texts of classic classical mythology who are alluded to throughout the first two books. But invariably they appear just as Tantalus does in this very passage. They appear within the context of a simile. They're not actually present in the real world of, of Milton's hell. Um, or if it's a, if it's a pagan God who's mentioned, Milton will tell us that, that, that the Pagan God was just a later, an earthly manifestation of one of the fallen angels.

Speaker 1:          14:04          But, but, but, but at least within the context of the present narration, the figures mentioned in Milton's hell, all are all former inhabitants of the Christian heaven and the fallen angels themselves. Satan lock, Bilio, mammon and BLS above. These are all demons who are drawn from the Judeo Christian tradition of demon Knology. Uh, they've clearly been hurled into hell by a Judeo Christian deity. So this little moment, that's a little bit, this Medusa moment we can call it is, it's, it's really quite strange within the, in the midst of all of the Judeo Christian realism, we have standing here, a decidedly pagan, and I think this is, uh, not uninteresting, a decidedly female presence. And, and you'll correct me if I'm wrong, but I, I, I think I'm right to insist that this is a unique phenomenon in, in these books. Uh, I, and I think there's actually a reason for this, for this aberration.

Speaker 1:          15:05          Medusa can turn men into stone. She subjects to them, to that posture of absolute paralysis that we've seen represented in a number of the early poems. Uh, the lady, the lady in Milton's mask was, was stuck to her seat in the presence of the Shakespearian magician comas and Milton himself had claimed in the poem on Shakespeare that Shakespeare dust make us marble with too much. Conceiving. Shakespeare can turn us to marble because he can, because he can fill our imaginations and leave us and capable of thinking for ourselves, um, and capable of, of maneuvering around maneuver moving around on our own. And I think it's possible to see Medusa here as an emblem or some sort of figure for a similarly paralyzing power. You could think of Medusa as Milton's counter muse, if, if, if, if Milton's true muse or so he or so he hopes there.

Speaker 1:          15:59          So he wants us to believe, um, has a, has a Christian origin. Then this counter music is unquestionably classical. She, she's a daughter of no Mazany the goddess of memory and she represents, she represents that force that prevents Milton from forgetting all of the Pagan. And all of the classical literature that of course he had spent so much of his life reading. Now I asked you to read for today, uh, and I'm hoping you remember some of the reading. Uh, the Canto from Spencer's fairy queen, that features that came of mammon. Uh, the Cape of Mammon is the, is the home of, of Mammon, the money God who stores in his cave, all of the wealth and all of the honor that human beings, uh, spend so much energy striving for now Spencer's hero in book two of the Fairy Queen is Sir guy and Sir guy and descends and demands cave a, it says Spencerian underworld and a, and it's in Mammon's cave that he is tempted by the money God himself.

Speaker 1:          17:00          So this little bit of this, a little bit of the fairy queen is important for Milton and all sorts of ways. It's first of all, a depiction of an underworld. And so it provides Milton within important Christian representation of a hell. And so in that, in that respect, it has a kind of priority over the hills or the underworlds of, of, of homer. And Virgil, it also provides Melton with the figure of Mammon who will as you as you will see over the course of this semester who will become well here in paradise lost. He's one of the the key fallen angels in in Milton's hell. Mammon actually seems to represent the miltonic position or that position in the debate in hell. That seems to resemble most closely Milton zone, Milton zone moral temperament we could say and you'll see at the end of the semester that's Cape of mammon.

Speaker 1:          17:49          Coke Canto is even more central to Milton's sequel to Paradise lost, Paradise regained, which in many ways is a uh, more or less close re rewriting of Spenser's story with, with Satan playing the role of Mammon and, and Christ in the role of [inaudible] the hero. Now you, you also may remember that we have already run, we've already run into a Spencer's mammon before this point, before paradise lost, a mammon had surfaced. I'm testing your memories here. Mammon had surfaced in the text of [inaudible] and because this is one of the most famous passages in the treatise, and it's not one that we actually looked at for mammon himself, I'm going to ask you to turn to turn to area up agenda. This is page 728 in the Hughes, the right hand column. This is where Milton began to consider the problem of temptation that of course will become so important to paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          18:54          Here's a, Milton is talking about the temptation of reading classical literature. Um, Rita and, and this is, this is an argument that we've examined before. Read everything you can. Milton insists because only then can you overcome that what he thinks of and characterizes as the temptation of reading. So on the right hand column of Seven 28, I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue on exercised and, and breathed that never Sally's out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland has to be run for not without Dustin heat. I'm going to skip a couple lines here, which was the reason why our why our sage and Siri is Spencer, who my dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas go to center and Aquinas or medieval philosophers. Spencer describing to true temperance under the person of Gyan brings him in with his poem or through the Cave of mammon and the bower of earthly bliss that he might see and know and yet abstain.

Speaker 1:          20:01          Spencer's Cave of Mammon is, is central to Milton's to Milton's understanding of the Christians resistance of temptation, the temptation posed in aerial politica bye bye, bye. Scandalous and seemingly non virtuous books and Spencer Milton argues here, knows the importance of reading everything, the miltonic position, however evil those books are in and of themselves. Um, we have to read them so that we might see and know and yet abstain. Now, this passage is famous for for a lot of reasons, not least of which is it's wonderful. It's juicy evidence that it provides for Milton's intense fondness for, we might even think of it as a passion for this earlier English poet, but the passage is also famous because in it Milton does something that he almost never does. Uh, Milton has made a mistake. John Milton has made a mistake. He's made a literary mistake. And as a, as I think all editors note, Spencer does not, Edmund Spencer in the fairy queen does not bring Sir guy in with his Palmer through the cave of Mammon, Gyan descends into the cave of Mammon by himself that the Palmer has been guidance guide up to this point.

Speaker 1:          21:15          His teacher and he and the Palmer accompanies him on all of his adventures. But this one and Spencer and stands up to have this canto. It makes it a big deal deal, deal with the fact that that guy in is descending into the cave of Mammon by himself. He's been separated from his guide. His teacher, the Palmer milk. Milton seems absolutely actually to have forgotten something is, uh, his memory has failed him. And, and given the general importance that I'm, uh, that I'm attributing to problems of remembering and forgetting, I think it's safe to assume that something important is going on here. The temptations that mammon offers Gyan are, are literally within the story itself, temptations of wealth. But they're also temptations, uh, to the wealth of classical learning, the wealth of the entire classical heritage. Uh, you, you'll remember that mammon has a special place within his cave that's called the garden of persona and the gardener per syrup.

Speaker 1:          22:15          And it has within it all of the, the, the, the central symbols of Pagan wisdom and a beautiful epic literature. Um, and, and you'll, you'll, you'll perhaps you'll remember too that Tantalus is present in the cave of Mammon, temptation, literary temptation being as important as all other temptations in this Canto of, of Spencer's, that the temptations of classical literature are so genuinely tempting to Milton that he finds it impossible to imagine that guy and could have seen and known and yet Epstein from them without the aid of his teacher, the polymer. And, and, and you'll note in this passage from areopagite politica that Milton himself calls Spencer a teacher. Now he's a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas. And the tech seems almost suggest that Milton can't do without his own teacher Edmund Spenser. Uh, Milton Need Spencer, this is a, an argument that's been amplified at some, at some length and really quite brilliantly by John Guillory in the Book Poetic Authority.

Speaker 1:          23:21          Milton Needs Spencer to serve as the Christian poet who can help Milton to fight off the temptations of, of pagan pagan poets like homer and Virgil, or perhaps Spencer Spencer is a poet who can help Milton fight off the temptations of even as a secular contemporary like, like William Shakespeare, the, the, the, it's, it's almost as if the story of Mammon's temptations of Gyan has, uh, have, have hit a raw nerve in Milton. Milton's lifelong susceptibility to this story. And that will without question proved to be the case, speaks to a, a truly profound ambivalence about the pleasure to be derived from a reading of secular literature. Milton seems genuinely ambivalent about the, about all of the time and all of this study that he has invested in his own education to become an epic poet. And I think that the metaphors of investment here and, uh, and of profit are especially applicable since it's the figure of mammon. It's the figure of Mammon who provides Milton Milton with the literary version of his economic account of Poetic Investment and poetic profit. So let's look at the first appearance of Mammon in paradise lost. This is page two 28 of the Hughes Book, one line six 78.

Speaker 1:          24:48          Milton's describing the landscape of hell and, and hell here it turns out, seems to resemble Milton's heaven and that it contains deep within it. And we would never have expected this. It contains deep within it, uh, uh, soil that is hiding precious metals. And so this is an underworld of course, but there seems to be another underworld resting just beneath it. It's an underworld filled with gold that a brigade of fallen angels begins to extract with spades and pick axes. Uh, so this is what Milton tells us at line six 78. Mammon led them on this angelic brigade. Mammon led them on Mammon, the least directed spirit that fell from heaven. And even in heaven, we're told mammon was always looking down. It's a, it's a kind of a cute scene. Mammon was always looking down at heavens golden pavement rather than contemplating the more elevated figure, uh, presumably of the heavenly father.

Speaker 1:          25:50          And inline six 84, we were told this of Mammon by him first men also. And by his suggestion tot ransack the center and with MBS hands, rifled the bowels of their mother earth for treasures better hid soon had his crew opened into the hill, a spacious wound and digged out ribs of gold. When we considered the degree of Milton's anxieties about his own attachment to classical learning, I think we can see the significance of, of mammon's actions here that the image of men, and it's a grotesque image of men rifling the bowels of their mother earth for treasures better hid it. This is a group, a disgusting and terrifying image of, of a lot of things. But one of the things I think that it's an image of is the, is the practice of excavation to ransack the intellectual treasures hidden away in the landscape of, of literary history is enact on some level of, of a kind of violent desecration.

Speaker 1:          26:55          And Milton, I think would need to defend himself from the implications of, of this act of violence. And so Milton calls on none other than his teacher. Spencer Milton seems to have dug around rather carefully in his copy of the fairy queen and he's, and he's come up with this illusion. And so you can you actually see this, uh, near the top of your handout, the illusion, uh, from the fairy queen. It's the passage from Spencer's Cave of Mammon Canto that describes this same scene of violation, the violation of mother earth. The first discovery of gold for Spencer took place when a Curson hand, the quiet womb of his great grandmother with steel to wound and, and Spencer just like Milton after him, seems to be associating the digging of gold with the pursuit of a buried literary past there. They're on the same wavelength here. Now, it's not entirely clear that Milton's Milton has been successful in sufficiently vilifying mammon's project of the excavation of Richards.

Speaker 1:          28:01          And I think in a lot of ways, and this could probably be set of Spencer as well and a lot of ways Milton as attracted to the excavation project. Look, look again at the sentence that I just, that I just read the last lines soon had his crew opened into the hill a spacious wound and digged out ribs of gold that the fallen angels maybe, okay, they may be violating mother earth. Not so great, but, but look, look what this violation produces out of the wound are Doug ribs of gold. The, the, the what? The image that seems initially, uh, negative begins to resemble, begins to resemble something I think quite, quite important and quite beautiful. And, and I'm, and I'm thinking here of the creation of eve and Adam will tell us later, this is in book eight, when Adam recounts for us the creation of Eve, that God opened up my left side and took from vents or rib wide was the wound, but the rib he formed and fashioned with his hand.

Speaker 1:          29:09          And when we remember that God will, will, will dig a rib out of Adam's wound in order to create the beautiful, the Golden, the Golden Eve. We realize how complicated, how complex and how ambivalent Milton's Milton's little images here in, at the beginning of the poem, Milton is loading every rift of this passage with aura. And there seems to be something, at least provisionally, at least for a moment, there seems to be something potentially redemptive, potentially generative about the, uh, the, about the active activity of excavation that Milton is describing otherwise. So negatively here that he's condemning here. Mammon. Mammon uses this extracted gold to create that magnificent structure, pandemonium and, and, and the function of this structure is implicit in its name. Pandemonium comes from Pan, diamond, pan, demon. It's the place where all of the demons, all of the fallen angels will congregate. This is their political capital.

Speaker 1:          30:09          This is where they will, they will debate their future and established an established, a new political institution. This structure, and this is something that's important for Milton to convey to us. This structure is genuinely beautiful and it's not entirely clear that Milton wants us to think of pandemonium as unambiguously evil, clearly. Um, it's, it's evil in all sorts of ways. This is the fallen institution established by the fallen angels, but it's more complicated than that. Look at Milton's description of the architect of pandemonium. Um, this is the man who appears is the fallen angels enter the building at line seven 32. So the architect of pandemonium is Mulsa bar and his hand was known in heaven by many a towered structured hi, we're sceptred angels, held their residents and sat as Princess

Speaker 1:          31:06          [inaudible] was famous in heaven for building beautiful palaces there. And Milton lets us know that there isn't actually that much of a difference at least in terms of architectural or aesthetic quality between the palaces of Heaven and the palaces of hell. It's almost for a moment at least it's almost as if there were a strange moral equivalence between the palace is up there in the palace is down here and a lot of the rigid, rigid moral distinctions that the poem is actually been working rather hard to establish are beginning to blur the line between good and evil is beginning to blur. Ah, look, look, look good. Milton's account of what happened to [inaudible] later on earth. This is line seven 39 nor was his name unheard or unadorned in ancient Greece and then I'll Sonian land men called him bolsover and how he fell from heaven. The fabled thrown by angry jove sheer or the crystal battlements from morning to noon, he fell from noon to do we eve a summer's day and with the setting sun dropped from the zenith like a falling star on lem nos. The Aegean aisle.

Speaker 3:          32:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:23          Milton tells us that the story of [inaudible] in ancient Greece in, uh, in, in Homer's account of the Iliad, he tells us this story. Um, and it's actually the Homeric version of the story of most of her that you have reproduced for you. On the handout, Milton is reminding us with this illusion of the punishment of most supper and, and the punishment, uh, and the punishment by implication of all of the fallen angels by, by an angry God. But at the very moment that he's telling us if multiple his punishment, he's allowing himself to dilate, to augment or to expand this beautiful little nugget that's been excavated from the pages of homer, and he allows himself to linger over its beauty. Just look at those lines again from morning to noon. He fell from noon to do eve a summer's day.

Speaker 1:          33:22          If for a moment I proposed for a moment, we almost forget what, what's actually being described in the passage. It's as if the, the story of [inaudible] the punishment has, has come to a standstill. And, and, and it's, of course, it's a, with no smell help from Milton's incredibly elastic blank verse here of the Headlong Rush of multiverse fall has, has been drawn to a, to a provisional stop and it's, it's been drawn out in spatialized. It's as if it's been spatialized into a scene of a beautiful summer's day and we're left contemplating not the punishment of evil, but I dunno, we're left. One of the things were left contemplating is the sheer beauty of Homeric poetry. Milton has dug up a gem from the pages of, uh, of the Elliot. And this gym has something like a Medusa effect on the poem or perhaps on us as, as, as readers time almost seems to stop when we begin appreciating this image, uh, solely on aesthetic grounds. But Milton of course, Melton's a Christian poem poet and he will not allow time just to stop forever. For, as, for as soon as he explains that most of birth fell like a star on Lemnos the Aegean aisle. He adds this,

Speaker 3:          34:39          okay.

Speaker 1:          34:40          Thus they relate whoring for he with this rebellious route fell long before this is so mean. Thus they relate earning four. He with this rebellious route, fell along before just just as we were beginning to appreciate the loveliness of the classical tradition. Milton reminds us once again, he reestablishes the moral polls of, of good and evil. Thus they relate burring who cares, who cares about homer says, what did homer or any of Homer's contemporaries know about? [inaudible] fell long before homer because Melissa fell long before the creation of the earth and it's Milton and it's no other poet before Melton who's finally able to sec to set the record straight. So Milton's insisting here that all of the Pagan Deities, um, had originally been fallen angels. He's providing us with something of a prehistory of, of classical mythology, a prehistory of classical mythology that had of course been completely unknown to homer and Virgil naturally, uh, because they didn't have the benefit of the Christian story of the fall of the, of the fall of the rebel angels.

Speaker 1:          35:50          Now without doubt, this is a doobie theory of classical anthropology and Milton probably knows that, but it's a, it's a theory that serves an obviously useful function for Milton. It allows the poet to appropriate all of the classical literature that he wants to because he will be able, in the end, he'll be able to correct that literature. He can compare the myths of homer, the earliest myths we have. He can compare them directly to the time scheme of Christian history and prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that his own version, that Milton's own version of the story comes first. So Milton may be writing after homer, but the story he's telling comes first. And this is one of the primary strategies that Milton develops, especially in the first two books of paradise lost as a, as a kind of defense against his dependence on classical literature.

Speaker 1:          36:45          Now, Milton may not be able to forget homer, but he is able to correct homer or to preempt homer. Uh, let's look at an at a later manifestation of mammon. This is in book to a line to 49. This is page two 38 of the Hughes Book, two line two 49. This is a mammon speech during the great consult in hell, that the subject of the debate has been the nature of the fallen angels political future, where essentially the question is, where do we go from here? A molecule, remember, is the, is the, is the military general general who will risk absolutely anything for revenge? Bilio is the, is the lovely intellectual, the intellectual seeking peace and who prizes above all things is intellectual freedom. Our thoughts as Bilio puts it, our thoughts that wander through eternity and mammon. Mammon is the profit tier. Mammon is the Gold Smith's son who wants to invest his talents within, uh, to invest his talents with labor and with hard work in order to show a profit.

Speaker 1:          37:56          Mammon's advice is thus not to seek revenge on heaven or to give up as Bilio is counseling to give up in despair, despair, but to cultivate all of the rich resources that we have down here and hell. Um, so line two 49 a book to let us, this is ma'am, and let us not then pursue by force. Impossible. By leave obtained. Unacceptable though in heaven, our state of splendid vassalage, but rather seek our own good from ourselves though in this vaster assess free and to none accountable, preferring hard liberty before the easy yoke of survival pump and a and a few lines down and tells us that we will work ease out of pain through labor and endurance. He's offering us essentially an economic model that I think we as readers of Milton recognize. This is the, the model of investment and profit that had characterized Jesus's parable of the talents.

Speaker 1:          38:57          And it's the model of investment in profit that characterized so many of Milton's zone Milton zone, early writings, including that promise. You'll remember to his fellow Englishman that he would one day produce a work of literature that is that his countryman would not willingly let die. Now it's, it's Bilio for my money. It's Bilio who gives us the most beautiful in the most seductive contribution to the debate in hell. But it has got to be mammon who most, who most resembles Milton himself. It's, it's mammon that comes closest to Milton's own, uh, this pure [inaudible] of a diff does diff discipline, liberty, hard work, and this kind of absolute self sufficiency in, in, in, in, in so many ways. It seems that Mammon is actually echoing a lot of the political pros that Milton had written a decade before. It's almost as if in the character of Mammon, we have Milton's parody of himself and that cry let us seek our own good from ourselves.

Speaker 1:          39:58          It's a, it's a perfect miltonic tag. Four for the first two books for the first two books of paradise lost, Milton is always seeking a good from himself that is morally superior to the good of his classical predecessors. Milton refuses the state of splendid vassalage to a kingly poet like homer, and he's continually seeking a good firm with his own religious and from within his own literary literary sensibility. Now, when these two books we've seen Milton dig up, dig up and discard just about the entire, uh, the entire tradition of epic poetry. And it's at the end of book two that Milton seems to complete this process, this process of, uh, trashing of his literary predecessors. And so it's here at the end of the second book that Milton is finally ready to embrace the poetics of his better teacher, Edmund Spenser. And out of nowhere, and I know that all first time readers of paradise lost are surprised by this.

Speaker 1:          41:04          Out of nowhere, we have Milton engaging the fine art of Spencerian allegory. So let me remind you what's happening. St and flies out of hell. He journeys heroically through chaos in order to find that new planet that, that he's heard about, that he had heard about, and heaven. And he stopped by a figure who holds the keys to Hellgate and who can determine who will, um, who was able to, to, to, to leave and who was able to enter. Now it, it goes without saying that Milton has not been up to this point, writing, uh, writing an allegorical poem. The creatures moving and speaking have been actual creations of the deity and with a strange exception of, of, of Medusa. And, and they have a substantial reality within the fictional context. The mimetic context of this, of this epic, the, these are angels. They are individual creatures who seem really to be in hell just as they seem really to have been in heaven, but the figures of sin and death, this is an entirely different, they are entirely different animals, uh, are mere personifications of abstract ideas.

Speaker 1:          42:11          And it's not at all clear that sin enters son death exist as individual entities in the same way or on the same plane that Satan does, for example, or Beelzebub. And it's reasonable, I think to invoke dot. Dr. Johnson here, Samuel Johnson, who writes in his life of Milton that Milton's, I love this. Milton's unskillful allegory appears to be one of the greatest faults of the poem whenever Johnson as being arrogant and and mean about paradise lost. And variably he's onto something. And he's telling us that Milton has gone too far. He's taken his allegory too far. He permits a real character like Satan to interact with the merely allegorical or symbolic character like, like sin and the effect for Johnson. And who can say that this is Johnson is wrong. The effect involves an awkward collision of different artistic modes and entirely distinct planes of reality. It's a, I don't know if you've ever seen a movie.

Speaker 1:          43:14          Well there are lots of movies that do this. One of the first movies that did this was the who killed Roger Rabbit. If that's something you're familiar with in which the interaction of real people with what are called tunes in that film is part of the, as part of the film's pleasure that the boundary between different levels of reality, uh, is, is crossed and Milton's doing performing a similar boundary crossing aesthetic gesture here. Now it might be morally useful to talk about the forces of sin and death as if they were actual moral agents. Uh, but, but it, but it makes no sense within the mimetic narrative that Milton has created for us here in this realistic poem. And I think that Milton is acutely self conscious of the uncertain status that these allegorical characters that he has invented a have. And so I'm going to propose this.

Speaker 1:          44:07          The idea that Milton's own allegory is while it is a serious allegory and it's uh, and it's performing all sorts of work that I don't have time to talk about it, is at the same time a critique of allegory, a look at the description of sin. This is a line six 48 on page two 47 of the Hughes before the gates. They're sat on either side, a formidable shape. The ones seemed woman to the waist and fair but ended foul and many escape the fold voluminous and vast a serpent armed with mortal sting. Now those of you who've taken English one 25 or any course that has asked you to read, Spencer will recognize almost instantly I think, I hope, uh, Milton's literary debt at the very moment that Milton is beginning his own attempt at allegory. He alludes to the most famous allegorical character by England's most famous allegorical poet.

Speaker 1:          45:06          This is error, the filthy dragon us, um, who charms us or doesn't charm us in the first canto of the first book of the Fairy Queen Like Milton sin, Spencer's error is half woman, half serpent. And in a lot of ways she embodies the very problem of religious error. Dr. Johnson is his right to, to suggest that Milton's use of Spin Spencerian allegory only invites a, a confusion of, of what should, what are essentially disparate and irreconcilable categories. But what Johnson doesn't seem to understand is that the confusion is precisely Milton's point. It doesn't make sense to speak of sin and death as if they were living entities capable of action and actual influence, um, in the, in the, as if they were living entities. Um, moving about as agents in the world. But, and why is that for Milton's from within the perspective of Milton's freewill theology, sin can't exist as an external reality.

Speaker 1:          46:13          It can't exist as a force that can seize the human individual from, from the outside without that individuals consent. Because we are all, we all freely sin. No one can be compelled to do anything within the miltonic. A theology of freewill sin can only exist as the product of individual choices that freely willing people like Adam and eve or like Satan before his fall, uh, make. And for Milton to purse the world and to rigidly determined categories like good and evil or sin and virtue is simply to be guilty of, of intellectual error. This isn't how the world works in, this isn't the miltonic universe. So Milton is alluding, so unashamedly here to Spencer's error because I think on some level he wants to brand Spencerian allegory as an erroneous literary practice. Now we've, we've seen Milton do this before. He's, he uses, and I'm thinking of uses in a pejorative way.

Speaker 1:          47:17          He uses a poet like homer to extract what beauty he can from deep within the Homeric mines. And then he does that only to turn on homer with that devastating. Thus they were late earning. He doesn't even get homer. The credit of being singular and having composed the Elliot, they whose day he can't even bring himself to say us, he relates earning so powerful. Is this defense against homer? Homer was in error. Milton told us, and Milton cold on the voice, the moral voice of Spencer to help him make that moral judgment against homer. But one of Milton's projects in paradise lost is to affect his forgetting of all of his literary precursors. And that means that he has to expel from his system, not just home or not just Virgil and Dante, but also his better teacher, Edmund Spenser. And it's almost as if we can hear Milton say after he's given us his own really quite elaborate display of allegorical poetry.

Speaker 1:          48:21          Thus, Spencer relates burring. Now, Milton may have forgotten in 1644 when he wrote the area Politica Milton may have forgotten that Spencer's guy in did in fact descend into hell without the help of his teacher, the polymer for Milton. Then at least at that point in his career, his literary career, such a trip without a guide, may well have seemed unthinkable. The temptations of the, of the wealth of classical literature represented by Mammon. Perhaps we're too powerful, uh, to, to resist alone. But now, now in the 1660s I think it's possible to see a way in which Milton finally gets the story right. He realizes now that it is possible. Perhaps it is possible for the Christian poet to descend into the literary underworld alone just as it was possible for Sir Gyan in the actual fairy queen to descend into the cave of mammon alone.

Speaker 1:          49:22          Milton surveys, the wealth of literary tradition before I'm any resists. It's allure without the help of any, without the help of any human guide, he can reject the beauty of homer. He can reject the beauty of Virgil, but he can also reject and this has got to be an even greater challenge. Perhaps he can also reject the help of his Christian teacher, Edmund Spenser. And so I'm going to leave you here at the end of this lecture less with the conclusion then with a paradox. I think that Milton in paradise lost finally remembers what actually happened, what actually happened in Spencer Spencer's cave of Mammon, how the hero triumphed alone. But Milton remembers this particular Spencerian story only once he has successfully forgotten Spencer only once he has set aside fully his, his teacher's style of poetry. Okay, that's a, that's it for today. Next time, reread for the third time. You will be repaid by your dedication. Uh, books one and two. This time focusing on the similes. And also, as I mentioned at the beginning of class, read the essays by Stanley Fish and Jeffrey Hartman.
