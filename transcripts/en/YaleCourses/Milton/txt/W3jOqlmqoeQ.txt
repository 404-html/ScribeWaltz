Speaker 1:          00:00          So the first thing I want you to do is turn to page 378 this is the beginning of book nine. It's a curious feature, I think of book nine that it, that that it begins with a consideration of talk. The narrator's lamenting the fact that that Raefiel has just departed the garden and that soon not ought not long after Raphael's departure that Adam and eve will fall and this fall is going to have an impact. And this is something that the the is really emphasizing here. It's going to have an impact on the way they talk. For example. It's going to be impossible after this point for human beings to enjoy a friendly conversation with an angel. So this is how book nine begins. No more of talk where God or angel guest with man, as with his friend, familiar used to sit indulgent and within per take, rural repast permitting him the while venial discourse on blamed with the, with the departure now of a of Raefiel man will never again be permitted to enjoy venial discourse on blamed.

Speaker 1:          01:12          And venial here has a, has a special meaning. It means allowable or permissible. And Milton suggesting that the, that the fall brings with it certain restrictions, specifically restrictions of language, and they're start to arise constraints on speech or what Milton calls here talk. And when you read the last two books of paradise lost, which we'll be doing for the next week, you'll begin to see just, just what kinds of restrictions Adam speech will be subjected to the the Angel Michael Will, we'll continually criticized and correct Adam's talk. And, and the general feeling I think of the last two books can be quite uncomfortable for, for just this reason after the fall, Adam and eve live in a world in which mere speech itself can be blamed or in some cases it can be, it can be prohibited altogether. The fall is imagined in, uh, in, in books nine and 10 to have a, as you can, uh, of course, this is the, this is the event herald and the heralded in the title.

Speaker 1:          02:13          So it's a big deal. It's imagined to have a, an enormous range of consequences. And Milton divides these consequences, um, into essentially a two categories. The first, you have the mythic consequences that take place are imagined to take place in the physical world. And then there are also the psychic, the psychological consequences that takes place somewhere within the consciousnesses of, of Adam and eve. And it's with, it's with a great amount of, of literary, imaginative literary Gusto that Milton enumerates the mythic consequences, which he does at some length. Then in book 10. So you'll remember that, um, after the fall, Adam and eve are punished with bad weather and Milton, it's, and it's wonderful when Milton does this kind of thing. He tries to represent punishment with as much scientific specificity as he possibly can. So the angels are instructed by God to shift the sun around and to tilt the poles of the earth, some, some 20 degrees from the sun's access.

Speaker 1:          03:12          And these mythically imagined astronomical alterations will bring with them the four seasons, uh, new to new to earth. And of course, the inclement wins, the biting cold that will plague forever and forever. The sons and daughters of Adam and eve. Needless to say, these are enormous changes, but when you consider the sheer magnitude of these cosmic shifts, it's all the more interesting I think. And all of the more noteworthy that the effect of the fall that Milton and laments first in book nine is the effect on consciousness and the effect on is specifically on speech. It's, it's here in book nine that Milton signals that his own talk, his own speech has been affected by this new subject, the subject that he has no choice but to deal with now, which is that of the fall. Milton, we'll have to alter, this is how the argument goes.

Speaker 1:          04:07          He will have to alter the style of his poem in order to suit the subject matter of the fall. And so this is, um, this is what he's doing at line five or what he tells us he's doing. Um, I must now change these notes to tragic and then in, and the change in Milton's poetic notes, these musical notes that are of course, um, his poetic verses or the, his is the nature of his literary literary representation. The change in these notes is manifest in a, in a, in a lot of ways throughout the final books of paradise lost for, for one thing, it's here that we have the, the last invocation of the poem. Um, and it's not coincidental. I think that this last in vocation in paradise lost is not actually an invocation at all. Milton does not directly address the, um, Urania the, the, the muse.

Speaker 1:          05:01          He could only speak of her in the third person. If this is line 20, if answerable style I can obtain of my celestial patroness I'm in Milton is enable, it seems to address the Muse directly anymore. Um, and how, how big that if is if answerable style I can obtain. Um, we, we, we don't, we don't actually know. We don't know whether he'll be able to obtain the answerable style. There's been a huge, a falloff in the poets, uh, poetic self confidence. He can't express himself on blamed as he had tried to do in the invocation to holy light in book three. You'll remember that question. May I express the and blamed he's, he's failed here to clear the lines of communication, uh, between himself and, and this heavenly being. And, and of course in this, in this failure, Milton, the narrator, the persona of the poet resembles Adam any, he's no longer permitted this kind of direct dial access to Urania just as Adam and eve are no longer permitted.

Speaker 1:          06:06          They're friendly conversations with a friendly angel like, like Raphael, they will have conversations with an angel or Adam will. Um, but Michael's, as you will see, Michael's a stern toodle edge. It can hardly be described as, as friendly. It's certainly instructive, but Milton would never be able to bring himself to use the adjective affable in characterizing Michael as of course he did. So charmingly with Raefiel. So for Milton, the fault is inextricably connected to problems of language and, and specifically no problems of, of literature. And so this is what we're going to, one of the things that we'll be looking at and, and this is why I'm not, I'm, I know I'm always beginning lectures with, can you believe it, that we don't find out in paradise lost until now that this incredibly important thing happens and I'll be doing it yet. One more time.

Speaker 1:          06:57          It's not until now. And this seems as a, as, as big a postponement as any of the postponements. So that I've mentioned, it's not until now in book nine that Milton finally gets around to explaining why it is he, he decided to write his epic about the fall, the fall of man. Look at line 25 since first, this subject for heroic song pleased me long choosing and beginning late, not set jealous by nature to indict wars. Hither to the only argument, heroic deemed chief mastery to dissect with long and tedious havoc, fabled nights in battles famed and Milton had intended for for quite some time as we know to, to write his epic poem on the subject of a fabled night. I mean he actually wanted, uh, to, to have his great English epic be something like a continuation of the legend of King Arthur.

Speaker 1:          07:53          And his epic was going to be a chivalric romance epic, like the poems by the great, the great renaissance poets Ariosto and Taso, or of course like the fairy queen by his own countrymen, Edmund Spenser. And in fact, one of the central figures you could say these central figure in the fairy queen is just that legendary Arthur that Milton had as a young man wanted to write about. But Milton now insists that it was on moral grounds that he chose finally chose not to write his poem in the form of a heroic Chevelle. Rick Romance. Um, this is line 32 of book nine. Milton decided not to devote or invest his poetic talent in, in, in all of those meaningless features of romance literature that he's now saying improperly, uh, go into the title of heroic. So he refuses. This is line 32 he refuses to describe races and Games or tilting furniture, emblazoned shields and praises, quaint comparisons and steeds bases and tinsel trappings. Gorgeous nights at gels and tournament. And this, this list is something like a [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          09:07          This is a common, these are the common elements of the Romance Trisha tradition and it's kind of like a, a cliff notes summary of all of the conventional features of a romance like Sir Phillips, Sydney's Arcadia or Edmund Spencer's, fairy queen. And in some cases Milton is actually lifting entire phrases such as tinsel trappings, which appears a few times in the fairy queen. Um, he's lifting them out of the pages of Spencer built. Milton knows perfectly well that this is a disservice to his favorite poet, Spencer and the Romances of the very queen. They're their, their romance. That is the fairy queen is clearly a lot more than merely a depiction of battles and games, although that certainly is a feature of it. The most characteristic feature of the romance genre, not just in Spencer's hands, but in the hands of all writers, all renaissance writers, their romance, the most characteristic feature is the hero or the heroine who travels the country side in search of adventure, in search of an opportunity to, to prove his or her virtue or an opportunity to prove, prove his or her courage.

Speaker 1:          10:14          And the principal means by which the romance plot advances is almost always by the wandering of its of its heroes. Heroes and heroines wander the landscapes of romance, and there's a lot of ideological significance attached to to, to this wandering. They, they rarely have set out before them, some kind of specific map or a guide that will allow them to proceed along. They're narrowly defined goal and the demons and the demons that romance he Rose Battle and the serpents that they fend off nearly always come as as this, this surprise, uh, they're not discovered with the help of a map. They're almost always, and this is certainly the case in the fairy queen, they're almost always happened upon the fact that Romancey rose have simply wandered into an adventure, only proves their virtue and their courage all the more. Um, once of course they have prevailed.

Speaker 1:          11:16          It's important. It's important that Milton has waited so long to, to explain his rejection of the genre of romance as the form that the great his great poem would take. And that's because the, the, the rejection of romance I think has everything to do as he's imagining it with the consequence of the fall in paradise lost. Um, what, what are the most convincing elements I think of Satan's temptation of eve is his attempt to turn her act of disobedience into an act of romance chivalry. So look at the look at book nine line six 90 Seton suggest to eve at six 92 that that God won't incense his eye or for such a petty trespass as eating the fruit. Um, and then he continues. God will praise rather you're dauntless virtue in the world of romance. Uh, the, the idea of obedience isn't nearly as important as the idea of courage or what Satan calls here, uh, in, in perfect chivalric language dauntless virtue and Sec St. It was essentially attempting, he's tempting to, he's tempting to eve to think of herself as a heroine of a romance, as, as if you were saying you're listening, I don't know what you've heard, but you're not a character in a biblical tragedy.

Speaker 1:          12:40          You're not a character. Even in a biblical epic, you are Wandering Knight in a shovel, Rick Romance and your only job actually is to prove your courage to prove your virtue. And of course, um, eve is dead wrong to, uh, to apply the assumptions of romance to this decidedly unromantic test of her obedience. But Milton gives us for that moment a little glimpse, this moment of Satan's temptation. He gives us a little glimpse into a possible alternative to the story of Eve. The, the, the, the told in the book of Genesis, if the, if the story of Eve had been framed in the genre of romance rather than in the genre of tragedy than eve might've been rewarded. Rather than punished for her eating of the fruit, I'm her courage would have been praised rather than her disobedience blamed. So bill Knowlton rejects the genre of romance.

Speaker 1:          13:40          Of course he has no choice but to as a viable literary mode in the description of the fall in book nine. But he does so only after he's made ample use and he's exploited it, uh, to an extraordinary degree. And I think he's made ample use of the principle movement of Romance. And that's the movement of wandering milk. This, this poem is filled with images of wandering as if, as if the poem shows traces or some kind of literary residue of the genre that Milton decided not to write this epic poem in the Romance as, as if somewhere inside of this is, uh, of this, uh, this biblical epic, there's a romance, epic's Chevelle, Rick epic struggling to get out. Uh, when Milton rejects the romance genre in this, in vocation, he begins to alter the poem sense of the meaning and the poems since of the significance of the very activity of, of wandering. So Adam and eve, and it's incredibly depressing if you, as most people have, um, have grown up listening to your parents argue. Um, they began about the

Speaker 1:          14:52          causes of the fall and they, they, they, they lapse into a, uh, a depressing cycle of mutual recrimination and Adam insists that eve fell because of a tendency she had to wander, you know, look what happened. He let her wander off yesterday morning. And you know, you, you know the story, that's essentially his argument and the subject of eads wandering becomes the focal point of the first marital argument after the fall. So Adam rejects eves wandering just as Milton as rejecting the whole genre of wandering, the, the, the, the literary form of the Romance. And I think that there's a way in which these two forms of rejection or are closely related and what's at stake with both of these forms of rejection, these acts of rejection is, is a problem of language. [inaudible] nope. So when Milton Rights in line 20 of the invocation that he's struggling, he, he, he writes that he's struggling to find an answerable style as style that will answer to this, this new occasion, the tragic occasion of the fall.

Speaker 1:          15:58          He needs to change his style in a way that can actually answer to the tragedy that he's about to describe. And so as a literary event, the, the, the fall makes its biggest impact I think on the, through a change in the style of the poem through the systematic. And, and by that I mean there's something like a systematic alteration of, uh, of the use of certain key words. So I'm going to, I'm going to be focusing for a moment on the changes undergone by a particular word. Um, and you've probably already guessed what it will be a particular word in paradise lost. Although there are a number of words that seem to undergo similar or at least closely related, uh, changes over the course of the poem. But here I'll be looking at the word wander. That word wander or wandering or some version of that word appears no fewer than 32 times in a, in, in paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          16:53          And without question, I think every appearance of of the word is loaded. The energy charging, the word wander comes from the fact I think that it has embedded within it or attached to it in some way the entire genre of the Chevelle rec romance that of course Milton has rejected and it's almost as if the word wander is a code word for romance. And when Milton uses the word wandering, it's almost as if he's alluding to this Spencerian type of poem that he rejected when he decided to write paradise lost. It's a reminder of the kind of poem that this could have been if it hadn't been a biblical epic. And, and you can see a way in which the word wandering and paradise lost, um, seems to range somewhere or move perhaps back and forth between two distinct meanings. And so I've, I've, um, it's a little confusing, but I've, I've given us, uh, something, a schematic version of the semantic spectrum that the word wander in habits in, in, uh, in paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          17:58          So I guess you could think of the pure or the innocent meaning of wander is, is, is purely spatial. It, it is purely a spatial description of a kind of directionless or unforced motion. Um, and then as, as the further you move to the right of the spectrum, you get it's figurative and therefore its moral meaning, which is error error. The pejorative sense of Aaron Aaron out simply has wandering and straying from the law, wandering as a divergence from that which God wants you, that which God wants you to do. So from a kind of pure and uncontaminated meaning, um, to the right of the spectrum to something much more morally pejorative, you can actually think of the word wander as something like a Chevelle Rick Knight that undergoes its own set of adventures and challenges and transformations over the course of this poem. So let's, um, let's look at an early instance of the word wander.

Speaker 1:          19:00          This is book two line one 46. This is be legal in the console. The great debate in in Hell when Billy Allen book to ponders the possibility of the annihilation of the angels. It's a horrible possibility for him. The consequences that, uh, the consequence theater he imagines as most painful and most absolutely unbearable is the possibility that his mind will no longer be able to wander. So be legal asks this question. This is line one 46 at book too, for who would lose though full of pain. This intellectual being these thoughts that wander through eternity and sure Bilio is a fallen angel and nothing goes out of his way to provide a kind of doc trinal condemnation of everything and be Leo speech. But there's no sense actually that there's anything wrong with the general concept of, of, of intellectual wandering and in fact be Lele seems to be quoting Milton himself from Aereo budgeted can, which Milton celebrates above all things, the white to wander, the right to wander through literature, through all of one's reading and all of one's cultural, cultural exposure without a guide.

Speaker 1:          20:12          Milton rights scenario politica that God gives us mines and he loves this fact. God gives us minds that wander beyond all limit and satiety and, and the whole principle of divine wandering. Now, the whole principle of human wandering has given a powerful divine sanction, um, in, in area politica. And so initially in paradise lost, we have just that kind of innocent, uh, innocent meaning to the word wandering it as, as it appears. Um, early in the poem, um, look at another early instance. This is book four line two 33. Page two, 83 of the Hughes. Um, Milton's describing here how the four rivers of paradise spread out and travel through the earth. How the river divided into four main streams runs diverse wandering, many of famous realm and country. So the river divides into four streams, wandering, many of famous realm and country. Um, and, and here it's a river that's been actually cast in the role of, uh, of the hero of a chivalric romances.

Speaker 1:          21:21          Typically of course it's the night a Chevelle Rick Knight who wanders many of famous realm and country. Now we may be tempted to assume that because of the rivers of Eden or wandering through the countryside, that there's already a tendency toward something like moral error or straying from the law of built somehow into the landscape of the garden. We may assume that Adam and eve will naturally, how could they not stray from the proper path of obedience if they live in a natural world that is itself continually Strang and and wandering. But Milton invites us to make that connection, but then a slaps our wrists for even entertaining it for a moment. He uses wandering here in these early passages in an almost aggressively innocent sense. He simply wants to describe a nonlinear emotion, a direction that hasn't been dictated or directed by a by a higher power.

Speaker 1:          22:16          And, and one of the, and I've made this point before, but one of the labors of reading paradise lost is knowing when to recover and then actually trying to recover the purely innocent significance of some of the poems. Keywords. So the idea of an innocent wandering is central to Milton's poem because the activity of wandering and the, the activity of wandering and the principle of freewill are so absolutely intimately connected. If think about it, if wandering is a, is is a motion that doesn't follow a predetermined or a predestined path, then then the wanderer is necessarily always free from the constraints of, of, of an external force. Or You could say that the wander is always free on some level from the constraints or the guidance even have an omnipotent God. The variability to wander the right to wander is something like a guarantee or a strong proof of one's freedom.

Speaker 1:          23:16          In book nine, though, this is, this is one of the reasons this book can be so hard to read. Um, the, the very notion of wandering starts to come under suspicion and there's a sense that Milton can't afford any longer to be so free. Uh, and his talk about wandering, no more talk of innocent wandering. He might've begun. Uh, this book with the, with the fall wandering is no longer and blamed or venial to use those words, uh, from the, from the opening, quasi in vocation, it, it comes under a new set of ethical constraints. And it's almost as if I'm wandering by the time you get to book nine no longer has an opportunity or the liberty to occupy the innocent or the left hand side of the semantic spectrum, but it's almost entirely forced to occupy the figurative, the moral and specifically the morally pejorative, uh, side of that words meaning.

Speaker 1:          24:17          Um, so look, let's take a look at how that, that happens. Um, this is page three 93 in the Hughes book, nine line six, 36 34 and Milsons describing Satan's leading a vive to the tree of knowledge, obviously a consequential event and eve as compared to an amazed night wanderer, I would night wander or who has been diluted and misled by a wandering fire. And I'm wondering if fire is a meteor, uh, moving across the sky. And at the moment of the fall, all of those wonderfully liberating significance is that had been attached to the notion of wandering suddenly seem to just drop out of the equation altogether. And the evil that we have, no choice but to associate with Satan starts to start. The evil starts to absorb and, and suck up all of those innocent, those beautiful associations that the word wandering had had.

Speaker 1:          25:16          And so instead of, uh, a capacious semantic spectrum, you get something like a rigid and much more fixed sense of the meaning of this word wandering by the time we get to the fall. Um, let's look on this is page 404 in the Hughes a line, 1000, 134 of book nine, 1134. By the time Adam gets around a blaming eve for the fall. And of course, of course he does that, um, uh, uh, that the word wander has been entirely confined to the moral, the morally pejorative part of its semantic range. And so for Adam, and he says remarkable. Uh, the, the point at which he falls isn't what we know to be the point at which he falls, which is the moment that she eats the fruit. The point at which he falls according to Adam. Here is that moment in which you wandered away.

Speaker 1:          26:09          She wandered away after their argument or their conversation about their separation. And so we, it says to eve at line 11, 34 would vow hat's Tarkin to my words and stayed with me as I'd be softy when that strange desire of wandering this unhappy mourn, I know, not whence possessed theme, that's strange desire of wandering. I think it's, I think it's painful almost to hear Adam used that phrase, that strange desire of wandering as if wandering. We're a concept, so alien and so foreign, uh, in the world of Paradise, Milton tells us, uh, just above this passage at, at, at line 1132, that Adam is speaking in an altered style and this alteration of style is, uh, surely on the one hand this, the angry tone of voice that he's using as he's speaking to his wife. But it's also, I think a certain restriction of semantic possibility.

Speaker 1:          27:10          The possibility of, of the significances of the words that he's using and, and hear the word wandering can only have it's morally pejorative meaning, and there's a sense in which Matt in which Adam is condemning not just eve, but the whole range of freedoms that lip that Milton had been working so hard to establish in as, as important actually crucial components of the, uh, of his liberal universe. Well, Eve hears this and she's right. She's right to be perfectly aghast. And she's a gas not simply because Adam is, as he is, is, is, uh, is exhibiting a kind of surprisingly unbecoming capacity for rudeness. It's not just the tone of voice that appalls her. She's also appalled by the altered style of Adam speech, by which I mean the powerfully reductive, a force of his tall talk. Look at line 1144 this is Neve, what words have passed by lips, Adam's severe imputes that that imputes Dow that to my default or, and you can see the kind of quotation marks that Eva's putting in the air right now.

Speaker 1:          28:24          Um, imputes though that to my default or we'll have wandering as now cost it. Eve is eve is right. I think to be surprised that this altered this fallen use of the word wandering has passed Adam's lips. And you can almost hear her say, listen, you know, what's going on? I always thought wandering was a good thing. A wandering is of course what the river's in paradise do. Adam and I, and I thought that the right to wander, it's a right that we possess as creatures in a creatures of freewill in, in a, in a free place. How dare you blame the fall on wandering and, and one thing I think we can say for eve is that she's an excellent, she's an excellent reader of poetry. And like a good reader. She's bristling here at the suggestion that a word as capacious, as wandering is capable, only have one type of significance.

Speaker 1:          29:20          There's a sense that before the fall words in Milton's poems had a kind of nimbleness. There was a, there was a flexibility to them and ultimately as you, as you remember, Milton unimagined, his verse style is something like the verbal equivalent of an angel's body. Um, his poem was a body of verse that was free of restrictive joints and limbs of the traditional rhymed couplet. And there was a suppleness that that'll allowed words and phrases and whole sentences to assume a h a a huge array of meanings just as angels can either sexism in, in heaven. But there's a sense in which words seem to lose a lot of their suppleness. Um, after the fall. And this depressing, lots of, of, of a kind of linguistic mobility is for Milton. I think one of the central crises of, of the poem, a word like wander suddenly begins to to assume joints and limbs.

Speaker 1:          30:19          It becomes arthritic and, and its meanings become restricted and reduced to a, to a black and white world of good and bad. Uh, and, and, and, and it's not, it's not just wander. There are other keywords that undergo similar transformations. Um, slightly different transformations of course, because they are different persons are different characters, but I'm thinking of words such as fruit or error or taste. Any of these would make an excellent paper topic, a tracing of the history of the word as it progresses through the poem. So words that had been so polyvalent, so, so multifaceted are, are beginning suddenly to be concretized as, as moral error. The words are becoming polarized. They're pushed to the opposite poles of good and evil. And, and this moved to reductive signification has seem to have, I think, and Milton wants us to see it as having some disastrous consequences for his poem.

Speaker 1:          31:21          And one of the most disastrous consequences of the new altered style of paradise lost involves the poems, new understanding of e four for a while, for a while it seemed possible that the official line on sexual hierarchy was just one was just one of of of the possible readings of of Paradise. They'll government. There were at least some suggestions. I thought they were at least some suggestions that that that there was actually a kind of natural equality between Adam and eve and that the matter of hierarchy was like a cultural imposition of an arbitrary order onto the naturally egalitarian status of their relationship. A cultural imposition that God himself had imposed, at least as you know very well at least I have found myself over the last couple of weeks trying to make a case for a certain openendedness to the, to human relations, to the relations between the sexes in Milton's Eden and I'm willing now to confess, I will confess here and now that maybe I pushed that case a little too far.

Speaker 1:          32:34          I pushed that case of this openendedness to the relation between Adam and eve a little further than the poem would actually allow me to push it. And if I have, um, if I have had, uh, gone too far in that particular interpretive direction over the course of these last, let's say three or four lectures, the poem now is correcting me, my wrist is being slapped, and by the time we get to the end of book nine, it's becomes impossible. And it becomes even possibly impossible for me. And I can push this stuff pretty hard to maintain the case for the gray areas or the blurred edges that surround the, the, the poems, the poem sexism. So, so no more of talk. No more of Rogers's talk of Milton's infinitely feel good, flexible feminism. Um, your, your, your professor can now be seen to have strayed beyond the bounds of, of responsible, responsible pedagogy.

Speaker 1:          33:35          And perhaps you'd be, you'd be well advised. I Dunno, it's up to you whether you should just throw away your notes from the last, um, three or four lectures or I will advise Dan the cameraman simply to erase. We'll erase the last three tapes. Um, because maybe I was entirely wrong after the fall, there's less and less of an alternative to Raefiel his insistence on, on sexual hierarchy. Everything is much more black and white now. And any ambivalence that that may have been expressed about the justice of Eve's subjection to Adam seem simply in some way to just disappear after the fall. One of the divine punishments, and it's always started strikes students has kind of odd that one of the punishments that follows the fall is the official subjection of women to man the sun. The Sun and Paradise lost passes judgment on eve and he declares it.

Speaker 1:          34:26          This is in book 10 to thy husbands will vine shall submit. He over thee shall rule. And a lot, you know, often we ask, well, what's, what's the big deal? How is this different from their situation before? But it is the big deal and this is a punishment. Um, you'll remember that eve before the fall had always been in a position to choose to yield, to add them. Um, and here she, she no longer has a choice. She just gets seized. And she's never given the opportunity to yield. And maybe the distinction strikes some of us as as, as a little specious, but it's a, it's a meaningful one I think to Milton, but there's more to the fall than just this official de la laying down of a new law, a newly rigorous and newly and forest law of sexual subordination, of involuntary, involuntary sexual, uh, subjection.

Speaker 1:          35:20          Look at page four 27 in the Hughes. This is book 10 line eight 67. There's, there's a, there's a new subjection of language, the subjection of language to a new altered style. Um, and in this passage we have Adam really at his most misogynist eve comes to Adam and try to make amends after the fall. And Adam just lets loose with this powerful antifeminist invective. So this is line eight 67 of book 10 out of my sight vow serpent that named best befits the with him lead thy self is false and hateful. Nothing wants but that they shaped like his and colors. Serpent teen may show the inward fraud to warn all creatures from the henceforth and the fall brings with it a new name for eve serpent and, and is actually thinking of one of the incredibly mean spirited and I think it was actually mistaken, but it was a traditional etymology for the name Eve, which had at various points over uh, the, the, the history of biblical interpretation actually in the Hebrew was believed to have meant serpent.

Speaker 1:          36:38          Adam here identifies eve with the serpent and he's providing a significance for eve the word eat, that that drastically constricts the enormous range of meanings that, that we may have associated with her up to this point that we, we were right presumably do associate with her up to this point. You'll remember that in book for the weaving, motions of Eve's hair had been juxtaposed implicitly with the waving winding motions of the serpent. And one of the points of that juxtaposition was to come to understand that the, the waving wandering motion was entirely innocent before the fall. That only comes to be associated with with moral error. I'm the right hand side of the semantic spectrum after the fall. But, but, but once again, um, Adam reveals to suddenly reveals himself to be an abominable reader of poetry and uh, and absolutely incapable of nuance and suggestiveness and he reinterpreted, he reinterprets all of the innocent similarities between the wandering waviness of eve and the serpent into something like an absolute identification with evil.

Speaker 1:          37:50          The neem eve suddenly takes on the force of something like a morally pejorative word, and Adam only makes his case stronger by reiterating this new black and white understanding of the concept of wandering. Get this, um, this is, um, line eight 73 of book 10, but for the, he tells eve, but for the, I had persisted happy, had not die pride and wandering vanity when least was safe. Rejected my fore warning pride in wandering vanity wandering as practically taken on the force of a, uh, of a curse word. In this sentence, it's lodged contemptuously between pride and vanity. As if out of nowhere, Milton is elevating the notion of wandering to something like the eighth deadly sin. Uh, the, the, the very, the very idea of wandering. Of course, we know this insists upon the importance of, of ambiguity and ambivalence. And I think it's just this ambiguity and Ambo ambivalence that Adam has really lashing, lashing out out. He's struggling to align the concept of wandering with some of the most hateful and some of the most misogynist impulses of the poem.

Speaker 1:          39:04          It's, it's, it's important though to, to understand that it's not just, and it's depressing also to understand that it's not just Adam who's responsible for the reduction of eve and the reduction of Eve's wandering to the status of moral error. That the poem itself seems to be lending a kind of disconcerting, um, authority to this misinterpretation of eve. I think it's a misinterpretation of eve when Adam Falls, the, the, the text makes clear that it's for very different reasons from Eve's fall even fallen out of deception. And Adam had fallen out of love. He knew precisely what he was doing. Uh, this is, this is what the narrator tells us at line. Uh, and you don't need to turn their line nine 97 to book at book nine. Adam scruple not to eat against his better knowledge, not deceived, but fondly overcome with female charm, fondly overcome with female term, fondly overcome with female charm.

Speaker 1:          40:03          What sense does that make? That that's, that's the narrators in interpolation. The narrator is giving an a new authoritative interpretation of the event of the fall. And I think it's an entirely unfair, and it's not just unfair. This is wrong. Adam falls, we know this because of his sense of his marital bond. I think he's wrong to fall actually. Um, but it's not that he was, uh, overcome with thieves. Uh, female charm. He says, our state cannot be severed. We are one, one flesh to lose the word to lose myself. And he falls. He falls out of this, his sense of connectedness with the, but he doesn't fall because he's been seduced by his wife that the narrator has interpreted Adam's fallen away. That I think the text itself simply can't support. And it's a central example of how reductive interpretations aren't just to be attributed to Adam, but they're beginning actually to insinuate themselves into the authoritative voice of the, of the narrator book.

Speaker 1:          41:08          10 of paradise lost is, is the book given to the representation of the consequences of the fall? And given that one of the effects of the fall is, as I've been describing, is something like the imaginative shrinkage that language suffers. We, we shouldn't really be at all surprised by one of the early and very strange actions and book 10 it's, it's here that we, that we witness that we're forced witness the, the reappearance of the debased. And what I think is for this poem the entirely inappropriate genre of allegory. Suddenly as if from, as if from nowhere a Milton re-inject into his otherwise realistic poem, the decidedly unreal figures of, of, of sin and death. So look at book 10 line to 29 this is page four 11 and the Hughes a Milton describes the sun's descend to Earth to pass judgment on Adam and eve.

Speaker 1:          42:07          And at line two 29, he gives us a description of a set of events that's been happening simultaneously. And he uses this meanwhile structure a few times in paradise lost. Uh, meanwhile air thus was sinned and judged on earth within the gates of hell. Set Sin and death and, and the, and, and with this use of the meanwhile structure of the narrative, um, Milton's allow, allowing us to see the activity of sin and death not happening at a later point in the story of the fall. It's happening at the same time as the fallen. In fact, it's the same event. It's simply at the same event, told from a different perspective, a different point of view. And of course, it's told within an, within an entirely different literary mode. And one of the consequences of the fall has been a certain reduction of meaning, as I've been describing, undergone by some of the poems, uh, keywords.

Speaker 1:          43:01          And here in book 10, Milton Constructs an entire scene out of that literary mode, traditionally most given to reductive meanings. And that's the, the, the mode of allegory. It's, it's an allegory that when performed hamfisted Lee, um, you have a one to one correspondence between an image and it's meaning there isn't that, there isn't traditionally an allegorical writing the same kind of a proliferation of meanings that you can have in other literary modes. The follows the moment of course at which Adam and eve sin and the moment at which they are consigned to suffer the penalty of death. You know, that much we accept and is perfectly reasonable. Um, but, but here after the fall, Milton chooses to represent this new introduction of sin and death within the motive allegory. And the result has to be one of the most bathetic, one of the most preposterous scenes in all of paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          44:01          It's a, it's a, it's an embarrassment. Um, turn to page the top of page 413 in the Hughes line to 82. This is the argument since there will presumably be after the fall, a greater deal of communication between Earth and hell. The allegorical monsters, sin and death find themselves in the position of constructing and actual bridge, uh, constructing an actual, a bridge that will connect the earth with the home of the fallen angels, the hell. And so Milton represents the building of this bridge as some massive public works project. And there's, and I think there's every indication here that he's intending this representation to strike us as, as as perfectly absurd, um, sin and death begin to build the bridge. This is the line to 82 then both from out hell gates into the waste wide anarchy of chaos. Damp and dark, flew diverse and with power, their power was great hovering upon the waters.

Speaker 1:          45:03          And you'll notice here that we have a parody of, of God's creation where the Holy Spirit had hovered upon the waters of chaos and made it pregnant. Um, I'll continue what they met. Solid or slimy as enraging see tossed up and down together, crowded, drove from each side, show Ling toward the mouth of hell as when to polar winds blowing adverse. And I'm skipping around here together. Drive mountains of ice. It's a, it's a, it's a brilliant but a grotesque travesty parody of Gods vitalist creation of the universe, the process whereby impregnated matter or begins organically to organize itself into the, into the, into the beautiful creation, synonyms in death with their ham fisted creators here, they can't impregnate, caused chaos of course. So they, they build a bridge over chaos by, by manhandling, by manhandling chaos. They forced together all of the solid and all of the slimy stuff into one huge pile.

Speaker 1:          46:09          It's a, it's a grotesque image, but it's grotesquery I think serves an important point. I mean, it serves as Milton's emblem for, among other things, his emblem for the process undergone by language after the fall. It's, it's as if he's representing the shoulding together into one concrete block. All of the diverse and all of the various meanings associated with some of the poems, most resonant, most beautiful and most suggestive words. Look at looking at how death gets, um, all of the slippery stuff of chaos. You know, it's, it's wonderfully slippery, um, to hold together in the form of a bridge line two 93, the aggregated soil death with his mace [inaudible] cold and dry as with a trident smoked and fixed as firm as de Los, the floating island as deloads floating ones. The rest his look bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move. And with asphaltic slime death has the ability to fix this preposterous allegorical, allegorical character death has the ability to fix something fluid and flexible into something from and asphaltic and, and, and I think you have one of the most, one of the most powerful images of the aesthetic disaster that is fallen language.

Speaker 1:          47:31          The extraordinary matter of, of, of chaos is being concretized concretized here it's subjected to a pro process. Exactly like the linguistic conquered association undergone by a word like wander or the words fruit or error. These words begin to succumb to a kind of link linguistic rigor mortis. They ossify into a moral rigidity that I think would have seemed perfectly unthinkable to us at an, at an earlier stage in, in the, in the poem.

Speaker 1:          48:06          I, okay. I, I have, um, I've, I have another second. Um, we have what we have time. I think for one more example, this is the punishment of Satan. When God, when God punishes Satan for tempting eve, he does so in a way that makes literal and actual Satan's association with the serpent. Um, and it's really quite vulgar. Satan had of course just temporarily inhabited the body of the serpent and God punished is Satan by turning this temporary association into something like an actual condition. Look at book 10 live and five 55. This is page four, 19. Uh, Satan is metamorphosed. You'll remember in day two, a huge and hideous serpent at the gigantic public assembly in Hell. And, but Milton doesn't stop at that vulgar, quasi allegorical representation after Satan has met. After that Milton metamorphoses, all of the fallen angels into serpents and he and he places before them a grove of trees, all of them c containing the forbidden fruit.

Speaker 1:          49:08          So the fallen angels who are announced serpents are all so thirsty and so hungry that they can't help but climb the trees and try to taste the fruit. This is line five 55, yet parched with scolding thirst and hunger, fierce vote to dilute them sent could not abstain, but on they rolled in heaps and up the trees climbing set thicker than this snaky locks that curled McGarrah. Mcgarrah was one of the, one of the furies, the feminine figures in classical mythology who punish sin. And like Medusa Mcgarrah has serpents for locks of hair. And I think it's impossible to read these lines and not, uh, not see in them an embedded an incredibly unfair and ugly but embedded image of eve. The beautiful waving, wandering tresses of Eve have been identified now categorically and unrepentantly with the serpent, the serpent who was her downfall. And the poem seems to go about as far as it can go in the absolute ossification of a character into a kind of empty embodiment of, of, of, of moral evil.

Speaker 1:          50:18          The actual image of metamorphose metamorphoses here is, uh, is, is merely a narrative version of a process that we've seen occur in the language of paradise lost for, for some time now, moral ambivalence and poetic ambiguity has been transmogrified into something like moral definitiveness. And literary ambivalence has become a literary, literal mindedness. Well, happily the poem isn't over yet. And, and the grotesque reduction of Eve to evil is by no means, uh, the poems, last words. So think about as you read books 11 and 12 for next time, think about the, the literary texture of those books as you compare it to the earlier books. Um, uh, the poem it has off. It used to be argued, and it's an incredibly stupid argument that Milton was simply getting old and tired by the time he got around to writing books 11 and 12. Um, but of course he rent Wah, he went on to write statements and Samson agonists, Deason and paradise regained magnificent works of art. But there is nonetheless a marked change in the verbal character of the last two books of paradise lost through. So think about the implications of the altered style of, of the book's conclusion. Okay.
