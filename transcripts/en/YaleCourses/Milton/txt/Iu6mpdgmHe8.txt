Speaker 1:          00:01          Listen, this is probably the most difficult poem that we'll be reading all semester. Um, but as I mentioned briefly in the, in the last class, the, this, the notorious difficulties attending this, this poem seem to have very little to do with Milton's grief over the death of Edward King, which, which may well not have been all that troubled, uh, or, or a co or complicated. We have no, we have no evidence. And I mentioned this before, that there was a particularly close relation between these two young men. Uh, the difficulty of the poem lies to a great degree, I think in something that Dr. Johnson had noted in his attack or in his criticism on listen to us that, that I, that I mentioned on Monday, it's difficult. It's difficult to lies in Milton's tendency in this poem to seek out what wonderfully Dr. Johnson calls remote illusions.

Speaker 1:          00:59          The, um, this is by far the most learned and the most demanding lyric poem that Milton Rights. It's a home deeply invested in the tradition of, of, of pastoral poetry, pastoral poetry from a theocracy and virginal onward. It's a palm deeply invested. In fact, in the entire Western tradition of poetry in general. And, and finally, I think it can be said that it's a poem who's deepest investment is actually in Milton's mastery over the entire Western tradition of literature. Milton, and this is, this will be the working assumption that I bring to this. Uh, my, I bring to my reading of, of this poem Milton sets out to prove something enlisted us and the most important thing that he proves his, his control over the learning that he has accumulated. Now, I spoke last time of that familiar sense of, of hesitation, that apology with which Milton had opened the elegy.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Um, we, we, we hear in the 1637 listen to us, those same cries of unrighteousness and underprepared preparation that we had heard in the, in the 1631 Sonnet, how soon? Half the time, the subtle piece of youth when Milton opens listed us with it. That phrase, yet once more, one of the things that he's telling the reader is that yet, once more, yet once more, he'll be making the same argument for unreadiness. The same argument for nervous anticipation that he's made a number of times before. And so as a way of understanding the, what at this point is really the sheer repetitiveness repetitiveness of this disclaimer, I want to propose, I want to propose a metaphor. I propose that we think of Milton at the opening of Lucentis as being stuck, stuck at a particular point in the imagined, the projected or fantasize trajectory of his career.

Speaker 1:          03:00          And He, and I'm using the word stuck of course, because the lady had been stuck. Uh, so, so, so famously and so prominently in Comas. Uh, you, you may remember that I had suggested in the lecture on the Nativity, Yo, that Milton may have thought of his career as if it were something like a race. And I think here that the particular image of a career as a race still still holds, uh, but with a little bit of a difference. What seems so obvious, at least to me here in reading lists of this, is that at this point in 1637, there's a stumbling block or a hurdle that Milton in his race simply can't get over. No. The, the, the surest sign of a hurdle is, is, uh, is one of those pointed literary illusions that Milton makes enlisted us, one of those remote illusions that Johnson had complained about and it's an illusion that has everything to do with Milton's own sense of his unreadiness and I'm thinking of that. Oh, it's just, it's wonderful. That strange moment that happens fairly early on in the poem. This is line 76 in the Hughes edition, it's page 122.

Speaker 2:          04:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:16          It's that moment in which Phoebus Apollo makes a sudden and unexpected appearance and then now not only does feed this Apollo make a sudden appearance, but he seems actually to interrupt the speaker of the poem in order to correct him now. So, so we'll, we'll let, let's remind ourselves what's been happening. Milton has just been lamenting the fact that the laborious days of the, of the poet might not result in a sudden blaze of fame. What good is it? You'll remember what good is it? Milton has to tend the high homely slided shepherds trade. That's of course the vocation of poetry. It's that shepherd poet is just going to be struck down in his prime is Edward King. Had been. And you'll remember that Milton had complained that the thin spun life could be so easily slipped. But, but look at line 76.

Speaker 2:          05:07          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:07          but not the praise. Phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears. Okay. Uh, what, what's happened? Uh, Vivas Apollo, the god of the sun and not unimportantly also the god of poetry. He was Apollo bursts into the text and correct the poet. Correct. The poet's youthful interest in earthly fame. Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil. True fame exists only in heaven. The only reputation that matters is the praise you ultimately receive from God or all judging jove as he pronounces. Lastly, on each deed, and as in all of these early lyrics, jove, uh, conventionally, throughout the renaissance, um, is, is used as a, as a name within these classical fictions, uh, to, to, to signify the Christian God. Now this moment is striking in part because we had no idea how could we possibly have had an idea that FIBA is, Apollo was actually eaves dropping on the poet's discourse.

Speaker 1:          06:16          I think we're taken aback here. Were taken aback by the, the, the rude interruption in the otherwise seamless flow of the poets lament. But the poet, the, the, the, this moment is also striking because Milton has lifted it, lifted this entire scene of this interruption from somewhere else. He has taken it from one of the pastoral poems, a Virgil, the, the, the image of a poet interrupted and chided by the god of poetry comes straight out of the opening of Virgil's six ECT Gluck. And Virgil was, Virgil had written a poem in the six that clog that had touched Melton and it had touched Milton I think because it begins with Virgil's own brooding meditation on the course of his poetic career. Now we all know what Virgil's poetic career would go on to look like. Virtual would go on to be a great epic poet.

Speaker 1:          07:13          Um, but not until after he had written these pastoral at blogs. And then after that, after he had written the Georgic poems, only then does he write finally the great epic poem, the Aeneid. Now in Virgil's early poem, this, this six blog, the speaker explains that the writing of pastoral poetry is this stuff that, that young poets do. Poets begin their careers with easy pastoral poems, but, but virtual speaker says that he's more ambitious. Now he's starting to, to champ at the bit. He's ready to write an epic poem on much more important subjects then that then shepherds and shepherdess is he wants to write about kings and wars. And as soon as he has expressed this epic ambition, uh, virtual explains, as soon as he's expressed this Phoebus Apollo, the god of poetry stepped in and chided him. So this is, uh, this is virtual. When I was feigned to sing of kings and battles the Sinthian God, that's Phoebus Apollo plucked my ear and warned me.

Speaker 1:          08:20          Apollo warns Virgil that a pastoral poet simply shouldn't overstep his bounds. Uh, this is the Virgil, he should sing thin, little find spawn maize and he should be content feeding is fat sheep. The God told Virgil that he wasn't ready yet for the manly, the adult, uh, the public world, the important world of epic poetry. And so all of this anxiety, and when you think of it, all of this shame, uh, and, and, and as well as the, the shame of ambition, all of this gets packed into this illusion to Virgil that Milton brings to this very disturbing moment enlisted us. And it's important I think that this Virgilian scene with Apollo appears so early in Milton's. Milton's listed has Milton's of this doesn't end up all soaked in this unhealthy brew of neurotic brew of anxiety and shame and naked and ambition. And I think it's one of our jobs here to figure out why that's the why that's the case. Why doesn't, this is one way of putting the question, why doesn't Apollo harass or bother Milton at the end of Lucentis in the same way that he arrests as Milton at the poems beginning.

Speaker 1:          09:40          Now I, um, I think you may be rather happy to hear that this is the last time.

Speaker 1:          09:48          I'm pretty sure that this is the last time that we will have to discuss at least at any length. Milton's worries about his unreadiness and his and his and preparation. It's, it's safe to say that, listen, this is one of the last poetic works of Milton's that's really consumed with this problem, the problem of fruitless anticipation and in some ways I think that that's because the poem was it us seems in some ways to solve the problem of Milton's weightings and this problem that he has a meeting to wait. And so one of the things that needs to be explored here is why. Why this poem is the last poem that Milton is not prepared to write. What does Milton do? This is, this is what I see as our project, our interpretive project. As we approached this poem, what is Milton do to get himself unstuck from this seat of anxious, anxious, anticipation?

Speaker 3:          10:49          That's the project.

Speaker 1:          10:51          So we looked, we looked last time at the, at the oddity that peculiarity of Milton's choice of genre here, the pastorals genre. Milton was the only Cambridge poet to honor Edward King in that memorial anthology by writing a poem in the pastoral mode and and, and a and a pastoral of course features shepherds and shepherd as, as, as it's most distinguishing characteristic. The word pastoral comes from the Latin Pastore store, which literally means shepherd and Ulta knew perfectly well how artificial his use of the pastoral mode of poetry would seem. And as well as how out of fashion, how completely outdated it would seem. But one of the motives for a selection of this, John or the pastoral genre is the tradition and institution that goes all the way back to theocracy and Virgil that associates shepherds with poets, and this has always been a part of the pastoral genre to speak of shepherds and shepherding.

Speaker 1:          11:48          And a pastoral poem seems almost invariably to a strategy or a way to speak of poets and their craft of poetry. This is, this is a kind of literary self consciousness that, that, that we're all familiar with. But there's another meaning given to shepherds as well. After the longs way of the awkwardness is, and Virgil's pastorals of course, Christianity entered the scene, a new dispensation and Christianity began to load this pastoral literary tradition with its own set of associations. Shepherds came to resent you. Separate came to represent not only poets, they came to stand for ministers. They came to signify allegorically ministers as well. So priests, ministers or pastors, we still call them pastors, had long been referred to as as shepherds, they are leaders of their flocks. And so it seemed a natural move for early Christian writers to use this existing pastoral form when they wanted to speak on the subject of, of, of, of priests or ministers or affairs of the church.

Speaker 1:          12:57          So Milton is essentially inheriting both of these traditions, both of these sets of associations with costs, with pastoral poetry, and, and we, when we consider the particular circumstances that occasioned the poem, listen it. So we can see why Milton I think chose this pastoral form. Edward King, the, uh, the, the young man, the [inaudible] deceased was a minor poet on his way to begin his career as a minister. And the, and the figure of the shepherd, the past store fuses into one person or into one w one figurative entity. Both of these callings, the vocation of the poet and the vocation of the minister. We've looked, we've looked before it, Milton's reason of church government. That's the political treatise written in 1642 and we've seen Milton's account thereof of how he had attempted to reconcile on the one hand, his obligation to become a minister and his desire on the other hand to become a poet.

Speaker 1:          14:00          Um, but I, I want to back up now because I think it's important, uh, to fill in a little bit of the historical context behind that long but important pros. Treatus it's not a, it's not irrelevant to our understanding of, of listeners. The subject of the reason of church government is the hierarchical Milton's feelings about the hierarchical structure of the Church of England in the early years of the English revolution, one of the hottest flashpoints of, of political contention was the, what's the degree of appropriate state involvement in the church? And as with almost all of the issues of contemporary and political struggle in the 17th century, Milton's own views really fall decidedly to the left, to the progressive end of the political spectrum. And so beginning in the late, late, late 1630s, when at the, at the moment in which listed us as being written, Milton is becoming increasingly radical and we can think of it, I mean this is an acronystic term, but increasingly leftist and he's becoming one of those figures that we can now identify with this label of Puritan.

Speaker 3:          15:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:10          Puritans at this moment in English history, replacing more and more emphasis when thinking about how things should, uh,

Speaker 3:          15:19          yeah,

Speaker 1:          15:19          work at church more and more emphasis on the sermon. The institution of the sermon, the act of preaching sermons for puritans was becoming more important actually than following the ceremonial rituals of the, uh, of the Church of England. So when the years just before 1637, the English court, uh, under James the first, and then later under Charles the first, uh, the, the, uh, the, the English crown had been cracking down on the delivery of puritan sermons in the church. It's 1633, um, William law had been appointed the, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and he had been granted an extraordinary set of arbitrary powers of suppression actually, uh, by the monarch. And his mission, Lord took his mission as the head of the Church of England to be

Speaker 1:          16:13          the squelching have this puritan opposition. And, and, and the most outrageous action in Lodz crackdown was his move to ban his attempt to ban preaching, uh, in, in, in churches. So under archbishop laud only the official liturgy, it could be recited in church. As you can imagine, there's, uh, there's, there's, this was controversial, uh, a struggle breaks out in the church. And Milton naturally takes the puritan position in favor of preaching. The church shouldn't be under the control of the bishops. This is Milton's argument or prelates a common 17th century word for admissions. But the church should be led by preachers, men who were chosen by their congregations to preach. And eventually this is where we get the notion of, of congregationalism. So given all of the controversies raging around the question of the proper government of the church, and Milton is deeply invested in these, in these matters, Milton Milton feels obliged to do something.

Speaker 1:          17:16          And, and, and this is the, this is one of the reasons that he writes the reason of church government, this intense sense of, of obligation that he feels he feels duty bound to participate materially rather than in this, in this, uh, political and the political controversy rather than merely remaining in his studious retirement, however pleasant that is at his father's house. And were Milton not to, to fight in some way to defend when he takes to be the, to church. He would simply not be investing those talents that God had given him. This is the, this is the miltonic logic that we're, that we're familiar with. So this is the situation that Milton finds himself in as he's riding. Listen us, he's under the greatest pressure of his life to do something with his talent. He wants, of course, at least we assume that he's still want that he wants to be a poet.

Speaker 1:          18:09          But at the same time, he fears that being a poet means, and this is a fear that literate young men and women have have to this very day to be a poet means in some way not to be acting responsibly or or politically soso. Milton explains in the reason of church government, he tries to, he tries to mend this breach and so we argues in the, in this treatise that po poetry has, and I'm quoting him here, poetry has a power beside the office of the pulpit. Milton even claims that poetry is equal to preaching and its ability to move people, to get them to do something, to make things happen in the world. Of course, this is a lot of pressure to put on poetry and it's especially in a lot of pressure to put on a pastoral log that's ostensibly about shepherds, [inaudible], shepherds and sheep, but it is the duty of this poem lists of this to show that poetry can exert a power beside the office of the pulpit, that it can do the same kind of work that a preacher is able to accomplish behind the behind the pulpit.

Speaker 1:          19:14          Milton has to develop a poetic voice that can actually combine those two vocations that the two offices, the though the office of poetry and the Office of Ministry. And if we want to think of it in, in the, in the more familiar domestic context, uh, Milton has to begin a career that can please both himself and his and his father. Now, last time when I, I mentioned the dramatic structure of this poem, you'll remember it features a succession of, of four mourners and each of these and mourners we could think of each of these mourners providing Milton with an opportunity to try out a different voice. But one of the voices utterly mops the floor with, with, with all of the others. Um, it stands far outside that certainly it stands outside the generally pastoral framework of, of the poem. Uh, the most striking, the most powerful of all of the morning morning voices here is that of Saint Peter.

Speaker 1:          20:12          This is the figure that Milton refers to in line 109 as the pilot of the Galilean Lake. Now what Saint Peter doing in this poem, the very mention of Saint Peter naturally violates the, the classical pastoral fiction of, of the poem. Up to this point, the Christian God has been referred to as Joe. That's how the poem works since it's within the pagan world, the pagan fictional world of the classical pastoral that this Christian poem is, is set, but to speak both of Jove and of Christ is obviously in some ways to mix your metaphors and, and, and, and the effect can only be disorienting that the character of Peter, uh, brought directly out of the New Testament. It's really slicing through the poems victim veneer and Peter Cutts a figure so daunting and so terrifying that were almost led to forget that the poem where reading is a pastoral LG at all. So unbelievable is Peter's discourse. Okay. Line 109.

Speaker 2:          21:19          Okay,

Speaker 1:          21:19          last came in. Last did go the pilot of the Galilean link to Massey keys. He bore of Metals Twain, the golden opes. The iron shuts the main, he shook his mitered blocks and stern bisque bake. Now this is important to Milton. This is decidedly the last of all the funeral mourners. And Peter Provides Milton's poem with an important element of, of finality of have closure. Peter wields the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and can open and shut the doors at personal salvation just as he can open and shut the doors of the church. But it's the, that's his function, but it's the sentiments that Peter Routers that I think most powerfully grab us and they grab us because they are so angry. They're so violent in their anger as the head of the true church. Peter's voicing here his disgust that the virtuous Edward King soon to become a minister had been lost at sea.

Speaker 2:          22:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:22          Think of the logic of what Peter is saying here. He would gladly have traded dozens. He would have traded dozens of corrupt Anglican ministers for the simple and honest king. Look at line one 13 this is where Peter is addressing Edward King himself. How well could I have spared for the young Swain enough of such as for their bellies sake, creep and intrude and climbing to the fold. Th the corrupt clergy up today, the under the Mullein influence of the horrible archbishop laud are interested only in satisfying their own grief. And, and in order to fill their own bellies. So greedy or they, they, they intruded into the churches, fold and devour for themselves. This is how the allegory works, devour for themselves the nourishment that of course they should be sharing with their flock,

Speaker 1:          23:14          but this wish that this wish that other shepherds had died and not Edward King is, is so strange. You can't deny it. And it's, there is something here of a kind of in decorous tone of, of malice that the priests and the prevalence of the church are so corrupt according to, uh, according to Saint Peter that we're led to assume almost not that this is the direct charge, but implicitly I think this is what Peter is conveying. It's almost as if they're responsible for Edward King's as if by creeping into the churches fold, somehow they've managed to push poor Edward King out of the fold. Uh, it's, it's, it's a hint at the malevolent agency of these priests, and it should point us to the, the true outrageousness of this, of this speech. Maybe it's irrationality. We, we already know that Edward King, of course, he wasn't killed by the presence of the Church of England.

Speaker 1:          24:09          He was drowned and the drowning was an accident. The palm never questions that. And it was ridiculous to lay his death at the churches at the churches door. But the poem nonetheless harbors this, this wonderfully primitive and irrational accusation. And, and, and there's a lapse in logic here. And this lab should focus our interest all the more on the urgency that we feel in Saint Peter's speech. This isn't just a speech, this is a vitriolic tirade. This and it gets ugly. Uh, Milton needs to get ugly here. He needs to voice this tirade, and he needs to write this politically motivated harangue. And as you, and as you'll see, it starts to pick up more and more enemies as it moves along. Look at line 119 blind mouths that's scarce themselves. Know how to hold a sheep hook or have learned ought else the least that to the faithful Herdman art belongs. The faithful Herdman art enlisted as is, uh, is a double one. It's the, it's the Christian art of ministering to a religious flock. It's that of the pastor and it's the more classical art of, of poetry. And the man against whom Saint Peter's is really spitting his venom are bad pass doors in every sense of the word. They're, they're, they're corrupt, not only as ministers, but they are also corrupt as poets. They're bad poets. Look at line 123.

Speaker 1:          25:38          These are such great and when they list,

Speaker 3:          25:44          okay,

Speaker 1:          25:44          and when they list their lien and flashy songs, great on their scrambled pipes of rich and straw, I have to read these lines again. And when they list their lien and flashy songs, great on their scrambled pipes of wretched straw, it seems to be the case that Milton's made this word up, this wonderful word scramble. The only, uh, and it seems to mean something like scrawny. At least that's what the OED tells us. And the only example that they can find if the word scramble is, is Milton's solicitous. Um, this last line that I've read seems itself to have been graded on a honest granel pipe. It's, it's such an unpleasant line and it's always worth asking yourself what a line of poetry that is as aggressive, aggressively unpleasant as this one is doing in a poem. But this year, cacophony of the clustered consonants in this line sets off or has the potential to set off a powerful, a powerful cluster of feelings.

Speaker 1:          26:47          The anger here is directed against the superficial, the flashy liturgies are read by the lobby and priests, but I think it's also being directed at the, at the lean and flashy songs that are being written by Milton's contemporary, Milton's poetic contemporaries, his rival poets, Saint Saint Peter has arrived from heaven into this poem to express perhaps for the first time that envy and the anger that Milton seems successfully to have suppressed up to this point. Um, envy and anger, not only at the state of the, of the Church of England in the late 1630s, but also the state of poetry. And uh, in England at this time. So Saint Peters, St Peter Concludes with a co it goes on and he concludes with a couple of that is as terrifying and it's threaded. Finality as it is for me, utterly baffling in its significance. Look at the last two lines, but that two handed engine at the doors stands ready to smile once and smite no more.

Speaker 1:          27:56          Now, we will never know and don't let anyone ever suggest to you that you will ever know what Milton could possibly mean by this deliberately perplexing image of the two handed engine at the door. If you ever want to take a look at the, and I urge you to the Vario RM commentary on the poems of John Milton in the CCO collection, you should peruse it. It's a massive, wonderful, uh, multivolume work that catalogs all of the critical commentary on Milton. Shorter poems, um, up until some point in the 70s and there are no less than 20 pages devoted to the critical debate on these two lines. What the Hell Saint Peter's two handed engine is what it looks like, what it tells us, everything about it. We have no idea what this menacing contraption actually is supposed to look like or what it's actually intended to signify.

Speaker 1:          28:53          But we can now, I think with some certainty that it's not scramble. It's size matters here and this, the two handed engine is big and it works and it's able to put an apocalyptic and to all to all corruption. And in fact, it's able to put something like an apocalyptic and to all life. It stands ready to smile once and smite no more. Now, we began this poem with a sense of the dreary repetitiveness and that opening phrase, yet once more, yet once more, but here very close to the poems. And we have a vision of an end to all those fruitless exercise is a repetition. Milton corrects. It's as if he's correcting the sense of monotony with which he had begun the poem and he corrects that. Uh, he corrects that sense of monotony by rewriting that initial phrase, whatever the two handed engine is, it will smite once and smite no more.

Speaker 1:          30:02          It's incapable of repeating itself. Now, I think there's a, there's a deliberate confusion here about these lines because they're precise. Historical significance is, isn't what's, isn't. What's most significant. What may be most important here is the, is the mere fact that Milton is expressing these political, these political convictions at all. The, the, the speech of the speech of Saint Peter Seems, I think in a lot of ways to be a lot more like a fire and brimstone sermon than it is a passage, a passage in a pastoral poem. And the strangely sermonising tone that this speech assumes is a, is I think exactly the point Milton is able in this speech to combine, I think, to combine for the first time the two associations borne by that Latin word Pastore. So in this guys with the mask of Saint Peter on his Milton's able to be both poet and minister, he's investing his rhetorical talent in an art that's actually doing something.

Speaker 1:          31:06          It's, it's capable of moving people to action. Or, so Milton, uh, may have believed, it says, if Milton is saying, look at me, I may be a poet. I May, uh, I may actually, uh, I, I'm, I'm simply writing a pastoral poem, but I'm actually doing something in the world. I'm minister into a flock. I'm preaching just as my father and just as all of my Cambridge classmates had advised me to do. This outburst allows Melton to solve what may have seen up to this point, an insoluble conflict, the insoluble conflict between the, the two meanings of the word vocation that we've been, that we've been exploring. So this passage is extreme and Milton's poem wonderfully is perfectly able to identify it as such. So look, look what happens next. After the passengers over, Milton addresses Alphaeus a river God, the God who was noted for plunging the course of his river underground in order to change chase, the new era who's, uh, who had been turned into a fountain, um, I'll face is also the god of erotic pastoral poetry.

Speaker 1:          32:16          It turns out, and this God has literally gone underground during the terrifying appearance of Saint Peter and it's here, although we didn't know that God was there. This is another familiar and strange feature of this problem. We didn't know the God was there and we didn't know he was underground until Milton tells us that he's coming up. Now it's here. Once that speech is over that Milton can bid Alphaeus return line 132 return, I'll Fayez the dread voice is past that shrunk by streams, the dread voice of the angry Surmont Milton, the ministerial Milton has passed. It has passed and it is past. It's part of the, it's part of the past. And it's at this point, and I think it's importantly not before this point, that Milton's able to throw himself fully into that eroticized conjecture, that catalog of all the flowers, that that was to be thrown onto the hearse bearing listed as his body that we looked at last time. I, I mentioned in the last lecture that the theme is flower passage here of course, is this is pure fantasy listed as his body is nowhere to be found. Uh, and there's, and there's nothing of course to throw the flowers on, but I think we can see now a way in which

Speaker 1:          33:37          Milton has permitted himself the fantasy, the fantasy of this, uh, of a recovered body. Or as he says, this is line 153, he is allowed it's frail thoughts to dally with false surmise. Milton can allow himself a literary indulgence in the rich sensuality of this passage because he has mastered the dread voice. He has mastered the fatherly sternness of, of Saint Peter. It's as if Milton, we can think of Milton is having paid his dues. He's accomplished as ministerial duty as a zealous and a politically oriented poet. And now he's earned the right. He's earned the right to dally with false surmise. He's earned the right to treat himself to this absolutely lovely. What must have been an extraordinary amount of fun to write the, the, the lovely catalog of flowers. It's almost as if the, the, the flower passages, Milton's reward for having written the Saint Peter Passage.

Speaker 1:          34:36          And I'm trying to suggest that Milton's composition of this poem is actually doing something for him. That it gets him somewhere, that it's functional in a, in a, in a genuine sense. And so, uh, it's our obligation now to look at the poems. Conclusion, where does listen to us leave Milton look at a lineup. One 83 Milton imagines listed us in heaven. Now it's a Christian poem and then it imagines, listen to this a little differently as the genius Loci the, this, the, the natural classical spirit of the place, the genius Loci of the Irish scene. This is line 183. Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore in dye large recompense and shalt be good to all that wander in that parallel is flood

Speaker 3:          35:31          period,

Speaker 1:          35:35          thus saying the uncouth Swain to the yolks and reels while the still mourn went out with sandals gray. He touched the tender stops, uh, various quills with eager thought warbling his doric lay and now the son had stretched out all the hills. And now was dropped into the western Bay at last tea rose and twitched his mantle blue tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new.

Speaker 3:          36:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:06          Um, I want to draw your attention to line 186 this is the line that begins the poems final verse paragraph, and it has to be one of the most amazing moments in all of English literature. Thus saying these five words, thus saying the uncouth Swain.

Speaker 3:          36:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:31          Okay. What are we being told here? This poem, this entire poem before this point hasn't been sung by John Milton at all. We naturally thought that it was the poet John Milton, who was speaking the first 185 lines of the poem. We naturally assume that it was Milton himself who was describing the his college friendship with listed as Edward Edward King. We naturally assume that the poet was speaking even with even behind the pastoral mask because we'd been given no idea whatsoever of any alternative to the poets responsibility for all of these words being uttered over the course of this admittedly very long poem,

Speaker 1:          37:15          but with little of do, this just happens. Milton suddenly and unexpectedly shatters all of our, all of our assumptions. He tells us that everything that we read up to this point that has been spoken by, uh, everything that we read up to this point has been spoken by a third person. Narrator. We didn't know this has been spoken by the uncouth Swain, a rustic shepherd. Everything that we had thought that Milton was telling us in the lyric present telling us directly now suddenly gets shoved back into the narrative past thus saying the uncouth Swain, the past tense is important there and that this is the first moment right now they'll sing the uncouth and this is the first moment that the poet John Melton is actually speaking in his own voice and he's speaking directly to us. We don't actually hear John Nelson until we hear this line, thus saying the uncooked Swain.

Speaker 3:          38:11          Well,

Speaker 1:          38:14          we should be shocked. And I think beyond that, we have every right to feel a little bit betrayed because Milton quite simply has, and he's doing this deliberately, he has just violated an important law concerning, uh, we could think of it as the contractual, the contractual relation that a writer with his, with his reader when there's a speaker of a poem who was not to be confused with the poet himself. There is typically a framing device and you can easily imagine Milton employing a framing device here. Um, he could have begun a listed this with this, with something like a description of the uncouth Swain, Oh, let me tell you about this uncouth Swain. And then he could tell us the mournful lay that the uncouth Swain sang. And then he could say, thus saying the uncouth Swain, uh, there would be, uh, an opening, a framing device, and then of course an end frame device.

Speaker 1:          39:10          But Milton's framing device in, listen, it's only frames the end of the phone. It's asymmetrical. And, and I think we're fully entitled to ask why, why Milton waits for the last eight lines of his poem to tell us that there's a difference. There's a difference between the poet and the speaker. Why hadn't Milton pressed on the this possible distinction earlier? And the answer to the question, I think gets at the very heart of the meaning of this, of this log. And I think the answer may involve the possibility that at the beginning of the poem, there simply wasn't a clear distinction between the poet and this being super speaker [inaudible]. It's as if the distinction between John Milton and the speaker of, of, of Lucentis wasn't really operative. There wasn't an uncouth Swain, uh, at the beginning. And you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll remember that I mentioned several minutes ago that Milton appears literary historians, I think I've rightly seen the Milton who had written listed us as a different figure than the one than the poet before having written lists of this.

Speaker 1:          40:26          Milton seems to have accomplished something in writing lists and us as if he almost as if, almost as if he accomplishes that over the course of this berry poem and one of the things that he's accomplished, his, his ability to see himself as someone who has accomplished something. He, he's just written this poem and instead of this continual amp aunt is a patient of writing something great. Uh, Milton is able to look back and find closure in something already written. And at the very end of the poem, the uncouth Swain rose and twitched his mantle blue tomorrow to fresh woods and passengers knew. And you get an image of Milton here. Uh, twitching is blue mantle his cape over his shoulder and dusting his hands and letting us know that that's over. He's finished. He's, he has completed this lyric poem. He's, he's finished with his pastoral, perhaps even he has completed the youthful phase of his literary career.

Speaker 1:          41:27          Now we began listen to us with an image of a poet who could only write this poem. This is what we were told with forced fingers. Rude. This was an act of composing. And the poet had to be forced to, to, to press this lyric out of himself. But by the end of the poem, um, we progressed from the image of forced fingers rude. This is an argument that's been made brilliantly by the, by the critic Peter Sacks, the author of a book called the English level LNG. We've PR progressed from the image of forced fingers, rude to an image of the poet who touched the tender stops of various quills. The poet's fingers by the end of listed as aren't, aren't forced or rude. They're capable of these extraordinarily delicate feats of dexterity. And that's because the poet has mastered his touch and this tactile mastery, a tests to something remarkable that's happened over the course of the poem somewhere below the surface of the poem, somewhere between the lines, Milton has mastered his poetic touch, perhaps because Milton himself has been touched.

Speaker 1:          42:38          Let me remind you of that other intrusive moment in the poem. The the moment when a figure whose presence we hadn't been aware of suddenly made a suddenly asserted himself. That was of course Vivas Apollo, the great god of the Sun. And the God of poetry who touched the trembling ears of the ambitious young Milton much as he had a century or so before, a couple of centuries before, uh, touched the ears of the ambitious young Virgil Apollo had touched Milton away in a way that I think we can actually measure. But by the end of this poem, because Milton at the conclusion of listen to us seems to have assumed the authority of, of, of Apollo. It's as if he's become a Paulo as he himself takes over the action of touching that the speaker has internalized the authority of the god of poetry. First he was touched and now he touches, he touches the, the stops a various quills.

Speaker 1:          43:42          Look at the final, look at the final lines and now the son had stretched out all the hills and now was dropped into the western Bay at last tea rose and touched no at last. T rose and twitched his mantle blue tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures. Now I, I'm, I'm interested in this temporal clause and now Nelson shows us he's fully escape from the repetitiveness of the yet once more beginning, this code is, suggests something like a victory over all of those worries of, of unpreparedness as the, as the worried rhetoric of not yet there. It gives way to a much more confident language of present completion than now and now the son had stretched out all hills and now was dropped into the western bay. Atlast he rose last, he rose. This is it's last d rose that last who rose who wrote the son, the son that was just dropped into the west or the uncouth Swain.

Speaker 1:          44:54          This is my question to you now. We, we learned of course in the, by the, by the second half of this line that it has to be the uncouth Swain who weren't rose and twitched, his mantle blue. But for a moment the he in line 192 seems to be able to refer to either the poet or the sun. Maybe it could refer to either the poet or the sun throughout the entire line. If you think of the mantle blue was being the actual sky that the son is able to twitch over his shoulder, I dunno. Um, it's at this point of a possible confusion, at least a momentary provisional confusion that we know that the poet has identified with the son. He's absorbed the touching authority of Phoebus Apollo, the god of the Sun. Milton. Why is that important? Milton can no longer be chided be criticized by Phoebus because he's become Phoebus this, this momentary switch off between the sun and the poet is just one of this poem's many, many substitutions you saw earlier.

Speaker 1:          45:55          See Peter Making a related set of substitutions and it was crazy. Peter was lamenting Edward King's death and he claimed that he would gladly have spared an entire slew of corrupt Anglican priests. He would gladly have sacrificed them in order to keep the much more virtuous and pure, listen us a gruesome proposal, but it's a group in proposal that suggests that a primitive desire for a quid pro quo, and it's this seem desire for some kind of sacrificial substitution that I think is fueling the poem's ending. That dynamic of the entire poem is one of sacrifice and recompense. Edward King gave his life and he's recompensed by his new status of the, as the genius of the shore. But John Milton is also recompensed, but and, and by the weird sacrificial logic that Saint Peter is already sketched out for us, you can see a really disturbing way in which Milton has benefited as well.

Speaker 1:          46:51          It's as if listened to this has died so that Milton could live to become a great poet listed as his untimely death seems to enable Milton to master. He's owned fears of untimeliness listed. This is death. This is, remember, this is the poem that Milton didn't want to ride. He was forced to write it a mill. Listen, this is death, allows the uncouth Swain to grow up to move on. And the last date lines announced the course of this new poet's life. Um, the announces the fact that this, this poets course in life is about to undergo a drastic change. And in fact, by a graphically, this is what happens to Milton. Finally, John Milton leaves his father's house. He moves out and he goes on. And of course he's still being supported, uh, quite generously by his father. Nonetheless, he goes on an extended tour, um, through France and Italy, but he manages to discard that youthful, that uncouth affection for chastity that had been such a part of his imagination.

Speaker 1:          47:57          And he marries, um, a young woman named Mary Powell. Now it's still going to be another 25 years before Milton writes the great epic. But Milton will no longer express the same degree of anxiety about under preparation to write the great epic. And in fact, uh, this is, this is an argument that's been made a number of times and I think there's a lot of sense to it. The last eight lines of listed us are written in a very specific rhyme form the, the Italian scheme of the Ottava rema and it's the Ottava Rima in which all of the great Italian romance epics by poets, uh, favorite poets of Milton's like Ariosto and Taso had been written. The appearance of this semi epic rhyme scheme here at the end of Milton Milton's poem suggests is readiness. And he's ready only here at the end of to us to embark on the epic project.

Speaker 1:          48:50          Okay. Quickly, I'm going to ask you to turn to the very beginning of Lucentis, page 120 in the Hughes, so listen, this was published along as you know with the along with the other poems about Edward King in 1637 but Milton himself publishes the poem a second time and his own volume of poems that he publishes in 1645 and it's for this second printing that Milton ads, the head note that you see here that now begins the poem in this Monety, the author be whales, a learned friend, unfortunately drowned in his passage from Chester on the Irish sees 1637 it's interesting that Milton certainly begins this headnote with suggesting directly to us that it's Milton speaking and not a fictional uncouth Swain, but that that aside, let me continue on the, I received 1637 and bio occasion for tells the ruin of our corrupted clergy. Then in their height, eight years after its initial composition, Milton looks back at this allergy, rereads it and picks out the Saint Peter Passage on the corrupted clergy.

Speaker 1:          50:03          Is that specific feature of the poem worth singling out and introducing. And of course in a lot of ways this is just good marketing. Since the poems, initial appearance, the institution of episcopacy or church hierarchy has been seriously eroded. The, the, the, the first English civil war has already broken out setting puritans like Milton against the royalists and the supporters of the state control of the church like the king and like the king's dread Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud. Um, when Milton writes this little head note in 1645, archbishop laud has been executed. Um, he's been sacrificed to the puritan cause and Milton reasonably alerts is reader to the timeliness of a lot of the material that would be covered in this poem. But this headnote goes a lot further simply than that. And Bio quetsion foretells the ruin of our corrupted clergy Milton was, is this is outrageous.

Speaker 1:          51:00          He's actually claiming that this poem had been prophetic [inaudible] listed as foretold the ruin of the clergy. And it's possible that Milton is actually suggesting, I think that this poem helped bring that ruin about, you know, that Milton had been entertaining this fantasy of becoming a great biblical prophet like Isaiah. As early as the naitivity out. He'd seen himself as a Jeremiah or as an Isiah. And there were all those early gestures of prophecy, but now he's able to tell us that he has already become prophetic. He throws his high per a prophetic talents into the construction of the Saint Peter Speech. And in 1645 historical circumstances being what they were, he was able to look back at this passage and actually claim that it had been a genuinely prophetic utterance. Um, he's made good on all of his promises. Of course, it's a sleazy move for Milton to have made to claim that he had actually prophesied, let's say, the execution of our archbishop laud. Um, but Milton will capitalize and exploit any evidence he can possibly find to assure himself that he is on the, the appropriate path to become the great prophetic poet, um, that he knows he is entitled to become and that he has been chosen to become. Finally, Milton has revised and undone the anticipatory logic of the great career narrative.
