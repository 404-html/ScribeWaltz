Speaker 1:          00:01          In book five of Paradise Lost Milton's theory of, of, of monism. That's the theory of the one first matter that we looked at last time. Uh, this, the theory of Mon ism or of vitalism or animus materialism. There are a number of, of terms for it. Um, it arises in the context. You'll remember, have a discussion about digestion and I'll, I'll just remind you, Adam's simply asked Raefiel how it was that human beings good eat how it was that angels could eat human food and Raefiel responded with his radical claim for the continuum of matter. Um, a continuum of matter and spirit in God's universe and the process of digestion was no more suggestive or suggestive or important to the Archangel Raefiel. Then of course, it was four for Milton himself. You'll remember that letter to the famous Dr. Leonard Dolores in which Milton and explained that it was his, it was his bad digestion that he believed was largely responsible for his, for his blindness.

Speaker 1:          01:06          And, and Milton's digestive theory of blindness was actually perfectly reasonable medical hypothesis in the, in the 17th century theorists of digestion. We're continually arguing that, that an escaped gasses could easily rise up in the body. Uh, but, but Milton's own adoption of this theory served a particular and, and I think an important purpose nearly every, and actually this is, um, this is a point that's made most brilliantly in a book that I think Matthew Valdiviez heads of it's by Michael Lee. Please hold up the book because it's a, it's a, it's a great book. It's called the dialectics of creation. And thank you for reminding me that I'm indebted to leave for this point. Um, nearly every important event and paradise lost is represented in some way or another as a process of digestion. Raefiel tells Adam that, uh, the Archangel says knowledge is as food and that Adam is therefore ingest knowledge temperately just to, as he must, it's his obligation to ingest food.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Temperately um, and of course in moderation, but it's not just, it's not just knowledge. Everything is digestive and paradise lost. The, the process, the process that we looked at last time, the transformation of Adam and eve into angels was going to be, as you remember, the, the product of a virtuous digestion. But so too will the will, the expulsion of the rebel angels be the, their expulsion from heaven. And when the son of God drives them out with his chariot of paternal deity, they are essentially eliminated his waste. They're purged from the space of Heaven. And Milton fills his account of that, uh, of that explosion with really all of the scatology that he can, that he can muster. And even the last judgment will be described in terms of a process of digestion. The saved will be assimilated into the body of God, into the body of the universe.

Speaker 1:          03:05          And the dammed at the end of time we'll be, we'll be excreted into hell. And Milton is transforming. I think Milton is transforming a lot of these absolutely central events in Christian history into something like scenes of digestion, uh, for a very good reason. By, by turning, by turning these moments into little or big digestive episodes. Milton's able on some level, although this might sound irrational, Milton's able to rationalize Christian history that the process of digestion, uh, was, uh, was, was an extraordinary interest in the 17th century. And, and, and scientists were fascinated in it because digestion seems like a lot of other processes in the human body seems to work without our own conscious knowledge and certainly without our own control. It's a digestion is a self enclosed system that seems to obey its own natural laws rather than responding to an exercise of our, of our will and Milton. Imagine.

Speaker 1:          04:07          So much of the of Christian history has at scenes of digestion in a way I think because he needs to imagine them as occurring without the deliberate manipulation of the heavenly father or without the, or in some way beyond the father's control. And, and I think Milton is continually fending off the, the Calvinist image of an arbitrary, uh, and punitive deity. So the fall of the rebel angels, uh, the fall of man, the last judgment, all of these events are perfectly reasonable, natural and at least from one, one important perspective in the poem, reasonable, natural. And also organic consequences of freely willed, self-determined human behavior or creaturely behavior. There they're not examples of God's skiddish. And this is important for Milton. They're not examples of God's skiddish and arbitrary punishment of his creatures. And uh, that, that, that distinction is a rising everywhere in paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Now, book seven is the book of creation. And, and here more than anywhere we would expect, I think a representation of the extraordinary degree of, of, of power and control that the heavenly father is able to exercise. What is the creation after all, if not an arbitrary display of the fathers, omnipotence. Uh, but Milton Milton knows that that's the case, but at the same time, at the same time that he celebrates that he's also struggling to represent it otherwise. And so we charge as even, uh, the creation itself with this same cluster of images involving digestion. Look, for example, this is the top of page three 52, a book seven, line two 34. And I think this is one of the most puzzling and for, for a lot of reserves its readers, it's one of the most physiologically suggestive of all the natural processes that seems to be described in Milton's poem.

Speaker 1:          06:12          The Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is an interesting entity for Milton. It seems to be something like Milton's name for the, uh, principal of energy behind a lot of natural processes, a divinely sanctioned principle of energy. The Holy Spirit inseminate it's chaos. So this is Milton on the water. Recall his brooding wings, the spirit of God outspread and vital virtue infused and vital warmth throughout the fluid mass. And Raefiel describes the Holy Spirit's stunningly and where we're getting used to this stunningly and sexual behavior in brooding over. And then of course, inseminating the fluid mass of the abyss. This is, uh, this is the process you'll remember that actually supplies chaos with that vital power of motion. Um, the vital power of warmth and, and virtue that, that so consequential for Milton's theory of modernism. And, and these are all ideas that Milton discusses in a theoretical frame in chapter seven of, of, of Christian doctrine.

Speaker 1:          07:21          Um, there's seven days in creation and Milton has a kind of numerological bent. And so it will be in book seven of Paradise Lost in which the creation has discussed chapter seven of Christian doctrine in which, uh, in which the creation has discussed. It's, it's this step, this inseminating step in which in which all of creation is filled with the goodness of God. Um, eh, that, that that's, that's really at the end that goes to the heart of Milton's theodicy because this infusion of divinity, because of it, everything that God creates, every natural thing hass must on some level be naturally good, necessarily a good, I think this much makes sense. But, uh, but Raefiel also describes a moment in the creation that's I think a little more difficult for us to reconcile with what we know or what we feel that we know of. Milton's momism look how this same passage continues.

Speaker 1:          08:22          This is line two 37, but downward. So this is the Holy Spirit is the subject of the verb. But downward purged. The black tartare is cold, infernal dregs adverse to life, then founded, then can globe like things to like the rest to several place discarded and between spun out the air, the Holy Spirit, downward purge, the black tartare us gold, cold infernal dregs adverse to life. The Holy Spirit doesn't merely infused chaos with vital virtue in vital warmth. It purges something from chaos to, and it's this, it's this strange digestive moment, um, in, in Milton's text that has left students in Milton's theology and students of the poem scratching their heads and bewilderment. And it's a and f. And for some reason Milton is usually so precise and really every word in every image can almost always be accounted for. But dregs were, this is the question. Where did these, where did these drugs come from? Why are there any drugs in the inseminated space of chaos, um, that actually need to be purged? God's infusion? Think of the logic of Milton's creation. God's infusion of vital virtue in vital warmth should have completely filled the matter of chaos with spirit and life all matter, at least theoretically. All matters should, uh, should be, uh, should be steeped with spirit and energy. And I, and according to all of Milton's theories of the this vitalist universe in the, in the Christian doctrine, there shouldn't be anything

Speaker 1:          10:04          in Milton's creation, technically that's adverse to life. Um, this really is crucial for Milton's understanding of how the universe is put together and it's crucial to for his theodicy. Um, but these drugs here are simply, this is, there was no other way to read them. They are dry, they are dead and they are in [inaudible] and, and I'm, I'm going to be applying some, some pressure to these lines because what we have here is a, is a moment of, of, of some metaphysical incoherence. And it's metaphysical incoherence at the very heart of Milton's account of the creation. And this, this incoherence is announced with that wonderful word, drags that Milton ways down. Um, so much he, he weighs it down with, well for four contiguous adjectives. Black Tartare is one, an awkward line. Black Tartare is cold. Infernal drags. I've spent a lot, I spent a lot of time thinking about these lines and I've, and I've also written about this problem and so I'm going to ask you that, ask you to permit me a little digression. Um,

Speaker 1:          11:13          not that you really have a choice, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just announcing to you this fact that I will be digressing now. And so what I'm going to do is give you my theory. My pet theory of Milton's tartare is dregs. Um, okay. I'm convinced here that Milton is participating, uh, in a contemporary conversation involving one of his pet subjects, one of his favorite subjects. It's just that of digestion. And this is a debate and it's certain, it's not Milton's debate. This is one that he inherits. It's a debate about those indigestible elements of food known as dregs in the 16th and 17th century, also known as Tartar. And I'm going to give you a bit of information about the renaissance philosophy of Tartar and if you can believe, believe that there is such a thing. Uh, because I think it provides a good example of just the kind of of seemingly cock Cockamamie, uh, contemporary philosophical world, um, that a lot of early modern intellectuals in habit, the key figure in the science of dregs and Tartar is the 16th century German philosopher, Paracelsus and literally tartare is dregs there.

Speaker 1:          12:26          There's simply the residue, the sediment produced by wine and, and, and vinegar. And we still have a substance and you're old if you cook, you're familiar with this. Um, it's a substance made a vinegar sediments and it's called cream of tartar. Well, Paris had, Paracelsus had actually developed an entire philosophy, uh, which had as its center, his understanding of these tartare is drags. So Tartar for, for Paracelsus was the stuff that hardened into stones within the gallbladder and within the kidney or the explanation for gallstones or kidney stones and tartar was also the same material that formed a hardened yellowish substance that we still call of course a tartar of the teeth. And Milton in the 17th century would have called it too at the Tartar. And more commonly it was known as tooth stone. And, and for per Paracelsus, if there's any natural substance on this planet that can be identified on equivocally with evil, it is tartar and I need metaphysical evil.

Speaker 1:          13:32          And so given the import of this matter, um, Paracelsus was prompted to ask the same question that we are all pumped to task when were squirming on the dentist's chair as we're having our teeth clean, where in the hell does this stuff come from? And, and, and Paracelsus is answer to this question was a theological one, which is why I think Milton was so interested in it, although Milton eventually had to reject it altogether. Now I'm of course, I'm not suggesting that the central context, intellectual context for understanding this part of paradise lost is the, is the history of, of dentistry or the history of oral hygiene. But it's, uh, it's, it's nonetheless, we have in a moment of Milton's engagement with a contemporary theory, however, seemingly off the wall, this is the theory of Tartar, um, which was easily as theological and philosophical in the 16th and 17th centuries as it was dental.

Speaker 1:          14:27          Okay. So for Paracelsus, tartar originates in the food we eat. And the Tartar that ends up on your teeth is simply the indigestible unassimilatable parts of that food. And, and, and for a lot of Paracelsus, his contemporaries, this was an incredibly troubling theory. Um, and a lot of Milton's contemporary said so and so they had to reject the parasail shun theory. Um, and you can, and perhaps you could guess why, because Paracelsus is theory implied of course, that Tartar, that tartar had been created by God. It's part of the natural world, and that God was somehow responsible for the origin of evil in his creation. And so you have philosophers and theologians in the 17th century weighing in on the, on the tartar question, on the origin of dregs. And of course they, there for the most part, they're, they're obliged to attack Paracelsus and the entire tartar controversy and all the things that this controversy suggests about the nature of divine justice.

Speaker 1:          15:31          All of this, I think gets compacted into this run. Truly extraordinary line. Um, black tartare is cold infernal dregs. And Milton is using this incredibly striking, strange and strange sequence of words at this point in his creation account because he wants to open up the question for his contemporary audience. Its core, of course lost on us, open up the question of the nature of divine justice and Milton I think in, in, in book seven is, is, is, is relatively torn about the kind of God that he wants so that he needs to represent in the poem is Milton's God, the punitive and, and, and arbitrary God something like an anthropomorphic deity or a god capable as Paracelsus had suggested capable of actually creating evil or is he a god that we can identify with them more from a, from a slightly later Deist deistic perspective, a God that we can identify with, the more rational or the more natural processes implied in the theory of monism in which everything in God's creation is just necessarily infused with divinity, divinity and therefore good and alive and for and in some way capable of virtue.

Speaker 1:          16:48          And this is a, this is a type of question that Milton is asking throughout throughout books heaven, a paradise lost. And one of the ways that Milton stages this problem is by turning for inspiration is by turning to competing sources of authoritative knowledge. So Milton has on the one hand the authority of scripture and you can see, although scripture tells us a lot of things, one of the things that it seems authoritatively to tell us is that it gives us a representation of the anthropomorphic punitive deity, at least in the, at least in the Hebrew Bible. Milton also has to support this view more or less the authority of a philosopher like Paracelsus, um, who had an image of a, uh, of a light, a similar, although differently configured image of a punitive deity capable of creating evil. But what kind of authority does Milton have for representing the other kind of deity, the force of life for the energy that might actually be much more rationally, uh, recognizable or accessible to a 17th century scientific contemporary of Milton's or we don't have a scientists in the 17th century.

Speaker 1:          18:00          Technically we have natural philosophers. Um, what is the form, the basis of authority for Contemporary Natural Philosophy? And the question of authority and authoritative knowledge is central to the middle books. Not just books haven't, but to all the central books of paradise lost. Raefiel is presenting Adam and eve with something like a quick, a quick education in universal knowledge. And the basis or the authority for this knowledge is, is constantly under question in these books. Because so much of rap yields discourse has, has no foundation. And this makes Milton nervous has no foundation in scripture whatsoever. The Bible simply can't be counted on as an exclusive source of universal knowledge. And so Milton has no choice but to turn to other forms of authority. And one of them will is science or natural philosophy. And so Milton at the beginning of book seven invokes the Muse of science, the muse of astronomy at the beginning.

Speaker 1:          18:59          So look, look at the end vocation. This is page three 45 of the Hughes. Um, the opening lines. It's here in book seven and only here that Milton names his muse and the muse turns out to be Urania. And she's without question. Of course. She's a, she's a feminine presence here. And in the muses earlier incarnations in books one and three, there was some uncertainty as to whether the heavenly spirit was a masculine figure capable of impregnating chaos and who will now impregnate Milton's mind or whether the heavenly spirit was a feminine spirit. Um, a feminine power that dove likes that brooding on the vast abyss or similarly sat brooding on the, the brooding mind of the poet. But books seven is all about birth. It's all about generation creation. And Milton requires for this book, I think an unequivocally feminine Muse, a maternal Muse who was there, who was there when the world was born and who will serve here now as the, as the nurturing mother of Milton zone poem.

Speaker 1:          20:09          Now Milton, who's, uh, who's committed of course to the truth of the Bible. And similarly, um, committed, at least in part to a lot of the truths coming out in the world of natural philosophy. Milton's on shaky ground as he describes the creation and is in vocation, is filled with something like that. And it just seems absolutely authentic. A fear of religious error. I'm look at line 19 Milton conjures the fear of falling off Pegasus, the, the Pegasus, the flying steed of poetry, um, erroneous there to wander. And for Lauren and, and, and book seven this especially this invocation is the focus for an enormous amount of Milton's poetic anxiety. And, and you can measure the degree of Milton's poetic anxiety here by the reappearance of that figure that Milton has called on throughout his career at moments of intense fear or intensivist isolation. Uh, and that's the figure of Orpheus. Orpheus. His mother was the Muse Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry. She had been incapable of saving her son when he was dismembered by the followers of Baucus, the Buckeye, Milton Implores Urania here at the beginning of book seven to Outdo Calliope, uh, to spare him the fate of Orpheus. So look at line 30

Speaker 1:          21:35          still governed now my song uranium and fit audience find though, phew, but drive far off the barbarous dissonance of Bacchus and his revelers, the race of that wild route that tore the Thrace. Ian Born the tour, the Thrace, he and Bard and wrote a PE where woods and rocks had ears to rapture till the savage clamor drowned both harp and voice.

Speaker 2:          22:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:05          Nor could the news defend her son.

Speaker 2:          22:08          Okay,

Speaker 1:          22:09          so fail not thou who the employers for Thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.

Speaker 1:          22:17          Now you're writing a is the traditional name for the patroness of astronomy. And if this music is astronomical, wisdom is not truly governing Milton Song. If she is nothing more than the projection of Milton's most outrageous poetic ambitions, then Milton will have no authority backing the poems. Extraordinary claims to knowledge. Milton Milton is, I think really going out on a limb [inaudible] paradise lost as he's claiming what is essentially the, the status of divine truth for thousands of lines in this poem that really have no foundation in holy scripture at all. Think of what we've just read that I have that I haven't spoken to at all. Book six. The story of the war in heaven is a story that doesn't in effect appear, um, in, in, in, in the Bible. And there's a sense in this illusion to Orpheus that this poetic endeavor of Milton's is attended by the, by really the profoundest risks, Milton implores, the muse. So fail not thou as calliope had failed, of course Orpheus. And, and behind this cry lurks lurks the fear that your rainy or to a kind of nagging fear that Urania too may turn out to be an empty dream. The fear that Urania just like calliope will turn out to be nothing more than a conviction then a convenient fiction dreamt up by, uh, by a desperately ambitious poet.

Speaker 2:          23:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:43          But there's another reason that Milton is a, a feminine Muse here. He wants in this next section of the poem to espouse as to establishing a new perspective for this book of Universal Knowledge. And he's relying on a new muse to liberate him in some way from the strictures of the Orthodox forms of knowledge that are sanctioned. So seeming so unequivocally, um, by the Bible and Milton struggling to balance the, the dominant theological discourse with this new discourse, this new language of science or natural philosophy. And so what you have in book seven is a, is a really startling opposition of, of essentially competing forms of knowledge and competing images of authority. And Milton will invariably, how can they not? And he does this authentically. He acknowledges the validity of a scriptural account of a natural phenomenon, but he will only do so, um, in order to set the scripture aside at some point and begin to explore an entirely different perspective, an entirely different account of the same phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          24:47          Let's, let's look at an example of, of, of this. Um, at the bottom of page three 55, this is book seven, line three 87. This is what look, look at what Milton does with the genesis account of creation. Here we have the, the fifth day of creation. This is when God, the god of genesis, creates fish and fowl and Milton Milton and begins the account here with a, with a dutiful and humble transcription of genesis. And in some cases the word diverse is actually a word for word transcription of the King James Translation. In some cases, the Geneva translation. Um, and you can see the King James Translation in the, in the footnotes and sometimes not. Milton will normally fiddle with just a couple of words to make the genesis text fit into the metrical scheme of, of his blank. First lie. Look at line three 87 and God said, and God said, let the waters generate reptile with spawn, abundant living soul and let foul fly above the earth with wings displayed on the open firmament of heaven.

Speaker 1:          25:55          And God created the great whales and so on and so forth up there all the way up to three 98 and let the foul be multiplied on the earth. And, and, and, and these lines half have to be, and they've certainly been cited as such. Um, they've been cited as such since the 18th century. They have to be the flattest the least interesting lines in the entire poem. Um, and one of Milton's first editors, this is on the handout. Um, Dr. Bentley had actually argued that these lines were so bad that they just needed to be deleted from the text altogether. And Bentley's Bentley's thesis wasn't a genius one that, uh, Milton actually isn't responsible for these lines at all. Um, according to Dr. Bentley, sometimes the Emmanuel Ncis, the young man who had act as secretary and take down the next installment of lines are 15 lines or whatever, um, would you would just start making things up or didn't hear Milton properly.

Speaker 1:          26:50          And so a lot of the lines that Bentley's, uh, most disliked, um, were to be dismissed for just this reason that they clearly weren't, had nothing to do with Milton's Milton's own composition. And so Bentley asks this question and it's a, it's a, it's a good question. Why should wrap the Elb so tied up to the letter in Genesis, Raphael, who makes this narrative thousands of years before genesis was writ not, uh, not, not a bad question. If Raefiel came before Moses long before Moses, why is he quoting Moses, Dr. Bentley reasonably asks, and why indeed, what might be the significance of Milton's being tied up to the letter in Genesis? Milton begins his account of the 50th creation by paying homage to the scriptural account of, of, to the scriptural source for his own creation account. But that's of course not where Milton ends APP. Look at line three 99 after builtin has exhausted.

Speaker 1:          27:52          Thank God he's exhausted. His Bald versification of the King James Bible. He lets loose with an entirely new representation of creation, listened to this forthwith the sounds and sees each creek and bay with fry in numerable swarm and shows a fish that with their fins and shining scales glide under the greenwave in schools that oft bank the mid. See Milton takes the, the austerity of genesis and amplifies it with some of the lushest most luxuriant verse in all of Paradise lost. And I urge you all to read these lines out loud in the, in the privacy of your home. So much of this poem has to be experienced in your mouth. I'm convinced before it can fully be appreciated. And this is in fact how Milton experienced it. Uh, he experienced it sonically because he was blind and wasn't able to read it on the page. And, and this and this particular description of the fish and fowl continues for another perfectly amazing 40 lines.

Speaker 1:          28:57          It's an extraordinary tour to force that the sounds of water, uh, of which Milton speaks at line 300 here are of course the bodies of water, uh, that, that are suddenly filled with an an enormous variety of aquatic life forms. But the sounds that emerged forthwith in this passage are also the sounds of, of this amazing burst of imaginative poetry. The verse here explodes with the kind of sonic energy that had been entirely repressed or suppressed during Milton's lifeless adherence to scripture and shows a fish that with their fins and shining scales, Milton's swimming here, and he's loving every moment of it. You know it in, in essential alliterative verse that almost completely drowns out our memory of the bland King James English of the previous lines. And this demonstration of poetic strength coincides with Milton's new sense of the strength or the a new sense of a force behind creation.

Speaker 1:          29:59          He takes the masculine image of God's verbal command from Genesis and God said, and he replaces it with an alternative feminine conception of creation that places the power of creation in nature herself. And in his description of his description of the first schools of fish, Milton I think is subscribing or can be seen to subscribe to a new and daring school of thought. So look at line. Look at the sixth day a line for 50 Milton begins, and we've seen him do this before. He scrupulously follows the genesis text and God, this is genesis. And God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind. And it was so, and Milton reproduces the scriptural description nearly verbatim, but he very scrupulously omits that final clause from genesis. And it was so because he wonders, well, how was it?

Speaker 1:          31:03          So the genesis account of creation is clearly inadequate here because it relies on some mystical or some magical fulfillment of the father's divine command. And it refuses. Genesis refuses to provide a rational or something like a natural explanation for how the creation of cattle and creeping thing came to be. So now in the years of the scientific revolution, the later years of the 17th century, the genesis account of creation was coming under a lot of scrutiny. Um, and the phrase and God said, was increasingly seen as this is an adequate, this is an insufficiently be a believable, a form of natural causation. And there was a pressure felt by a lot of intellectuals to imagine another form and a more naturalistic force or power of causation at work. And this is exactly what Milton himself does. He replaces the biblical phrase and it was so with, uh, with a spectacularly naturalistic drama of what we can think of as self creation.

Speaker 1:          32:08          Look, look, look what Milton does. The earth obeyed and straight opening her fertile womb team that a birth in numerous living creatures, perfect forms limbed and full grown and invoking a, a mother earth. Of course this mother earth obeys the heavenly father, but Milton by invoking her is performing an operation, uh, similar to the strategy that he had performed in a, in the vocation. He's countering the entirely masculine force behind the genesis creation with a new feminine presence that the female Earth May just demonstrate her initial obedience, uh, and subordination to the father. But after this, a humbling of herself, she's empowered to produce and she does this on her own, all of the numerous living creatures and in Milton's imagining here a female authority distinct from the authority of the father who's issuing these verbal commands at any depicts this new source of creative power by drawing on a literary authority, quite distinct from the book of Genesis and the, and the image of the earth opening up her fertile womb actually comes from odds.

Speaker 1:          33:20          Metamorphosis. Interestingly, this comes from the section of the metamorphosis that describes a life after the flood, the flood, Duke Aliens Flood, seen as by by Christian readers and Milton's day as a classical version of the, of Noah's flood. So it's a fallen phenomenon that Milton is placing well before the fall. But what Milton does after this point in this passage doesn't even have an authority in all of it. Look at light. Look at line four 63. Uh, Milton begins to represent what may have seemed to less courageous poets as they're utterly unrepresented. Representable this is the actual birthing of these living forms. There are Imr, the emergence of cattle and creeping things from the fertile room of the living earth. Line four 63.

Speaker 2:          34:13          Okay,

Speaker 1:          34:13          this, this gets me the grassy Claude's now calved

Speaker 1:          34:23          the grassy Claude's now cab, the grassy clods of earth are actually opening up and giving birth to calves. What, what is an amazingly daring sequence of five, five words. Um, it's a spectacular image of creation. The grassy Claude's now calved now half appeared the Tawney Lion Pine to get free his hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds and rampant shakes. His Brendan Main, you'll note at the bottom of the page that Merritt who was tells us, and I love this about you, is that he gives us this footnote that the romantic poets, Samuel Taylor Coleridge had singled out just this image, the image of the tawny lion as unworthy of Milton's gifts as a poet. And you can see what offended Coleridge and presumably also offends merit, Merit Hughes. Uh, there, there's, there, there is more than just a little breach of decorum in this image of a, of a lion wiggling his bottom in order to free his, his hinder parts.

Speaker 1:          35:24          Milton's not only portraying the lions attempt to give birth to itself, which is no small feat, um, as it pause it's way out of the earth swollen. He's also depicting something like a liberation of sexual energy and there's an emblem of the erotic charge that Milton is giving so much of this non scriptural material in, in, in, in book seven of of Paradise lost. And when the the lions springs as broke from bonds, there's a sense that Milton is representing his own springing from the, from the confining bonds of a scriptural tradition that is insufficiently literarily inspiring. And it's also a liberation, fully akin to his poetic escape, will remember from the tyranny, the bondage of rhyme.

Speaker 1:          36:09          Now throughout so much of paradise lost the lines of hierarchical authority seem to be an incredibly clearly drawn. But in book seven, Milton begins to experiment a little more freely with, with forms of authority and images of hierarchy that actually counter, uh, more of the, the Orthodox notions that he finds in the Bible or in fact that he finds in the culture at large. And, and, and, and, and the book itself is inspired by a, by a distinctly feminine Muse and, and its description of creation. There's a significant significant degree of autonomy granted to this, this feminine power, the Earth, this new phenomenon, the earth. Now book eight would see in the semen a lot of ways to put an end to this, what would seem to be a provisional or momentary celebration of Feminine Energy. And in fact, book eight seems to reassert the subordination of women to man that that had characterized our first glimpse of Adam and eve and book for, um, you know, it's, you'll remember that it's in book eight that, that Adam or counts for Raefiel the request that he had made to God for a, for a partner, some fellow human, and he specifically ask God for an equal.

Speaker 1:          37:18          This is a book eight line three 82 four among unequals. What society can sort, what harmony or true delight Adam asks. But God didn't seem all that interested in granting Adam's request for an equal partner. And refferals continually urging Adam to remember his superiority to eve. He mustn't mistake gives beauty for nobility or wisdom or, or equality. And of course that has been Adam's tendency and Rafio famously contracts his brow when, when, when Adam shows a tendency to, uh, to idolize his wife. And whenever the conversation turns to Adam's relation to eve, Raefiel expresses a fixed and inflexible opinion on the matter of sexual hierarchy. One sex clearly has a priority over the other,

Speaker 2:          38:09          but,

Speaker 1:          38:10          but [inaudible] is also concerned with another kind of hierarchy, the hierarchy of the heavens. Uh, th the, the relations of the heavenly bodies fuel and Adam also in book eight discuss it considerable length, the relative position in the space of the sun and the earth and the moon. Does the sun travel around the earth, uh, which remains fixed at the center of their universe as the, as the medieval Ptolemy had argued or does the earth revolve around the sun as the early modern Copernicus? And then later Galileo had theorized. Adam of course, isn't certain though it's certainly looks to him as if the, as it looks to us as if the sun moves around the earth. Now, Adam's uncertainty here is only reasonable, but the remarkable aspect of this dialogue is that the Archangel Raefiel isn't certain either. Redfield doesn't really know which way the planets revolve, even though he has spent much of this very morning, um, on his flight from heaven to Earth, where presumably he had some opportunity to observe the workings of the, of the, of the heavenly planets.

Speaker 1:          39:16          It appears that God has made it difficult even for the angels to discern the hierarchical structure of the cosmos. And there's an illegibility about hierarchy of built into the system. And of course by the mid 17th century, the jury was still out as to whether the universe, uh, w was heliocentric or geocentric and Milton wasn't alone in expressing some uncertainty. And you know, you could say, and it has been said that it was wise of him to hedge his bets. But there's, there's a lot more going on in the discussions of astronomy than, than just a serious desire to get to the bottom of a difficult contemporary scientific question there. There's way too much made of raffles confusion here and his uncertainty about cosmic hierarchy, that the sun and the earth or the sun and the moon are, are deliberately gendered. Here Milton uses the traditional gender assignments of these heavenly bodies that, that he inherits from the Latin language and he holds to them scrupulously throughout the poem.

Speaker 1:          40:22          This, so the sun is always masculine and the earth and the moon are always feminine. And, and the, and the controversy about the priority of the heavenly bodies is in some way Milton's reformulation of the controversy about the priority of the sexes. That the field of astronomy provides. Milton with a something like a scientific discourse about the sex is an alternative source of knowledge that permits him to counteract the more traditional, the more theological account of the sexes, uh, assimilable from his culture, but also from, from, from the Bible. Look at page three 66 in the Hughes. Raphael's a certainty about sexual hierarchy in the human sphere seems to give way to nothing but doubts and uncertainty. As soon as that hierarchy is extended to the cosmic sphere and science provides a different kind of space, this is a discursive space for a more liberated, a more open ended discussion of, of sexual politics.

Speaker 1:          41:23          And it provides Milton with an opposing source for the knowledge about the sexes, um, uh, knowledge that seemed so complete and so sewn up from the theological point of view. Implicit in the genesis account. So on page three 66, this is book eight, line one 48. Raefiel, uh, is beginning to grow exceedingly speculative here. And he dares to conjecture that there may exist out there in the cosmos, other sons and other moons, other sons, perhaps with their attendant moons, thou wilt describe communicating male and female light, which two great sexes animate the world stored in each or perhaps with some that live the two great sexist here, communicate that, communicate their light. Um, do so with an equal brilliance that the greatness of one isn't emphasized here, at least in these lines at the expense of the other. And you'll remember with Adam and eve and our first description of them in there, Naked Majesty, they were lords of all and presumably equally lords of all.

Speaker 1:          42:32          And when Raefiel conjectures that some creatures might actually live on these infinitely distant other sons and other moons, he's pointing to an alternative conceptual world in which the relation of the two great sexes might, might be configured, um, altogether differently. Um, Rafio concludes the discussion at, at line one 59 and he suggested essentially to Adam bet it's not Adam's place. Adam should just cool it. It's not his place to pursue these grand questions of heavenly organization. So this is Raefiel. But whether thus these things or whether or not, whether the sun predominant in heaven rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun, it's a IRAP fields just telling us that simply doesn't matter. And he suggests a decisive if such a thing makes sense. So the decisive uncertainty about whether the predominant sunrises on the earth or whether their predominant earth rises on the sun and, and one Milton critic John Guillory has, has been absolutely right.

Speaker 1:          43:32          I think he's the best reader of this. A whole problem in suggesting that we can hear behind these lines. The brooding question of sexual hierarchy, is the, is the man on top or is the woman on top? Is the, is the masculine sex predominant or, or could it be that the feminine predominates and when speaking about the sex is in the language of human relations, Rapheal is utterly definitive about who, uh, about who predominates over whom. But when he's speaking the language of science, he seems baffled and is, it's lovable. His confusion in the scientific realm can be seen to, to force us to reconsider his certainty about relations in the human realm and the ethical realm. Now, none of this is to say that the Milton is a, is a feminist or, or, or even that Milton is a protofeminist that the question of what, what Milton actually believes about the priority of the sexes is, is really I think too difficult to discover or extract simply from a reading of the text.

Speaker 1:          44:39          Um, this, this poem is far too filled with contradictions to give us anything like a clear roadmap, uh, to Milton's own beliefs. If it could even be said that he or any of us actually have firm and fixed beliefs about such huge and consequential matters as the relation between the sexes. But I, but it is, I think it is possible to see that Milton is struggling to hold in solution to keep in some way to keep in suspension the competing sources of knowledge that address this crucial question in paradise lost the question of the relation between the sexes and, and Milton's poem is, I mean we can't deny this. This is a far more theological poem then it is a scientific one, but Milton will nonetheless use the language of natural philosophy, the language of science, to open up some of the pressing questions that his theology seems to have closed down.

Speaker 1:          45:37          And you can see Milton Milton willingly placing himself in the role of Rafiel at just those moments when the archangel is discussing astronomy, it's as if Milton just like that affable angel. And don't you love it that Milton lets us know that without Raefiel is the affable angel quite quite unlike the Michael that we moment in the last two books. It's as if Milton just like Raefiel, we're throwing his hands affably up in the air. I'm in complete uncertainty and telling us the readers, I dunno, I don't know the answer to these big questions. You decide, okay.
