Speaker 1:          00:01          We ended the last lecture. Um, or actually I ended my last lecture, not, uh, the last lecture was, was was Matt. Um, I ended my last lecture on Paradise regained with a brief consideration of the riddle of the Sphinx. And Satan was compared to the Sphinx who had the sphinx, who had thrown herself off the as meany and steep when her riddle had been discovered. And, and the son of God you'll remember was implicitly compared to Oedipus, um, who had figured out the riddle of his own identity with, by means of his exchange with this sphinx. I think it can be sent to Samson agonists. Ds is more explicitly concerned with riddles and with riddling even then paradise regained was one of the key moments. Although this isn't anything that, that Milton does very much with one of the key moments of the story of Samson that we get from the book of judges in the, in the Bible involve Samson's posing of this big riddle, the riddle of the, of the, of the honey and the lion.

Speaker 1:          01:01          And it's Sampson, at least in the judges in the judge's version of the story, who can be seen as assuming the role of the Sphinx. He poses the riddles and it's really his duty throughout his life, uh, to know when it is. You should reveal the answer to the riddle to the secret and Samsung agonists ds as I think a profoundly interested in this, in this problem. And it's continually asking the question, how do you know when it's time? How do you know when it's time to, to reveal your secrets or to use the language that Milton uses in the seventh sonnet? Um, how soon? Half the time. How do you know when it is that you have ripened? That's a riddle. That is the, it's the, it's the job of Samson in Samsung agonists, gs to figure out the answer to now. It's one of the, it's one of the ironies of, of literary history that this poem, which is really all about riddles and secrets, this poem surely poses the biggest riddle for that scholarly, the academic study of, of Milton.

Speaker 1:          02:10          It has proven nearly impossible for scholars of Milton to determine when it was the Samsung agonists ds to determine or authoritatively are definitively when it was that this text was written. Um, and so in that respect, it's utterly different from the, the other works of Milton's that can be dated with much more authoritative flame. Samsung agonist is, we do know this, it first appears in 1671, it's published alongside paradise regained. So you have the title page of that 1671 volume paradise, regained a poem and for books. And then in a little little type phase two, which is added Samson agonist cheese and a, and actually the Hughes Edition [inaudible] produces for you just this title page. It's on page four 70. Um, but there's no hard evidence for the date of the composition of the poem. And there are conflicting accounts as of course you can imagine of the, of the date of composition.

Speaker 1:          03:07          So I want to spend a little bit of time here and I'll just do this briefly. Um, thinking about the various scholarly accounts of the, of, of when it was that Milton wrote Samsung agonists, ds. Because all of these theories I think concerning the placement of Samson agonists, ds in the miltonic Canon assume in one way or another that this poem is autobiographical or that there's some kind of intimate autobiographical component, uh, to, to, to this remarkable work as if the assumption is, is that on some level Sampson agonists, ds almost necessitates a type of biographical reading. So, uh, first and this is the most popular theory of the dating of the poem. Um, and it's the one I happened to, uh, and that most people subscribe to. Um, it's the theory that places Samson agonists ds as Milton's last poem, which means that this is a poem that's written well after, uh, we will, after the middle of the 1660s, Milton seems to have started writing paradise regained around 1665.

Speaker 1:          04:11          So it would have been after that at some point well into the Stewart restoration. And this reading really suggested Samson to the extent that this is a dramatic reading of the poem, suggest that Samson is like Milton, the great political hero or the erstwhile great political hero. Samson had almost led the Hebrews to freedom by destroying so many of the Philistines with his extraordinary divinely inspired violence. But the Hebrew leaders failed to join Samsung in this mission and they ruin their chance for freedom from the Felicity and yoke. And in the 60s, 50s and in the 1660s, Milton was always continually representing himself and just this same light with the help of Milton's own, uh, aggressively propagandistic efforts. The English had begun a tick to, to fulfill the promise of a, of something like a full fledged revolution. But the parlor, the weak minded parliamentary leaders had failed to carry it out and out of some sort of a moral, moral weakness, the English people began to yearn again for a subjection to, to, to the Stuart monarchy and its response.

Speaker 1:          05:24          It's in response to the tone of political disappointment that we can read in Samsung agonists, Ds, that scholars are led to date this work as the late one as a final poem, the final poem. Now the second theory of the date of the composition of Samsung agonists. These places it in the late 1640s in the period somewhere between 1647 and 1653 and this reading suggests that Samson agonists, ds constitutes Milton's first great response to the onset of his blindness by placing the poem in this period, you and you can tell what's gone well, what scholars are responding to in the poem with this theory, they're clearly trying to make some sense of the tremendous amount of pathos. And, and you could actually say the tremendous amount of self pity, uh, that charges a Milton's treatment of Samson's Samson's blindness. Now the third theory of the, of the poems composition places it even earlier in Milton's career during the, during the early 1640s, this is the period in which Milton was revived.

Speaker 1:          06:33          Ra was writing the divorce pamphlets. And in this account, the poem is, is the center of the poem becomes the, the betrayal that are become the center of the poem becomes a reflection or some sort of representation of the betrayal. Milton must've experienced himself when his wife, his wife of six weeks, Mary Powell left him, um, uh, just, just, just abandoned him. It seemed, uh, she, she went home to her parents. Now in the poem in Samson Agonists, [inaudible] Dolly law, you'll remember she was a Philistine. She was a member of a political tribe that had so oppressed. The Hebrews and Mary Pals family had, had all been royalist during the English civil wars and to so, so to some extent, Mary Powell, perhaps Mary Powell herself. Um, what, what was, it was a royalist. And so the, the leanings at least of the Powell family, um, it has been conjectured, um, contributed significantly to what turned out to be merely the temporary erosion of Milton's first marriage.

Speaker 1:          07:39          And according to this theory, then the main thrust of Sampson agonists, ds isn't exclusively political. Um, but it's domestic or domestic and political. And Milton uses a biblical story to reinvent. And in some way to, to work through, uh, you know, the private disaster that was, that was the early portion of his marriage to Mary Powell. Now I think the third theory is it, it has to be wrong, um, that, that Samsung agonists, Ds was written so early in Milton's career in the 1640s, but, uh, I'm personally much too invested in the notion that this is the last poem, um, to, to, to have its status be relinquished as a, as a post restoration work. But nonetheless, I want to think about that, that third option that I've, that I've just mentioned and to focus on the nature of the relation of the nature of Milton's representation of the relation of Samson to Dilla.

Speaker 1:          08:37          Two Dalai Lama in this poem, um, which is an undeniable and undeniably powerful aspect of this work. Let me, um, let me, uh, just digress here for a moment and explain to you why I pronounced her name Dolly Law and not Delilah. So when I'm, when I used the word Delilah, this lecture that will be referring to the character in the Old Testament from the book of judges, the name with an h on the end, a Milton doesn't have an h on the end. He uses the Latin spelling, um, from the Latin Bible of all the characters in Samson. Agonisti so the father is Manawa rather than Minoa. Um, he makes up the name [inaudible] but it's along the same sort of Latin Nate lines of DOL, Layla and Manoa. Um, who knows why Milton wants to class size these names rather than using, uh, the English transliteration of the, of the Hebrew.

Speaker 1:          09:31          Um, it's been conjectured that is just, it sounds prettier. Uh, you have a line like the sumptuous Dolly love floating this way, those extraordinary doctorals that seem incredibly central and seductive. You couldn't have that with Delilah. There's some shoe was Delilah floating this way? It just doesn't, it's not as, it's not a sexy. Okay. That was just a, a pronunciation. Degression. Now the evidence for Milton's, uh, for the scholars who, who date this poem as, as, as, as a really early one, is usually taken from the scene in Milton's life. Um, that actually was narrated for us by Milton's nephew, Edward Philips. So I'm going to ask you to turn to Milton's nephew Edward Phillips's biography of Milton at the end of the hues edition. So this is page 1032 in the Hughes. This is Phillips, his account of how Milton and Mary Powell reunited. And it's an a, it's a, it's a, it's an absolutely adorable narrative and involves an elaborate trick straight staged by friends of both Milton and of Powell.

Speaker 1:          10:44          So we learned here and we learn that it's a, it's a, it's an amazing little window into what the texture of this man's life was like. A Milton was evidently in the habit in the six weeks he lived alone as the abandoned husband. He was in the habit of visiting a friend. We don't know who this guy was, but a friend named Blackborow and according to Phillips, this is the top of the right hand column according to Phillips. It was at black Burrow's house that the scheme to reunite the couple to reunite them was pulled off. So I'm quoting here from Phillips one time above the rest, he, John Melton making his usual visit. The wife was ready in another room and on a sudden he was surprised to see one whom he thought to have never seen more making submission and begging pardon on her knees before him.

Speaker 1:          11:32          He might probably at first make some so show of aversion and rejection, but partly his own generous nature. And this is the loving Phillips who so admires the uncle, um, but partly his own generous nature. More inclined to reconciliation then to perseverance in anger and revenge and partly the strong intercession. Have friends on both sides. Soon brought him to an act of oblivion and affirm league of peace for the future. And Mary Powell and John Milton get back together again and they, they have a, they have a child, they have a few children. Um, this, this seen bears and obvious resemblance to the initial entrance of Dolly law into the poem. Samson agonists, ds. Um, now there's, there's no proof. Of course. Then Milton Samson is a, is a reworking of this biographical event in the stormy life. That was, that was Milton's domestic, the Stormy's career of Hilton's domestic, uh, domestic life.

Speaker 1:          12:40          Um, there's no proof that this event ever happened at all. And my guest actually is that Phillips who's writing this biographical narrative, well after the publication of Samsung agonists, Ds is actually staging his account of this moment in Milton's life in some ways, a reworking of the analogous moment from Samson agonist. These, um, I think he's giving us an, an imaginative engagement of Sampson agonists decent. He's probably because he's, he wants to stave off what he knows will be the easy, obvious auto biographical reading that we'll bring to Milton's poetic death, a representation of a perfectly disastrous marriage. So I don't, I don't actually trust Phillips's biography here, but I want to linger on this passage for just another moment because I think it starts to aluminate. Uh, one of the most puzzling aspects of Sampson agonists, ds. Um, look at that. Look at Phillips is metaphor in the last sentence that I just quoted.

Speaker 1:          13:39          Milton's own generous nature brought him to an act of oblivion and affirm league of peace for the future. Phillips is alluding here to actual political events, political events that took place not in the 1640s. When this reunion, we know this reunion occurred, but after the restoration that the act of oblivion and the League of peace are both actual political events that followed the restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660. So the royalists in 1660 passed the act of oblivion, the act of oblivion, that profit prohibited any further punishment of puritans who were seen to have behaved suspiciously, uh, during the revolution. So in a, in a gesture of magnanimity, the royalists were agreeing to be oblivious. They would forget, they would forget the crimes of the Puritan parliamentarians. And one of the most notable beneficiaries in fact of this act of oblivion was Milton himself, Milton, whose life was I think, really mercifully spared.

Speaker 1:          14:47          Um, uh, after the registration, he could easily have been prosecuted and executed for his composition of the regicide. Trina says, then once, I think it's fascinating what Phillips is, is doing here. He situation, he situates the relation of husband and wife in the context of a political accord, a political agreement between two warring parties. And, and, and in doing so, he's reproducing, I think, one of the strangest aspects. And it is a really strange aspect of this poem that's the, the remarkable conjunction of the representation of love and the representation of, of war, uh, the, the militaristic nature of sexual relations in Samsung agonists, Ds, and also the disturbingly sexual nature of political conflict as it's represented in Samson agonist ds and to, and we won't, we'll pursue that in a moment. So one of the curious elements of, of Phillips as account of Mary Powell, his return is the implicit reversal, I think, of, of political identities here.

Speaker 1:          15:50          Milton becomes the royalist passing the act of oblivion by way of forgiving Mary Powell and that, so the, these domestic enemies Powell and Milton have become, it says, if they become mirror images of one another, the, the, the moral alignment of their identities suddenly becomes in this, in this retelling of it. Um, vague and, and indistinct. And it'll, in a lot of ways, they're kind of pictured like Satan and the son of God and paradise regained. Satan's in so many ways, seems to be the son of God's evil twin. There are mirror, they're mirror images of one another, but obviously they represent, uh, utterly different things. The Sun you'll remember in paradise regained only discovers his identity in paradise in that poem in opposition to Satan. And the, this is something that the late poems of Milton are continually doing. They're exploring what we can think of as the dialectical nature of, of identification.

Speaker 1:          16:46          Um, virtue cannot exist in a vacuum. And in fact, I think for Milton, the, the knowledge of oneself can't, uh, come about in, in, in a vacuum. Um, any virtuous identity will inevitably be the process will be the product of some kind of antithetical process of some sort of agonistic encounter with ones with ones opposite. Now the antithetical construction of the heroes identity is really central to this poem, a Samsung agonists, ds. And, and I think keeping this in mind will help us try to make sense of, of some of its most troubling components. And I think the components of Sampson agonist, these are as troubling as anything you'll find anywhere in, uh, in the reading for this course. Um, and for me what's most troubling is this fat. And this is an undeniable unquestionable fact. Samson agonists, [inaudible] is the or gives us the intensivist expression of misogyny that you will find in the miltonic Canon.

Speaker 1:          17:55          And that's because this program goes further, I think, than any of Milton's other poems in narrowing the problem of identity. And this is a problem that Milton has been concerned with all along, but narrowing this larger problem of identity to the much more circumscribed, the much more focused question, a problem of sexual identity, the, the masculine heroes identity can only be established by contraries by an some sort of antithetical process. Samsung can only identify himself as a hero by rejecting, by actively excluding absolutely everything that's not masculine. Every rejecting everything that's not heroic, rejecting everything that's not Samson and it's a, and it becomes a kind of violent process of rejection. Um, the character Samson is continually impelled, it seems by a powerful need to expel all forms of, of sensual pleasure, the types of pleasure that we know to be prized and sanctioned by, by, by, by Milton, um, forms of sexual pleasure that Milton will identify and Samson agonists, ds as types of femininity.

Speaker 1:          19:15          And all of this has to be expelled by Samson from Samson. And as you reread the poem, I think you'll, you'll, you'll be shocked if you haven't been shocked already. You will be shocked by the violence of the really weirdly sexualized rhetoric that makes up so much of the, the metaphorical texture of this poem. I'll give you just one example. There are innumerable examples. You may have noticed how this poem refers routinely to the Philistine enemies as the, um, as the uncircumcised. And, and this is to be on some level, this is to be expected. The Bible refers to havens as the uncircumcised. And so this is conventional, we could say. But Milton, of course, it goes, goes needlessly, goes further than that. And he actually refers to the enemies of the Hebrews. As for skins, with his sort of bones, Samson slew a thousand for skins.

Speaker 1:          20:16          This is an unbelievable synecdoche [inaudible]. He being the rhetorical trope of using a part for a whole. And Milton as far as I can tell, had absolutely no precedent whatsoever for the use of this predict earlier particular synectics [inaudible] to refer to an entire people the enemies of the uncircumcised enemies of the Hebrews. There's a kind of sexual violence continually welling up in the, in the rhetoric used to describe political violence. Um, and think about what that, what that implies to slay a thousand for skins is in some way to imagine a military victory as something like a mass circumcision or symbolically some type of mass mass castration. And this is just one, one of many examples of, of, of a related kind of figurative pattern in Samsung agonists, ds, um, political violence seems so continually to be figured in the, in the literary rhetoric of this poem as a sexual cleansing, as a kind of purging the painful excision of something unclean, um, something presumably unnecessary and something excessively sensual.

Speaker 1:          21:33          Look, for example, at the way this, this text sexualizes the key event, um, in Samson's life, which is of course the loss of his hair. Uh, look at Samson's account of the moment of his, the, the moment at which he lost his strength. This is a page five 64 in the Hughes lies lines five 29 and following now when the book of judges, a Samson tells Delilah that the secret of his strength lies in his hair. Only after her continued verbal assaults, she pleads with him, she nags him, she pleads with him, unremittingly to tell her his, his secret. And finally he just freelance. That's the, that's the scriptural story. But in Sampson's accounting, in Melton story, Dalai Lama doesn't harass, harass Samson into telling the secret. She seduces him. Look at line five 29. This is Samsung talking and here he's the, he describes, he describes himself as the cock of the walk here.

Speaker 1:          22:37          Fearless of danger, like a petty God. I walked about admired of all and dreaded on hostile ground. None Daring Maya Front, then swollen with pride into the snare. I fell of bear, fallacious looks venereal. Trains softened with pleasure and voluptuous life. Now the voluptuous life that he's describing here in line five 30 forest. What is this? Uh, I think this is what we would have to name the life of marriage. Um, the, the, the woman he's to calling a deceitful concubine is actually in Milton's telling of this story. Samson's wife. And there's a, there's a profound confusion about the cause of his weakness here. Was it, was it the actual act of his head being shaved or, or simply the state, the condition of marriage, this condition of marriage itself. Um, listen to Milton's figuration of the event, of the cutting of his hair. And, and you tell me if this is an unusually charged even for Milton with I'm a pretty intense degree of sexual anxiety at length to lay my head and hallowed pledge of all my strength in the lascivious lap of a deceitful concubine who shore me like a tame weather.

Speaker 1:          24:01          All my precious fleece. Um, you, you haven't, you haven't, you have an image here of, of sexual intercourse. This is the, this has been suggested in a brilliant reading of this poem by John Gallery, um, embedded in the image of Samson's head in the doll and Dolly Liz lascivious lap. Um, her, her violation of Samson, her cutting of his hair seems almost extreme, inextricable here from a, from a perfectly simple seemingly, it's never simple of course, but an act of conjugal intercourse. Um, but the figurative chain doesn't end there. It gets better or worse depending on your, on your perspective. Um, because in this play, marital intercourse is equated, at least figuratively, is equated with castration, the cutting off of the hallowed pledge of Samson's strength. And Samson makes this explicit when he describes himself as a team, whether, but what is a, whether you ask a whether is a, is a castrated ram, the slot, the slayer of a thousand for skins is himself slain and, and part of the intensely violent figurative world of, of Samson agonist. These, this is a world that continually identifies Dolly Luz. Betrayal as a kind of castration and castration itself has nothing more than the male experience in marriage. Um, a darker or more anxious reading of the relation between the sexes. You will, you'll have a, you'll have a difficult time finding.

Speaker 1:          25:39          Uh, let's look now at Dolly Liz own language. Uh, turn to page 570 in the Hughes. Um, a round line hundred 803, eight [inaudible] three. Uh, and I think Darlene was languages and a lot of ways just as powerful though it's configured a little differently, much more than Samson. Dolly La contradicts herself throughout this poem. And, and the, and the contradictions have proven baffling, uh, to, to the poems critics. Now, one way of reading the character dollar law is to, is to insist that are contradictions a point point out, emphasize her mendacity. These are just simply lies that she's telling. And in a lot of ways Milton does seem to be setting her up as a type of, of, of Satan. Satan who own mount knife eighties at the beginning of book four of paradise lost was continually contradicting himself. Um, and, and, and critics have typically dismiss Dolly Liz explanations for justifications of her behavior, um, and with the assumption that Milton is simply trying to discredit her and it's not a, it's not an unjustifiable assumption.

Speaker 1:          26:49          And, and, and I think that's because the, the central contradiction of for discourse involves her use of two types of arguments. The first is an erotic or romantic argument. And the second argument she deploys is a political one. And once again, it's this conjunction, the conjunction of the sexual and the political that in this poem proves so, so unsettling and so, so puzzling. So let's, let's look at Dolly Luz reasons for betraying her husband. This is her first argument line eight oh three. She's essentially saying, I wanted you at home. You were always going out. You're working all the time. I knew that liberty would draw the fourth to perilous enterprises while I at home set full of cares and fears whaling thy absence in my widowed bed here. I should still enjoy the day and night here at home. I should still enjoy the day and night. Mine and loves prisoner.

Speaker 1:          27:48          I unmanned you. She's saying because I loved you so much. That's the gist of the argument. Um, Dalai Lama's second argument is entirely different. Um, and it's the, it's, it's, it's distinct from the complaint of the housewife that we just, that we just looked at. Look at the top. No, look at the very bottom of page five 71. This is line eight 57 and following here, Dali law tells us that she, she had to betray Samson for political reasons. She had to do it to liberate her people. The Philistines, the priest was not behind. Darla law says, but ever at my ear preaching how meritorious with the Gods it would be to ensnare an irreligious dishonor of day gone. What had I to oppose against such powerful arguments. Only my love of the how long debate and combated in silence. All these reasons with hard contest at length, that grounded maxim so rife and celebrated in the mouths of wisest men that to the public good private respects, must yield with grave authority, took full possession of me and prevailed.

Speaker 1:          29:02          Virtue as I thought, truth duty. So in joining and Delillo here gives us an extraordinary revelation. She turns out to be on some level. She turns out to be the mirror image of the great heroic Samson. She plays the same role as the deliverer of her people. She's the deliverer of the Philistines that Samson plays for the Hebrews. She defends the Gentile God day gone and, and Samson, her husband defends, uh, the Hebrew God, Yahweh or Jehovah. Um, they're, it's in direct competition here. They're, they're political opposites. And Milton is playing with the kind of something approaching a sort of cultural relativism by means of his representation of this competition. There is however, a difference between them and it's a difference. We have no choice but to, to, to deal with the, the difference between them is that Dolly law, the wife sacrifices private concerns for a public commitment to her people.

Speaker 1:          30:08          She yields in her word, she reels private respects to the public good. This is precisely what Samson was supposed to do. But of course this is exactly what Samson failed to do. So the a and a lot of ways the, these two explanations, these two arguments of dollar loans contradict one another. And on the literal level of the plot, the first motive, the motive appropriate for a wife is revealed as a lie. But the, but the presence of these two conflicting motives, um, bespeaks more, I think, than the mere fact that Dalai Lama is a liar or some way in some way the Dolly loves a satanic figure WHO's Justin? A very embodiment of evil. That these two conflicting arguments really speak to Samson's deepest anxieties. And perhaps the deepest anxieties of this poem, Sampson Agonists, these, the prospect of domestic pleasure is invariably a dangerous one for Samson.

Speaker 1:          31:06          And that's because domestic success, success at home for Samson is indistinguishable from, from political defeat. Um, Darlene lists two arguments are, are, are, are utterly. It's as if inside of Satan, Satan Samson's head, they're utterly intermingled with one another and inextricable in Samson psyche in the severely restricted, circumscribed world of this hero's consciousness. Um, domestic comfort and political failure. S turn out to be something like one in the same thing. I'm in both instances, the hero is seen to have relinquished his masculinity. He's undergone a humiliating defeat. And with this dual identification of Dhalla as wife and us and as fierce warrior, um, you have a sense of the fragility of a powerful sense of the fragility of masculine, heroic consciousness as it's represented in this, in this text. Okay, turn now to Dhalla's final offer to Samson. This is line nine 20 a the middle of the huge page five 73.

Speaker 1:          32:18          The most tempting and the most terrifying offer of Dolly laws is her offer to nurse Samsung. He's old. He's blind, um, to nurse him after his release from the prison. So Dolly tells Samson I to the Lord's will intercede not doubting their favorable ear, that I may fetch the from forth this load some prison house to abide with me where my redoubled love and care with nursing diligence to my glad, to me, glad office may ever tend about the two old age with her nursing diligence. Dolly luck can perform the work of, she can be Samson's nurse, uh, better yet she can function as Samson's mother. I think that's essentially the gist of her argument. Sampson has already claimed, we know this was at line six 33. He's claimed that he is a nurse Ling of God and he's been struggling throughout this text to establish himself as a child, not of human parents, um, certainly not of this perfectly sweet natured, but v uh, kind of adult dad of his [inaudible]. Um, but he's a child solely exclusively of God himself. And so it's, Dolly was offered to nurse Samson that elicits his most violent, the most powerful fit of rage. And it's, it's, it's horrible. Look at line nine 52, Darla says, let me approach at least, and touch by hand

Speaker 1:          34:00          in Samson's response. Shocking, not for thy life. Less fierce remembrance. Wake my sudden rage to tear the joint by joint. It's Dolly Liz. Simple offer to touch Samson's hand, uh, has received an extraordinarily extreme, uh, reaction. And it's usually thought this, this typically how we read this. I think that the fierce remembrance that will awaken Samson is his room, is his memory of his powerful desire for her. A memory that, that he has to forestall with this violent rejection. But, but I think the violence of this, of this reaction, uh, surely exceeds the violence. Myriad merely have a remembered sexual passion. This is, this is too intense even for that. And I think it's possible to see in this reaction to Dolly has offered to nurse Samson another memory that, that that has been suppressed. Um, and, and it's not just a memo, not just the remembrance of a sexual, bisexual love.

Speaker 1:          35:11          And our, our best clue to this suppressed memory might come from that aspect of this story of Samson from the book of judges that has been most notice simply have suppressed, perhaps it's been circumcised from Milton's, from Milton's own poem. Um, you'll remember from your reading of the poem that Milton is continually referring to the Heavenly Messenger who descended to prophesied Samson's Sampson's greatness. Uh, this was happening well before Samson was actually born, but to whom? To whom did this heavenly messenger speak, the angel spoke according to the judge's story, the angel spoke to Samson's mother or a character who figures prominently in the scriptural original of the story, but who was very carefully excluded from the text of Samson agonists. These, um, and I'm, I'm, I'm indebted for this point to, uh, to, uh, a wonderful reading of this poem by, uh, I think she's a great Milton Krennic.

Speaker 1:          36:11          Her name is Stevie Davies. Um, in, in this, in Samson's violent rejection of Dalai Lama and his rejection of her offer to nurse him in his old age, Samson is rejecting on some level the very existence of a, of his mother. He's denying the obvious fact that he had ever been mothered at all. Um, W which is another way of course of don denying his humanity of denying his status as a creature has creativeness. Now it has been years now Milton has four years, addressed himself to the attraction and also to the danger of the fantasy of heroic self sufficiency. Um, I'll, I'll just remind you of book five of Paradise Lost in which Milton explored the, the fantasy of self creation. Satan's remarkable. And of course, implausible claim that he was, that, that he was self be got. Satan needed to deny he wanted to deny God's agency in his creation.

Speaker 1:          37:16          Now Samson's case is related, but of course it's a little different. I'm Samson wants more than anything to be a nurse Ling of God. And it's as if he needs to deny that he had ever had any tie to the womb or to the breast of an earthly mother if he is to be the nursing exclusively of God. Of course, it's the fact the existence of the mother. That is the thing that guarantees the truth, which is that he is inescapably human. Um, but like us, Samson obviously owes a fundamental physical debt of fundamental physiological debt and obligation to a mother. And, and there's a sense in this poem that the very existence of the mother of any mother seems to doom all of our attempts to think of ourselves as independent, as, as autonomous in any way self sufficient beings, or to think of ourselves as beings whose primary debt can be exclusively to the heavenly father.

Speaker 1:          38:18          And Milton Milton had been so bold in, in, in paradise regained to emphasize the thorough going humanity of the, uh, of the son of God. He had, he had the, the, the son of God and paradise regained, had no more divine knowledge about his situation. It seemed then, then we could possibly have had, um, that it's in, that we're, we're, Milton should have been anxious about the humanity of the hero. Um, but all of that theological anxiety that should have existed in paradise regained seems to have been displaced onto, onto Sampson agonists, ds, um, turn to the very opening of Samson agonist. These, the, the, the exquisitely beautiful lines with which Milton begins this poem. A little onward. Len did thy guiding hand to these dark steps a little further on, a little onward lend by guiding hand to these dark steps a little further on Milton Milton's poem opens with, with these beautiful lines

Speaker 1:          39:27          addressed by Samson to someone presumably who's holding his hand, who is touching his hand. And he's an assisting his movements in his blindness, Samson's wandering steps and slow. And, and the sense of absolute dependence here is, is, is that with which we began, this palm is overwhelming and it's often argued that Milton is suggesting here something like Samson's complete dependence on God. This is the nurse Ling of God. After all, Samson's ultimate victory comes from his absolute submission to the will of God. This much we will learn at the end of the poem, but the character, it's a character. In fact, it's not. It's not, uh, the divinity. The character leading Sampson around at the opening of the play has never named this characters never identified. And this mysterious omission is, is certainly has to be purposeful. Um,

Speaker 1:          40:24          the, and the, and this is a, another clever argument forwarded by Stevie Davies that the unnamed character holding Samson's hand reminds us here of another unnamed character in the Samson Story. And that's of course Samson's mother Samson as the champion of the Hebrews is supposed to be able to submit himself utterly to the will of the father. Not Manoa but the heavenly father. But the play reminds us overwhelmingly and continually that even the greatest heroes are our subject. And this, you can tell that Milton was an enormous fan of Shakespeare stragedy Cory Elena's which to explore a lot of the same problems, um, that even the greatest heroes are subject to other far less dignified forms of, of submission. And that human figure most likely to lend a hand to one steady steps is obviously the mother that the, the, the, the person in the child's life who touches the child's hand and serves as his first guide, first teacher

Speaker 1:          41:29          in, in paradise, regained Milton was after all that we went through in paradise regained, Milton was able to allow the sun to return home to his mother's house. He unobserved home to his mother's house, private returned, the son of God had successfully proven his son ship to the heavenly father and he could thereby a Ford to return to the domestic space. Uh, of course it's a domestic space that had been utterly purged of any, any, any type of sensuality. But in Samson agonists does this, this space, the place of maternal affection and domestic piece of just happiness in one's domestic life is continually threatening to contaminate the hero. Um, and obviously this is a hero who has a lot less well adjusted. We could say, um, then the son of God, um, I that didn't make any sense, but on some level, at least to me it does.

Speaker 1:          42:31          Um, heroism in this poem depends on the heroes ability to exclude, uh, to expunge from his system any attachment to the home. Any dependency on an origin that could come, could compete with the ultimate origin, which is of course that if they haven't only father, and that's why this poem is continually voicing. It's terrible conviction in the necessary exclusion of all things, of all things feminine. And it's in respect, I think, to this exclusion that we can best understand the, the horrible violence and the terrible misogyny charging the language of, of, of Samson agonists, these, this, this poem, this play that's not really a play. Um, seems to be arguing for the necessary exclusion of the feminine from the Hero's life. And if that's true, if that is the old one of the ultimate arguments that Samson agonists, ds is actually making than where I think we also have in this poem, the pain and also the painful rhetoric. Um, we have the, the painful sense that Milton gives us of the cost of that exclusion here in, in, in Milton's final poem, we have an acknowledgement that the process whereby one becomes the miltonic hero is potentially ruinous.

Speaker 1:          44:01          Okay. That's a, that's it for today.
