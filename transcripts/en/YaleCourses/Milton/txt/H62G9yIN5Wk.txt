Speaker 1:          00:01          In the invocation to book nine of paradise lost. Milton describes, and it's a, it's, it's wonderful to see this representation of this process that I think we've been wondering about. He describes the process by which the heavenly muse inspires and he says inspires nightly the composition of his epic. And he explains that the subject for his heroic song and of course we'll be getting to book nine later. Uh, but it's, it's a, it's, it's relevant for our discussion today. Uh, Milton explains that the subject for his heroic song, the subject of the fall of man pleased me long choosing and to beginning late, pleased me long choosing and beginning late. And as we know very well, Milton decided to write an epic poem at a very early age, but his decision to write an epic poems, uh, some epic long predated his sense of what exactly that epic was going to be about.

Speaker 1:          00:54          He was long and choosing the subject of his heroic song. And as well as we know from all of, and we've encountered a number of them, all of those protestations of delay. Milton began his epic late. So we last left. We last left the poet in a 1640s. A area epigenic you'll remember was written in 1644. Uh, the, the, the story of Adam and eve and of the end of the fall of Satan may strike us having read or about to read paradise lost may strike us as a natural subject for Milton to have chosen for his, for his epic poem. After all, this is a, an extremely pious puritan, but as late as the 1640, this was not at all of the epics subject that Milton was intending to use Milton. And we know this. Milton was a political revolutionary, and when he anticipated writing the great poem, he consistently imagined that it would be a poem on a, on a nationalist theme.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Milton's would be an epic demonstrating the origins and the heroic achievement of his own, of his own nation, England. Or maybe he'd be thinking a little broadly of Britain, which is England, Scotland, and Wales. And in this respect, it would resemble a, it would resemble a Spencer's fairy queen or, or, or perhaps more importantly, Virgil's Aeneid other nationalist epic's now Milton at the same time we're talking about the 1640s had had been contemplating writing a play and that was, that was supposed to be a tragedy that in some manuscript drafts that we still have today. Um, he in some manuscript drafts, he titled This Prospective Prospective Tragedy, paradise lost and another drafts, uh, Adam on paradise on paradise. Um, and by, by the, by the time Milton and actually all these, uh, all of these early drafts, these notes, these outlines for this tragedy that actually never seemed to have gotten written, um, are, are included in the Tyco packet.

Speaker 1:          02:56          But by the time Milton begins writing his epic, he, his plan for a nationalistic poem, a nationalist poem, and decides instead to use the subject matter that he had been 10 intending for that perspective, tragedy, paradise lost. And so were the reasons for this really enormous shift in plans and the enormous shift in subject matter are worth exploring. Milton had devoted 19 years to the world of politics and, and a lot and a lot has happened since the exuberant optimism of police, of the political spirit that we see in attract like, like area politica. In, in, in 1649, the, this, the Great Puritan Revolution reached, uh, an unspeakable, a climax, a minority, a minority government of revolutionary puritans had effectively taken control of the state. And so the radical puritan parliament voted to execute the tyrant, what they consider to be the tyrant King Charles the first and to establish its own government.

Speaker 1:          03:58          And Milton participated with a extraordinary enthusiasm and considerable zeal in the establishment of England's new non monarchic government, initially a commonwealth. And then what we can think of as a republic. He had been the foremost propagandists for the, for the puritan side. And he had not only written really quite daringly on behalf of the execution of this particular king, but he wrote another pamphlet, iconic class DS, which is included in the Hughes edition, which is a shocking defensive, just regicide in general, uh, not just in England, but as a, as a kind of political principle. Milton probably around this time around the time that he was writing and finishing the regicide treatises began to lose his eyesight. Uh, this is the earliest years of the, of the Commonwealth government. Nonetheless, even blind Milton could serve the serve the new regime as both the state licenser. And I won't even get into the irony of the fact that Milton seems to actually become the license or the license or a printed texts that of course he had seven or eight years before, so utterly abhorred in the area. But Jenica he seems to have had some work as the state licenser, but also more importantly, and this is a much bigger commitment as the nation's Latin secretary, which means that he would compose and translate all of the, uh, England's correspondence with, uh, with the governments on the continent to and from Latin. So up until the, oh, up until this period, the early 1650s, Milton was a, a devoted contributor to the ideal puritan notion of this, of this government. And it was really the height of his political idealism.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Fast forward a few more years. By the end of this decade, by the end of the 1650s, Milton can see as good others, uh, fairly clearly that what we can think of is the eminent collapse of the Republican, of the Republican. Uh, the majority of Englishman we're calling for the return of their nations rightful monarch. And it wasn't, it wasn't long before the revolution failed. And, and, and the Stuart monarchy was restored. The son of the executed king who had been an exile and, and France was returned to the throne in England. And so at the restoration, as it's called the restoration, which took place in 1660, the puritan revolutionaries, the revolutionaries like Milton who had devoted their labors to the success of this Utopian ideal of the Puritan Commonwealth experienced a humiliating and, and bitter defeat. Um, a lot of Milton's friends, a lot of Milton's comrades were hanged and quartered and Milton himself was jailed and jailed for his, for having written.

Speaker 1:          06:48          The regicide treatise is we have to assume, and it seems to have been solely the influence of some important friends that kept Milton from being held in prison. And definitely, and it's entirely imaginable that Milton could have been executed for his writings on behalf of the killing of, of King Charles. So it's at this point, this is when, uh, this is when Milton begins. Finally, this is after the revolution has failed, that Milton begins to write as epic poem. And it's at this point that Milton to chooses, chooses to write an epic not on a nationalist theme as Virgil went on, or as Spencer had done there, there was simply no nation worth writing about. And, and all of Milton's labors in the cause of liberating England from the tyranny of monarchy had in some way could, could, could be construed as having having been useless and all of Milton's expectations that England might actually be transformed.

Speaker 1:          07:45          And they were glorious expectation. Did it transformed into something like a pure it and utopia or even a puritan paradise. All of that had been destroyed. And so it's at this point that Milton shows for the subject of his era, epic poem, the subject of the tragedy that he'd been contemplating for so many years. The epic was going to treat the fall, the fall of, uh, both of Adam and eve, Adam and eve from there, a blissful state. I'm in Eden, but also the fall of the rebel angels after their failed revolution. And there's a continual analogy running through paradise lost. And it's a very troubling one that associates the paradise that man lost with Utopian government that England lost. And of course, perhaps even more troubling is the satanic parallel as well. And you'll, you'll want to think about why Milton seems so aggressively to invite the, the association between the failure of the Association of the failure of the just revolution of the puritans.

Speaker 1:          08:48          Of course, that's how he would see it with the failure of the unjust revolution of the, of the rebel angels under the guidance of Satan. Milton began writing his epic poem too late to celebrate a virtuous political realm. It's, it's, it's too late for this to be a political poem. Um, but paradise lost is, is, is late for all sorts of reasons. It's a, it's, it's late for some personal reasons as well. Uh, Milton had been, as you know, anticipating writing this poem since he has, since he was at least 19 years old, but he didn't even begin to fulfill what we can think of as his epic promise until he was nearly 50 years old, until he had actually lost the use of his eyes and telling you could no longer read until he could no longer use a pen to write. And finally, Milton's poem is late by the, by virtue of the simple fact that it's, that it's written in the form of an epic.

Speaker 1:          09:46          An epic might seen like a great idea when Milton was 19, but by the time Nelson gets actually around the writing, it, um, it's an entirely superannuated, utterly outdated form. Uh, there's of course the, the, the undeniable fact that the greatest epics, the Iliad, the Odyssey, and then the Aeneid were all written in a, in a heroic literary past that would have struck anybody as is irrecoverable. But even the modern practice of epic riding or romance, epic writing had basically entirely fizzled out by the end of the 16th century. Um, then, uh, the, the Italians, I'm thinking of Tesco and, and Ariosto there, there, there had been a half century that had passed since any great modern epic or romance epic had even been produced and there would have been a prevailing sense and Milton has to have been sensitive to this, that it was simply to write too late to write an epic of any kind on any subject.

Speaker 1:          10:41          Milton began his epic poem late. So it's in, it's relate in relation to all of these forms of lateness that we can best understand the, the opening invocation of paradise lost. So look, look at the first, the first lines of the poem. This is page 211. And the hues, um, and Harold Bloom has, has, uh, has written, and I think he's absolutely right that Milton begins paradise lost with a powerful defense, a defense against lateness. And it's this, it's, you can think of it as this reaction to the problem of late and us that accounts for one of the invocations, most distinctive features. And that's the repetition of the word first. You actually have the word first appearing six times in the first 33 lines of paradise lost. Just, uh, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll do a little catalog of them of man's first disobedience and the fruit.

Speaker 1:          11:35          That was line one. Of course, line eight, that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed, lily 19. Now from the first west present, go down to line 27. Say First. First heaven hides nothing from my view a line 28 say first what cause and line 33 who first seduced them to that revolt. Milton is alerting us to the significance of the word first. Um, in the very first line in this wonderful act of violating the laws of I ambig pentameter. Then now the, the, the rhythm of a true line of I ambig pentameter. And there of course, hundreds, maybe thousands of such lines in this poem. Um, a true line of I amic pentameter would run like this, you know, this Duh, Duh Duh da Duh da Duh da Duh da UN unaccented syllable followed by an accented syllable and that little pattern repeated five times. And so with this, I am bic template in mind with this little paradigm in our head and we may feel, we may feel metrically constrained to read the first line of this poem like this of Man's first disobedience and the fruit, not an no hundred, hundred, hundred of man's first disobedience.

Speaker 1:          12:49          And the fruit, it, it sounds stupid. Uh, it, it shouldn't sound stupid. It's impossible to get away with such an awkward reading. But that's the reading that the metrical form is pushing us into producing that word first. And the problem is with the, the, my, my awkward metrically a proper reading of that first line is that the word first insists on being accented and it screws up, it screws up the template of man's first disobedience and the fruit. And so Milton is, is, is, is rebelling against an implicit law of poetic meter in the very first line of what? Of course we know we'll be this extraordinarily self conscious poem and you could think of this as the poems first by no means by no means, it's last. It's first act of poetic disobedience. Now the word first begins to take on a a much bigger range of significance is then we might at first think when Milton instructs his muse, say first for heaven hides nothing.

Speaker 1:          13:54          From my view, there's, there's something more here than the primary sense of the word, which is just first in sequence. And Milton of course is instructing the muse to explain first before she gets around to explaining anything else what caused Adam and eve to fall. That's just the simple sequential sense of first, the first that comes before second, third, and fourth. But there's something more radical here. Then the ordinal or sequential sense of first first can also mean earliest. And Milton's describing his muse, describing his muse now at the present moment of the, of the writing of the poem to be the first one. Perhaps ever to explain the cause of the fall, to be the first to tell the story of the loss of paradise, or I don't know, to be the first perhaps to be the first poet ever to write an epic poem.

Speaker 1:          14:46          Milton's Milton's constructing a, it's a remarkable and impossible strategy here. And it's when we can call a strategy of retrospective anticipation. And it's a type of, uh, of course, this retrospective anticipation can only be, can only be a fiction one can never come before something that of course has already happened. Uh, but this fiction of an impossible first, and this is something that Miss Milton is, is working very hard to accomplish here. Um, and, and we know this, Milton has already indulged this fantasy of coming before something that's already happened. Um, we recognize this desire to anticipate and already existing narrative from, from what? From Milton's first major poem, the, the, the naitivity own Milton directed the heavenly news. In that poem, you'll remember to prevent, to come before the three wise men who were, who were hasting to there, to the manger with their gold and their frankincense and myrrh.

Speaker 1:          15:42          Oh, run, prevent them with my humble load. Have Thou the honor first by Lord degree and I, and I suggest that we can, we can hear some of the echos. We can hear echoes of that same youthful competitiveness in Milton's first major poem in these opening lines in the, in the, in, in the beginning of the great epic of Milton's maturity. Milton wants to write an epic that in some way, in some ways comes before or prevents the great epics of homer and Virgil. This is it. Safe to say that this is no, no, no easy feat, no easy feat, but as presumptuous is that desire is to come before homer or to come before Virgil. It's by no means the final sense, I think of Milton's ambitious drive to be first. Milton invokes the seam. Heavenly news here. Who Inspired Moses? That shepherd? Look at line eight, Moses, that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed.

Speaker 1:          16:43          It's almost as if could this be. It's almost as if Milton wants to narrate the events of the creation and the fall with the same kind of firstness that Moses, Moses did. Milton would of course, steps have assumed that it was Moses who had written the first five books of the Bible, the Pentateuch, and to prevent or come before Moses is a, is an act of, of prevention or anticipation, far more dangerous. Uh, then mere literary competitiveness. Milton, what's Milton doing here? We could see him as actually vying with scripture and, and implicit in this invocation is a, is a truly remarkable claim that this poem is the same product, is the product of the same divine authority that had informed and inspired the writing of the Holy Bible, seeing heavenly muse, that on the secret top of Oribella or of Sinai did inspire that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed in the beginning, how the heavens and earth rose out of chaos or of Zion Hill delight.

Speaker 1:          17:52          The more in Siler was Brooke that flowed fast by the Oracle of God, I then invoke thy aid to my adventurous song. Now, Milton doesn't want, uh, Milton doesn't want simply to be an epic poet like homer and Virgil. Ah, that, that's that. No sweat with that one. But Milton wants to be a divine prophet like one of the great Hebrew poets of the Old Testament, and this is why he's continually placing the imaginative origin of the poem. Back back to the very dawn of time, perhaps even back before, if you can imagine such a time before the very dawn of time, Milton wants to create the illusion that he's predicting or that he's prophesied. The actions recounted in the poem is it Milton were prophesying what? Of course we know to be already passed. This is the strategy of retrospective anticipation. Now, Milton can make this implicit claim for a prophecy because he's being inspired by none other than the divine spirit that had inspired Moses to sing of of divine creation.

Speaker 1:          18:57          How the heavens and earth rose out of chaos. This is already an outrageous claim, but Milton dares to go even further. Now, not only is this the same muse who ended, had inspired Moses to write about creation. This heavenly spirit was actually present at the moment of creation. Look at line 17 and chiefly thou spirit that does prefer before old temples, the upright, heart and pure. Instruct me for Thou knowest thou from the first wants to present and with mighty wings. Outspread Doug like sets brooding on the vast abyss and made, stood pregnant of of all of the appearances of the word first in these opening lines, this is the first that has to bear the most weight. This spirit to whom Milton is praying was the actual vehicle through which God created the universe. This is the spirit through whom God fashioned the world out of chaos.

Speaker 1:          20:02          This is the spirit that Moses says in the first book of Genesis. This is the spirit that moved upon the face of the waters at the time of creation and Milton. Milton goes beyond the image of this creation, this creative power provided for us by the, by the King James Translation of the Bible or by any English translation of the Bible. In Milton's time, he looks back even further. Milton goes back to the Latin version of the Bible, which translates the Hebrew word for move moved as in Cuba Bot. That's Jerome's translation. Uh, incubate is the strange Latin word and it's a verb. Of course, as we know, it's a verb typically used with relation not to spirits, but to just dating birds. And it literally means to brood, to incubate means to brood or to sit on one's eggs until they hatch. And so Milton's Holy Spirit, the, the creative force behind the entire universe actually sat brooding on the vast abyss sitting on the wall there.

Speaker 1:          21:08          Waters of chaos, just as a mother dove might sit on her eggs and, and Milton, think of what Milton's asking us to here. It's a, he's asking a lot. He's asking us to imagine God or perhaps this is God's creative spirit as some sort of feminine being laying the universal egg and brooding over it until it bursts forth with, with new life. I remember Milton is, is this is a risk. Milton's treading an extraordinarily fine line between the, the tremendous beauty of this image on the one hand and what it's, it's potential impiety or just grotesquery on, on the other. And no sooner is Milton conjured this already unbelievable image of a kind of maternal creation than he reverses all of the gender categories that he's just established. And he adds to this image that is perfectly sufficiently filled with grotesquery as it is. He adds this next phrase and mates to pregnant. I ran, how do we even begin? How do we even begin to appreciate the, the, this, this amazing imagery here in portraying the deity?

Speaker 2:          22:24          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:24          I would think if I were to write an epic poem, I would, I would feel that I would be expected to stay within the fairly narrow parameters of religious, of religious decorum. There's, there's no, Milton had no precedent for this. Um, there's no precedent for this depiction of a god or a Holy Spirit as a kind of hermaphroditic being. Um, and I think it's safe to say that were intended to be, to be shocked. Maybe even we're POLST bye bye. This remarkable description of the deity. And so I'm hoping you'll feel something of the shock of, of, of these lines and mates. Pregnant Milton and his is taking a huge aesthetic risk here. And it's always when w whatever you're reading, it's always worth thinking about and considering what the motives might be first. The first such extraordinary literary risk taking that they made this image of the curious process by which the heavenly spirit creates the universe is, is absolutely central.

Speaker 1:          23:24          It's central to this poem. Um, and it's central to the poem for two reasons. It's central to Milton's theological debate, a theological vision that will soon establish itself throughout the poem. And it's also, I think, central to his poetic vision, his vision of what a poem is or should, should be. And so shocking image, this impossible to imagine image of a brooding impregnation establishes the foundation for, for two of the two of this poem's most, most daring elements. The first is the radical theology and, uh, and, and the second is this poem's equally radical and equally daring original verse form. Let's let, let's take the first thing first radical, the radical theology. It's, it's with, and I'll just look at a all, I'm only able to talk about a small component of Milton's theological daring here. Um, it's with this image of a brooding impregnation that Milton announces the presence in his poem of his most potent when I think is the most interesting theological, um, innovations, the innovation that he comes up with here.

Speaker 1:          24:32          This is, it seems to be the case that Milton rather late in his life has become a modernist. He embraces the Hetero docs idea of Mon ism or sometime sometimes called animus materialism or vitalism, which is essentially a denial and denial of any distinction between the body and the soul. And so the principle of Moana Ism had, had just introduced itself in England around those, around the mid 1640s, around. It's been argued around the time that Milton's writing area political and, uh, and it met with all sorts of opposition, Orthodox scientists, Orthodox Christians, everyone agreed in the 17th century that matter or substance a body was, it was entirely separate from and distinct from the immaterial, the Incor pauriol stuff, uh, called spirit or soul and, and so orthodoxy is definitively dualist. There are two, there are two types of stuff in material stuff and matter or body, but Milton insisted that there's no such thing as an immaterial spirit, that that was a contradiction in terms.

Speaker 1:          25:42          And so everything that we call soul or spirit, even God himself for John Milton is bodily. Um, spirit, spirit is mirror merely a kind of bodily form of energy and, and, and, and God at the beginning of time and fuse this energy into the entirety of the, into the entirety of the material world at the creation. So physical life, physical matter for Milton, for the mature Milton has never lifeless or dead. Uh, it's uh, all matter contains within it something like a potency of life. That's Milton's phrase. It's, and it has a capacity for action. I actually a capacity for motion and just as, as books can take on a life of their own and [inaudible] so all matter for the, for, for later Milton, um, even what we think in our vulgar ways to be inanimate objects, even they even, they seem to have within them something like a potency of a potency of life or an infusion of divine spirit.

Speaker 1:          26:43          And of course the human body is the perfect is the, is the supreme example of the spiritually infused corporeal substance. Um, it's, it's infused with divine spirit. Um, and, and, and this was, this is a huge problem in the 17th century, Milton's contemporaries were endlessly conjecturing where it is exactly in the body that the soul resides. And some of you may, may know that Descartes, the great French philosopher, Milton's slightly older contemporary, had decided that the soul, the soul resided in the pineal gland of the, of the body. The soul infused, the sole managed to cover in the body from this tiny little tiny little place in the rears, the pineal gland. I think it's in your brain, the back of your head. Thank you. Um, keep that and keep that in mind. The, the soul for Milton though isn't distinct from body. It is the body, the soul infused.

Speaker 1:          27:43          It's power throughout the entirety of the bodily frame. And so bottle it, body and soul in Milton's incredibly moving and I think really beautiful vision almost becomes indistinguishable. And so all of this Mona's stick philosophy, I think is implicit in the image of, of divinities impregnation of, of the vast abyss. Milton's God doesn't, as we learned from genesis, doesn't fashion the matter of chaos with his hands. He impregnates it with spirit and he gives it a potency of life as, as you'll see in book seven, the book of creation. He gives it a liberty to organize itself into the order of the created world, a freedom to create itself. And now that's, that's one, that's one consequence of, of Milton's Milton's image of a brooding impregnation. There's a second type of potency that's also established in with this image. And that's the potency of the kind of verse that Milton is writing and paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          28:43          And, and, and, and, and it's been argued, and I think, I think there's something to this that Milton's Moen ism is closely connected to his implicit theory of poetry. There's there, there's no question that, that the shock experienced by the first readers of paradise lost had next to nothing to do with the content of this poem, which might strike us as, as, as shocking in itself. We would think that Milton's contemporaries might be, um, might be aghast that such a, such as sympathetic portrait of Satan could be used at the beginning of the poem. No, it, the most immediately shocking aspect of the poem was it style. And, and, and we have to look at the actual poetic form by which, uh, this poem is constructed because it's, the poetic form is absolutely integral to, it's to, it's to its meaning. So if you, if you don't, right? Uh, and if you're not taking notes in this lecture, um, you have to write down at least one sentence. You must write this down because this will be the most important thing I say all morning. Milton's paradise lost is the first narrative poem in English that didn't rhyme.

Speaker 1:          29:58          Milton Milton road is epic and lines of unrivaled, I am big pentameter or what we call and what Milton would have called blank verse. And up to this point, up to this point and literary history, only verse written for the theater had had been written in this unrivaled unrivaled lines of I ambig pentameter in blank verse. This is the verse form you'll read, you'll recognize it in so many of the long speeches of, of characters and the plays of Marlo and Shakespeare. But all those are plays though in all English narrative poems, including all of Shakespeare's narrative poems. Um, they had all been written in rhyme, either a long verse, paragraphs of rhymed, heroic couplets or in intricately rhymed stances. And so for most readers in Milton's Milton's time, Ryan was actually constituent IV of poetry and Milton's lines of unripe verse here may well have not seen poetry at all.

Speaker 1:          30:58          It was shocking. And so there seems to have been something of a kind of outcry about the style of paradise lost and it look at page 210 in the Hughes. It's in response to what seems to have been an aesthetic reaction to the poem that the printer of Paradise lost ask Milton went back to Milton and said and asked him to append a note, two et seq the book, second printing, append to note that explains why the poem rhymes, not, you know, there's people can't deal with this problem until they get that they can get a handle on why the fact it doesn't rhyme. So that, so Milton Milton writes this and adds it, appends it to all subsequent additions of the poem. This is, this is what Milton tells us. The measure is English or work verse without rhyme as that of homer in Greek and a Virgil in Latin Ryan being known, necessary adjunct or true ornament of poem or good verse in longer works especially, but the invention, and this has this so familiarly miltonic, it's the invention of a barbarous age to set off wretched matter and lane meter Greyston Dean since by the use of some famous modern poets.

Speaker 1:          32:10          Okay. Spencer might've done it kind of well, the whole rhyme thing, but nonetheless, the modern poets are carried away by custom much to their own vexation hindrance and constraint to express many things otherwise and for the most part worse than they would have expressed them. Milton brings to his critique of rhyme that same and this is familiar, the same political rhetoric that he had brought to his critique of monarchy in the, in the regicide treatises and can also hear Satan's Satan's critique of the tyranny of heaven in, in, in, in these, uh, in this account of the rhyme as well. Like kingship. Rhyme is a custom, it's an invention of a barbarous age, which a blind and ignorant population will exempt only to its own vexation hindrance and constraint. And it's always Milton's duty. This is John Milton's. The reason that he was put on this earth is to liberate a people from any such constraining customs.

Speaker 1:          33:07          It's the rhetoric of liberation, that this is the rhetoric that permeates all of Milton's political pros. And so while Milton decided against writing an explicitly political nationalists poem, he didn't see himself as writing a poem that performs some kind of political function and it performed it's revolutionary function in a much more subtle, though I'm much more insinuating kind of way. And so at the end of this note on the verse, Milton claims the Paradise lost is to be esteemed and example, set the first in English. Another important first of ancient liberty recovered to heroic poem from the troublesome and modern bondage of rhyming. It's a, this is a, is is a wonderful metaphor. Milton's thinking. It's as if Milton is thinking of of the poem as if it were a human body and the, and the rhyme words at the end of the typical heroic couplet.

Speaker 1:          34:00          Two lines that w that rhyme at the end and then another two lines with a different rhyme at the end of those two lines. Um, he's, he's describing the, these lined rhymes of the poems by his contemporaries, his competitors as the couplets, the rhyme, the rhyme words function as shackles. I think that's the image here, there manacles that confined the otherwise vulnerable and tender flesh of the, of the body of the poem. Rhymes are barbarous forms of constraint that impinge upon the true freedom of the body of the poem. And so that's why Milton explains here in the middle of the note, that's why other cultures have rejected rhyme as a thing of itself to all judicious ears, trivial and have no true musical delight, which consists only true musical delight consists only an app number fit quantity of syllables and the sense variously drawn out from one person to another, not in the jingling sound of like endings.

Speaker 1:          35:00          So Milton refuses to force to force his poem to make sense through the barbarous mechanics of rhyme, which, which for Milton reduces all of the spirit, all of the life of a poem or of a line simply to that jingling sound at the end of the line. And so when Milton's verse here, sense or meaning is variously drawn out from one verse into another, since the very spirit of meaning is infused throughout an entire line, rather than being singled out and separated or segregated, uh, to the end of the line in the form of the rhyme word. So since in Milton's poetry functions a lot like sole does or spirit does in Milton's theology. And, and Milton's note on the verse clues us into this intimate connection between his radical poetics of blank verse on the one hand and his radical theology of Mona's among the other.

Speaker 1:          35:55          Um, you'll, you'll, you can, uh, you can see from the handout that I've, I've, I've given you, I hope you can see from the handout that I've given you a quotation here from Milton's Christian doctrine. Yes. Um, in which built and describes the process whereby a God actually impregnates the human body with soul. Nor did God merely breathed that spirit into, into man, but molded it in each individual and infused it throughout. The divine soul is everywhere in the miltonic body, the human body. And of course, that means that all human acts are sanctioned by God, including the, maybe most importantly, the sexual act. Um, it, it has given the highest form of divine approval imaginable. And Milton wants to, Milton wants us to think of the sense of his verse as being similarly unfused. The poem is similarly infused throughout the entire, with with some kind of soul or spirit or divine energy throughout the entirety of a verse.

Speaker 1:          36:54          Paragraph. Milton refuses in paradise lost to constrain a thought or to confine it to a grammatical, to a grammatical unit of sense. He reframes a grammatical unit of sense is never identical to align in Milton's poem. Um, since doesn't simply end at the end of a 10 syllable lines. Now, now most most rhymed poets in poems in Milton's Day. Uh, we're in stopped lines of verse and an end stop line is one in which the grammatical unit of sense stops precisely at the end of the line. So, and the, and the next line of verse picks up a different thought and the next one after that and, and, and so on. And you can actually see the mechanics of this of end stop verse quite clearly in the Ryan version of paradise lost that the great, admittedly the great poet John Dryden wrote, this was supposed to be the Libretto for an opera.

Speaker 1:          37:53          And Brighton seems to have gotten permission from the old blind poet Milton himself because Dryden felt that the, the public had an interest in reading paradise lost, but they couldn't deal with the fact that it didn't rhyme. And, um, it's a mill. And so Dryden's set out on this remarkable project of making the whole thing where I'm, and I invite you to, I invite you to read. Dryden's efforts are really quite remarkable. It's not unlike with the Turner Broadcasting that work does with, uh, with old movies colorizing them in order to make them more palatable to a modern audience. And you'll notice that every line of this, of the passage from Dryden here concludes with a, with a comma or a period because every line constitutes own syntactical unit of meaning. But Milton Milton's poem, this is a statistical fact that that's a, I don't know who came up with it.

Speaker 1:          38:45          Milton's poem has far fewer end to stopped lines. Then the verse of any other poet, Milton's lines we say are in jammed, they, they, they run into one another and it's in tactical unit for Milton is continually spilling, spilling out. It's bursting, bursting out of the line and infusing itself into the next line and then into the next and into the next. And I don't know who came up with this statistic, but I love it. Nearly three out of every five lines and paradise lost are in jammed. The embrace, the practice of in Jama, the meaning or the, or the sense of inverse paragraph is, is diffused throughout a series of lines. And, and I think that Milton intends for us to think of, of of the verse and Paradise Lost as he wanted us to think of books in areopagite Dukkha, the lines of Milton's poetry or not absolutely dead things, but they do contain within them a potency of life.

Speaker 1:          39:42          So Milton, imagine that his own verse was to be read and experience something like a, like a body. Of course, it's a body that extraordinary that, that, that enjoys an extraordinary degree of freedom. And, and is this a freedom that's infused into the creation when the Holy Spirit impregnates the impregnates the vast abyss. And this is also the freedom enjoyed by the most remarkable, surely hands down the most remarkable of all of Milton's corporeal creatures. And those are the angels. I imagine it sounds strange to hear that, that, that Milton is asking us in some way to think of the lines of his poetry as if they were the bodies of angels. Uh, but, but the, but the notion of corporeal freedom is so central to Milton that that it actually makes sense in some ways that Milton would want to attribute it to all of the most original in the most daring elements of his poem. This is a, this is our, an argument that's developed, been developed really quite brilliantly by a great Milton critic William Kerrigan. So a lot of book. One is, is given over to the, as, as you know, given over to those magnificent catalogs of the names of the fallen angels as Milton names, the demons, the fallen angels and catalogs, the names that they assumed when they ascended to earth and took on the form of, of, of, of Pagan Deities. Look, look at line four 23 in book one.

Speaker 2:          41:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:10          Oh, Erbitux. Even if you're reading this for the second or the third time, you were surprised again when you came, you came to this point, Milton Milton's been noting that some of the pagan deities, that the fallen angels eventually became, were male and some were female. And it's here that Milton for no explicit or no apparent reason at all. It's here that you provides a little theoretical digression on the flexibility of angelic bodies. Uh, and in the context it's a, it is a little gratuitous blind for 23 for spirits when they please can either sex, assume or both. So soft and uncompounded is their essence pure, not tied or manacled with joint or limb, nor founded on the brittle strength of bones like come braze flesh, but in what shape they choose. The highlighted or condensed, bright or obscure can execute their area purposes and works of love or amnesty fulfill.

Speaker 1:          42:10          Clearly the angels have bodies here. They're, they're made of matter just as, uh, as human beings are, but their bodies aren't compounded, have separable elements. They don't have joints and limbs or Oregon's or flesh. They're nothing but a strangely embodied form of pure, pure spirit, corporeal spirit. That's a spirit that's been infused through or loosely circumscribed shape. Now we learned later that the fact that these spirits can either sex assume actually comes, uh, comes in rather handy as the angels are permitted to experience a form of, of sexual union that far exceeds the miserable coalition that creatures like us are forced to perform. The coalition founded on the brittle strength of bones Milton rights. Milton's angels in an act of Sexual Union are fully s smushed Felice smushed together. They're an individuated, if that makes any sense. In the act of, in the act of sexual union, there's is the unutterable sexual rush that can only come about through total corporeal in jam mint.

Speaker 1:          43:23          Now this, this, this little discretion that Milton's give us, given us here on the amber sexuality of his angels, not unlike perhaps the Amba sexuality of his God seems to have a, seems to have little to do with the discussion at hand of the heathen deities, but I think it has everything to do with Milton's understanding of his own verse, which he has freed from the bondage of rhyming just as angels are freed from the manacles of joints and limbs. And so Milton's not only writing in a poetic style that he thinks his is politically motivated and ideologically motivated and he is doing that. But the style of paradise lost is also powerfully eroticized for Milton. And in, in this, in it's amazing malleability of form having dismissed the manacle of rhyme. Um, the, the, the, the poem is teaming with the same kind of erotic energy.

Speaker 1:          44:12          This is, I think, Milton's fantasy from the poem that, that same energies that charge that image of books in, in Area Politica. Um, let's, so let's look at how this, an example of this might, might actually happen. Um, uh, uh, a way in which the verse actually seems to this sensation of bodily freedom. Just look at the first line of the poem of Man's first disobedience and the fruit. And, and, and we think it, we think at first because we have been so used before we read this poem, we were so used to reading end stop lines of verse like the along the lines of verse that all of Milton's contemporaries where we're, we're, um, we're just gorging. We assume, I think after the first line or that the line should be pronounced like this of, of man's first disobedience and the fruit of, and implicitly given the fruit of that disobedience as if, as if the line was actually an of man's first disobedience and its fruit, the fruit of the disobedience.

Speaker 1:          45:18          And we, and we read fruit naturally here as if it meant result or consequence. But we find out, but we don't find this out until we get to the next line. That the fruit at the end of the line is only a kind of temporary resting place. It's a provisional, uh, it's a provisional ending. It's not a Ryan Ware. And so it doesn't constitute the end of a unit of sense as a rhyming word would in most heroic couplets that the sense of the sentence pushes us onto this. And the next line, which alters our view of the meaning of the word fruit of man's first disobedience and the fruit of that forbidden tree. The word is in figurative, it turns out to be literal real fruit. And we realize now that we've only partially understood, uh, that the sense of the word fruit, it, uh, and the combination of, of our readerly experience of the two of these two lines.

Speaker 1:          46:10          First, the figurative reading that comes from our habits of reading end stop versus, and now the literal meaning of fruit that comes from this newly acquired habit of reading and Jam blinds. Um, it's the experience of both of these cognitive sensations that that provides us with the true signifying experience of, of, of what Milton can do with a word like fruit, which is obviously going to be a loaded one in the poem. Look at another instance of the malleability of this, of this verse. Oh, a few lines down. Uh, the heavenly spirit that ditzed inspire that shepherd who first taught the chosen seed in the beginning, how the heavens and earth rose out of chaos. Now at first, I think Milton seems to mean that the shepherd Moses inspired by the Muse first taught the Israel Lights, how the heavens and earth rose out of chaos in the beginning.

Speaker 1:          47:01          And it was Moses who came up with this phrase, Milton thought in the beginning. That's the first, the first, first words of the book of Genesis. But Milton has clearly placed this little phrase, this, uh, this adverbial phrase in the beginning in an awkward place. He frees himself. And, and, and this is a, this is an insight that William Kerrigan has also had. Um, he frees himself from the strictures of conventional syntax. Any places that phrase in the beginning, at the beginning of the line, very strangely, very awkwardly before the how in the beginning, how the heavens and earth, and he's done this because he wants to permit this phrase to do more than simply modify the verb rose. We can also see in this phrase in the beginning, we can see it applying to the end of the proceeding clause. That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed in the beginning in the beginning can modify the verb taught as easily as it can.

Speaker 1:          47:57          Uh, the verb rows, it can either verb, assume just as Milton's angels can either sex as soon. And there's an important point I think that's being made with this second, this second possibility. Melton needs to imagine the narrative of, of creation as if the narration itself were taking place in the beginning as if poetic creation could be a first in the same radical way that the creation of the entire universe is obviously a first. And, and, and this is a strategy called a, uh, uh, double syntax. The notion that in the beginning can modify one verb or, or the other. And it's, and it's just this kind of rhetorical trick that Milton uses so many rhetorical tricks like this, that Milton we'll use throughout the poem that led Dr. Johnson to say an utter exasperations, but admiration that Milton wrote no language. This is an English that Milton is writing here.

Speaker 1:          48:50          Um, they, Milton's language doesn't have the same kind of headlong rush that most declarative English sentences have. We're continually being prevented from reading the text to get to the end were prevented from rushing to the end of the sentence or two, the end of the poem, because at least as far as the, well, you can think, you can, you can understand why as far as the plot goes, we know how it's going to end. We know of course that Adam and eve are going to eat the stupid fruit, but Milton is developing a style and he's working really hard to do this. That works to resist our drive to get to the end of this story and it's through a mechanism of an entirely new verse, a new kind of verse, lonesome weaves into the metrical fabric of the poem, a New Perspective on that old theological problem of, of human freewill and divine foreknowledge.

Speaker 1:          49:40          Um, can it be said that we actually chose to sin or to eat the apple? If God had known all along how the story would end or that we would do this thing in the first place? That's the conundrum that on some level we've all confronted and, and, and has been confronted since, since time began. But Milton knows that if this poem is going to be successful, we cannot as readers be permitted to think this story had to be what it was. We can't be permitted to think that the story had to turn out the way it did. Uh, we need to think that the actions in this story, we're in some way free and absolutely perfectly undetermined. We need to get at the story of the fall from the perspective of its beginning rather than from the perspective of its of its ending. And so Milton and fuses this angelic, this angelic freedom, and he infuses this bodily liberty into the actual body of the verse itself. Of course, to make a point. He's incorporating his style, a radical, original style into the, into the essential argument of the, of the poem. And he permits his own unconstrained indulgence in, in poetic, in Jama. He permits in Jama to become the verbal medium. This is the, the pulsating vehicle for his precious theology of freewill and, and for his politics of liberty. Okay. That's the end. I want to remind you a final time to look at your Spencer, uh, the Cave of mammon episode as well as Doctor Johnson's brief comments on sin and death.
