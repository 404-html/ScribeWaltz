Speaker 1:          00:01          Paradise regained, um, except well as anyone who's read and maybe there's someone here in this room who has read the continuation of the novel, Gone With the wind as anyone who has read that knows, or is anyone who's seen let's say the bride of Chucky or fast and furious part three nos. Um, sequels are rarely greater than the original works, whose stories they, whose stories they continue. And it's almost as if the diminished appeal where something like an inevitable and necessary fact of the sequel. It just comes attached to the notion of the SQL. And I think that the, that the disappointment aroused by SQL SQL of any kind is a phenomenon about which Milton John Milton as he wrote paradise regained, must've been, um, extremely aware. So, so it's Thomas Elwood, um, that was one of the young men who acted as a secretary for Milton. Um, it was Thomas Elwood who claimed a years after the poet's death that he had been responsible for Milton's having written the sequel to paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          01:16          He recorded having told Milton, um, after he had read it, an early manuscript copy of paradise lost. This is before paradise lost was even, uh, in print. He, he, he, he reports to us having told Milton, thou hast said much here of paradise lost, but what has thou to say of Paradise found? And then Elwood continues and it's, it's a wonderful little bit of a, it's a wonderful little bit of information. Milton made no answer to me but sat sometime and amuse and I, I like a lot of, like a lot of critics of Milton. I have a hard time believing that it was Elwood squirmy little Elwood who planted the idea of a sequel to paradise lost in, in Milton's head. But I think it's nonetheless interesting that this story has been so widely circulated and it's almost invariably cited by scholars of, of paradise regained because I think in some way, uh, readers are looking for some excuse really for Milton's having written it.

Speaker 1:          02:21          Paradise lost seems in itself, so absolutely complete and so magnificent. The idea that it requires this equal, um, is, is one that is, uh, it seems suspicious or questionable too. A lot of Milton's readers now, Milton's, oh nephew, Edward Phillips described the way in which readers, even in Milton's lifetime judge the sequel to be the, the, the, the inferior, the lesser of the two works. And so Philip tells us in his biography, and this is actually usefully included in the back of the the Hughes Edition, a Phillips tells us, um, that paradise regained is generally in censured to be much inferior to the other. The Milton could not hear with patients any such thing when related to him. And I love this image of the old man impatient with any comment that might be a little, the accomplishment of the, of the sequel sequel. And I think it's a, it's a, it's a moving, it's a moving image and if Milton's nephew is, is right here as I suspect he is, then I think it's worth pursuing the reason for which Milton might have considered paradise, regained the sequel to be the greater work or a work in some way more sophisticated and more advanced than paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          03:35          And I think in a lot of ways it is, it is exactly that. Now, surely one of the first things that we noticed when we, when we read the sequel to paradise lost is, is really the radical radical difference of its style. The literary style or what we can think of as the verbal texture of, of paradise regained really constitutes one of its greatest departures and obviously one of its most deliberate departures from the first step. And all those, most readers of regained find it's less stylistically pleasing them. Lost. Uh, Milton has, has embraced this style, I think for an important reason. He has very consciously imposed a set of constraints on his verbal style, a set of constraints on his entire poetic imagination and our, our appreciation of the beauty and the meaning of this poem is actually, I think inextricable for our understanding of this poem.

Speaker 1:          04:30          Um, understanding of the, the, the, the, the severity of the lesson that this poem has to teach us. Um, this poet, and we know this because we've spent a lot of time with John Milton. Now, this poet was instinctively given to verbal excess, uh, to an almost unimaginable degree and he clearly had to struggle hard to reign in a lot of his most powerful literary impulses in order to produce a work such as paradise regained to work of such seemingly charmless severity. Um, this poem has been scrubbed clean of, of verbal and images stick extravagance. I'm scrubbed cleaner even than the last two books of paradise lost, which were, which were themselves, um, radical departures. And I think in a lot of ways paradise regained, resembles a stylistically in terms of it's verbal texture. The last books of paradise lost. Now Milton has purge this poem as well of the Grammatical Obscurity, the syntactical obscurity that we found in paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          05:34          And you remember all of those ambiguities syntactical ambiguity's that we're always opening up far more signifying possibilities that we could even begin to deal with. Milton has clipped so many of those long and wandering sentences into short and unequivocal declarations and he's replaced the lushness of, of so many of those similes and literary ornaments with what we can think of is the puritan austerity of, of simple argument and simple statement of fact. And this poem has been written and what is often described, um, now as the periods plain style, uh, something like the conversational style of unambiguous, straightforward language that was supposedly favored by the Puritan clergy in the, in the 17th century. And I think that makes sense. This poem has been written in what we can think of as the plain style, but if that's the case, how strange and how surprising that this poem, which is written in a poetic language as plain and unambiguous as anything Milton ever put on paper, how unbelievably odd it is that this poem paints for us a world in which so few statements can actually be understood.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Um, all of the, all of the, all of the characters in paradise regained. And I'm including, there aren't that many of them, but I'm including of course the son of God. Um, all of the characters fail at sometime or another to understand even the clearest, even the most perspicuous language, a much like Adam in books 11 and 12 of paradise lost the characters in Paris, right? Gained or on some level profoundly, uh, clueless. And, and their cognitive incapacity, which, which actually comes in a, in a variety of shapes depending where you are in the poem there. Cognitive incapacity usually involves their inability to, to interpret fully, um, and to interpret accurately, accurately a statement or a text statement or a text that in our estimation, um, seems to be just about as clear and unambiguous as it could possibly be. Now, one of the texts that proves so puzzling to the characters of paradise regained is also a puzzle to Adam in paradise lost. And so I want to look back at the ending of paradise lost in order to see a way in which that poem had been preparing us all along for, for the sequel.

Speaker 1:          08:07          I, um, I think you'll remember our are mentioning in class that odd and sometimes irritating way in which, which Adam was always jumping the gun in his interpretation of, of, of future Christian history. The, in the lesson that that Micah was presenting him and one of the central historical documents that Adam seemed particularly predisposed to misinterpret was what is known as the Prodo Evangelian and that's been spelled for you. Piaroti oh, eva. N. G. E. L. I. U. M. That's been spelled for you on your handout. So you don't need my um, orthography right now. And, and, and, and the protege evangelism, which is the Greek for first gospel or the first good news is one of the ways in which Christians refer to genesis 14 and 15. It's the prophecy from the book of Genesis that God delivers to the serpent God prophesies that the serpents eventual punishment. And this is on the handout that the serpent, eventually we will be punished and I will put enmity between thee and the woman.

Speaker 1:          09:15          And between thy seed and her seed, it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel. Now, this is the anticipation of the end as, as presented, as imagined in genesis. And it's, it's this text that the new testament uses, um, to forge a connection between the story of Christ, which is obviously the new testament story and the, the, the, the first initial texts in the tradition, which is the, the story of Adam and eve. And so for Christians, Christ of course, is the woman's seed, the great, great, great, great, great, great grandson of, uh, of Adam and eve. And he will one day bruise the head of the serpent who is interpreted by Christians to be Satan, um, even as Satan will be dogging, um, his steps. Now, the text of this prophecy is reproduced and reworked, I think almost to a compulsive degree in paradise.

Speaker 1:          10:12          Lost, um, uh, allusions to the prophecy in genesis agenda, the pro to Evangelian appear foe in five separate places in the last books of Milton's, APEC and a, and an a, an actually in far more places than that in paradise regained. This prophecy is a text that has to be read and interpreted. It's mold over and reinterpreted and it's Michael's task in the last books of paradise lost to teach Adam how to read it. Adam has to figure out, and this actually and itself requires a lot of, of toodle edge on Michael's part. Adam has to figure out that the serpent is actually Satan. That's nothing that comes instinctively or intuitively to Adam. And that of course the seed is the Messiah who Adam will eventually interpret to be the son of God. And so let's look at the end of paradise lost here because Michael is not only teaching Adam how to, how to understand the Proto Proto Evangelian, but he's teaching us also, I think preparing us to read paradise regained.

Speaker 1:          11:14          So this is, um, page four 63 and the Hughes, it's book 10 of actually, I'll be, um, I'll, I'm going to be skipping around the, the first passage that we'll be looking at his book. 10 line one 79, um, that's when the sun delivers the prophecy to the serpent. Um, and then at line 500 of book 10, we see Satan trying to figure out what the Sun could possibly have meant. Book 11, line one 15 if you can flip through pages fast enough. Um, God himself explains to Michael in heaven about the prophecy of the seed. And then Michael due to flee relays this message to Adam himself in book 12 line one 50. Now, there's obviously an excessive proliferation here of, of prophetic statements so excessive that you probably weren't able to flip through your books nearly quickly enough. And, and it's no wonder that Adam is really beside himself with such an eager desire to get to get to the end.

Speaker 1:          12:14          I'm so obsessive. Lee Is this prophecy of the end. Uh, presented it at the end of paradise lost. Adam has learned about the birth of Jesus. He's learned about the Messiah who will actually be born of a woman, uh, called the woman's seed in the book of Genesis. And he thinks he has this prophecy of the seed completely figured out. He thinks he understands now how the story of Christian history is going to end. So this is, um, lined three 75 of, of book 12, line three, 75 of book 12. Um, at the top of page four, 63 Oh, profit of glad tidings, Adam says, finisher of utmost hope. Now clear. I understand what oft my steady his thoughts. I've searched in vain why our great expectation should be called the seed of woman. And of course, and we, and we're used to this because we read the last two books of paradise lost.

Speaker 1:          13:14          Adam is wrong to think that he has a clear understanding of what his Greg, uh, of the great expectations of the end. And he imagines once again with a kind of singularly dull witted literalism just how this prophecy of the seed is going to play out. So at line three 83, Adam says, needs, must the serpent. Now his capital brews expect with mortal pain and a capital bruises, literally a bruise to the head say where and when their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victors heal. And Adam, of course, has utterly imagined or imagine precisely the wrong kind of ending. This isn't going to be a physical fight, who's victory can be pinned down to some specific time and specific place, uh, uh, kind of a terrifying event for which tickets can be purchased. And, and, and, and, and, and, and Michael recognizes Adams interpretation as a misinterpretation.

Speaker 1:          14:14          And so he, he corrects it. And at line three 86, uh, Michael Tells Adam this dream not of their fight as of a duel or the local wounds of head, or he'll, we're not supposed to imagine some gunslinger show down at the end of time between the Messiah and the serpent. And remember that Milton Milton, Adam is still imagining the serpent being a serpent. He hasn't yet figured out that the serpent is Satan. We're not going to have an actual war capable of producing actual wounds. And Adam of course, in his defense, and I think he does need a little defending here, um, has in mind the story, the war in heaven, the story of an actual fight full of local wounds, um, that, that all to local wounds, they were healed instantly that Raefiel had conveyed to him of course in book six and which David Carrell had a wonderfully explicated, um, for our benefit.

Speaker 1:          15:10          But the battle that will turn out to reconfigure all of Christian history isn't going to proceed along the vulgarly literal line set forth in the war in heaven. Um, it's as if Michael is trying to tell Adam to forget to forget everything that it, Raphael told him to forget that monumental a war that, that Raphael had had relayed because that kind of thing simply isn't going to happen anymore. The fight between the fight between Satan and the seed of the serpent and the seed is going to be a much subtler one. And, and, and the Messiah will begin his destruction of the serpent by becoming a man himself. Uh, just just like Adam had, had become a man at his, at his birth. That seems to be pretty much the gist of, of Michael's theology and paradise lost. Well, so Milton finishes paradise lost. Evidently he begins Paradise regained even before paradise lost has, has found its way into print and paradise regained his published four years later in 1671 and paradise paradise regained his published four years later.

Speaker 1:          16:21          And it's all about that redemption, that regaining of paradise that Michael had prophesied at the end of paradise lost. And as you can tell from the title of the Sequel, Paradise regained is all about returning and, and, and, and repetition. And we shouldn't think that the same. The SQL here is simply repeating and elaborating on the ideal, on the ideas with which the original poem had concluded. Um, now what's true, the paradise regained does repeat the Prodo Evangelian that prophecy that the sun, the sun's destruction of the serpent that we finally figured out is actually Satan and approves just as obsessively interested in that bizarre prophecy as paradise lost was. But this new poem repeats that prophecy with a difference. And I think there are all sorts of ways in which the, the, the poem is, is exploring and we exploring a lot of the implications and a lot of the consequences of the very idea of repetition, implicit or compacted in that prefix re of paradise regained.

Speaker 1:          17:31          Um, this is a work devoted to how the lost paradise will eventually become the regained paradise. And, and obviously for, for Christians or Orthodox Christians have almost, almost any, any stripe, um, that regaining that redemption will hinge on the atonement on the, on the moment of the crucifixion. Well, um, that's pretty much out of the question for Milton. So we have to ask the question. Um, how does Milton account for that pivotal moment in Christian history that the turning point from the old covenant with God to the new covenant, how does Milton Imagine the shift from Paradise lost to paradise regained and the, and the answer as we have come, uh, as we have come to recognize, because if these are the kinds of the answers that we get when we ask questions about Milton, the answer is as shocking one. Milton quite simply doesn't mention, and this is unspeakably sublime, he just doesn't bother to mention the crucifixion in paradise regained.

Speaker 1:          18:41          Um, and and of, of course we already know that the subject of the crucifixion is one that Milton has long had an awkward relation to. Um, he wasn't able to finish that early poem with a passion, um, uh, that, that he had written as a young man. And in this new poem, a paradise regained the story ends. Uh, the story ends before the crucifixion and even takes place because for Milton in this absolutely remarkable poem, the crowning moment of Christian history and the point at which lost paradise is actually regained something that we are of course all ourselves, the beneficiaries of it has nothing whatsoever to do with the sacrifice the father sacrifice of the son. And it has nothing to do with a magnificent battle for that matter between Satan and the, and the Messiah. It's a moment mentioned rather briefly in a couple of gospel accounts of the life of Jesus.

Speaker 1:          19:34          The Gospel of Matthew and the gospel of Luke narrate the story of Jesus's fasting. This all happens in a, in a, in a, in a few, in a few verses in the New Testament, the story of Jesus fasting for 40 days in the wilderness and the three temptations to which Satan subjected, uh, Jesus of during that time. Now in the gospel of the loop loop, which is the version that Milton follows most closely, Satan tempts the sun three times. He asked this under turn stones into bread in order to free himself. He asked this, uh, and of course the son refuses. He asks the Sun to accept all the kingdoms of the world as Satan Zone gift. The son refuses and he asks us under prove his divinity by casting himself off the pinnacle of the temple and the son refuses. And that pretty much is it three temptations and three acts of resistance.

Speaker 1:          20:35          And it is this simple, but of course, never, nothing is ever that simple, but it's this more or less simple, um, resistance of temptation in paradise regained that constitutes the very center of Christian history. This is, uh, this is an extraordinary and for me, unbelievable way of, of rethinking and reimagining, um, Christian theology and the story of, uh, and the story of Christian history itself. The very premise of this poem is I think a transgressive one. It utterly, uh, changing all of the emphases in traditional Christian doctrine. The focal point, of course in Milton's poem isn't, isn't really theological. It's not mystical or sacramental. It's ethical. It's not the magic or the mysticism of the crucifixion or the resurrection that that has anything to do with the regaining of paradise. Here it is a simple and entirely, I think an miraculous action of behaving ethically.

Speaker 1:          21:39          It's something that any of us could do. And as I mentioned a minute ago, this poem is all about returning and, and repetition. And the pro do evangelism is a text to which the characters are themselves continually returning. But there's another text that is repeated if you can believe it, even more obsessive. Lee, uh, then that in paradise regained, and that's the scene in which Jesus is baptized by John The baptist. The scene of the baptism is narrated. First. It happens right at the beginning. Um, line 29 of the first book. This is page four, 83 in the Hughes and we have to look at this passage. Um, it's narrated first in book one, line 29 and following, and then it's repeated and referred to and worried about at least four times over the after that. Over the course of, over the course of the poem, this is what we first learned on him, baptized heaven opened and in likeness of a dove, the spirit descended while the father's voice from heaven pronounced him his beloved son.

Speaker 1:          22:53          Now we of course read these, what I take to be these relatively simple and unimaginative lines. And if anything, I think we should be overwhelmed by their exceptional straightforwardness. It's almost impossible to understand what it is about this baptismal pronouncement that could prove so troublesome and so difficult, um, in the poem, but no one in the poem. And that includes, of course, the son of God himself. No one in the poem has anything even close to a clear idea about what these lines actually mean. And this radical uncertainty at the very heart of the poem involves the fact that these incredibly important revelation is the product merely of the father's voice, the father's voice. We're no longer in the world of paradise lost where man can commune directly with angels. And even with the son of God and with some frequency and with w with a degree of relative ease, nowhere in paradise regained his divinity.

Speaker 1:          23:55          Actually present. Dad Isn't palpable. It's not indisputably there in the world of this poem. And all we have is the father's voice, his pronouncements or in other words, all we have is a text, just like the text of scripture or in fact it is the text of scripture. And the father has left us with a little tay, a trail of his precedence. Um, uh, in the form of the words of the Hebrew Bible. And everyone in the poem is desperately scrambling to interpret this verbal trail. These words and all of this is a way of saying that the, that the universe of paradise regained is essentially to my mind, a secular one. Uh, the world. And this is essentially the world that Milton had introduced us to at the end of paradise lost. And in this secular world, all con, all one can really do is read the text and try to figure out what it means.

Speaker 1:          24:55          And this is all the Satan and the sun are in a position to do in paradise regained. And I think this is what gives this poem. It's powerfully modernist feel. Um, it says skeptical and uncertain as it is possible for such a profoundly and piously religious poem to be. If I'm, if that oxymoronic statement makes, makes any sense. Um, look, look at how Satan reacts to the pronouncement of God at the baptism that we just looked at the pronouncement, that this is my beloved son. Lines line 33 that heard the adversary, who roving still about the world at that assembly famed would not be last. And with the voice divine nine thunderstruck, the exalted man to whom such high a test was given a while surveyed with wonder. Satan rushes to the congregation of angels assembled at the River Jordan. Um, because he wants to hear as the other angels do, to hear the highest test that God is bestowing upon this man from Nazareth.

Speaker 1:          26:07          This nobody who was the son of Joseph deemed. And it says it's at his hearing of this divine voice that Satan is thunderstruck. Now fender struck is, this is, this is a striking word here. It, it, it bursts out of this passage as a little metaphor. And you know, we're taking whatever we can get here. We take note of it because Milton has given us so little by way of Poetic Metaphor, um, in this severely restrained literary world of Paradise regained. We're grateful. And, and, and the word thunder struck is in fact, so striking. And so that Milton has used it only one other time in, in all of his poetry and it, and it's clear here that Milton is asking us to remember that earlier occurrence. So I'm going to ask you, does anyone here remember where else in Milton extra credit here? Um, where else in Milton we have, we have encountered the word thunderstruck.

Speaker 2:          27:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          27:13          Okay. Uh, you're no one in paradise regained seems to have remembered the parent, the appearance of the word either. Um, and so you're in good company. If we can't imagine the inhabitants of the world of paradise regained having been in a position to read paradise lost, which is something I think that Milton sometimes asks us to imagine, although of course it's preposterous. Um, uh, it's, it's clear. I think that Milton is asking us to remember that earlier occurrence. Um, so I'm going to ask you to turn to page three. 43 of paradise lost the Hughes Edition. This is the climactic moment. Oh, and actually I have, uh, I've included this handily on your handout. This is the climactic moment in the war in heaven at which the son of God assumes the chariot of paternal deity, you know, gets in dad's car and proceeds to put a decisive end to the battle with the rebel angels.

Speaker 1:          28:12          This is what I'm Rapheal tells Adam, the overthrown he raised and as a herd of goats are timorous flock together. Thronged drove them before him. Thunderstruck pursued with terrors and with theories to the bound. And Crystal Wall of Heaven. And it's at this terrible moment of being thunderstruck by the awesome power of the sun that the rebel angels throw themselves headlong down from the verge of, uh, down from the verge of heaven. This is obviously an unbelievably consequential moment. This is the moment of the, of Satan's fall. And I think there's, there's got to be a point to Milton's recycling repeating of this word, this striking word from paradise lost. Um, in the new poem, Paradise regained. I think he's signaling signaling some kind of connection between the horrifying moment of the sun's Vick from Satan's perspective of the son's victory over the fallen of the rebel angels in the earlier poem and the Son's new victory, or what's about to be his new victory over Satan that begins at this moment, century later, centuries later at the son's baptism, Milton alludes to that climactic moment in paradise lost, but on some level, this is an illusion that the later poem paradise regained, doesn't know what to do with.

Speaker 1:          29:31          And in fact never really does anything explicit with Satan. Is Thunder struck at the baptism just as he was, some thunder struck at the war in heaven, but Satan himself is incapable. And this is just in, in, in genius on Milton's part. He's incapable of understanding how these two moments might be in any way related. Um, I don't know what kind of television, if, if any, you all watch. Uh, but I do know that not when I was an undergraduate, but because we got such terrible, um, reception in the, in the days before cable. But when I was a graduate student and living off campus and I had cable television, I spent an inordinate amount of time watching a soap opera is during the day. It was a way not to write my dissertation. And, um, if you've spent as much time as I have a watching thousands of hours of soap operas, um, you know what it means to be thunderstruck, which is something I take it to be closely related to being struck by lightning.

Speaker 1:          30:33          Um, there is, uh, at least in the 70s and in the 80s, there's a point in almost every soap opera at least once every two or three years in which someone is struck by lightning and the consequences in variably the same. It's the condition of Amnesia and soap operas obviously couldn't survive without some recourse to the, the Amnesia plot, the lightening striking plot because it's a way to keep all of the actors intact but reconfigure the reconfigure and, and spice up a lot of the plots because the same actor gets to be someone completely new, uh, because he has to develop an entirely new life and new relationships with all of the preexisting, uh, actors and cast members. Um, I think it's something very close to Amnesia that Satan is struck with at this, at this moment in paradise regained. And it's as if Satan has at this very moment repressed any memory of his first having been thunder struck.

Speaker 1:          31:32          He has completely forgotten about the son's role in the war in heaven. And I, and I actually have to be more specific than that. Um, Satan is incapable of applying to the current situation, any memory of who it was, who had beat him in the war in heaven. He has repressed the presence significance, this significant for the presence present moment of the sons, the son of God's victory. And it's the nature of this repression, I think, which is at the very center of Paradise, regained the central advanced that this poem has made over a paradise lost is its refusal to represent traditional epic action. There's, there's no big battle here. There's no war, there's no a huge fight in which the woman's seed, Christ bruises Satan's head. There's really actually no overt action at all. The hero quite simply does nothing. And he just keeps saying no.

Speaker 1:          32:29          And, and, and whatever action this, this text presents to us is clearly psychological. And the psychological problem that I think overwhelms all of the, all of the characters in paradise regained is the simple fact that they cannot manage for the life of them to relate the cur, the current story that they're inhabiting to the events of Paradise lost. They have forgotten paradise lost. No. So let me, let me ask you to think about the dramatic, the dramatic situation of this poem. Satan knows perfectly well that God has prophesied that one of his sons will rise up one day and destroy him, and he's very, he knows that this is going to happen and he's very clear about the, the certainty of the prophecy from Genesis Three 15 and Satan even knows that it is this man named Jesus who's being baptized now, who will one day destroy him and who will one day would be responsible for bruising his head.

Speaker 1:          33:29          But Satan seems for some reason to have no way of knowing that the son of God who will at some point in the future be responsible for his doom, is the same son of God who had devastated all of the rebel angels and Satan himself. Of course, in the war in heaven, Satan has no way of knowing that the prophesied messiah that he's dealing with now will turn out to be the son of God. The first forgotten. He has no way of knowing that the Messiah will be that same absolutely insufferable angel whom the heavenly father had promoted so, so arbitrarily. And so Austin spaciously above all of the other angels in Book Five of Paradise lost that, the traumatic scene of that exultation on this day, I have bee got my only son to him. I'll need shall bow. Um, all, all him who disobeys me.

Speaker 1:          34:19          Disobeys you remember all of those thundering words of the, of the father. Satan is incapable of relating that traumatic scene to this traumatic scene, the tractor to traumatic scene that he's witnessing now. This is my beloved son. Um, at the baptism, look at what Satan says. It's excruciating and it makes us squirm. I think I'm at the top of page four 85. This is book one, line 89 seems trying. Satan is trying to figure out what God meant by his strange utterance at the baptism. And you can see state and coming so close to an understanding, but he's, he can't seem to make the final logical leap. And it's a leap of course, that I think we all feel confident that we would have made or been able to make. [inaudible] 89 this is Satan. His first big we know and sore have felt he's remembering the war in heaven.

Speaker 1:          35:12          When his fierce thunder drove us to the deep who this is we must learn. So he's able to remember that sensation of being thunderstruck and paradise lost, but he can't connect it with the thunderous, properly proclamation of the sun at the baptism. If there's a, it's a, it's as if we have a failure of, of the synaptic nerves and Satan's brain. Um, and, and he, he can't make what seems to be, it's to us the obvious cognitive link. Um, and, and I think his inability to make that link is, is surprising. But we have to understand that Satan has been traumatized and it says if the war in heaven had produced in St and something like a post dramatic stress disorder, and the nature of this disorder is his, well, I think it's perfectly understandable. And just in a simple psychological terms, you'll remember that the original motive for Satan's fall was the father's exaltation of, of his beloved son, his now beloved son above all of the other angels, and that the resulting sibling rivalry, uh, was the spur for all of Satan's later actions.

Speaker 1:          36:21          The dilemma of, of sibling rivalry is at the heart of, of paradise regained as well. But, but sibling rivalry in this poem exists solely as a phenomenon that has to be repressed. Satan simply cannot and will not make the cognitive connection between the rivalry he feels now to this messiah character and the one that he had felt that primal originary rivalry that had proven so devastating and paradise lost. Now we may feel that we can understand on psychological grounds there the reason for Satan's inability to read the full meaning of God's pronouncement at the baptism. But I think the true genius of Milton's poem is the fact that the sun is just as clueless as Satan. The Sun has even less memory. In fact, then Satan about his former activities in heaven, the sun can't even begin to reconstruct what had happened in paradise lost because in assuming his earthly mantle, he seems to have suffered an a much greater and much severe case of Amnesia than the, than Satan had.

Speaker 1:          37:33          And I think it's this image of Amnesia or some kind of repression or have some sort of pathological for getting that may provide the most useful way of thinking about the relation of paradise regained to the earlier poem. Paradise lost. Now let's think about it from another perspective. In writing paradise regained. Milton has clearly had to repress everything that had been spilled on everything, but pretty much everything that had been so liberating, so revolutionary, and so remarkable about paradise lost. Now what might be, it might be tempting to argue, and it of course has been argued that Milton is just getting old and he's getting tired. He's not up to all those similes now. Um, but Milton has severed from his verse, all of that luxuriant ornamentation for a deliberate and I think a very important reason he's purging is verse of its care. Of what we now take to be its characteristic beauty because he too like the Satan and like the son is struggling to forget paradise lost. And I think there's an important sense in which Milton is thinking of the beautiful verse style of Paradise Lost as something like a temptation in this poem. And it's a temptation that he, that he has to resist. Look at the scene of the second temptation in paradise regained. This is a page 500 of the Hughes. This is book two, line two 89.

Speaker 1:          39:00          Um, the sun is beginning to get hungry understandably after his 40 days in the wilderness. And He, uh, he enters a pleasant grove where he encounters Satan only in a bottom. This is line two 89, a book to only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove with chant of tune. Full birds, resounding loud vid there he bent his way, determined there to rest at noon and entered some and entered soon. The shade, high roofed and walks beneath and alleys brown that opened in the midst of woody seen nature's own work. It seemed nature taught art and to a superstitious I the haunt of would gods and would nymphs.

Speaker 1:          39:47          I think this pretty little landscape that we have here is, is rather jarring in the context of the reserved, the sparing pleasures typically afforded us in paradise regained and it's drawing because this pleasant grove remember, reminds us, I think of in so many ways of the garden of Eden from paradise lost. Milton's description here is in fact a tissue of Echos from book four of Paradise lost where we're eating opens onto a woody theater. Just as this grove opens onto a woody scene and, and, and, and this grove appears, seems to appear to possess, would gods and would mimic as much as diverse a paradise lost was filled with the illusions to all of those classical presences that Milton had cold from his, his lifetime of reading classical literature. But here are the deities, a pagan literature are branded as superstition. Thus they relate earning and all of those elements, those aesthetic elements that had made paradise lost, so lovable, so engaging.

Speaker 1:          40:51          And so when Tyson are now branded as a temptation, and it's as if the sun were being tempted with something like the literature of Paradise lost when he's presented with this opportunity that he takes, by the way, uh, to enter this grove. And it's important, it's important that the son willingly enters a, this pleasant grove that has been so carefully fashioned of course, uh, but by Satan and readers of this poem rightly are always shocked. But by this, by this moment, because this is the son of God here after all. And he's the very poor picture of virtue and have perfect reason and he's made this unbelievably stupid mistake. This is like the mistake that red night makes in the first Canto of the fairy queen entering the would have error. Um, the beauty of paradise and by extension, the beauty of paradise lost is so tempting.

Speaker 1:          41:44          We could say that even the son of God feels it's overwhelming. Magnet magnet magnetic pole. Milton I think is still though working consciously here to renounce all of that extraordinary poetic license that he had taken in paradise. Paradise lost. And and this new poem explorers in more depth and with more insight this the merit, the beauty of poetic renunciation than any other poem ever has. I'm convinced of that. This is a poem all about denial and repression and and its deepest and most powerful meanings emerge. Not through our sense I think of what the poem offers, but our sense of what it's not offering or what it won't permit itself to offer. Now there's an obvious and explicit way in which paradise regained is about this kind of of negation or this renunciation of paradise lost. Paradise lost was about man's first disobedience and the new poem Paradise regained, reverses that situation and treats another man's unswerving obedience to God and obedience so severe that at times I think it strikes, this is on on thinking or unreflective.

Speaker 1:          43:00          That's just the obvious way in which paradise regained works to to negate or undo the effects of paradise lost. But there's another, there's a more significant way in which Milton's later poem attempts to forge some kind of connection with the earlier one. Ma Milton and the new poem is acutely aware of his already having written the great epic paradise lost. And in this, in with this intense self consciousness, it's an entirely new neurotic burden for Milton. Paradise regained, takes up the problem that had proven so difficult and so troubling to the, to the younger Milton he needed, takes it up once again. But of course with a twist. And this is the problem of the poets career and it's as if Milton can stand back now and review the autobiographical narrative he had written for himself as a young man and take stock in what he's accomplished.

Speaker 1:          43:55          So think of the basic situation that the son of God finds himself in in paradise regained even before they're remarkable moment of God's pronouncement. At the baptism, Jesus had grown up with the knowledge of his future role as the Messiah. His mother had told him, his mom, Mary had told him when he was a young boy, uh, of what was to become what he was to be. He had a very early age, his sense of the important work that he would perform at some future point in time, but he didn't know exactly what that work was going to look like. And he didn't have a clue as to when he was actually supposed to begin his work and short the son of God before hand before him a narrative of his career long before he was able to imagine just how that narrative was going to be fleshed out.

Speaker 1:          44:44          Um, and if this problem sounds a little familiar to you, that's of course because it is familiar. This, this is precisely the position that the young Milton had found himself in. He had declared at a very early age that he was, that he was chosen by God to write a poem that his countryman would not willingly let die. He was going to be, um, England's literary messiah. But, but, but that was years before he knew what he was supposed to be writing about or even when he was supposed to begin writing. And as he says in paradise lost, he was long and choosing and beginning late. And this is exactly the position that the son of God finds himself in in paradise regained. Look at the top of page four 87 a book, one line one 83. This is the son of God, trying to figure out what the father, what the father must have meant at the baptism. Meanwhile, the son of God, who yet some days lodged in Bethesda row where John Baptized musing and much revolving in his breast, how best the mighty work he might begin of savior to mankind. And which way first publish his God. Like office. Now mature.

Speaker 1:          46:07          Now, if we read this passage with, with any sense at all, any knowledge of its author, I think that this moment in the life, at this moment as a scene from the life of Christ, I dunno, it's, it's completely absurd. This would, this is a, it's a ridiculous situation. You have Jesus thinking, hmm, I'm supposed to be the savior of mankind. Let me think. What should I do first? I'm, I, I'm, I'm really confused here. It's, it's no one else has ever and would ever, uh, imagine such a scene of a, of the kind of career anxiety, um, in, in some sort of narrative involving the son of God. It's, it's laughable to think of the son of God is undergoing something like a, a career panic attack. But this passage is very different and it's an assumes, I think an extraordinary degree of significance when it's placed in the context of Milton's own ongoing ruminations about his own career.

Speaker 1:          47:07          The son is asking himself how he should publish, how he should make public the God like office into which he has now matured. And I think it's impossible not to hear in these lines. The analogous concern that Milton had himself revolved in his breast when he was pondering when he should publish or bring into print the fruits of what he knew was his god like poetic talent. So I want to conclude with this suggestion. The suggestion that Milton has transposed the narrative. This is only one of the myriad things that he's doing in paradise regained. He's transposed the narrative of his own poetic of development onto the new narrative of the sons, the development of the sun, sense of his own identity. And, and by saying this, I don't want to suggest that all paradise regained his is an autobiographical poem. I'm convinced of course, that it is an autobiographical poem, but it is first and foremost, I think a meditation on the problem of autobiography.

Speaker 1:          48:12          Milton is in the amazingly peculiar position of having, of having written his autobiography long before he'd actually lived the bulk of his life. That's what all those career narratives were doing, um, that he had penned in the, in the early 1640s. How do you actually live a life, the end of which you already know. What's the relation of, uh, of the, uh, what's the relation of the anticipated life narrative to the actual experience of living? These are of course, the questions that play Gaddam and eve in the last books of paradise lost as they, as they learned the, the future history of their descendants, but still have to go about the business of, of living their lives. And these are clearly questions that get to the very heart of Milton's relation to the prophecy of his own poetic talent. And they're questions that we will begin to, that we'll begin to approach that we will continue, um, throughout this week as we approached the problem that Milton Confronts when he writes paradise regained. Um, and that's this question. What does it mean? What does it mean after all to write a sequel to the poem that after times will not willingly let die? Okay. Um, I'm going to end there. I'm going to ask you to, uh, make sure you will have read all of paradise regained, um, for Wednesday. Okay.
