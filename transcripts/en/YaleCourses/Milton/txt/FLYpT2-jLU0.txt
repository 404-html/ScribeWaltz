Speaker 1:          00:01          I'm actually going to continue here. One of the discussions that I had begun in the last lecture, which, uh, which involved the matter of the relationship of this poem paradise regained to the earlier epic, uh, which we, we have to acknowledge is on so many ways the more ambitious poem paradise lost. And so I want to look at the way in which Milton uses this new poem, Paradise regained to explore the larger, the larger problem of identity. Um, and a lot of ways the identity of Milton himself, Milton's identity as a, an obedient son of God. Uh, Milton's identity as a, as a poet. Um, and, and all, all of this gets worked out over the course of the, over the course of the, of the poem, each of the characters in paradise regained Satan and the sun, each of them is involved in an elaborate process. And it's really a process that spans the entire poem, um, of trying to figure out who the other one is. And on top of that, each of them is trying to figure out who he himself is or who he, uh, or who he himself has been in the son's case. Um, there's that, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:27          turn, I don't know what page this is on book one, lines three 55 and 56. This is the sun speaking to Satan. And, uh, I think it's an extraordinary thing for the son to say, um, book one, line three 55, the son says to Satan, why dust thou then suggest to me distrust, knowing who I am as I know who thou art. Why does style then suggest to me distrust, knowing who I am as I know who thou art. And of course we are, how can we not? Um, we are inclined to assume that because this is the son of God. After all that this is, that there's, that there's something more meaningful about this statement then actually is the case. What does the sun know? The Sun does know, uh, that Satan is his enemy and that Satan is of that to be identified with that serpent from the pro Evangelian. The prophecy back in Genesis, um, who it will be the son's job to destroy. The son knows that, um, and Satan knows

Speaker 1:          02:49          that the son is his enemy and that it will be the son's job as the Messiah to g to destroy him. But this is still just a partial knowledge and it's remarkable the extent to which Milton doesn't let on just how partial this knowledge is. We don't know it until the end, how little the sun and Satan actually understand about themselves and about each other. And so I think the sun is actually wrong in some way at this early point in the poem to claim that he knows who Satan is because his is of course just a partial knowledge and Satan doesn't know fully who the son is. Um, and the, and the sun doesn't know fully who, whose who Satan is. And each of them, each of them on some level knows who the other is. But each, but neither of them knows who the other had been.

Speaker 1:          03:41          If that, I'm hoping that will make more sense by the time we get to the end of the, the end of our period here. Okay. So what, what little action, uh, what little drama this, this poem of affords us and it is, you know, we have to confess it is, it is relatively little, um, involves justice struggle, this intellectual struggle to understand one's identity. And I think that that the search for identity represented and the poem in a lot of ways is a reflection of or something like a narrative version of Milton's own attempts. And we've been, we've been tracking this for a long time now. Milton's own attempts to identify himself. So one of the questions I think at stake here is who is John Milton? Who is this man? Who is this man who dared to rewrite scripture in his 12th book epic poem.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Paradise lost this, this, I think this poem is everywhere trying to answer that question and it begins answering it at the, at the very opening look, look at the beginning of paradise regained. This is page four 83 in the Hughes I, and obviously this is a Milton, the narrator talking to us, I whoever, while the happy garden song by one man's disobedience lost now seeing recovered paradise to all mankind by one man's from obedience, fully tried. And, and obviously Milton is drawing our attention to, to the earlier achievement, the epic that had begun with that prepositional phrase, uh, of man's first disobedience. And so the poet very carefully rings a variation on that phrase in the forest line of the new poem and the new, the new phrases by one man's from obedience. And this little modulation reflects, of course, the change of, of, of subject matter.

Speaker 1:          05:41          Uh, but, but look at the way in which Milton has, it's, this is unbelievable to me. Look at how he has characterized his authorship of the earlier poem. I who air while the Happy Garden Song? No, just just, just pause for a moment and think about what kind of way that is to refer to the, the, the magnificent epic achievement that is, that is paradise lost. Milton's diluting and these [inaudible], he hasn't made up this convention. He's alluding and these lines to the opening of Virgil's epic, the Aeneid, and also to the beginning of Spencer's romance epic, the Fairy Queen and Spencer of course, was himself alluding to Virgil and Virgil and Spencer had begun their vast and ambitious literary projects by identifying themselves to the readers. Um, and so each of them in his way, uh, began their huge poems like, like this I the poet who had sung of happy gardens, who had been content writing pastoral poems, diminutive little pastoral lyrics.

Speaker 1:          06:48          I'm now embarking on an epic and an epic. As you all know, from having read homer is a poem that treats of heroism and of war. I have graduated to epic ambition. That's how Spencer began the fairy queen. And that's how a virtual before him had begun the Aeneid. And by the time we get to the renaissance, this is really the standard way of introducing your epic poem. Okay, that's fine. But what sense one sentence is there to Milton's beginning paradise regained this way, this, he should have done this. He should have done this before in paradise lost. What sense does it make from Milton to begin this poem with that conventional epic opening? Milton had already written his epic and not only had Milton already written as epic, but he had written his diminutive little pastoral lyrics long before that I'd say maybe 30 years, uh, before the publication of Paradise, a paradise regained.

Speaker 1:          07:52          Listen to us, uh, comas led, grow and heal pencil aroso. Those were Milton's pastoral poems. Those were the poems in which he, he's saying the happy garden, but to identify paradise lost as a, as a simple pastoral about a happy garden is obviously on some level to get it wrong. And, and I think there's everything riding on the fact that Milton has misidentified the nature of his paradise lost. And, and, and so this is going to be the working assumption of the rest of this lecture that Milton, on some level, and I know this sounds farfetched, that Milton has repressed the epic content of his epic poem. Now you'll remember that last time we saw how Satan and paradise regained, had repressed the fact that it was in fact the son of God who had brought him to the brink of destruction during the war in heaven.

Speaker 1:          08:51          He had repressed a crucial fact about that war, the most crucial fact about that more. Well, and on some level, the speaker of the poem, Milton's narrator, we can call him Milton, um, joins Satan in this act of repression. And the speaker of this poem has ref repressed the fact of the war in heaven as well. It's as if he had forgotten that paradise lost was an epic something more than a poem merely about a happy garden because in epic, um, necessarily features that the epic subject of, of war, um, paradise lost, can't be identified merely with book for the, our introduction to the garden of Eden. Needless to say, um, it's not, it's not just the paradise lost featured, uh, that lush, a extraordinarily beautiful style of poetry that Milton fields in some way, he has to resist in paradise regained. It's not just the lure of the rich classical style.

Speaker 1:          09:53          That was so tempting there. It's, it's also the fact that paradise lost represented, gave us an image of, of heroic actions and the heroic actions of its characters. It's characters actually did something, uh, uh, fact that we didn't know we were supposed to appreciate so much when we were actually reading the thing. But now that we're reading paradise regained, um, the fact that the characters actually act and do in paradise lost, um, takes on a new meaning. And the very fact of all of that action that had been represented in paradise lost has become something of a problem by the time we get to paradise regained. Now we remember that, uh, that, that when Milton in those early poems was considering his problems of, of career and a vocation, he was consistently imagining a tension between those two parables. Uh, it, the, the, those two parables in the gospel of Matthew that posed, that posed the question of action, the question of work and the parable of the talents.

Speaker 1:          10:53          This is, you know, this, this, this, this, this lecture in some way will be something like a review session for the, for the whole, for the whole semester up to this point, the parable of the talents suggested that hard work and initiative were absolutely essential for the father's approval. While the parable of the workers in the vineyard gave us a different, gave it to a different understanding, suggested in some way that the father approves of the individual who's willing merely to wait to be called to work. And the conflicting or what seemed to be the conflicting implications of those two parables were worked over and dozens of, of earlier poems and in prose treatises and their reworked here in paradise, regain again much later in Milton's career. Um, and there, there, there, there, there reworked and the three temptations that the son of God undergoes at the hand of Satan and in paradise regained.

Speaker 1:          11:48          So this for me is one of the most amazing and most surprising aspects of Satan's temptation of the son of God. In this poem in Paradise, Paradise lost. Satan had tempted eve to be disobedient. And it was clear to everyone that this was a kind of temptation to evil. But this, this is the situation in a paradise regained. This is a much more complicated poem and uh, it's infinitely more complex. The nature of these temptations of Satan in this poem is tempting the Sun not to act disobediently, but on some level actually to act virtuously or what strikes us as, as a virtuous behavior. Now the cardinal and the cardinal virtues, um, you'll remember from an earlier discussion of comas are faith, hope and charity and, and in Milton's account, and it's ingenious, I'm Satan tempts the sun with those virtues, but he does it in precisely the reverse order.

Speaker 1:          12:48          He temps to son to an act of charity and then to an act of hope and then an act of faith. Now just, just think of what Milton does to the original story in Luke. Okay. So the sun is, is hungry after 40 days fasting in the wilderness. Now in the account from the gospel of Luke, Satan responds to the sun's hunger by tempting him to turn this stone into bread. He's tempting him to provide himself with something to eat. Well. Uh, Milton, uh, it goes way beyond that and in paradise regained Satan doesn't merely tempt the son of God to eat something himself that would be far too easy for the sun to resist. He asks us under turn the stone into bread so he can perform the virtuous, that charitable act of feeding the hungry. And if feeding the poor, we're starving here.

Speaker 1:          13:45          Satan tells a disguise. Satan tells us, tells the Sun. And in a magnificent line that strikes me as as perfectly prophetic of the Vegan movement of the late 20th century, Satan says, uh, sublimely we hear live on tough roots and stubs. We hear live on tough roots and stubs. This is the kind of, I don't know if you get those emails that I get from a woman named Anastasia curly from the sustainable food project, but I think of her, um, with those updates from what's happening at the farm. Um, when I read this line, we hear live on tough brutes and Stubbs and we're asking for your help. Uh, that's, that's what Satan says. And it's this temptation, the temptation to virtuous action that the sun has to resist. It's not a simple, simple temptation to gluttony in any way as it seems to be in the Gospel. Original Satan is tempting the son what to exhibit a little humanity to, you know, just to do the right thing.

Speaker 1:          14:48          Uh, milk Milton's father John Milton senior had pressed the young Milton to s to stop reading at home and to begin doing something. Uh, he was, his father was pressuring Milton to perform. The Virtue is action of a clergyman. Um, and it was just this form of virtuous action that Milton, of course, as we remember this, was continually resisting and he insisted repeatedly that he wasn't ready yet. He wasn't ready to start acting. It's too soon. We found him a continually protesting. I'm not ripe yet. And it was at, and he was constantly explaining to that, uh, to that paternal authority that he had in some way internalized. Um, the, the, the fact of his unrighteousness. And of course it seems to be something just like the voice of Milton's father and in Milton, which is nothing less than or nothing other than Milton's own conscience that constitutes the essence of the next temptation.

Speaker 1:          15:43          And that's the attempt [inaudible] to accept the worldly kingdoms from Satan as Satan's gift. And it's the second temptation, which really takes up the bulk of the poem, um, and the Milton and takes this, this verse from the Gospel of Luke and explodes it and to hundreds and hundreds of lines. And it stretches from the middle of book, two to the middle of book for, and it's here that Milton most really most powerfully distorts his, his scriptural source. He takes, you know, what you could think of as a kind of brief, throwaway temptation from the gospel of Luke. And he expands it into a set of several sub temptations and, and they're genuine temptations. And in a lot of ways he's imported. Um, the, the, the notion of these temptations from his favorite can't to of the fairy queen, the Cave of Mammon Canto from book two. So Milton takes its cue from Spencer and transforms this tech second temptation into, into a catalog of all of those activities, all of those seemingly virtuous activities that he had himself, that he had himself devoted his life to that.

Speaker 1:          16:50          And so this massive and endlessly seemingly endlessly elaborated second temptation, weeds, something like Milton's autobiography. Um, he explores with what I take to be an almost painful precision. The central drives and the impulses of, of his very, of his very being of Satan tempts the son of God with wealth. Uh, W he tends to the son of God with, with revolutionary political commitment, with the promise of military success. He offers Jesus the entire Parthian army to help him regain the throne of David. Because of course, everybody knows Jesus will eventually regain the throne of David. Um, he sent, he tempts the sun with empire. He offers to give him a, the empire of Rome since the current Emperor Tiberius is so old and corrupt anyway. And, and he tempts him finally with all of the beauty and all of the wisdom and all of the fame associated with classical, classical Athens.

Speaker 1:          17:57          In short, um, Satan tempts the sun with just about everything that was ever important to, to two hour John Milton. And it's almost as if Milton had deliberately structured the second temptation is something like a review session for the Milton exam. You have an entire career, Neri career narrated here. So in the temptation to wealth, and I've given you a sense of the dates, but it's also on your handout. Um, and the temptation to wealth. You have the protestations of action and, and, and of merit that guilty defensiveness that you, that you saw on the lyrics of the 1630s. And in that Latin poem, I'd pop time that Milton had written to his father in the temptation to political commitment, um, or the temptation to intervene politically. Um, you have Milton's new commitment, the commitment of the 1640, the decade of his prose to apply his literary energies, uh, to, to do the goal of the puritan revolution, the desire to reform the corruption of church, Church and state, and the temptation in the temptation to Parthian military glory.

Speaker 1:          19:08          You can hear Milton's con conviction and the regicide treatises of 1649 and there abouts his conviction in the, the importance of destroying, destroying with force by actual military power, the unlawful tear, any of Charles the first. And in the temptation of the Roman Empire, you have the, the reflected the faith that Milton seemed to hold and the early 1650s, at least in the almost unlimited utopian potential of the Puritan Commonwealth, the hope, and it was, it turned out to be a crazy and perfectly irrational hope, but the hope that an empire governed by the virtuous puritan saints might actually be able to precipitate the millennium or the apocalypse at the end of time. And in the last, in the last part of Satan's second temptation, Satan's absolutely delicious and completely irresistible offer of literary fame and classical wisdom, uh, in the form of classical Athens. Uh, clearly this last addition to the separate second temptation that was the, the, is the, is the thing that persists throughout, throughout Milton's career.

Speaker 1:          20:26          It, it, it, it obviously spans his entire life. So Milton alludes to and recycles in the elaborated second temptation. All of the virtuous commitments and all of the discipline decisions that he had been making himself over the course of the last 40 years. And he presents them in. This is what's so brilliant. He presents them in the form that the hero has to resist the temptations, that the hero has to resist the voices in his head that had been, uh, that had come to him and through the, through the mechanism of conscience or God or John Milton senior or some, someone authoritative, um, all of those authoritative voices are now crystallized in the person and the shape of, of, of Satan. And Satan is tempting to son of God with a version of essentially all of the virtuous behavior that Milton's father had pressured Milton width.

Speaker 1:          21:23          Now it's usually clear that the sate, that Satanic version, and this is almost always clear that the satanic version is of the temptation is an evil or at least a questionable rendition of the virtuous action that Milton himself had over the course of those years felt obliged to perform. But it's not always perfectly clear to me as, as a, as a reader, um, why it is that all of Satan's arguments are faulty or, or why it is we have to dismiss them necessarily as, as evil. And it often seems that the son of God is rejecting modes of action and types of virtuous commitment that, that Milton himself actively embraced. And, and, and, and there's nothing which, which is just a way of saying there's, there's nothing that mill Milton is not willing to question, um, in this, in this poem. Um, he's, he's struggling to reinterpret in some way his entire career as if to purify it. Um, have anything like a self interested motive. It's as if he's systematically reviewing, scrutinizing every move, every type of action that he had been gay, engaged in over the years in order to purify his own past by differentiating it in some way from, from it's satanic double from a dark version of, uh, of, of his own virtue. Okay, let's turn to page 510 in the Hughes. This is book three, line two 24.

Speaker 1:          22:58          And this is a good example of the way in which Milton will cast as a satanic temptation, the voice of virtuous conscience that had plagued him as a younger man. So, uh, so Satan asks, if you have such hopes to be the savior of your nation, of course you do. Why don't you hurry up and act, come on, do something. Look at line two 24. Uh, why move by feet so slow to what is best? And I'll skip a couple of lines here. Perhaps they'll linguist in deep thoughts detained of the enterprise. So hazardous in high. No wonder for though in the United would have perfect cannon man be found or human nature can receive. Consider thy life have yet been private. It's a, it's a quite a jab. You're not, you're not, you're not really fit for public action at all. Consider the life have yet been private.

Speaker 1:          23:52          Most part spent at home scarce viewed the Galilean towns and, and once a year Jerusalem. Oh, I, it's saint and saying, Oh, I know why you're hesitant to act. You're too busy. Lingering in all of your deep thoughts. You've spent all of your life at home and you've never ventured out. You've never sallied forth to do something in the world. And Milton has incorporated into Satan's temptation, a piercing critique of his own tendency, that early tendency to wait to anticipate rather than to act. And Satan tempts the sun with the wisdom of John Milton's senior. Um, you're, you've spent most of your life in private, at home reading why in God's name, don't you do something? Now, let's jump ahead to the final moment of the second temptation, which is another of Milton's additions, uh, to the, to the story that has absolutely no basis in scripture whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          24:57          And, and of course its absence from Milton's biblical source should only draw our attention all the more to its importance. And this is the temptation to the intellectual fame represented by classical Athens. In book four, uh, turn to book four line two 40 Satan displays before the sun, all of the cultural wealth of ancient Athens. And at line two 40 heat, he invokes Athens, the eye of Greece, mother of Arts and eloquence. And this Athens, the mother of arts seems to possess within it all of the classical learning that Milton himself had been addicted to a as a young man, as he spent those years after college in studious retirement, as at his family's house, I looked, looked down at line two 81, uh, the Satan urges the son to read all of these great classical texts. This is just getting so close to home. A Satan says to the son, these here revolve, or as thou likes at home, it's, this is amazing.

Speaker 1:          26:11          He says, if Satan and we're imagining something like a lending library, um, and nothing could be more attempting to Milton the Sun could actually think about read and ponder these works in the privacy of his own home. This, this line here convinces me that Milton himself, uh, had an enormous book collection. The books were his, he read them at home. Um, he, after, after he was in college, um, he wasn't merely a reading them in an old woman's house or a friend's copy or, or in a, or in some version of a library. Um, Milton must have read at home till tie these here revolve. Or as they'll like stay at home till time, maturity to a kingdoms weight. These rules will render the king complete within myself much more with empire joined and, and, and, and, and this temptation to immerse himself in Pagan literature at home of course, is the temptation that in paradise or again, that has to be most difficult for Milton to imagine resisting.

Speaker 1:          27:17          Um, and, and, and, and of course it's, I think it's the most difficult temptation for us as readers to, to, to encounter. Um, it's impossible in fact, to read the son's response to Satan's temptation here without wincing, uh, without wincing at the pain that had to have accompanied Milton's writing of it. This is the son who becomes unbelievably puritanical at this point in a stereotypical sense. This is the top of page five 23 line three 22 of book for the son says to Satan, who reads incessantly and to his reading brings not a spirit and judgment equal or superior and what he brings, what need he elsewhere seek, uncertain and unsettled still remains deep versed in books and shallow and himself crude or intoxicate collecting toys and trifles for choice matters worth a sponge. A sponge is an eraser as as try collecting toys and trifles for choice matters worth a sponge as children gathering pebbles on the shore, the sun dismisses dismisses literature.

Speaker 1:          28:39          He dismisses all of secular learning as mirror toys fit for for children and you can hear them and then you can hear something like the voice of Milton's father here accusing Milton of childishness. And you can also see here the important association of literature with the domestic sphere, the space of the home, the sphere of experience that's governed not by the child's father, but by the child's mother. And it's important, I think that Athens is very carefully figured by Milton as the mother of arts because this kind of learning is presented and represented in Milton's poem is a maternal inheritance and it's just this maternal inheritance that the sun has to resist because what's his, what's his purpose here in this poem? It's perfect. Uh, s a sole obedience to the father. The Sun's rejection of classical learning really paralyzed, uh, parallels Milton's Milton's own as he writes this very poem on some level he's describing for us what he himself is doing. He's obviously resisting classical literature, at least that illusion to classical literature throughout paradise regained. Um, this poem is almost, and of course I can only say almost, it's almost scoured of, of any classical references whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          30:01          Well, the exquisitely abstemious son of God resists this most tempting of temptations just as he's resistant all the others. And you know, this is the, this is the big gun that Satan has just pulled out and Satan understandably is beside himself with frustration. Look at line three 66 top of page five, 24 Satan quite at a loss for all his darts were spent. Satan has nothing else to ask. But this astonishing question at line three 72 look at Satan's question at line three 72 what dust dow in this world, what does though in this world you have rejected every form of action and I can't imagine that you're actually willing to do anything. This is ridiculous. Can you do anything but say no? The Satan asks the Sun. But what of course Satan doesn't understand yet is that this poem isn't about action. It's not about doing, but on some important level.

Speaker 1:          31:10          It's about knowledge and particularly it's about self, self knowledge. And it's the problem of knowledge that really comes to the fore at the third and final temptation which goes like this. If you are, as you claim the real son of God, then prove it. Satan challenges the sun. And so the, the third temptation is essentially a paternity test. Um, it's a, it's a test in his faith and who his father is. And Satan's coming to the point where he has to learn once and for all exactly who this sun is. And, and it's here that Satan takes us under the top of the pinnacle, the father's house, the uh, uh, that the top of the temple to prove that he is in fact a son of God and Satan is going back. He's returning once again to that proclamation that the father had made it the baptism. This is my beloved son and he has to figure out once and for all what that meant. So look at line five 27 no, a look at page five 27. This is book four, Line Five, 15 Satan to the sun. I want to learn in what degree or meaning thou art called the Son of God, which bears no single sense. The son of God. I also am or was. And if I was, I am

Speaker 2:          32:41          okay.

Speaker 1:          32:41          Relation stands, the son of God. I also am or was. And if I was, I am relations stands the relation of past and present. The relation of, of who I was to who I am is, is finally presented here explicitly. This is the big question and it's here that the extent of what we can think of is Satan's repression, uh, becomes almost unbearable for me to witness. He, uh, Satan insists that the son of God is a term that can be used indiscriminately to describe all of God's human and, and angelic creatures. And you know, he's right. Uh, it was used pretty much indiscriminately, um, throughout a lot of, of paradise lost. And Satan is incapable here of acknowledging to himself the identity of this son of God, this opponent with that son of God, the son of God. That's so the so called only be gotten the first big gotten in heaven way back when that son of God, whose favor in the eyes of the father had of course motivated Satan's fall from heaven.

Speaker 1:          33:50          And the first place had motivated the rebellion. Satan brings the sun to the top of the temple and he asks the sun to cast himself down. And it's, it's incredible the degree to which this climactic moment in this poem reworks, that climactic moment in the other poem from the war in Heaven, in, in, in, in, in paradise lost. It's as if unconsciously Satan is trying to restage that fall from heaven. Perhaps I am some sort of fantasy way perhaps to have it have a different outcome, that terrible moment at which the sun had successfully maneuvered Satan and the other rebel angels into casting themselves down from down from heaven. Uh, it's a, it's a, it's as if this were a desperate attempt to Redo a traumatic moment. Um, in the, in the familial past. Satan tempts the son to call upon the father to lift him up. Since it is written in scripture that angels will rush to the aid of the son of the son of God. So in essence, if you are in fact the son of God prove it, call upon the father to help you. And it's at this point in Milton's text that absolutely everything that we've been discussing comes to a head. It's a remarkable convergence. Look at line five 60 on page five, 28

Speaker 1:          35:20          to whom thus Jesus also, it is written tempt the Lord thy God. He said and stood, but Satan smitten with amazement, fell.

Speaker 1:          35:39          The son of God performs no action here other than quoting a verse, a verse from the book of Deuteronomy, and then stands, or maybe actually just remains standing. He refuses to honor Satan's request. And, and he exhibits his complete and total obedience to the father by, by quoting the father's word, by quoting scripture temp, not the Lord thy God. And it's at this point, and it is not before this point, that the truth of the son's identity becomes evident to Satan, I think. Um, and I think this is also the moment at which the truth of the son's identity becomes a parent also to the sun on. On one level, Jesus is merely, merely means, don't tempt the Lord to, you know, don't tempt the Lord thy God. Don't tempt the Lord to help you if you don't really need his help, if you can do it on your own.

Speaker 1:          36:34          But at the very moment that the sun quotes the father's scripture, it's almost as if the meaning of this scriptural verse, uh, Changes, uh, before her very eyes temp, not the Lord thy God comes also to mean maybe by the time he's gotten to the God. Uh, it comes also to mean perhaps don't tempt me because I am in some way the Lord thy God. And at this, and at this very moment of absolute obedience, the sun is rewarded with the knowledge that he has, not only the savior or the Messiah, he's known that he's rewarded with the knowledge, that in some sense he is God's. He has got himself. It's an, it's an incredible moment and it's at this moment that it's, it's as if the repression, this poem's repression of Paradise lost the earlier poem has been lifted. The repression that is obscured, the identity of this son of God with that son of God, the son of God who was actually responsible for driving out Satan from heaven in the first place. The repression evaporates, and as soon as the reality of the situation asserts itself, once again, it's amazing. Satan falls headlong to his.
