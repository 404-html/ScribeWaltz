Speaker 1:          00:01          It's, it's fitting that the first poem of Milton's that we study in this class is on the morning of Christ's naitivity. And in a number of ways, it's both. It's both the first poem and it's a poem about firsts. It isn't exactly though the first poem that Milton that Milton wrote, the young Milton. As you can see from your, uh, from actually any addition, any modern edition of Milton, which arranges the poems, uh, more or less chronologically, you can tell that the young Milton had actually written quite a few things before he wrote what we call a colloquially the note the naitivity owed. But most of these early pieces are written in the, in the Latin that Milton had perfected at school. And these, these, these earliest, uh, these earliest of Milton's Latin poems are our lyrics. There are of a highly proficient technical, uh, incredibly impressive technical proficiency and they are absolutely soaked with the references to the classical writers that Milton had been ingesting from, from his earliest youth.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Milton had also written a couple of very, very short poems in English. But there's a, there's an important and I think a very real sense in which Milton wanted to make it seem as if the naitivity owed. We're the first poem that he had written. And there's also, uh, an important and I think a very real sense in which Milton wanted to make it seem. And obviously this is a much more difficult feat. Wanted to make it seem as if the naitivity road where the first poem that anyone had written now, now Milton was born in 1608. And uh, he wrote the naitivity owed along with the sixth LG, the LG OLED GSX data that we read for today in December of 16, 29, uh, a couple of weeks presumably after he turned 21, it wasn't until 1645 at the age of 36 or 37 that Milton would publish his first volume of poems, which he, which he titled Simply Poems.

Speaker 1:          02:08          And, and it wouldn't be another 22 years after that until Milton, uh, actually published paradise lost. Now I'm, I'm mentioning these dates here because the dates on which Milton wrote and published his poems, the, the temporal sequence of these, the publication, it has a p peculiar and particular importance to to Milton as early as 1629 that's that. That's the date we're in. Now, Milton is thinking of himself as a poet who has not yet published. He delays for an unusually long time, his poetic entrance into print and he's musing almost continually on on what it means to be a poet who has, who has delayed his publication to be a poet, who's, who's waiting for something to be a poet, who always looking to the future, to the poem that, that he hasn't yet written down to the future to the readers. He hasn't yet attained and maybe most gloriously to the poet who was looking to the future, to the fame that he has not yet successfully secured, were secured at all because no one at this point knows, knows John Milton when in 1645 Milton finally publishes that first volume of, of poetry.

Speaker 1:          03:22          The first poem that he places in this volume is the negativity out our poem today and s and under this title on the morning of Christ's naitivity appears, as you can see from your text appears the subtitle composed 1629 and Milton's taking pains here and he does this, he does this with very few other poems. He takes pains to let us know precisely when it is that he's written it a composed 1629 whether or not that's actually true and there's, there's some, there's some controversy about that. But nonetheless, the subtitle announces to all who know, John Milton that the poet was 21 years old at the moment of its composition and that he had therefore just reached his majority. Now, the subject matter that he's chosen for this poem for this so called first poem, couldn't possibly be more appropriate. Uh, when the, when this with this first poem treating the subject of the Nativity of Christ, Milton is able implicitly, uh, to announce something like his own naitivity as a, as a poet.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And it goes without saying that there's, there's, there's just, there's something outlandish to say the least about this. We're struck by the arrogance implicit in, in Milton's active identification here. What could possibly be more presumptuous than the Association of the beginning of one's own career, one's own literary career with, with the birth of the Christian Messiah. Um, Milton's implicit connection between his own birth as a poet and the birth of the son of God is inactive of Hubris that I think a lot of his contemporaries would feel more comfortable calling. Uh, actually calling blasphemy Milton's is, uh, John Milton. We'll remain unique in English letters for the degree of thought that he gave to the shape of his literary career or actually to the notion of a, of a, of a career at all. No English poet before Milton, I'm ever suggested that he was, that he had been chosen by God at birth to be a poet, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare.

Speaker 1:          05:35          These are all pre miltonic poets. None of these earlier figures had dared to suggest and it would never have occurred to them to suggest that there's was actually a divine vocation. It takes your, I think it takes your breath away, uh, to think of the unspeakably high hopes that John Milton had for his, for his career. If you have a chance, you might want to take a look. I think this is in the cross campus library at the Facsimile version of the, of the very first edition of Paradise lost. It's in 10 books rather than 12. Um, it's a, it's a, it's a modest thing, not the facsimile version but the actual uh, 1667 volume and that the text looks perfectly ordinary until you realize that in the margin alongside the lines of the poem are printed the line numbers for, for the poem, just like the line numbers in any modern edition of Milton that's been produced for the likes of you, for the, for the consumption of college English majors.

Speaker 1:          06:36          As far as I know, um, I, I know of no exception, although someone may well be able to produce one, no original poem in English had ever been published with the line numbers in the margin. And it's very first in its very first printing and it may well be that that no poem has ever been since Paradise lost published, uh, with line numbers in its, in its very first addition to any right thinking printer or any right thinking publisher would scarf at the presumption of a poet who had demanded such a thing. The only precedent Milton would have had even for the idea of, of line numbers, um, would, would have been the great ancient classics, the magnificent renaissance additions of homer and Virgil. Um, they would have appeared in the 17th century with line numbers because line numbers obviously facilitate the production of scholarly commentary and facilitate the study of those texts in the classroom.

Speaker 1:          07:32          And I can only assume that, that, that is precisely the point that the Milton would later in 1667, when paradise lost is published, he would make his poem canonical just like the Elliot and just like the Odyssey and the, and the Aeneid before anyone had actually read it meant Milton would cert into the printed text of his, of his poem, his own anticipation that his epic would receive the same universal approbation as homers and, and Virgil's, uh, it's, uh, it's a, it's a daring way to jumpstart one's own one's own literary celebrity. Milton Milton was continually in a state of anticipation. Um, and it's the, it's this rhetoric of anticipation, this language of looking forward that structures all of Milton's own own narratives about his own literary career. And, and, and this is a exquisitely visible to us in the Nativity out at a very early age. Milton bruited on his poetic vocation as if it were an actual calling from God.

Speaker 1:          08:39          But, but the problem of one's being called to be a great call to be a great poet is that one, one may have an inkling or some sense of a promise of a future greatness, but nothing really to show for it yet. Milton had, and he knew this, he had obviously been a successful student at the Saint Paul School in London. And, and then later in Cambridge at a later in college at Cambridge University, he had written a large handful of college exercises and assignments in Latin and he had obviously made a favorable impression on his teachers, many of whom he stayed in touch with, uh, for years, even as a young boy, Milton's Latin seems to have been impeccable and he was quickly establishing himself as one of the best Latin nests in the country. But Milton, it's calling, this is what John Milton knew his calling was to be a famous English poet, a famous English poet, writing in English, a calling that he holds despite the fact that he appears to have written next to nothing in English verse.

Speaker 1:          09:43          All Milton has at the beginning of this poetic career is the promise of greatness, the anticipation of a luminous body of, of English poetry. Now in the first original poem that Milton wrote in English titled Added Vacation Exercise, Milton and you will come to recognize this as so unbelievably miltonic. Uh, Milton doesn't write about love or about death or about any of the subjects that typically engage the youngest practitioners of poetry. Milton subject in his first English poem is a, we can guess it, it's his future literary career. You can look at page 31 in the, in the Hughes edition. So Milton begins by addressing not a fair mistress or a blooming rose, or he doesn't even begin by blooming, uh, by, by addressing God. He addresses instead the English language, hail native language. Milton begins and then he proceeds to set out in his heroic couplets of I ambig Pentameter, a map for his, for his future career as a famous poet.

Speaker 1:          10:46          Now, when Milton publishes, publishes this poem, he makes it clear that it was written at age 19. That's important to him. Milton claims that he will one day use the English language to express what he calls some graver subject, some more important subject matter, and he proceeds to characterize what that graver subject will will look like. So the, I'm looking at line 33 here, such where the deep transported mind may soar above the wheeling poles and it heaven's door look in and see each blissful deity, how, how he before the thunderous throne death lie. Now the graver subject that Milton is intending at some point to expound upon is clearly an epic one like homer and Virgil. Milton intends to soar above the wheeling poles of the visible world and just describe the otherwise invisible comings and goings of the gods. And of course since this is what he would go on to do in paradise, lost the 19 year old Milton hasn't yet imagined that his own epic would take for it subject to story, a story from the Bible, but the poetic and ambition is clearly identifiable to us as as epic in scope.

Speaker 1:          11:59          We will hear again in Milton's intention to write an epic in the, in the versified letter that he writes to his, his best friend Charles de Dadi. Um, this is the letter to [inaudible], uh, which Milton publishes as the, uh, as the sixth elegy. Uh, that's the Latin poem that was assigned for today's class. So take a look at page 52 in the Hughes. Milton Milton naturally, uh, wrote his friend letters in an impeccable Latin verse. And, and this one he seems to have composed almost immediately after having written, having completed the naitivity out the letter to Dr he gives us another glimpse of the anticipatory narrative that Milton is sketching for his career. Milton claims that that epic poetry is the highest ambition for a poet. And then again, it goes on to explain how it is that the epic poet should comport himself. Uh, I love this.

Speaker 1:          12:58          Oh, so this is, um, this is Milton to, to his best friend, but he whose imagine receiving a letter like this, but he whose theme is wars and heaven under Jupiter in his prime and Pires Heroes and chieftains half divine. I'll skip a little bit, let him live sparingly, like the same me and teacher and let herbs furnish his innocent diet and let him drink sober drafts from the pure spring. Beyond this, his youth, the youth of the future epic poet, his youth must be innocent of crime and chased his conduct irreproachable and his hands stainless. So Milton is explaining to Tarell's dod that if you're going to become an epic poet, you have to start acting like one. You have to remain celibate. And as we will see in the coming week, um, this is important to Milton. You have to remain sober and you must eat vegetarian.

Speaker 1:          14:00          Let herbs furnish his innocent diet. And then Milton that goes on to explain that this is exactly what homer did. This is how homer prepared himself to be the great, the greatest, and the first of all epic poets. Um, it's not an uninteresting, I think to note that there was absolutely, there appears to be absolutely no evidence whatsoever available to John Milton that homer was either veggie vegetarian or, or, or, or a lifelong celibate. Um, by all accounts, Milton has just, he's just made this up. Um, it has led her to dia. Dadi clearly this is something that he wants. He wants to believe or that he needs to believe, but there does seem to be evidence that at least at this early point in Milton's life, he's intending to remain sexually abstinent for forever. Um, he, he would, he would remain a virgin in order to prepare for and to maintain this incredibly important role as an epic poet.

Speaker 1:          14:58          And, and, and, and, and as I mentioned a moment ago, we will return to this question of what has been interestingly and maybe rightly called the young Milton's chastity fetish. So, so Milton applies to dod that he isn't yet up to the task of, of epic, but as he describes the naitivity Yo that he's just written, it's almost as if he considers it something of a, of a mini epic. Uh, look at, uh, this is page one 98 in the Hughes. I am singing the starry skies and the hosts that saying high in the air, that and the hosts that sing high in the air. And the gods and the gods that were suddenly destroyed in their shrines. Now there's some, we have the trappings here of, of epic Grand Juror, an epic subject matter that the poem on the morning of Christ's naitivity serves as we can think of it as Milton's preparation for something greater than itself.

Speaker 1:          15:57          It's a poem on which this very young poet is cutting his teeth. The naitivity of Christ, as you can imagine, was that was a popular subject for, um, for early 17th century poets for pious, early 17th century poets. Um, nearly all of the poets that we come now to recognize as the major religious literary figures of, uh, of the period. I'm like John Donne whom you may have read an English one 25 or raw Robert Herrick or Richard Crash. All of these poets had tried their hand at the poetic celebration of the birth of Christ. And it actually, it's instructive and you can learn a lot by, uh, comparing Milton's poem to those of so many of his contemporaries. His contemporaries are doing a kind of thing with the, their representation of the birth of Christ. That Milton seems carefully to have avoided now most, and you can actually imagine without even having read them.

Speaker 1:          16:57          Um, what a lot of these poems are like most poems, most poets who write naitivity poems are interested in the miracle of the Virgin Birth, emphasizing the Virgin Mary and the tender mother son. Relationship between, between Mary and Jesus Melton shows, uh, unusually little interest in the miraculousness of the conception or anything like the domestic details of the, of the domain of the manger scene. The focus of the naitivity owed isn't even really on the incarnation. Uh, that's the, that's the theological doctrine of, of DV divinities descent into humanity. How God becomes a mortal. What Milton is primarily interested in and his naitivity owed is the redemption, the promised of what the promise of what Christ's naitivity will do at some future 0.4. For mankind, the birth of Jesus doesn't immediately effect the redemption of fallen man. But it's the moment, and this is why it's so important to Milton this, it's the moment at which that promise is made.

Speaker 1:          17:59          The Nativity for Milton is purely an anticipatory event. It's, it's less meaningful in itself then than it is than it is for what it promises for, for the future. Because it's not going to be until after the negativity that we have the event of the crucifixion. Uh, and after that, the event of the resurrection and finally the terrible moment of the last judgment, which will bring the narrative of Christian history to its, to its ultimate close. So the, the satisfactions of the moment are for Milton deferred here, and it's this, it's something like a recognizable process of deferral and postponement that you will see beginning to form themselves at the, at the very center of Milton's poetic imagination. Okay, let's, let's look at the poem. Um, page 43 in the Hughes as, as soon as Milton describes for us the events in heaven that lead up to the naitivity, he begins the, this is the prelude of the poem.

Speaker 1:          18:57          It's broken up into two chunks, the prelude, and then what Milton calls the him. He begins to third stanza of the prelude to his poem with a plea to the heavenly news for inspiration. Uh, this is line 15 page. Uh, page 43 in the Hughes, the poet is asking for help, uh, with, with the composition of the poem, say Heavenly Muse shall not they sacred vein of four to present to the infant God. Hast thou no verse, no him or solemn strain to welcome him to this his new abode. We're, we're struck, I think, or at least I'm struck by the what I find to be the oddly negative almost scolding tone that Milton is adopting really quite inappropriately, I think, um, in this address to the muse, he seems less interested in actually praying for divine assistance then he isn't chiding the muse for not having come to his aid sooner, but we might be able to understand some of the, the weird anxious energy behind the stands.

Speaker 1:          20:01          If we think of the phrase that Milton uses here, the phrase infant God as, as someone who had, um, quickly establish himself as the most talented Latin is probably in all of England. Uh, Milton is naturally, how could he not be highly attuned to the Edom, illogical prehistory of the English word infant. And our word infancy, uh, comes from the Latin word in farms, which literally means not speaking Christ, whose, whose naitivity Milton is honoring is still just a baby. He isn't speaking at this moment yet. He isn't yet producing language. And in his role here as a, as a mute, as an infant, Christ is serving, I think as an, uh, an important function for Milton. He serves as something like a complicated double for the, for the young unpublished. And as of yet unproductive poet himself considered that even even this early on in his career, Milton is harboring epic ambitions as we've seen.

Speaker 1:          21:08          Um, he is very much an infant in 16, 29. He isn't yet able or he hasn't yet produced epic speech. And I think it's possible to see that one of the purposes of this poem is, is precisely to correct that situation. It's one of the purposes of this poem to allow Milton to grow out of his infancy to incarnate or to put actually into words the talent that he believes himself to possess. Now it's not until the fourth stanza of the prelude that we can fully understand the magnitude of the strange, the strange anxieties here, we can't know exactly and this is one of the most wonderfully unsettling things about this stanza. We can't know exactly to whom Milton is addressing this stands. It would appear that Milton has stopped addressing the Muse. They haven't my muse and that he has begun addressing himself, although that's unclear, but it may be the case that it's, it's something like a situation in which over the course of the previous stands and Milton is actually usurped the role of the Muse and has begun pro providing something like his own inspiration.

Speaker 1:          22:20          So when the forest stands that we have, we as readers have no idea where we are or when it is. The speaker of the poem imagines himself to be speaking and it's at this point that something quite strange happens. Milton tells the muse or is he telling himself, we don't know. Milton tells someone to hurry up. Think of this to hurry up with the inspiration of the Ode. Hurry up with the inspiration of the ode because Milton can see the three wise men bearing their gifts as they do to flee. Follow the star of Bethlehem to the manger. This, uh, this may seem to be a perfectly reasonable vision for a poet considering himself to be an inspired poet to have, but it, but it's, but there's something peculiar here. Milton wants to beat the three wise men to this scene. Milton wants to arrive in Bethlehem to hand Christ his poem to hand Christ his poem before the wise men are able to bring their gold and their frankincense and their Merv a look at line 22.

Speaker 1:          23:26          See how from far upon the eastern road, the star led wizards haste with odors, sweet, oh run, prevent them with thy humble load and lay it lowly at his blessing feet. Think of what this poem is now asking of us. We're being asked to accept the fiction that Milton is having very poem laid at the Blessitt feed of the infant Christ Milton, who was writing at the present moment. The present moment of December, 1629 is claiming the capacity to arrive at a moment in history that he has already described as a long completed one. Milton tells himself to run and, and, and naturally he would have to run fast indeed in order to arrive at a moment in time that had already occurred before, before he even set out this, this kind of temporal, this weird temporal disjunction is naturally an important part of the poem. And it not only gives the poem, it's, it's peculiar air of something like a conceptual timewarp, but, but it's an important part of Milton's profoundly, uh, anticipatory imagination. So Milton is struggling here to catch up with a star led wizards who as you can note, um, are already themselves hasting and he tries to prevent them with his humble load.

Speaker 1:          24:47          We'll talk about humble in a minute. Uh, um, but I, I'm interested now in the word prevent, which for me is really the central, uh, the central word of this remarkable stanza. Now, most I don't, I don't know if Mary Hughes weighs in on this or not a most editors of Milton. And tell us that the word prevent in this line retains its, its original Latin meaning as you can see on your handout, it means to come before, uh, the Latin is private era. It means to anticipate Milton wants is owed to make it to Bethlehem before the three wise men do. Now this is a form of competitiveness with which we are all familiar. This is the straightforward, ah, perfectly understandable competition to be first. Now, now it's built ins annotators who tell us that the word prevent means to come before to anticipate. And, and on some level that obviously means that and it got that goes without question.

Speaker 1:          25:42          But I think this definition is also limiting. And, and this is a phenomenon that I hope you will come to be familiar with the good scholars of Milton a reveal their typical resistance to anything even remotely interesting or alive in the text. Surely this word prevent also has, um, a little bit of its modern meaning. Um, I think it's might actually be the more obvious meaning, uh, which is to, to hinder or to preclude when Milton tells himself to prevent the starlet wizards with by humble is also saying that the wise men should be prevented from making it to the manger at all. That somehow the wise men need to be headed off, headed off at the pass and precluded from presenting any gifts to the infant God that may compete with the, with this so called humble, humble ode of John Milton. Now this is a darker, this is a darker form of competitiveness that the kind of, uh, of competitive and respond.

Speaker 1:          26:42          I don't know, think of our own environment here in the academy. Um, that spawned by courses that, that, uh, grade strictly on a curve, um, uh, a type of environment where one succeeds not merely by doing well, but by doing better than other people. Um, and especially, um, in addition by preventing other people from, from doing well, it's a, it's a, it's an extraordinarily dark way to characterize the composition and the process of the, of the poem. We have a streamed image of the composition of the poem at its at its very outset. And we have an image of someone writing as if he were participating in a race and we're reminded of the etymological root of our modern English word, a career, uh, Milton. And we'll only use the word career once in his, uh, in his poetic of, and it comes, it will come pretty soon actually in the sonnet.

Speaker 1:          27:43          Number seven, uh, the word career comes from the French. Uh, as you can see on the handout [inaudible] which means a race course and etymologically a career. What we think of as a career isn't simply the benign product of the gradual development of a certain potential. That's how we generally think of a career. It's the outcome of a race. It's that one's running faster than all of the other guys. And it's as if to have a career at all, one has no choice but to come in first. The desire to be first is, is, is really central to this poem. And it continues in this stanza have thou thee have thou the honor first the Lord to greet and join my voice on to the angel choir from out. His secret alter touched with hallowed fire as you may have guessed, because you have this on your handout.

Speaker 1:          28:38          Milton is alluding here to the old, the famous words of the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah. Isaiah in this passage is, is describing a crucial moment in his career, his career as a prophet. The moment in which his lips are cleansed and he is empowered, divinely empowered to speak prophetically. Uh, this is the, this is the Old Testament. These are the old testament lines. Then flew one of the Sarah Fims unto me. Isaiah tells us having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar. And he laid it upon my mouth and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips and nine iniquity is taken away. And I sin purged. Also, I heard the voice of the Lord saying, whom shall I send? Who will go for us? Then said, I, here am I send me.

Speaker 1:          29:36          So what are we to do with this, uh, with this illusion? What are we to make of Milton's use of this striking and painful image of prophetic preparation? Milton Milton can join his voice to the angel choir and had the honor of being first to greet the infant God, but before he can actually be made present at the actual event of the, uh, uh, the need tivity he has to endure something painful and obviously momentous from out his secret alter touched with hallowed fire. The iniquity of his lips must be burned off by alive angelic coal that the sinfulness of his lips. And we could think of it as the sinfulness of his voice, his poetic voice. We'll, we'll have to be purged. What exactly that purgation will entail and why Milton's voice needs to be, needs to be purged at all. I think these questions are really the subject of the entire rest of the poem, the him, what Milton calls the humble owed that follows.

Speaker 1:          30:38          This introduction is the poem that Milton wants to present to the Lord, but the but the him at the same time, it's something like the process, the process by which Milton is attempting to purge, cleanse his proposed etic voice and make it a voice that will actually be equal to the extraordinary ambition that Milton has for it. The him, uh, the large part of the poem can be divided roughly into three sections. First I'm in the first date stands is, um, you have Milton describing the scene of the negativity and the effect that the birth of this new infant has on the natural world. And, and I don't have time here to discuss this section right now, but you've, you've already had some encounter with the incredibly impressive level of, of, of ingenuity and grotesquery in this remarkable passage. Nature who's a personified, a feminized, a feminized, personified being is shamed and humiliated when she finds herself a naked in the, in the presence of this new, of this new God.

Speaker 1:          31:40          Jesus. The second section runs from Stan's is nine through 17, and it characterizes the song that the heavenly, the heavenly choir sings at the moment of the Nativity. But when Milton describes the song of the, uh, of, of the angelic choir, he can't, and it's amazing. It's as if the speaker can't seem to focus on the event at hand. What, what we should I think be witnessing here is the naitivity of Christ and all of the events, uh, immediately surrounding the actual birth of the infant God. But no sooner has Milton mentioned the naitivity. Then he reminds himself, and no sooner has he mentioned this, this singing of the angelic choir. Then he reminds himself of all the other times that they've song, it's something like a liner notes or a performance history of the, of the cosmos as greatest group ever. I look at line one 20.

Speaker 1:          32:35          Milton writes that this choir had been singing at the moment of creation, not bad while the creator great, his constellation set and the well balanced world on hinges hung. It's, it's almost too much for this poet. He's already been playing around with the temporality of the poem as we've seen establishing a fiction that works to, to place him at the scene of an activity that obviously occurs 1600 years and change, uh, before his own, before his own birth. But it's almost as if Milton were tempted now to make himself go even further back to write a humble load that he could place at the feet of the creator, the Creator at the moment of the actual creation of the entire universe, that the stakes of coming first seem to get, uh, are getting higher and higher. And before long, the speaker realizes that, that this fantasy and it is a fantasy that he's been engaged in is starting to sound a little.

Speaker 1:          33:35          And even to Milton, it's a stat sounding a little extreme or maybe a little dangerous. In in line one 34 Milton indicates that this holy song has enwrapped his fancy, that it has in some perilous way absorbed his imagination. For if such holy song and wrap our fancy long time, we'll run back and fetch the age of gold and speckled vanity will sicken soon and die and Lup ricin will melt from earthly mold and hell itself will pass away and leave her dollar us mansions to the piering day. The Holy Song Milton has been describing is beginning to look almost too tempting even to contemplate. There's almost a danger here and listening to it too long or describing it into in too much detail and the danger seems we're at Milton thinks of as the perils seems to involve the problem of time for if such holy song in rap our fancy long then then we'll mistakenly convinced yourselves that that time could actually run backwards and that we'd been returned to the Golden Age, the very first age of human history.

Speaker 1:          34:45          According to classical legend. We, of course know as we, as we read the prelude to this poem, that, that this is a work consumed with, with questions of temporal disjunction with that problem of temporal discontinuity. Milton clearly wants us to know that this naitivity owed was written by a young Londoner in 16, 29, but it's a poem that is at the same time deliverable to the infant Christ by some extraordinary violation, of course, of all of the established laws of temporal sequence. And when you reread this poem, um, and, uh, and you look at it, uh, in your section, perhaps you may want to think about the tenses. It sounds tedious, but, but it's, I, I'm convinced that it's not tedious. The tenses of the verbs that Milton's using. Milton is switching here from present to past to future, um, incredibly rapidly and really what the bewildering kind of facility and it's in some points impossible I think for the reader to tell whether he, the poet is discussing something that's happening now, something that's happened a long time ago or something that will happen at some, uh, at the, at the end of time that the matic problems that Milton is attempting to tackle are written into the very grammar and the syntax of the poem.

Speaker 1:          36:04          Now, Milton understands the problems besetting the poems, what we can think of, the poems, confused temporality. He understands it's a lot better than we do and there's a self consciousness about the temporal strangeness of this Poem That Leads I think, uh, to its crisis moment. Look at, look at stands a 16. This is the stance of the begins with line one 50. Milton has just been entertaining the glorious moment of the apocalypse at the end of time because he's always looking out further and further and further ahead. He's been doing that when we get this line one 50 but why is this FAPE says, no, this must not yet be. So the babe lies yet in smiling infancy that on the bitter cross must redeem our loss. So both himself and us to glorify. But why is this? Fate says no, this must not yet be.

Speaker 1:          37:05          So it's, it's, it's here that we have something like a crystallizing moment of reality testing. Milton, he checks himself reality, true intrudes, and the poet has no choice but to say, no, you've gone too far. Okay, John, you've gone too far on your anticipation of the future event. At the end of the, at the end of time, fate will permit no apocalypse before, before its time, before the necessary and painful steps that have to lead up to the, to the last judgment. But for the ecstatic fulfillment of all of Christian history, the Great Christian narrative, Jesus actually of course has to to to grow up and lead his life and then sacrifice that life on the bitter cross. In eluding to the, to the Prophet Isiah and the prelude, Milton suggested that the iniquity of his lips had to be purged, purged off a burned off with the live coal, uh, supplied by a Sarah from one of those or a Saraf, uh, one of those sins.

Speaker 1:          38:02          Uh, one of those sins I think that needs to be purged is clearly the sin of eagerness or over anticipation that the drive to move ahead of oneself and the drive to get ahead of others as we saw Milton trying to do with the three wise men. These are drives that the poem seems to be struggling to keep in check or that Milton is representing. The poem is struggling to keep in check or to purge in some way, but there's something else that needs to be purged. Uh, and the poem recognizes that even more profoundly than naitivity owed is continually presenting the speaker with temptations, with incitements to sin, that, that, that need to be purged from the speakers. Poetic Voice. The final section of the palm presents us with the most powerful temptation that John Milton, uh, can confront. And we will find that this is a problem that, uh, continues for the rest of his writing life.

Speaker 1:          38:58          Um, he will have to do battle with this sim temptation forever. And this is the temptation offered by classical literature. You remember that Milton had vowed to his friend Charles Dod and the LG six that he would, that he would become an epic poet someday, and that he was taking all of the necessary steps to transform himself into an epic poet. But it's strictly a Christian epic poem that Milton seems to imagine himself as writing. Now, he hasn't yet settled on the, on the, on the topic of the fall, the fall of Adam and eve from the, from their place of bliss and garden and the Garden of Eden. But Milton knows that the general feeling of the thing is of course going to be Christian. And he's probably taking as his model at this point, the Italian poet, a Toric Quato Taso who, who wrote Jerusalem delivered a Christian a slightly earlier Christian epic poem, Romance epic poem that Milton greatly admired.

Speaker 1:          39:55          But Milton's also sensitive to the fact that the very phrase Christian epic is in some way a contradiction in terms. The epic form is a, is a classical, it's a pagan form. It's a poem structured around the interaction between human beings and the and an entire Pantheon of pagan deities and to write any kind of epic at all might very well seem to be embracing and in an inappropriate sensual inappropriately sensual paganism at the expense of the higher discipline of monotheistic, good old fashioned monotheistic Chris Christianity and, and the Ode to the form, the form that this poem is written in [inaudible] is a pagan form invented by the Greek poet Pindar to express the sublimity of emotion arising from a contemplation of the actions of the gods. Now in writing to, in writing in these John was, Milton is, is of course confronted with a dilemma.

Speaker 1:          40:51          He's a humanist scholar. He is more steeped in the century, was beauty of classical literature, the classical tradition than probably anyone else of his generation. Since he was an unusually small lad, he had been mainlining, a Greek and Roman poetry, the the language of homer. And Virgil and if Pindar and have often had become an inextricable part of, of his literary imagination of and of his consciousness in general. But Milton was also beginning to develop in this period, uh, a much more strict to much more disciplined religious temperament. He was beginning to join ranks with those early 17th century English Protestants who imposed upon themselves rigorous and strict codes of behavior and self denial and who are increasingly being called by their enemies puritans. And it's possible that the very idea of a puritan poet presented Milton with, with what may have felt like it, like an insoluble conflict.

Speaker 1:          41:53          It, it's possible that the Milton would continue. Well, if, if Milton were to continue this cultivation of a poetic career career, he would clearly have to purge. This is, this is the miltonic logic at this stage. He would have to purge his poetic Voice of the sin and the taint of Pagan antiquity. If he was going to become a specifically Christian poet, he would have to expelled from his system. The sensual world of classical learning that for him was at the very core of his being. And it's precisely a silencing of classical literature that Milton is attempting to affect here with this scene of the flight of the Pagan Gods at the naitivity of Christ. Milton is also depicting a scenario that I think on some level he's hoping will occur within himself. We have the silencing, not just to any literature here, but, but of Pagan literature.

Speaker 1:          42:48          It's now the pagan deities who have turned into infant gods. They have been, Eh, Milton is, uh, is narrating or representing the process by which they are silenced. They're rendered speechless or dumb, and the poem, uh, effects this process in order to give someone else an opportunity to speak. Milton calls upon a whole range of, of violence, exciting, militaristic images and set pieces to describe the, the triumph of Christ over the petty gods of paganism. But this, this routing of the gods brings with it a certain cost. Something is lost here as well. Uh, look at line one 81. These are without hands down. These are the these for me, these are the best, the best lines in the poem, the lonely mountains or, and the resoundingly shore of Voice of weeping, heard and loud lament from haunted spring. And Dale edged with poplar peo, that parting genius.

Speaker 1:          43:53          It's with sighing sent with flour and in woven tresses torn the nymphs in twilight shade of Tangle thickets. Mourn. It's, it's here in this stands a field with the resounding, uh, voices of weeping and lament that we realized that something more is going on than merely a routing of the pagan gods. Something more even than Milton's pious triumph over his classical literary imagination. Uh, suddenly the literary genre that Milton writing is writing in is no longer this triumphant classical owed. You have an elegy here, a beautiful and lament for something or someone lost. And, and, and we have to ask ourselves, could this be a paradise lost? We hear a clear morning for, for those pagan beings who are forced to depart because of the violent onset of Christianity. When Milton writes that the parting genius is with signs sent, he means the genius Loci or the the local spirit of the place, the natural spirit of a place.

Speaker 1:          44:58          Those beneficence beings that pay pagans had believed inhabited certain woods and streams. But the parting genius is also a part of Milton's own genius. His, his literary genius, that aspect of his literary career and his literary expertise that has been nourished and fed, um, lovingly fed by, by classical literature. The conflictedness that Milton is encapsulating here is, uh, is probably most intense in the last lines of this, of this wonderful stanza with flour and woven tresses torn the nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets. Mourn this, and I'm almost done here. The densely tangled thicket of costs, clustered consonants in this, in this amazing couplet is a signal to us of the, of the weight of the import of this terrible event. That these are difficult lines physically to read. And they may very well be the most painful lines in the, in the entire poem.

Speaker 1:          45:57          From an emotional perspective, it's, it's one thing, uh, for the evil pagan deities like Mo lock and Payor, uh, to be forced into hell by the newly newly born Christ, uh, who are they to us? We find it difficult to be whale their absence, but the Nymphs, the Nymphs in all of their sensuous beauty with flour and woven dresses, they have to experience the same fate. And I think it's impossible not to wince when we imagine the painful tearing of the nymphs tresses. Their hair gets caught on the tangled thickets of the forest as the abandoned the cloud as they are forced to abandon the classical corners of Milton's literary imagination. That the Lhi tone of some of the, of this final section of the poem should give us some clues to the type of victory over paganism that Christ's birth is actually heralding here.

Speaker 1:          46:54          Um, how new, uh, will this new world order actually be? We may imagine that hence forth now that he has written is Nate naitivity owed. Milton has fully explored expunged from his literary system, that youthful attachment to the pagan classics. But of course, no object of our love this, this is true of all of us can ever be rejected with an absolute finality. The explosion of Paganism described in the Nativity Nativity owed is a scene that Milton we'll return to and return to again and again, and in many ways it will be Christianity's triumph over paganism and all of the pain that that triumph produces that will become the hidden subtext of, of many of Milton's greatest works.
