Speaker 1:          00:01          The best way I think to introduce the central issues of, of this wonderful poem was it us is, is to return to, to Milton's Comus. So yet, once more, and I promise this will be one of the last times that we look back at Milton's mask, but once yet, once more, let's look at a comas now. You will remember that the Mass Komas was everywhere concerned with questions of the power of will. The strangely intertwined questions of the power of chastity on the one hand in the power of poetry on the other, the two brothers in the, in the, in the mask engaged in that philosophical debate about the force or the strength of, of virginity. And the second brother you'll remember had taken what I take to be the perfectly reasonable position, the cautious position that the ladies endangers, that she's a sitting duck. In fact, out there in the dangerous forest.

Speaker 1:          00:59          And uh, it was, uh, it was, uh, according to the second brother, it's virtually impossible for a single helpless maiden to pass uninjured in this wild surrounding waste. Now, the elder brother, we remember hastily dismissed his brother's pessimism. And any insisted that the ladies virginity was fully capable of protecting her from any such physical attack. Now did the extent that this, uh, this discussion discussion is actually about the virginity of, of the younger brother and the elder brother, sister. It, it, it seems, I think to to border on the, on the ridiculous, but the debate I think we have to take seriously. It's an important one for Milton and it's important because it touches on a lot of them. Uh, more consequential questions. And I'm thinking of the general problem of, of the abstraction of virtue, the, an abstract notion of virtue and, and think of all the questions that all of us at some point or other I tend to associate with virtue is, is virtuous behavior repaid with some kind of ultimate good?

Speaker 1:          02:09          Are we rewarded for our virtue and for our virtuous deeds? Are, are we recompensed in some way for all of those sacrifices that we make in the name of virtue, these are questions that Milton will never stop asking and that he will never stop attempting to answer. And the position that Milton, this is how I like to read it, this the, the position that Milton would like to be able to take on this question of virtues. Reward is formulated by the elder brother in Comas and I'm, I'm thinking of the passage near the bottom of page 103 in the Hughes. This is comas line 588 the elder brother, so the brother says virtue may be a sailed but never hurt. Surprised by unjust force but not in throat. Yeah. Even that which mischief meant most shell in the happy trial proved most glory but evil on itself. Shell back recoil and mix no more with goodness. When it last gathered like scum and settled to itself, it shall be in eternal restless change, self fed and self consumed.

Speaker 2:          03:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:21          If this fail, the pillared firmament is rottenness and earth space built on stubble.

Speaker 2:          03:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:30          Virtue invariably protects itself. Virtue is in variably rewarded with glory and evil a, and this is the, this is the flip side of the coin. Evil is always punished. It's gathered like in this, this amazing image. It's gathered like scum in some eternal cess pool where itself fed and self consumed a problem solved. And the elder brother continues though if this fail

Speaker 2:          03:57          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:57          By which he means if virtue does not in every single instance trial a triumph over evil, then this is a world whose heaven, who's pillared firmament is rotten to the core and whose base or who's found who's very foundation is nothing but stumble. If virtue fails to triumph over evil than what, uh, then this simply isn't a war, a world worth living in. Uh, that's, that's what I take the, the, the elder brother to mean here. These are unquestionably strong words and I think it's impossible for us to over mate over estimate the weight of these words that the speech is more than just a pious bit of optimism. Like a lot of the speeches in fact that the elder brother has given us. Um, and we have to confess, I'm, it's, it's more than that. This speech is a challenge. The elder brother is challenging God to see to it that some kind of justice is actually effected on this, on this earth.

Speaker 1:          04:56          And so I'm going to be placing a particular amount of pressure on this passage because this is the first expense expression and Milton have a very particular kind of argument of a religious argument. And it, it's one that becomes central to all of paradise lost. Uh, the speech of the elder brothers is a theodicy and theodicy is the term coined by the 18th century philosopher live minutes, uh, which he had any applied this term theodicy to just that kind of philosophical sentiment that's, that's implied by its etymology that the Odyssey is an account of the justice, the decay of God a Theo or theos. And so do you use the words with which Milton would begin? Paradise lost. A theodicy is an attempt to justify the ways of God to men

Speaker 1:          05:48          know for a lot of Orthodox Christians in Milton's time. And I think we can say the same for a lot of Orthodox Christians in our own time to embark upon anything like a, at all can be considered a heretical, or at the very least Hetero docs. A theodicy can be, uh, can be seen as heretical or even blasphemous for the simple reason that it is. Think of what it is zooms. It assumes that the ways of God are in fact justifiable. A theodicy assumes that God's justice can be witnessed and that it can be accounted for here on, on earth. A theodicy assumes that the things that things on earth actually makes sense and that God's ways are ultimately rationally accessible, that they are comprehensible by human beings and that God can in some way. And this is, I think the, the central implication of the elder brother here, that God can in some way be held accountable for his actions to justify the ways of God to men is essentially to put God on trial for the actions that he performs. And in the, of course, in the central test case, this is what we all care about for the unfortunate events that befall virtuous people.

Speaker 1:          07:05          The next major poem that, that Milton Rights after comas is listed as you'll remember that, uh, Milton published comas and 1637 and uh, and it's 1637 later that same year that Milton rights listeners and enlisted as Milton looks back at the elder brothers theodicy and it's almost as if he's a attempting to test its validity. Uh, you, you can think of Milton asking in this poem, listeners asking if it's true, is it true with the elder brother said that virtue is all raise were awarded and evil punished. Now listen to us. [inaudible] this is undeniable is a stencil oddly, and maybe more than ostensibly it's an LG. It's a poem about a depth. It mourns the loss of a friend of, of, of Milton's from, from Cambridge. Uh, the young man was named Edward King and he drowned in a shipwreck and the Irish sea shortly before he took up orders as a minister for the Church of England.

Speaker 1:          08:05          And like so many, and I mentioned this before, like so many of the young men studying with Milton and Cambridge, a king was being prepared to pursue a career in the church. Now, and I don't think this is unimportant, king was also, it would seem he was also a minor poet, an amateur poet. I'm like Milton he wrote versus uh, there there's, there's nothing like a shred of evidence that to suggest that a Edward King had any talent whatsoever. Nonetheless, the fact that he attempted to be a poet, um, I think is important here. Edward King in fact seems to have been sufficiently well liked or admired that, that when news of his death hit Cambridge, a group has been as friends organize something like an anthology of poems in his honor. And this is on the handout. The, the title of the book is a juice dot Eduardo King.

Speaker 1:          08:58          Now Fraga obsequies on Edward King lost at sea or drowned. And now we have no evidence that king was a particularly close friend of Milton's. But nonetheless, Milton was as an ambitious, uh, literary figure in college. Uh, he was asked to contribute some verses to the anthology and listened to us is the product of that request. And we shouldn't be surprised that Milton has to be compelled to write this poem. He's still in that awkward phase of unreadiness and under preparation. Now, readers have always seemed to have agreed that that Melton's listened. This is an enormously admirable poem, but for a few hundred years now, there has been a controversy over how admirable Milton's listen, this is specifically as an elegy, that the poem is obviously magisterial. It's, it's, it's moving. And, uh, just about everyone concedes that at many junctures, it's a, it's, it's, it's, it's extraordinarily, uh, it's extraordinarily learned.

Speaker 1:          10:06          It's obviously learn it, but it's also very moving. This is the question now, is it properly elegiac is listed as a, an appropriate expression of grief over the death of Edward King and does it furthermore, does it console others for their grief over Edward King's death? Now this is a, this is a debate that fits into the same category as far as I'm concerned as the one between the elder and the second brother. Uh, this is, this is a debate that will forever and forever be fruitless, uh, because it's unanswerable. Um, nonetheless, I still think there's something about this controversy surrounding this poem. The poem as analogy that, that, that we need to take is instructive because if, if Milton's, listen, this isn't an expression of grief over the death of King Edward King than just what this is what we have to ask. Then just what is it an expression of?

Speaker 1:          11:07          So let us, let us begin our exam examination of this question with a, with a consideration of the poems form. Now, the most distinguishing feature of, of Milton's allergies, the fact that it's a pastoral LNG, it engages the ancient art of pastoral poetry, uh, initiated, made, made famous by the, the great Greek poet theocracy, which was later into imitated by Moscow. And then finally by the Roman poet Virgil in his celebrated pastoral EKG logs. And you can see on the handout of those poems by those classical authors that, that Milton's listened to us is, is most indebted to the pastoral. Lg is clearly one of the most stylized and most self consciously artificial of all of the poetic genres. The, the poet of a pastoral log usually represents himself as a shepherd, a shepherd mourning the death of a fellow shepherd. And he often explains that the death of these shepard friend is, is exerting a magical effect on the entire natural world.

Speaker 1:          12:12          This is called the pathetic fallacy. The trees, the rocks, the streams are all weeping for the loss of the shepherd speakers, a beloved companion. And it's at this point in the pastoral allergy, the conventional stereotypical pastoral allergy that the poet Shepard sings a mournful song. He sings this song and Itchy in which he recalls all those happy days that he had spent with his shepherd friend in the countryside. So we have, uh, we have in the pastoral LLG a generic form that's, that's highly predictable and it has not only, not only now, but I think on some level it has always struck some of its readers as, as ludicrous and, and we're not being merely churlish. I think, um, if, if we want to ask why, why someone would want to write a poem in such a form. Um, it, it, it, as you can imagine, it had long been out of fashion in Milton zone day that the pastoral genre, in fact, even for theocracies, it's inventor, uh, was always highly artificial.

Speaker 1:          13:19          A theocracy, new know more about shepherds or sheep or shepherd ases or Nymphs and seders than you are. I know. And later urban poets and [inaudible] was an urban poet. Later urban poets like Virgil or Milton Milton Hour Londoner knew even less than theocracies. We have to assume it's all, it's almost as if the entire point of a pastoral is that it is set in a world that neither the urbane poet nor the urbane reader has actually any real experience with, uh, another way into this problem. Let's look at the comments that Dr. Johnson made about Milton's listed as in the 18th century. Um, this is reading from the packet assigned for today and I'm going to ask you, uh, to do what you can to get through the biography of Milton in the packet as well as the notes on Milton's poetry that we have from Dr. Samuel Johnson. Uh, make sure you will have done that by the midterm.

Speaker 1:          14:23          Okay. Uh, famously Dr. Johnson couldn't bear this poem. Listen us. Um, Dr. Johnson, the, the, the greatest of all literary critics of the 18th century. And because Milton's poem is probably considered to be the most important leg written in any language by any poet Johnson's assessment of it has become famous, uh, for, for being one of the most wrongheaded evaluations ever made of a work of literature by a great literary critic, but inspired wrong headedness, which is what I take a, which is what I take Dr. Johnson to be guilty of, is invaluable. And so I want to quote Dr. Johnson here. And this is on the handout. Listen to us is not to be considered as the effusion of real passion for passion runs not after remote illusions and obscure opinions. Passion plucks, no berries from the myrtle and Ivy Norcos upon Erath who's and [inaudible] Nortel's of rough seders and Fonz with cloven heal where there is leisure for fiction, there is little grief, it's form the form of the pastoral.

Speaker 1:          15:35          Lg is that the form of lists of this is that of a pastoral, easy, vulgar and therefore disgusting. Now I have to say, although the last word is obviously incredibly powerful and sort of wonderful, it doesn't have quite the punch that it does. It didn't have quite the punch 'em in the 18th century that it has for us now. Disgusting really means literally for Johnson merely distasteful. It's still, these are still strong words and there has to be something more here than merely Johnson's massive blunder. As a literary critic. Johnson tells us that, listen, this is not to be considered as the fusion of real passion for passion runs not after remote illusions and obscure opinions. And it's difficult to imagine that an expression of, of genuine grief over the death of a genuinely close friend would, would take the form of a poem of a poem so learned, uh, so filled with remote literary allusions and obscure, obscure opinions.

Speaker 1:          16:35          Johnson obviously has a as a point here, but we have to remember that king himself was a poet or thought of himself as a poet. He was a poet who died before he could take up his career. And it's not unlikely that he wasn't married, that he was also a poet who died while he was still a virgin. King's death provides Milton with an occasion on which Milton is able to write the most personal poem, uh, that he has yet written and perhaps that he will ever right. He gets to ask all of those questions that are most pressing to him. John Milton. Uh, what if the virgin of Milton were to die before he was able to take up his career? What if he died before he was able to fulfill his promises? The poet before he could publish or make public his, his talent.

Speaker 1:          17:26          The very structure in fact of Milton's poem here is what Dr. Johnson would be obliged to call a remote an illusion. The poem is based most closely on Virgil's 10th o'clock. This is the poem in which the speaker grieves over a death by imagining a procession of mourners after the funeral. And this really provides the, the central rhetorical based for Milton's. Listen, US and the speaker of the poem mourns the death of the shepherd poet listed us and describes this parade, this procession of mourners who make their tribute to the deceased. So look at line. Uh, I'll just, I'll, I'll run through some of the central sections here. Um, line 76 to 84 we have the god of poetry. Fiba Sapelo himself who makes an appearance in he chides Milton for being so concerned with earthly fame. Uh, more on that later, uh, line 88, the next section Triton the herald of the sea, he tries, he tries to make sense of listed as his death.

Speaker 1:          18:28          He asked the gods what, what has happened to listen to us and, and who exactly was responsible for the sinking of, of listed as his ship at [inaudible]. Then in the next line, the next four lines, we have Caymus, uh, the god of the River Cam appears. He Rem presents Cambridge University, the Alma Mater, uh, where Edward King and John Milton had been students. And finally, uh, at line lines 108 through 131, we have Saint Peter, he of the pearly gates, Peter bursts onto the scene and we have without question, he's the most terrifying of all of the mourners and in, and he gives an angry, powerful vitriolic speech about the terrible state of England, the terrible state of the Church of England. And as a consequence of the terrible state of England in 1637. So the structure of this poem is on an unquestionably Virgilian, but the sentiments that are voiced and this poem are unquestionably miltonic and we will recognize them.

Speaker 1:          19:32          Um, who went Milton, uh, could speak the poems. Famous opening lines turned to the beginning of looseness, yet once more OEE laurels and once more you Myrtle's brown with Ivy, never see her. I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude and with forced fingers, rude, shatter your leaves before the mellowing year. Bitter Constraint and sad occasion, dear compels me to disturb your season. Do for listeners is dead, dead air. His Prime Milton is lamenting once again that Milton has been compelled to begin writing. Okay. So Edward King had died and the editor of the Edward King memorial anthology has pressed Milton and to service what, what could the young poet do? Bitter constraint and sad occasion are forcing, forcing him to write, even though of course he is not yet ready. The laurels and the hurdles that he had that he addresses. Here are of course the traditional plants classically associated with, with great poets, but for Milton and his passage. Importantly, these plants. Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:47          These plants simply aren't ripe yet. They're, their berries are still harsh and crude and they haven't yet had time to develop. And Milton is telling us that he is himself in the process still in the process of maturing. He's not yet up to the task of a great poem yet. And the only fingers with which you'll be able to hold his pen and write this poem are his forced fingers. Rude. Now you're right, you're right. If you had the feeling that, that you've heard a lot of these same ideas before Milton's, nearly 29 years old, when he writes lists at us, uh, he, he's making exactly the same disclaimer that he had made in sonnet seven, uh, or member sonnet seven. How soon halftime, the song, the Sonnet that he had written on the sad occasion of his 23rd birthday, uh, that Milton had claimed there, that he seemed to have all the outward appearances of an adult male of a man, but an inward ripeness death, much less appear.

Speaker 1:          21:48          His, his poetic talent, his poetic promise is poetic ripeness. It hasn't yet burgeoned are made itself manifest. Well, this is six years later, six years later when Milton rights solicitous. He's is he, he's employing this scene, fiction of unreadiness and with filled with all have the same anxiety of under preparedness as insulin at seven Milton rights. The first verse, paragraph of this, of this great poem. Uh, listen to us, the first 14 lines in the form of a Sonnet, essentially the form of a sonnet and, and the lines have a distinctly a sonnet rhyme scheme, but, but look closely, it's not a perfect sonnet in quite the same way that sign at number seven was a look at line number four, which is so clearly simply by looking at this, you can tell it's deficient in the number of syllables and there were only six syllables heal rather than rather than the, the, the conventional 10.

Speaker 1:          22:46          And it's this line and with forced fingers rude, it's, this is called a broken line or a half line. And this broken line has, has been, has been read, I think rightly as Milton's indication to his reader that he's not even up to the task of writing a Sonnet at this point. Anything he writes is going to be forced compelled and with his forced fingers rude. He violates the formal presiding, the metrical scheme of his leg at it's very opening, just like Edward King who died before his prime. Milton has to write this poem before his own poetic prime. And so it is with this deeply apologetic, intensely hesitant beginning the John Milton opens what many considered to be the greatest poem in the English language.

Speaker 1:          23:40          The fact that the death here enlisted us is the death of a young virgin poet at the very outset of his career, as you can imagine, resonates in a lot of powerful ways. The very idea that if figures so virtuous could have been dealt such a tragic and early death strikes, strikes Milton or Melton speaker here as the, as the rankest injustice. And it's this sense of injustice that keeps, uh, keeps pushing this log in the direction of a theodicy and attempt to justify the ways of God. Milton has to justify or at least understand this seemingly incomprehensible and unjustifiable event. And it's this drive to theodicy that accounts for the poems. Most painful moments. Look at line 15, this is where Milton asks the ocean nims, the ocean nims where they were when Edward King's boat was lost while crossing the Irish sea. Why, why didn't you do anything?

Speaker 1:          24:37          We're worrying hymns when the remorseless deep closed door, the head of your loved listen to us, if you loved listed as so much, how could you, how could you let him die? And no sooner has the, the speaker asked this question and, and, and you see this rhythm, this dynamic, uh, a peer continually throughout restlessness. He asks the question and then immediately he acknowledges the inadequacy of the question. Look at line 55. I me, I fondly dream. Had you been there for four? What could that have done? The nymphs of course are powerless and we're seeing that the Nymphs as we know, and of course as John Milton new are merely fictions. This is all made up. It's folly to think that we have about us protective spirits who might actually keep us from harm. And, and, and, and Milton continues. What could the news herself that Orpheus bore the Muse herself for her and chanting son, whom universal nature did lament when by the route that made the hideous roar, his glory visage down the stream was sent down the swift Hebrews to the lesbian shore.

Speaker 1:          25:52          Why, why after all, should we expect the Nymphs to have helped poreless at us? Not even the news. Calliope the abused at that big poetry was in a position to avert a human tragedy like this. Calliope hadn't even been able to, to save her son the poet Orpheus when the terrifying Bach I had torn his body limb from limb when the terrifying Buckeye had sent his head rolling down the heat Reese river all the way to the isle of Lesbos. If, uh, if you've read a load leg Ronelle Pencil Rosso, you, you know that the image of the great methodological poet, Orpheus is always a loaded one from Milton. This is a myth that has and will continue to haunt Milton. I'm all the way up through paradise lost. Um, let, let, let, let's have a little review of the career of the great poet Orpheus.

Speaker 1:          26:48          Um, as, as we get it certainly in a low light grow and you'll pencil Rosso. Orpheus was the poet who had attempted to bring his wife your receipt back from the underworld. And he did that by charming Pluto with his song. The attempt failed and saddened by your [inaudible] death or Orpheus spent the rest of his life avoiding the company of women. He kept himself solitary and chased. He devoted himself to poetry. He sang songs of such beauty that the entire natural world w would move and dance in response. This is the story of Orpheus that we have received up to this point in Milton's poetry. This is the story of the empowerment of the poet is his empowerment through his experience of a terrible loss. And clearly this is a myth that Milton is identifying with a very strongly here,

Speaker 1:          27:39          but the subject of, listen, this isn't about, isn't the empowerment of the poet. It's about the untimely death of a poet. And so when the figure of Orpheus appears in this poem, it's the second half of the Orpheus story that Milton is forced to tell, or if he is devotes himself to his beautiful poetry and he keeps himself sexually abstinent. He rejects all of the advances of the, of the, of the women who are attracted to him, but the Pecan contest, the the female followers of the God Bacchus or enraged by what they take to be his coyness, they drown out. Or if he has his music with the hideous roar of their housings and their screenings and they tear him limb from limb, the chaste poet

Speaker 1:          28:24          was unable to pass on injured in that wild surrounding waste. This violence was so terrible that not even his mother, the Muse calliope could save him or if you said, provided Milton with a paradigm of the poet, the poet who's disciplined, who's abstinence, nourished and strengthened his poetry and, and, or if he isn't a lot of ways seemed like the perfect model of a poet because he had the power to do something with his poetry. His verse actually had a physical impact on the world. The rocks, the woods. Uh, the trees danced in response to Orpheus is music in comas. Uh, the, the lady had identified with Orpheus that she described to comas what her speech, what her speech about virginity would do. Um, if she were actually to deliver it, if she, she would bring all of comas is magic structures down his head, down around his head. It's just this orphaned power that Milton, like the lady was, was always anticipating for himself. He's been waiting and waiting for his season, do so, so that he can ripen into a powerful or thick poet.

Speaker 1:          29:37          How then can we justify the ways of God to man? How can we justify the fact that the abstinent or fee, the virtuous Orpheus was so brutally assaulted and without it any aid from the higher powers, it would seem that the elder brother and his sister were way too optimistic in their assessment of the protected status of the virtue of the, of the virtuous poet, the protected status of the Virgin, the favored role of the, uh, of the poet. Virginity does nothing. Virtue does nothing. Poetry does nothing. All of the self discipline. And all of the self denial in the world can do nothing. This seems to be one of the implications of this poem can do nothing to protect the poet from an untimely death. It's at this moment that the poem reaches a remarkable climax and I have to say that this is actually only one of the poems. Remarkable climax is there. This, this, this, this poem has amazing ebbs and flows throughout, throughout its entirety, but without question. This is one of the intensivist personal moments in the elegy. Look at line 64 here we have Milton asking himself all of those questions, all of those vocational questions that this fact, the fact of Edward King's death seems to open up for him. Alas.

Speaker 2:          31:03          What boots it

Speaker 1:          31:05          with incessant care to tend the homely slided shepherds trained and strictly meditate. The thankless Muse were it not better done as others use to sport with Amaryllis in the shade or with the tangles of Nina Ira's hair. The the, the, I think these lines at this point, I'm going to read them again. They're too important simply to have been read once a last, what boots it with incessant care to tend the homely slided shepherds trained and strictly meditate. The thankless muse were it not butter, better done as others use to sport with Amaryllis in the shade or with the tangles of knee IRA's hair at this point in our reading of Milton, I think these lines have an amazing impact. We, we, we've spent a couple of weeks now reading Milton's declarations of the importance of the shepherds trade. This is the, the vocation of poetry in this pastoral lexicon. Nielsen's just written, uh, your, your, you remember he's written his father and odd pod trim that the trade, the vocation of poetry. It may be homely and slided in his father's eyes, but it was of course worth all of Milton's time. All of Milton's unsettlement care and investment and now Milton's in the position of asking

Speaker 1:          32:26          what for. Look, look, what's this all about? Look what happened to Edward King. What's the point of all of this study? All of this work, all of this scent, self-denial. If I could just wind up, it's a, it's a, this is a good question. If I could just wind up dead tomorrow and, and now that I'm in, now that I'm thinking of it, why deny myself sexually? Wha why deny myself physical gratification if I could just instead a sport with Amaryllis in the shade or with the tangles of knee, IRA's, hair and Milton's asking in these lines, not simply about actual erotic entanglements, but although I think that's there a relation with women, but it's a, it's a question about erotic poetry as well. Why can't he write love poetry, secular poetry instead of this much more discipline, much more difficult mode of sacred and prophetic poetry that he seems already to have weathered himself too. What's the point of making life so hard for himself?

Speaker 1:          33:27          Look, now, and this is on the, this is on the handout at the, at the letter that Milton had written to his friend Charles Dod, this letter was written at nearly the same time that Milton was writing lists at us. Um, he wrote a, and this too is in the packet. Um, he wrote, listen to your body, but in secret less dye blush. And let me talk to you grandiloquently for awhile. You ask what I am thinking, so help me God and immortality of fame and we would we read. Can you imagine getting such a letter? Uh, Milton may well blush at this extraordinary confession. He is courting poetic fame more shamelessly at this point in his career than he has before and perhaps that he will after. But, but the death of Edward King is really forcing him to question the point of, of his pursuit of, of greatness, a poetic fame.

Speaker 1:          34:23          All of his ambition and the poem continues at line 70. Fame is the spur that the clear spirit death rays that last infirmity of noble mind to scorn, delights and live laborious days. But the fair Gerden when we hope to find and think to burst out into a sudden blaze comes the blind fury with the m Horridge sheers and slits the thin spawn life. It's the, it's the pursuit of fame, the noble pursuit of fame that spurs us to scorn, delights and to live laborious days. Uh, as theme spurs us to pursue the abstinent life of the poet, it's the, it's the garden, the reward, the prize of fame that we're continually anticipating will burst out someday in the, in a sudden blaze of glory. But as soon as we hope to find that garden, the golden ring comes the blind fury with the imported sheers, ouch.

Speaker 1:          35:27          And slits the thin spawn life. The blind fury here is the mythological figure, a trope os this is the fate that cuts the slender thread by which our lives dangle and Milton Lens especial horror, I think, to this image of a blind fury. And I, I, I hope you will agree with those critics. I didn't make this up. Who find embedded in these lines something like a figurative intimation of, of castration, like the furious Buckeye, the furious eight [inaudible] emasculates the man who dares to aspire to poetic greatness with the Aborad sheers. She cruelly punishes the virgin poet for his failure to use the a and the one on the one hand to use the sexual body that God has endowed him with. Um, but you also have the image here of the poets death. You have the image of the cutting off the castration of the power of generativity, all poetic potency, all, all power to assert oneself in the world can be severed, uh, and, and, and the, and that's it.

Speaker 1:          36:36          And I don't think that the critics whose who see here an image of castration or just imagining it because there is such a weird and just such a persistent interest in the, in the human body and especially in the poet's body throughout, throughout this poem, Milton's focus on the body, on the entire realm of the corporeal. Um, I'm hoping that it feels a little strange to you. It, and it seems strange, I think when you consider what is obviously here, the Christian context, uh, of, of, of Milton Solicitous Orthodox Christianity teaches us to put aside our concerns for the body when we consider our death. The Old Testament Prophet had said, all flesh is grass and important verse for the new, uh, the new dispensation of Christianity. And the only thing that matters is the salvation of the incorporeal. Pauriol the body lists soul. But Milton is so unorthodox, or at least Hetero docs in his insistence on the importance of the, of the body. In this poem, look at the first paragraph that begins at line one 32.

Speaker 1:          37:48          This passage, uh, Milton asks the Sicilian Muse. This is the muse of pastoral poetry, asks the Muse to help him strew the flowers, um, over the hearse to strew with flowers. The casket in which listed as his body lies, that the body of listed as even in death is of an unusual interest to our poet and the speaker employees. This is an amazingly physical, and I think it's even essential language as he catalogs the flowers that he imagines we'll cover, listened to says body line one 35. You valley's low, where the mild whispers use of shades and wanton wins and gushing Brooks on is fresh lap. The Swartz star sparely looks throw hither. All your quaint enameled dies that on the green turf suck the honeyed showers.

Speaker 1:          38:54          Okay. Maybe the, maybe the elder brother and comments was wrong. The virgin his body. Can't you remember that amazing counterfactual fantasy the virgins body can't make perhaps worse. We're, we're, we're acknowledging here, can't be transmuted into spirit or soul, but we can still tend, we can nurse the dead body. We can love lovingly care for it and ornamented here and are very corporeal way on earth. It's an intensely erotic passage decorating this image of decorating king's tomb with flowers and it's at the height of this vision of our floral decoration of listed as is her birth that the speaker is suddenly caught up short.

Speaker 1:          39:37          Look, look at line one 54 w we read line one 54 and we realize we've, we have been had, we'd have just, we've been sucked in. We have just participated in one of the biggest cheats that poetry can offer. I me, the speaker cries in one 54 I me, he says as he realizes, of course there will be no flowers. There's not going to be a hearse. Why not? There's no body. There's no body to decorate. What have, what have you been thinking listed us was drowned. His remains are unrecoverable. This is a terrible moment of realization on the part of the speaker whilst the, the shores and sounding sees wash far away where I, I bones are hurled, whether it be on the stormy Hebrides where thou perhaps under the overwhelming tide visits the bottom of the monstrous world. Milton's confronting here the, the awful fact that lizard is his bones.

Speaker 1:          40:37          They, they'd been hurled to the four corners of the, of the sounding sees they could be anywhere. And as if that weren't terrible enough, a realization he goes on to vision and even more grotesque and four listed as his body. He conjures surely this is in decorous. This is, uh, this is wildly inappropriate, I think in, in such a pious poem, the in decorist image of the dead listed as under the whelming tied visiting the bottom of the monsters seats. That word visit that gets me, that gets me every time. It's so inappropriate and ghoulish I think in in this already sufficiently ghoulish context, it's, well, first of all, it's like a parody of the epic journey to the underworld that we have in so many great classical texts. And it forces us to think at least for a moment here of listed us as some ghastly underwater visitor, a skeletal monstrous version of, of Jacques Cousteau peering into the unknowable, monstrous, mysterious depths of the bottom of the world.

Speaker 1:          41:44          This intensely intimate focus on the human body is out of place and a Christian analogy and it's, and this of course Milton nose, and it's because the investment in the bodily world is, is so great here that Milton ultimately turns to the Christian vision, the more familiar Christian vision of a body Euless afterlife. And this is how this logic goes. We are all familiar with this. Our body remains to molder in the earth or welter in the ocean where air, but our incorporeal spirit rises to heaven where it can enjoy and a theorial of body lists world of eternity. And so Milton, uh, concludes listed us with this standard vision of Christian constellation. This is on some level. This is textbook Protestant or Catholic Christianity weep. No more willful shepherds weep no more for listened to. See your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watery floor, so sinks the day star in the ocean bed and yet a non repairs is drooping head.

Speaker 1:          42:53          This image of the afterlife is is founded on the Orthodox, a figure of for eternity. The body stays to the earth while the soul like the daystar rises to the sky. But when you, when you look a little more closely at this conclusion, I think you realized that Milton's heaven is almost as invested in the human body as Milton's earth had been that they haven't imagined. Here is is able actually to supply us in fact with a better body than the one we had down here. When the speaker writes that the daystar star yet a non repairs is drooping head.

Speaker 1:          43:29          We reminded of Orpheus. We have an image here of a reconstituted the repaired body of Orpheus who's gory. Severed head had been sent down the swift Hebrews to the lesbian shore. It's as if Milton can't let go of this most unchristian attachment to the human body. And I think it's fair to say that Milton can't really imagine or fully invest himself in the Christian heaven until he can fully corporealize it and imagine it modeling. And this is exactly of course what he will do in paradise. Lost everyone in Milton's haven't has a body. Even God himself, the God himself in paradise lost says nothing but body. His body is the universe itself. Listen, listen to the physicality of the rest of the description of Milton's haven't enlisted us. This is line one 72. So listen to this sunk glow, but mounted high through the deer might have him that walked the waves where other groves and other streams along with nectar pure is Uzi locks. He leaves and here's the unexpressed have nuptial song in the blessed kingdoms, meek of the joy and love their, entertain him all the saints above and solemn troops and sweet societies that sing and singing in their glory move and wipe the tears forever from his eyes.

Speaker 1:          44:57          Clearly the other groves in the other streams are, are different. Um, in, in heaven, uh, there, there, there, there are different from the groves and streams we have down here, but they don't seem necessarily to defer. I submit in their degree of physicality. Listen, this is going to shampoo his hair and heaven much as he shampooed his hair on earth except in heaven, there's always a difference. Um, it will be a nectar pure with which he leaves his Uzi locks. And even more important, uh, listed us. We'll continue to sing in heaven just as he had sung on earth, except now he can hear the unexpressed live that means inexpressible nuptial song. We, we remember this song, this is the song mentioned in revelation 14 that Milton is continually alluding to. And we saw him allude to just this passage ad pod trim. Uh, John The divine had written in revelation 14.

Speaker 1:          45:53          You know this and they sung as it were, a new song before the throne. And no man could learn that song, but the hundred and 40 and 4,000, which were redeemed from the earth, these are they, which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins and it's virgin. Who, who, who get to sing the nuptial song at the wedding of the lamb that John also envisions Milton can't allow himself to embrace the wonderful fiction that beautiful fiction that had been espoused by the elder brother. The fantasy that virgin is don't even die. That their bodies are simply reconstituted somehow as angelic spirits. That that was, that was, that went too far. It was to pagan, uh, way to unorthodox. But Milton does permit himself the closest scriptural version of that fiction. And that's John's image in revelation 14 of the special heavenly rewards for virgin poets.

Speaker 1:          46:53          Now, you also looked at for today, the Latin poem that Milton wrote not long after licit us. Um, that's the poem. Damon's epitaph, the Epitaph Iom Day Mona's written on the very sad occasion of the death of Milton's friend, best friend Charles Dia Dadi who died the next year, 1638 that you remember, this is the, this is the young fellow that Milton had confessed his, his desire for a mortal fame to look at the end of that poem. This is page one 39 in the Hughes. This is where Milton imagines you have to turn to this. He imagines dod just as he had imagined, Edward King enjoying at last, his heavenly reward. And this is the English translation because the poem is in Latin because you loved the blush of modesty and to stainless youth. And because you did not taste the delight of the marriage bed low, the rewards of virginity are reserved for you. Your glorious head shall be bound with a shining crown and with shadowing fronds of joy as poems in your hand, you enact your part eternally in the immortal marriage where song and the sound of the liar.

Speaker 1:          48:10          Can you even believe what I'm about to say? Where song in the sound of the liar are mingled and ecstasy with blessed dances and where the festal orgies range under the heavenly thesis. We, we, we know, we recognize the song. This is the, this is the song from revelation of the virgin who could learn and seeing the new song before the throne, the throne of the Lord. But Milton has obviously taken John's image here and exploded the implications of, of its erotic potential. Um, it's, it's not just that virgin virgin virgins are entitled, uh, to sing a heavenly song. As Milton is saying, Dia Dadi is the heavenly reward in this poem involves all of the sensuality, all of the central experience that was denied and repressed on earth. This, this Damon's epitaph ends with a virtual orgasm of, of Christian constellation as Milton gives his best friend the most, the most unbelievable send off that is possible to give the heaven in.

Speaker 1:          49:11          This poem is so far from being the Incor Pauriol, the spiritual heaven of a, of Orthodox Christianity, that you have an image of an actual orgy, the festal orgy raging under the thesis. That's the Phallic Wand who's holding this one? Presumably none other than the, than the orgiastic leader God himself. There's no other way to interpret these lines, which as you can imagine, critic simply, uh, pretend don't exist because who, who, who can, who can figure out what to say? Lou enlisted as Milton doesn't let him himself, thank God, go quite so far as he does in the, this amazing ending to the, to Damon's epitaph. And in fact, nowhere, nowhere else do we see Milton literally bursting out at the scenes, um, as, uh, as, as he seems to in this poem. But the, but the unmistakable physicality of the heaven imagined in the poem about Dhea. Dadi gives us some idea, I think of how to read by the end of listed as the corporeal city of Damon's epitaph illuminates.

Speaker 1:          50:14          We can see the, the unorthodox direction in which meals Milton's Melissa is tending. So let me conclude, let me conclude here. Milton has wrenched this poem away from Christianity and, and he's forced it into a direction that we could, that we could loosely call paganism. And it has been a slippage from Christian spirituality into something like a pagan naturalism. And it's a world in which all things are physical. All spirits, like the genius Loci are physical, palpable presences in the natural world that the human body, the world of flesh and blood that we all inhabit have having some way at the end of this poem reasserted themselves. And in this final assertion of the body, Milton, I think is able to recover his, his theodicy, his attempt to justify the ways of God here on earth. Milton's, Milton's listened. This is body is still in some way a physical, a physical one.

Speaker 1:          51:13          And to the extent that listed as his body has been recovered, that it's been redeemed, Milton is able, perhaps successfully, Milton is able to justify the ways of God to man. He's able to justify the ways of God to men here on the physical, on this intimately bodily earth listed as this is the last thing I will tell you, as, as, as you have no doubt experience, this is a dense and difficult poem. So please reread it, um, in numerable times for the, for the, for, for Wednesday's class. And in addition to that, do the other readings assigned. Okay.
