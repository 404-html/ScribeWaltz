Speaker 1:          00:01          Milton is typically sited by literary historians is one of the first major English poets to praise in verse, uh, the institution of marriage. And, and in this, in this respect, he seems to have followed Spencer, a Edmund Spencer who's fairy queen is in large part a tribute to the sacrament of marriage. Although interestingly, the fairy queen, uh, the Great Spencerian poem, uh, never actually manages to feature a, a marriage between two human beings, the only marriage that actually appears there as a marriage between two rivers. Uh, nonetheless, the fairy queen can be said, however, strangely, uh, that it is the first great poetic celebration and English of the institution of marriage. Uh, and this was important to Milton and one of the big set piece speeches and paradise lost you, and you may remember it if you've read that poem is the hymn that begins hail, wedded love.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And Milton is adamant throughout the epic in, in his insistent imagining Adam and eve, quite specifically as a married couple and a married couple. And this is important to Milton, a married couple with an active sex life. There are a couple who's marital blessing has been granted by none other than God himself. Now, the treatise is that Milton wrote on the rights of divorce and the 1640s are also, uh, extravagantly. Pro-Marriage. Um, a happy marriage for Milton was founded on a couple's likeminded opinions and values, their ability to converse with one another. And so this is why the notion of the divorce for reasons of in compatibility is so important to Milton because compatibility and melt marriage is, is the very essence of marriage. I can only imagine though at this point in this semester, uh, what will become Milton's eventual championing of marriage, um, is, is pretty hard to imagine a w in part because we're just devoting our second class to a literary work given almost entirely to the virtue of chastity.

Speaker 1:          02:00          And there's every indication that as I, and I mentioned this before, of course, there's every indication that Milton have a lot of these early works bespeak something like a serious interest, um, in the ideal of a lifelong state of chastity. And chastity is not only an obsessive topic in the early poems for Milton, um, or in the published a treatise that we looked at last time, the apology for smack Tim Lewis. It's also a subject, uh, in the reading that we can find in the reading journal that Melton kept for the better part of his life. So the text into which, uh, any early modern 17th century writer would jot his or her thoughts into his reading notes was always called a commonplace book. And Milton, uh, like so many of his contemporaries kept a commonplace book. And, and, and, and as you can imagine, he kept it, um, for the most part in Latin.

Speaker 1:          02:56          And actually we have Milton's commonplace book is reading notes. Um, and you can find it all in English translation and volume. One of the complete prose works of John Milton. It's a in the CCL collection. Now one of the entries in Milton's commonplace book that touches on the subject of chastity strikes me as a particularly charged one four. It's a terrifying image of, of, of violence. And I've, I've never really known what to do with this. And I think at the entry can be seen as in some way helpful for our understanding of this poem, the mask. So this is what we know. Sometime in the year 1639, Milton read a history book entitled the General General Chronicle of England, um, in which there was a discussion in, in disco, in, in a, in a, in a, in its treatise on medieval England, the discussion of a brutal Danish invasion in the ninth century of a Catholic convent in the English city of Coldingham.

Speaker 1:          03:55          It's a Milton jots down the historical deal detail from this account that seems to have caught his attention. And this is what, this is what he knows as particularly memorable. Uh, the nun abba cut off her nose and lips and urge the other sisters, the other nuns in the convent to do the same thing. So that frustrated in this way, the Danes would make no attempt against their virtue. It's the, it's the violence of this a horrible act of self sacrifice, tragic act of self sacrifice. Um, an act of self sacrifice intended obviously to preserve the state of virginity that, that, that, that grabs our attention and presumably grabbed Milton's in order to avoid the violation of their virginity at the hands of the brutal Danish Brigans at believes a conflict convent full of nuns to disfigure themselves every knows and lip. Um, as you can imagine, there's no historical evidence that anything like this took place in.

Speaker 1:          04:53          It actually seems to be something of an urban legend among, uh, among medieval writers, a recounting, uh, early, uh, early Christian convents. This same story, um, about the nuns deceleration of their nose and their lips seems to have been told about just all, um, all of the early, early Christian nunneries, uh, a strange cultural fantasy manifesting itself in some way, but, but nonetheless, Milton Milton includes this in is commonplace entry. No, no commentary, no observation, no interpretation of it. But, but, but I think we could make some estimation of its significance if we juxtapose it, uh, with comas since the mask attempts to tackle in a much more, in a much more expanded form. So many of the same issues. Comas is an elaborate meditation, not simply on chastity but, but also on the threat of rape. And, and of course as I mentioned last time, comas himself suggests nothing more than he, than wanting to get the lady to drink a sip from the Chairman Cup.

Speaker 1:          05:58          But it's clear from his language that the subtext, at least behind his, his deduction involves in some way at least an intimation of the, of the lady sexual submission, the potential danger a besetting the lady is certainly a subject of some concern for her due to full brothers. You remember they're wandering around the forest without her picking, picking berries that the younger brother, the second brother is most concerned about his sister's safety. So I want you to look at this passage. Um, this is line three 98 of comas, page 99 in the Hughes. So the, the second brother says that the, the lady is an open target out there for an assault. You may as well spread out the unsend heaps of misers treasure by an outlaws den. And tell me it is safe as bid me hope. Danger will wink on opportunity. We'll, we'll, we'll not allow itself to see opportunity and let a single helpless maiden pass uninjured in this wild surrounding waste.

Speaker 1:          07:05          So, so notice first year that the younger brother compares, uh, compares his sister, his virginity to a misers treasure. Um, and in this particularly odd image, you have something like a veiled accusation. And it's not unlike comas, his accusation that the lady is hoarding her, her God given treasurer of her chastity, and the, with, with all of the resonances that the of the parable of the talents that, that, that we see in comas, a similar language, but you also notice the sense of limitation and the vulnerability associated with the physical state of virginity here. As wonderful as the ladies chastity might be, it's certainly not going to protect her from the dangers lurking in this wild surrounding waste. And if anything, her chastity will only attract such injuries as, as we saw in the last lecture, the elder brother holds an entirely different theory of, of chastity.

Speaker 1:          07:59          And of course it's a lot more optimistic. Um, he believes that the, that a virgin, like the lady is secure or safe from the violent attacks imagined by as a younger brother. So look at line four, 23 of Comas, uh, where the elder brother explains that the chase lady can actually travel anywhere. She pleases utterly unafraid. She may trace huge forests. I mean, both. Both of these positions are voice was such a magnificently hyperbolic rhetoric. She may trace huge forests and an harbored heats, infamous hills and sandy parallettes wilds. We're through the res, the sacred rays of chastity. No savage, fierce bandit or mountain ear will dare to soil her virgin purity. He dismisses his brother's entirely practical argument because for him, chastity is a lot more than it's a simple exercise of sexual abstinence. It's a positive for us and it exerts a, an actual and somehow palpable discernible force in the world.

Speaker 1:          09:04          The sacred rays of chastity are going to be emanating from the chase to maiden and protecting our lumps like some magical force field. And actually we'll keep her safe from the physical assaults of a savage bandit or a mountaineer. Now. Now this is just a thought exercise. Um, but we're, we're the elder brother to read the general chronicle of England that Milton had read in 1639. I am assuming he would have found in coherent the, the story that had so interested in Milton that the story about St Ebo, the nun who had, um, who had, who was driven to such terrible lengths to protect herself and her fellow sisters in the nunnery from attack for the elder brother Ebis bodily purity should excel, exudes a sufficiently powerful strength that the, that the terrible Danes would be repelled by the sacred rays of her chastity. Um, so you get something like a conflict, uh, developing Milton in Milton's mask attention between the extravagant virgin virgin oil, idealism of the, of the elder brother.

Speaker 1:          10:08          And what I have to concede as the much more practical sense of virginities limitations, uh, voiced by the, by the second brother. And so Milton is actually staging a debate, but between these two positions enacted on the stage in 1634 by an a nine and nine and an 11 year old boy, I'll remind you, but the very presence, uh, but the very presence in a theatrical piece of a, of a long and weighty, a philosophical debate like this one, um, could easily be seen as having a pretty tedious effect. And, and Milton is taking a pretty great risk here. And so it's worth asking what's at stake, uh, because this is such an odd, an odd thing to find. And so I want to consider a way in which this debate between these two brothers can be seen as related to other debates. Um, other conflicts between competing aspects of, of, of Milton's own consciousness that would be one perspective and, and maybe more grandly between opposing factions in the, in the culture of, of 17th century England at large.

Speaker 1:          11:14          First though, I need to say a couple of words about the word chastity. Um, as I've been using it throughout this, throughout the discussion, so far of comas, both, both today and Monday up to this point. Um, and some of you may have felt this, I've been throwing the word chastity around a little promiscuously and, and, and throwing it around with this kind of looseness. Um, I've been reproducing what I take to be a certain sloppiness in Milton's text. Um, I, I've been speaking of chastity as if chastity and virginity, we're were absolute synonyms or are always synonyms just to, uh, uh, forever interchangeable. And this simply isn't true in the 17th century. Um, now it goes without saying that we all know what virginity is. Virginity is that bodily state that predates inactive of sexual intercourse and therefore for, at least for most of Milton's contemporaries, that is the bodily state that predates marriage.

Speaker 1:          12:20          Chastity, however, was beginning to mean something new in the period for a lot of Protestants in the early 17th century. The word chastity could also be used to refer to this state of what could be called married chastity and Mary Chaston. He was a type of bodily purity that could be extended or in spiritual purity as well that can be extended even to into marriage. This is sort of the theory. If a, if a couple of practice temperate moderate and more or less dispassionate act of sexual intercourse, they could be said to remain chaste. A married couple of course they could keep for themselves the prestigious title of chase even though they were obviously performing an act that almost anyone in an earlier period would assume disqualified them, um, from, from the, from being, from being called chaste. And so their opens up a kind of distinction between virginity, which is of course actual physical, sexual, abstinence and chastity, which for some could actually include the moderate practice of sex within, within marriage.

Speaker 1:          13:28          And it's one of the interesting and curious features of the Protestant mask comas that this is a distinction that's never really observed or, or, or acknowledged. Virginity and chastity seemed to be used often and kind of awkwardly, I think interchangeably. And the confusion between these two words, um, is closely related. I propose to the, some of the confusions and dilemmas confronted by the work as a whole. And I'll go so far as to say that some of the semantic difficulty here in the, in our understanding of the word chastity has something to do with an indisputable, indisputably awkward element of Comas, this plot. And that's the fact that for so much of this mask, the lady is stuck to receipt.

Speaker 2:          14:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:20          So I mentioned at the beginning of the lecture that Milton would go on to become the English languages premier poet of, of marriage. But it's important to note that the celebration of marriage is not at all an obvious thing for, for an English poet and Milton's time to be a attempting to, to strive toward. And in fact, it's just at this point in early modern England that that marriage is beginning to assert itself as a, as a cultural ideal,

Speaker 2:          14:48          uh,

Speaker 1:          14:49          uh, religiously inflected cultural ideal through it throughout their renaissance, uh, throughout the 16th century. The popular ideas about marriage and celibacy, we're still firmly tied to the values of the Roman Catholic Church. Uh, well after the actual reformation, the Roman doctrine of course had prized the state of Celibacy, um, insisting that it was the superior state, um, over marriage. Now, it's true that, and this has always been the case, that a proper marriage was obviously always one of the churches, sacraments and marriage obviously had always received the church's blessing. But nonetheless, the higher ideal was still seem to be celibacy. And it was, it was the ideal, uh, embraced by priests and nuns. And it was the ideal to which all Christians theoretically, at least should shouldn't. We're in a position to, to aspire to it. It's in the period that, that Milton is writing in a, it's in the period in which Milton has writing that the, that, that the tide is beginning to turn.

Speaker 1:          15:48          And so the Protestant reformation and especially, uh, the, the risings energies of puritanism in the early 17th century are beginning to do a lot to change this state of affairs. And so over the course of the century, you can see a gradual as if something like this could actually be charted. Nonetheless, I think it's safe to say you see a gradual decline in the cultural idealization of virginity and a corresponding increase in the valuation of marriage and this new form of chastity that we can think of as married chastity. Um, it's a transition in the valuation of, uh, of, of marriage that is not at all an easy one. However, um, there, there are debates, there are disagreements even among puritans about which state, virginity or married chastity is the superior one, um, in the eyes of God. And it's an in, in light of this ongoing cultural tension in the period, um, that I think we can understand some of the strange confusions concerning chastity that we, that we find in, in the, in the, in the poem that we're looking at now, one of the moments in which the, this tension between virginity and chastity seems to be most pronounced is in the encounter between Columbus and the lady that we looked at in the last class.

Speaker 1:          17:08          A comas attempts to seduce the lady you'll remember with, with something like an economic theory of, of natural beauty for comas. Nature has given us all of her riches and it's our duty. It's our obligation to spend them, to consume them, to consume the, to Lug luxuriate in natures, uh, generosity. You can think of this and this has actually been described, uh, by, by critics as something like an aristocratic theory of natural expenditure because comas imagines in this fantasy rhetorical world of his, something like an almost endless supply of natural wealth, um, nature's wealth can continually and forever be spent and expended. Now, the lady responds to coma, says what we can think of is his aristocratic debauchery with an economic theory of our own. And we haven't looked at that yet. So this is line seven 68 of comas. And in the Hughes Edition, it's on page 108.

Speaker 1:          18:10          This is the ladies a retort. She explains that nature of course, wants us to live according to her sober laws and holy dictate of spare temperance. And in this description of the moderate and temperate enjoyment of nature, the ladies giving us something like a, uh, a puritan economic theory. And so this is her argument line seven 68 if every just man that now pines with want headbutt a moderate and besieging share of that which lucidly pump pampered luxury. Now, heaps upon some few with vast access. Nature's full blessings would be well dispensed in unsuppressed Louis even proportion. It's, I think it's sometimes hard to remember in reading his speech like this, that the ladies actually talking about Justin, he, her argument sounds, and some of you may recognize this argument. It sounds so distinctly like a political argument and argument from political economy. And it actually, it's been shown, um, seems to foreshadow the, uh, the political philosophy of, of Milton's much younger contemporary John Locke.

Speaker 1:          19:19          Uh, the, the notion that nature demands that every human individual, uh, has just enough is given just enough to be self sufficient. But when you remember that the subject at hand is actually in some way sex, then you can begin to associate the lady's image of this moderate consumption of natural wealth with some version of, if this makes sense, some version of an act of sexual consummation. The ladies called call for, uh, a tempered, a moderate distribution and con consumption of natural goods seems to point us towards something like a particular attitude toward sex. And this [inaudible], this is sex she's seeming to refer to it. It's clearly not virginity that's at stake. And this isn't sexual abstinence that the lady's pointing to a with revision of the moderate and temperate enjoyment of nature's beauty. The lady is sketching this new 17th century ideal of, of, of married chastity, the ideal of the temperate, moderate indulgence in sexual pleasure, pleasure of course, within the sanctified confines of marriage.

Speaker 1:          20:30          And, and, and this makes sense. We have to assume that the lady is resisting comas, his advances because she has before her the higher ideal of married chastity. One day she will become a wife herself and it's, it's in her husband that she will eventually invest the talent of her bodily wealth. To use the metaphor that we get from Matthew 25, it's a perfectly reasonable sentiment to include an an example of the particular genre that Milton is writing. This mask in the form of this mask is that of the romance. It's a literary genre that, that that dates back to classical Greece, late classical Greece, and which typically charged the trials and tribulations of a hero in many cases, the trials and tribulations of a virginal heroin. The romance heroin is often threatened with rape, um, but by her cleverness or by good luck or concatenation of forces, um, she can always invariably avert that tragedy.

Speaker 1:          21:30          And by the end of the work, she can present herself to her future husband as, as a virgin. And, and, and this, this last twist is without question the central element of the convention, the Conventional Romance Plot. And this remains a central element in the Harlequin Romances for example, that are, that are still I think consumed. Um, so voraciously, even today after her brush with danger after her brush with sexual peril, the romance heroin always gets married in the end, the story has to end that way. And her marriage is invariably seen as her reward for all the trouble she's been through. Now, given this the romance frame of Milton's comas where we're not surprised actually to see, even though we don't see at the end her actually getting married, we're not surprised to see the lady in this speech embracing a form of chastity, that that promise is something like an eventual turn to marriage.

Speaker 1:          22:23          This makes sense. And it's with this hint at the state of marriage, chastity, you know, kind of this, it seems like a healthy perspective. Um, it's, it's with this hint that the lady ended her speech at the only 17th century performance in comas, which as you know, took place at Ludlow Castle in 1634 on McComas night at this original performance of the mask, the lady speech read by the Lady Alice Edgerton, age 15, um, ended at line seven 79 in, in, in your text. And, and I think after hearing the lady enter speech at nine, seven 79 that the audience could reasonably expect that the lady would someday get married. But yeah, you can see from the text that you have in your hues, additions or any addition. Um, and he printed edition. Now the speech continues in the version of the mask that, that we, that we have while Milton wrote most of the mask in 1634 he published it in 1637 and it's at this 0.3 years later that he seems to have inserted into the lady's speech and also elsewhere in the poem, um, for, for this certain lines, for the published version. So the lady's speech and the printed version continues at line seven 79 and this is what the lady asks, how can you not love this? Shall I go on or have I said enough?

Speaker 1:          23:50          Clearly Milton is instead of the way a wonderfully speaking through the lady here, but then we get the lady again, shall I go on or have I said enough to him that dares arm his profane tongue with contemptuous words against the sun cloud power of chastity thing. Would I something say yet to what end thou has nor ear nor soul to apprehend the sub sublime notion and high mystery that must be uttered to unfold the sage and serious doctrine of virginity. She's speaking reluctantly here. She'd love to tell calmness something about chastity, but he has, he has neither ear nor soul to apprehending the sublime notion and high mystery.

Speaker 2:          24:32          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:34          The speeches as proceeding rather smoothly. And I think kind of Vic's explicably as the lady defense, The sun cloud power of chastity. Uh, but, but look at the end of the passage that I've just read a few lines down.

Speaker 1:          24:47          The doctrine that the lady wishes to advance suddenly seems so absolutely not to be a doctrine of Mary chastity. It's the, it's the sage and serious doctrine. The virginity that concludes the speech. It's clear that something's happened between 1634 and 1637. Uh, Milton's lady doesn't proceed as we expect her to talk to Marshall for their arguments for the, for the moderate fulfillment of one's conjugal obligations. Uh, there, there's no more talk of temperate sex or the virtuous and moderate, the virtuous moderation that's so important to the ideal of Mary chastity. And The lady begins to speak instead of the unyielding virtue of sexual abstinence. That's absolutely central to an entirely different kind of doctrine. The doctrine of, of, of virginity. So we have to ask this question. What's happened? The lady has claimed that she's hesitant to say anything at this point. Tacoma's how could such a double edged character possibly understand the mysterious truths about chastity? She re interestingly, she refuses to unfold for her audience. The Sagent serious doctrine of divinity.

Speaker 2:          25:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:59          Of Virginity. Um, but she does anticipate what that doctrine of virginity would look like if she were to unfold it. She explains to comas what would happen should she actually choose to break her silence, should she actually choose to unleash all of the rhetorical powers that she has pent up inside of her? And, and, and in some important way, I think the lady can be seen as being in the same position that Milton had been, had been representing himself in. And so many of the early poems, he was continually imagining himself to be someone on the verge of saying something spectacular, but he wasn't. He wasn't quite there yet. But the lady continues. Look at line seven 92. Thou art not fit to hear thy self convinced yet. Should I try and she means shit. Should I try voice the doctrine of virginity, the uncontrolled worth of this pure cause would kindle my rap spirits to such a flame of sacred vehemence that dumb things would be moved to sympathize and their brut earth would lend her nerves and shake till all by magic structures weird so high were shattered into heaps or thy false head.

Speaker 1:          27:10          She's making us a strong acclaim as, as possible to make for the, for the, for, for her potential for rhetorical power. She implies that she's the equal, uh, to any of the great poetic heroes that Milton so admires as a virginal order. Should she choose to unleash your powers. Um, she would have the power of an Orpheus. I'm moving dumb things to sympathize Orpheus being one of Milton's most prized mythological figures of the, of the powerful poet. She'd have the strength of a Samson, the biblical hero who could shatter huge structures over the heads of his enemies. She has way more power than she needs. It would seem to destroy a petty little may just like comas. The power that the lady claims for herself as a virgin is, is, is, is titanic. And it allows us to understand, I think, why she has slipped from her discussion of, of married Chassidy to this new discussion of what seems to be, or what she claims is virginity it the lapse makes a certain kind of sense.

Speaker 1:          28:16          I think because it's virginity and it's, and not married chastity, that the lady imagines will allow her to demonstrate such a remarkable show of, of rhetorical strength. It's, it's, it's almost apocalyptic in, in its force. Um, it, it promises something like the power of God is he brings the, the, the, the, the shattering close of the entire Christian narrative, uh, t to an end at the, at the last judgment and beyond. Um, and, and, and one of the, one of the cultural phenomena fueling, I think this rhetorical bursts of the ladies is the prevalence 17th century, um, anticipation of the end of the world, the millennium, the, the, the, all of these, uh, uh, apocalyptic, uh, beliefs that were swirling around almost all of the, a sectarian, a sectarian religious figures in the 17th century. So, given all of these cultural resonances, there's a lot riding on the lady's claim for her rhetorical powers here.

Speaker 1:          29:21          And, and you can understand that initial hesitation when she asks, shall I go on or have I said enough? She's probably said way more than enough. Uh, uh, in her testimony to the potentially apocalyptic power of her virginal speech. She, she's, she's making extraordinary claims for virgin and oratory. And it has all of the power of, of prophecy that Milton had had been associating with a biblical prophets. But, but as, as I've mentioned before, she doesn't deliver this anticipated speech. And so virginities power remains untested. W We, we can't know just what force virginity would exude. And, and so the speech leaves us where we begin, um, in a state of uncertainty concerning the ultimate strength of this virtue of, of, of sexual abstinence. It leaves this where we began asking what finally, what is virginity good for? We're reproducing a, the problem that the, that the, that the two brothers were rehearsing in their debate.

Speaker 1:          30:26          So the lady in the 1637 vision version of this poem of this mask is at an impasse. She stuck between a competing ideals of bodily purity, uh, just as just as surely and as firmly as she is stuck to her seat. And, uh, this is a, this is a kind of a literary metal literary allegories ation that I'll be performing here. But you could also think of Milton, the poet as being stuck at this. At this same juncture, he stuck between two meanings of chastity. Chastity has absolute virginity and chastity as the moderate and besieging sexuality sanction within marriage. And he's also stuck between two models of speech with which we have become quite familiar by this point. On the one hand, he's, he wants to wait before he talks. He wants to keep anticipating producing the great speech, uh, which is exactly what the lady has been doing. But on the other hand, Milton's possessed of a competing desire to speak and to speak now to publish, uh, to succeed, to consummate his hat, his talents. And it's as if Milton were paralyzed almost at this moment in his choice, uh, between these various alternatives.

Speaker 1:          31:45          Now we know that the lady doesn't end the masks happily us imagine how, but it would be like if this were the case, she doesn't end the mask stuck Tacoma's chair. And it's important to figure out exactly how the lady gets unstuck. And so that's what we're going to look at. Now. This is the [inaudible]. Remember there's first the bungled attempt by the two brothers to release her. Um, they forget to reverse. Comas is won when they rushed into, when they rushed him to his layer. That didn't pan out. Um, they had even obtained with the help of the attendance spirit, the magical herbs, Haman knee with all of its Homeric associations. But this too seemed inadequate to the task of rescuing their sister. The lady is only rescued once the attendant spirit calls on the Nymph. Sabrina the genius Loci, the natural spirit of the Severn stream, that which is the river that separates England from Wales and Milton uses for his source, for the character.

Speaker 1:          32:44          Sabrina, um, another character named Sabrina from Spencer's the fairy queen. There's a wonderful work of literary criticism. I mentioned it last time, um, on Milton's indebtedness to Spencer, um, in the book by John Guillory called Poetic Authority. I urge you to look at it if you're interested in, um, the, the fact that Sabrina, this little character here has her origin and Spencer's important. Uh, Spencer's, the great early Christian Poet in English of Holy Matrimony. Um, and, uh, according to Gillery is brilliant argument. Um, he has the power to counteract. Spencer does the magical effect that Shakespeare wields through the character of comas. The lady had claimed for herself a remarkable set of powers, but she wasn't yet ready to use them. She was paralyzed in speech just as just as she was prevented from even moving. And it was almost as if a sobrinas a sent from the Severn stream to assist the lady in her time of need suggests Spencer's arrival from the realm of English literature to assist the young poet John Milton, Edmund Spenser arrives, arises to help Milton overcome the paralyzing effect of the comas like power of Shakespeare.

Speaker 1:          34:05          Uh, let's see if this makes any sense. Uh, look at line eight 52 of comas. This is page 110 in the Hughes. The attendant experience, the attendant spirit explains that sobrinas in, in possession of precious vialed liquors that have the capacity to heal. So at line eight 52 up, Sabrina can unlock the clasping charm and thaw the numbing spell if she be right invoked and warbled song for maidenhood she loves and will be swift to aid a virgin such as was herself in hard besetting need this. Will I try and add the power of some ad during verse? The power reverse has everything to do with the power wielded by Sabrina to save the lady from, from her paralysis. If if right invoked in warbled song, Sabrina can actually be called down for assistance. Um, and, and it's just this or called up for assistance and it's just this interest in the right, the proper form of warbled song that's so important here.

Speaker 1:          35:08          She resists represents a power that might enable Milton to warble a right or proper song. She represents a power that might enable Milton. Perhaps someday. Actually to fulfill, to consummate his, his much anticipated poetic promise. But how does she do that? Look at line 910. This is page 111 in the Hughes. Sabrina says to the lady, she rises from the water, Brightest Lady, look on me. Thus I sprinkle on my breasts, drops that from my fountain pure. I have kept of precious cure thrice upon my fingers. Tip Thrice upon the ruby lip. Next, this marble marble venom seat smeared with gums, have glutenous heat. I touch with chased palms moist and cold. Now, if this is a, this is a, if this is a scene as it's been argued of, of Sabrina's baptism of the lady, it's a, it's a curious baptism. Indeed, we might think that the, that sobrinas chased palms moist and cold would only make more frigid and more frozen, uh, the the body of the lady.

Speaker 1:          36:21          But in fact, it's just the opposite that happens. Um, I think of the delicate, really beautiful sensuality here and sobrinas speech. I don't think we were expecting this. Uh, she evokes the beauty of the ladies Ruby Blip. How inappropriate the eroticization of the ladies beauty has up to this point come exclusively from comas. And in and in touching the lady's fingers tip. It's as if Sabrina were awakening the first time, the lady sense of, of, of touch. Now the lady we know has an exquisite and powerful sense of hearing. Uh, she's a poet and she has an impeccable ear, but this fiercely virginal lady has not up to up to this point, even begun to develop her other sensory realms. And when Sabrina touches the surprisingly sensual ruby lip of the lady, she's an essence baptizing, I think in sanctioning the erotic drives that the lady has been so fiercely repressing.

Speaker 1:          37:22          She baptizes the entire domain of non auditory sensual experience that the lady so forcefully avoids. And you can think of Sabrina as she touches so gently. The lady, this is the, this is to use the, uh, the wonderful phrase that John Guillory used actually in this very room when I was a, when I took the Milton mature as an undergraduate. That's what Sabrina is doing is, uh, and this dates John Gallery. This is a very seventies phrase, but Sabrina is activating the lady's erogenous zones and there's something, there's, there's, there's something to that with, with this magical touching of the lady with their precious liquor. Sabrina's saves the lady from her paralysis and, and Milton stage directions. Just say at all. It's very simple. Uh, uh, the lady just rises out of her seat. I don't want to suggest that the, that sobrinas work is purely erotic hair.

Speaker 1:          38:18          There's a lot more than sex implied in this redemptive touching and touching the ladies ruby lip. She's also, I think releasing the ladies hesitation to speak after after comas is masterful seduction replete with all of its illusions to the, to the, uh, the parable of the talents from Matthew 25. The lady you'll remember had been so hesitant to speak. I had not thought to have unlocked my lips in this unhallowed air and when she does unlock our lips ever so slightly when she doesn't lock our lips, uh, she does do only to anticipate the effect that our speeches would have if she were to unlock them even more. Um, everything is entirely conditional and future oriented. Sobrinas touching of the ladies lip, uh, seems to unlock perhaps permanently the rhetorical hesitation that has paralyzed, uh, the lady and the lady is, is, is liberated. Uh, of course we have no evidence of the ladies rhetorical liberation.

Speaker 1:          39:24          There's no, there's no further speech on her part. Um, but it's an important action. I think nonetheless, the touching of the ladies rip, the touching of the ladies lip touches us in, in, in other ways as well though, at least in this lecture because we remember that, uh, that unfortunate, that horrifying image of, of the lip that Milton had noted in the commonplace book, St Abba Abba had not only severed her nose, she had also severed her lip. And I think it's worth thinking about, at least for a moment, um, of the oddity of this terrible act of self mutilation, the Superflow, his action suggest that there was something more at stake perhaps than C [inaudible] attempt to ward off sexual assault to disfigure the mouth.

Speaker 1:          40:15          This is how I would interpret it to disfigure. The mouth has a primary effect in rendering one, at least temporarily speechless. And I think there's a connection here between the image from the commonplace book and the treatment in Milton's mask of this strange strangely can join phenomenon of virginity and speechlessness and the little scene from the early English history that Milton had selected from his reading. You have an image of silencing of a, of a, of a horrifying and unredeemable speechlessness that is so closely connected to virginity. And it would seem to be the terrible thing of, of Saint [inaudible] to die, both speechless and virginal that Milton is struggling to avoid here. So yeah, Columbus is a celebration of virginity and it might even be a celebration of Milton's endlessly anticipatory mood, the mood of, of imaging himself as a, as, as a great poet.

Speaker 1:          41:13          But th but these virtues, however great I think are also associated in the mask with the ladies Petro faction, her, her fixation on the seat that Comis has has fashioned for her. And it's one of the duties of the masks plot, uh, to get the lady out of her seat. And you, and you can see in the song that the Sabrina's sings something of the mechanism perhaps by which this transition is, is affected. Uh, look at line eight 97. We're almost done here. Sabrina rises from the water and appears gradually on the land making a transition a lot like the one the lady will eventually have to make. She sings sobrinas sings whilst from off the water's fleet. Thus I set my print lists feet or the cows slips, velvet head that Ben's not as I trend now, her feet are of course print lists because she's Arie and a theorial and she leaves no tread on the cowl slips or the flowers.

Speaker 1:          42:12          But this is an odd phrase. You'll concede parentless feet and, and it's odd. This is important. Feed of course, has a lot of meanings and Milton's poetic feet. The material of the verse written in, in six and eight and 10 syllables in this poem, um, are also in 1634 print lists there. They're unpublished. And when comas is first perform per first perform, Milton's poetry hasn't yet been printed. Um, but it's almost as if Sabrina, um, seems to have died print lists or unpublished so that Milton wouldn't have to, um, it's a sacrifice on, on, on our poet's behalf. That would be one, uh, literarily allegorical way to think of it. Now, as I noted earlier, there's a difference between the two existing texts of Milton's comas. There's the performance version of 1634 and the printed version of 37. And, and the additions to the texts that Milton is making for the published version, uh, reflect, I think he's since that he liked the lady is in process, in the process of making an important transition.

Speaker 1:          43:17          He is no longer or no longer wants to be an infants. I'm a poetic virgin, a speechless poet. There's also another, another transition that he's making. Um, and this, this involves the subject of virginity not as speechlessness, but his actual abstinence. The, the final. Um, and I'll just, uh, I'll just point you quickly to this passage. Look at line 1003. It's on page 113 in the Hughes. After we have the lady wandering through the forest, she joins her father with her brothers and we get this, but far above in spangled sheen celestial cupid, her fame son advanced holds his dear psyche, Sweden tranced after her wandering Labor's long till free consent, the gods among make her his eternal bride. Uh, you can see an image here of cupids eventual marriage to psyche as a pointed reference to the, the, the likelihood that the lady to will will become someone's eternal Brian.

Speaker 1:          44:23          Um, in 1634 in the first version, we didn't have this anticipation of, of the ladies for future marriage. This, this didn't exist. The lily remained much more fixed in her idealization of virginity and a lot more silent in her responses to comas. But it's almost as if the prospect of publishing this mask seems to have induced in Milton and interest in trying to move beyond the idealization of virginity, um, beyond simply the anticipation of future power. Um, and you're, you're getting to see something like an intimation of John Milton, the published poet, a poet whose energies are going to be directed toward making his poems public. The poet of anticipation is beginning to think of himself as the poet of achievement. And the poet of the radical power of virginity is beginning to redirect a lot of his interests to the radical pair, the radical power of married sexuality.

Speaker 1:          45:26          Now, it won't be another four or five years after the publication of, of calmness that Milton will himself actually be married. But the transition from virginity to marry chastity charted in this poem that we'd been looking at nonetheless reflects a marked interest in the nature, not only of Milton's personal life, but in the nature of his literary interests. He's beginning to put aside all of those literary anxieties induced by his reading of Shakespeare. And it's as if he's more and more willing to use as a kind of literary assistant or Helper Spencer, the great, the Great Poet of Holy Matrimony and married sexual bliss. And in the works that Milton is going to be publishing now with greater and greater frequency. It's this Spin Siri and ideal of marriage that will be the new, and believe me, that endlessly complex miltonic subject now for, um, for, for next time we'll be reading lists at us, uh, which is about the death of a friend and a death of a friend. In fact, two died a virgin. We have to assume, um, it's not about marriage and it will, a marriage will still seem quite a quite a ways off. I fear when you read, listen to us. Um, but we will be marking the transition to the poetry of marriage soon enough. Listen, this is probably the most difficult poem linguistically that we'll be reading all semester. Um, it repays in numerable readings and re readings. So I urge you to read it a 75 times, let's say, before you come to class on Monday. Thank you.
