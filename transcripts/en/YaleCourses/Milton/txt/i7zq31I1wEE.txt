Speaker 1:          00:01          We looked, we looked last time at Saint Peter's declamatory speech in enlisted us, and we spent a lot of time on it and we looked at its relation to the new career. The John Milton, uh, ended up assuming in the late teen 16 in the late 1630s, the, this new career as a polemical, a writer of political pros and Milton becomes increasingly in this period. And this is the period of the, of the, of the English revolution. It's what is the English revolution you ask? Uh, whether that's a good question. And there they're still, um, in numerable, uh, often competing answers to that question, but it seems to be more or less, this is one way of framing, framing an answer. It seems more or less to be a puritan revolution. Middleclass puritans like John Milton, um, find themselves upholding the authority of Parliament over the authority of King Charles and over the authority of the official Church of England.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Um, that's the, the roughest possible sketch of what the English revolution is. Um, we find ourselves in today's reading area. Politica in the middle of the English revolution, sometimes called the puritan revolution. It's in this period that Milton increasingly begins to adopt or assume Saint Peter's a confident and denunciatory rhetoric. Um, he adopts it as his own. Milton does, and he writes a series of treatises and supportive, uh, and this is a really, really out there and he alienates a lot of his natural organic base with these actions. But Milton writes a series of treatises in support of the right to divorce a divorce for reasons of in compatibility. And he continues to assist. The Puritan left the progressive movement in overthrowing the hierarchical structure of the, of the Church of England. The bishops, uh, also called the prelates. Those church officials essentially appointed by Archbishop William Lord, who we looked at last time, were replaced in the early 1640s by means that the success of the Puritan revolutionaries were replaced by Presbyterians ministers who were chosen by individual congregations.

Speaker 1:          02:19          And Milton was able to think of this new form of church government as the most reasonable form of church government because it seemed to be the product of, of individual choices. It seemed to be the product of individual decisions made by the rational church going English public. So by the time we get to 1644, this is the year that area politica appears, um, we're well into the English revolution. And this is the, this is the year in which we have two dominant groups in the new revolutionary parliament. Um, the, that you have the conservative Anglican royalists, they've already been ousted. They're not, they're no longer a central component of the political scene. So you have left the Presbyterians and the independence. And at this point, the Presbyterians are in firm control. Now, as with most most political groups who suddenly find themselves. And this is just an ancient piece of wisdom that I'm sharing with you, but it's something obviously that you will have heard before.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Um, as with most political groups who suddenly find themselves in possession of a, of a measure of power, the ideas and values of the Presbyterians and who had of course started out as radicals. Um, we're beginning to harden into something like a new orthodoxy. Um, with this new aggregation of political power, they began laboring to suppress and laboring to stamp out of forces that forces that oppose them, whether those forces were on the right or on the left. [inaudible]. Now, of course the presbyters had seized control in the first place because they disapproved of the tactics of suppression and intervention that had been in that had been deployed by the bishops or the, or the prelates of the old church. But, but the new, but the new Presbyterian party soon developed its own methods of employing state power to control and regulate the church. And this is just a general historical irony that surely at some point, um, besets all revolutionary movements.

Speaker 1:          04:22          And it's an irony that particularly appalled John Melton, and it's in recognition of what we can think of is this time honored historical irony that that Milton rights, that such a, such a memorable line, a wonderful line in his sonnet on the new Presbyterian regime. Um, that's the, it's the, it's the poem, uh, of the force of the new foresters of conscience, uh, which ends with that line. You'll remember new presbyters are, but old priests writ large. The new pres bitters are, but old priests writ large. The, the, the revolution has essentially become a revolution in name only priests. These are the bishops of the old system have changed their name to presbyters perhaps, and they look like revolutionaries, but their manipulative controlling actions haven't, haven't essentially changed at all. And for the Presbyterian Party in 1644, it turns out there are in fact a number of factions, uh, to control and to manipulate and to regulate.

Speaker 1:          05:29          The new Presbyterian Orthodoxy soon, soon developed its own methods of, uh, of, of control, of employing state power to, to control and to regulate and to manipulate the church. And that's where we get this a rousing line. New [inaudible] is but old priests writ large. Um, so I, I had mentioned, um, the various factions in parliament that the Presbyterian party had to confront, um, uh, the, the independence who are to the left of the Presbyterians. And we can count John Milton as a, as a supporter of the independence, the independence, resented the new authoritarianism of the Presbyterians and they support it, or at least they tolerated a new phenomenon, a relatively new phenomenon on the English cultural landscape. And this is the freedom of the printing press. It's a freedom that of course parliament had pushed for. Um, but now that they got it, uh, there, there are some misgiving from 1641 to 1643, there had been an unprecedented explosion of printing and publishing an England, every conceivable Protestant sect was publishing treatises of, of theological speculation, publishing treatises of, of religious propaganda at an extraordinary rate.

Speaker 1:          06:51          It's, it's really remarkable, a remarkable things that happens, uh, in the, in the mid century religious propaganda of course, and this is always the case. Um, unregulated religious propaganda only reads more unregulated religious propaganda and more religious division. And by the end of the period, there was an unprecedented, unprecedented number of new religious groups, some of whom, uh, some of these groups born at this moment, I'm still exist. We still have the Quakers. Uh, we have the baptists, but there are of course, many groups, uh, thriving in the 1640s that have absolutely faded, um, from the religious scene, the grantor's, the family [inaudible], the Mughal, Tony, Ian's. These are churches of almost every imaginable stripe. And they're springing up. And from a mainstream perspective perspective, they're quickly eroding the authority of the, of the Church of England. It was becoming absolutely impossible, in fact, or at least much, much harder to claim that there was a single expression of religious truth to which the English nation could consensually subscribe.

Speaker 1:          08:02          And suddenly there are dozens and dozens of competing expressions of religious truth. And so you have a, a new proliferation of new religions and new religious ideas, uh, that comes about is the immediate product of the freedom of the press. And so it's in this decade, in fact, that we have the first newspapers, the printed word begins to take on assumes, uh, a political and the cultural importance that it had never had before. So the proliferation of religious texts and the proliferation of religious sects produced, uh, what was widely seen to be a potentially anarchic political situation in the early 1640s. And it's in response to what was deemed to be the chaotic condition of English religious culture that the Presbyterian led parliament issued in 1643. The Licensing Act, the, the, the, the Presbyterians needed to hold the endless generation of dangerous religious propaganda and uh, and continued Mattel. What they felt on some level was, uh, was the continued metastasis of, of Protestant sects.

Speaker 1:          09:14          And this is a recurring rhetoric, the, this notion that there is a cancer in the body politic. So parliament enacts through this legislation. A mechanism for the state control of, of the press books now have to be licensed. They have to be preapproved by the state before they can actually be published. And so when the controversies that are leading up to the licensing act, one of the authors most frequently mentioned as opposing especial threat to the wellbeing of the of the English nation is our very own, is our very own Milton. The treatises that he had written in favor of the right to divorce for reasons of in compatibility, um, in the earlier 1640s hadn't scandalized his contemporaries, isn't it? Especially scandalized dispirit and contemporaries on the left. So meet Milton was particularly singled out as one of them, uh, as one of these dangerous new voices that had to be stopped.

Speaker 1:          10:10          And in a sermon that was preached to parliament and the August and August of 1644 a by Herbert Palmer, um, it's, it's Milton whose name is cited as one of the, as one of those figures most dangerous to the state. So now my guess is that maybe not all of you, but some of you, uh, we'll have, we'll have, uh, heard about or perhaps actually, um, have read snippets from a today's reading, this amazing treatise long before you got to it last night area politica it, this is without question one of the English languages most powerful and most most browsing expressions of the freedom of the press and actually of the, of, of a kind of libertarian philosophy in general. And, and, and, and the logic, the argumentative logic of very OPA Jenica rests on the distinction between a distinction between external compulsion on the, on the one hand and internal discipline on the other, an internal discipline being something, looking something like an internalization of the discipline and the authority of the, uh, of, of the monarch.

Speaker 1:          11:19          So we have the, we have the compelling official authority of the new state licenser and, and Milton pits that external state power against the powers of reason and against the powers of conscience that of course govern. We're seem to govern human action from within an internalized authority. And it's of course not just John Milton who's authorized to determine his own actions. Everyone according to the logic of very open, Ritika, everyone has the potential to assume the inner authority of conscience and self discipline. Everyone has potentially a licenser within himself. And so there's no need. There's no logical need for a state license. Sir. Um, it's hard. It's a,

Speaker 1:          12:08          let me, let me, uh, there, there's a, there's a, there's some passages in area politica that I would be, I would be remiss to overlook. Um, so I'm going to ask you to turn to page 739 in the Hughes. So there's and Milton's arguing that there's no authority that can rightfully exist outside of the conscience of the individual and even religious truths, which of course are the most potent forms of knowledge that we have. Even religious truths have to be subjected to the final arbiter who is the individual's conscience and the individual's power of, of reasons. So Milton is taking the argument. It's at so many points in area politica as far as it can possibly go. This is page 739. Um, uh, a man may be a heretic in the truth. Milton writes, a man may be a heretic in the truth and if he believes things only because his passenger says so, or the assembly so determines without knowing other reason, though his belief to be true, though his belief to be true, yet the very truthy holds becomes his heresy.

Speaker 1:          13:17          Don't think of that though. Is Belief be true? Think expand in your minds the implications, the possible consequences of this. Any belief, any belief is heresy. If you haven't managed, managed to determine that belief for yourself. If you haven't managed to determine that belief on the basis of your own conscience or through the powers of your own faculty of reason, you can be, you can be a heretic in the truth. If you accept a belief. However true that belief turns out to be at the end of time when we, when we enter the pearly gates and we finally get the last word. Um, you're a, you're a heretic because you've accepted that belief only because it's been handed to you by an External Authority and external authority like a pastor or a bishop or a member of the state assembly, um, or uh, or a lecturer in the English department for that, for that matter. Um, you, it is your obligation. Milton argues in this remarkable treatise, uh, determine for yourself.

Speaker 2:          14:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:21          What will constitute truth. All truth have to be acquired directly by the individual. It is, it's, it's perfectly impossible, I think to imagine a stronger statement than this of the authority that Milton gives the end, the intellectual self possession that he ascribed to the individual. And I think we can, you can see why area politica has been memorialized for centuries now as one of the central precursors, well to a number of things. One of them would be the, uh, the, the, the, the, the 18th century enlightenment. And it's subsequently seen as one of the, uh, one of the precursors of the first amendment to the, to the American constitution. It's here, it's here in area politica that we find one of the first expressions of the idea that an individual's freedom to read and the individual's freedom to write is more important. It outweighs in value, the state's right to limit the individual's freedom to read and the individual's freedom to write what, whatever danger a particular text may pose to this date is outweighed by the greater harm of the official elimination of the, of the, of that text, or by the greater harm of the punishment of the author.

Speaker 1:          15:36          So it, in light of what we have to concede is the, is the extraordinary achievement of area politica and in light of its reputation as one of the foundational texts for the principle of the freedom of speech. Um, readers have been puzzled and they've been rightly puzzled by, by the fact that nowhere in areopagite [inaudible] does Milton explicitly denounce censorship? Nelson doesn't say, doesn't denounce censorship at all, although it comes up. Um, in fact, he even claims and he does this explicitly an area politica and you might've caught this, he even claims to be in favor of censorship in a number of cases. Uh, Milton's argument in this treatise is directed exclusively at licensing and licensing differs from censorship in some important ways. And so let me, um, and uh, indulge me in making this important distinction. We know what censorship is. Censorship is the banning of books that had been published and that had been deemed by the state authorities to be dangerous or harmful in some way.

Speaker 1:          16:43          So censorship would involve the burning of books, uh, the prohibition of any further additions of those books or perhaps even the punishment, um, by imprisonment, say of the author or maybe the printer or the publisher of the books. That's, that's censorship. Utterly straightforward. Licensing on the other hand, is an action that precedes censorship. And so according to the 1643 licensing order against which Milton is directing this treatise area, Politica a book has to be sent to the licensing office for approval before, before it can be published. And the licensing agent reads the book and determines whether or not to print it at all or, or, or, or license it to appear in print. Um, and, and this isn't simply a distinction without a difference. Uh, Milton Milton places in enormous amount of weight on this, on this distinction. Censorship only comes into play once a text has actually been in circulation for a while, only after a number of readers have found a published text to pose a threat. Um, only after that point can a text actually be censored. The book has to be tested. It has to be tried, um, by the public, by a reading public before it can be censored. Um, and it's, uh, it's censorship by consensus almost and it's a truth that has come about. The, the truth of whether a book should or should not be censored is something that's come about through the diligent effort of a group rather than a single arbitrary judge like those state licenser.

Speaker 1:          18:25          Milton is, uh, Milton devotes a lot of time in area of Politica to making a number of attempts to distinguish licensing from censorship. And you can see, I'm actually making this distinction, but what I'm interested in here, and I think what a lot of readers are interested in when they, when they approach [inaudible] is why this treatise, which does in fact permit the practice of censorship, why it can so easily be read as an argument against censorship. And in fact, this treatise is often described or maybe even most commonly described as the western traditions greatest argument against censorship. Obviously there's something going on in this text that has produced this confusion or we could think of it as a misreading. Um, and it, this is of some, this is of some interest to us. So, so turn to the left hand column of page 720 in the Hughes edition.

Speaker 1:          19:20          This is where Milton speaks of the importance of censoring dangerous books. Milton explains that the licensing order of 1643 is ineffective [inaudible]. It's useless because, and I'm quoting here, this order avails nothing to suppressing of scandalous seditious and libelist books, which were mainly intended to be suppressed. Milton striking, uh, such a strange authoritarian note here that it's easy, it's easy, it's easy to skip over it. It seems unaccommodating will almost a look at the next look at the next paragraph. Id nine odd, but that ended up is of greatest concern went in the church and the Commonwealth to have a vigilant eye, how books demean themselves, how books demean themselves as well as men and thereafter to confine in prison and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors. Now we know of course, that this is an argument for censorship and not an argument for licensing because the punishment of the books and the implicit punishment of their men who write those books occurs after their appearance in print. And, and Milton then goes on to explain, and I want you to look closely at this. Milton goes onto explain why books need to be brought to justice, why books need to be punished, essentially like criminals in this personify in the, in Milton's personifying.

Speaker 1:          20:49          So Milton continues for books are not absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was. Who's progeny? They are nay. They do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them. Okay, let me stop there. The ostensible purpose of this sentence, um, at this point as I take it in Milton's argument is to explain the importance of censorship. But the, uh, surely this sentence has an entirely different effective on us as, as readers. Um, a different effect than the syntax or the logic of this sentence may demand that the scandalous seditious and libelous books that need to be brought to justice are suddenly in this remarkable sentence or suddenly revealed to have a soul. However, dangerous books are in a lot of ways, these books look like good, good Christians.

Speaker 1:          21:51          And in fact, they're better than good Christians because books are the purest, the most rarefied extract of the originary goodness of the author, and absolutely unfollowing perfect creation. And, and, and it's important to understand that clearly something very strange has happened here. This sentence, which by the logic of the argument should be demonstrating to us the importance of being, bringing bad books to justice seems to be doing something else. And, and, and in making this point, Milton has just made us, I think, um, almost utterly unwilling to effect this justice that he himself has called for which of us, which of us would want to punish the purest efficacy of a living intellect? It, it, it doesn't make sense in, in the simplest possible terms. You could say that Milton's sentence, Milton's argument here in this paragraph has gotten away from him. And there's a sense in which you can see this happening all the time in Aereo politica there.

Speaker 1:          22:57          It's as if a gap has opened up a gap between the official argument of the treatise. And that's an argument that permits censorship. And, and the rhetorical figures are the metaphors, the Milton's elaborately construed language, which he uses to illustrate that argument. And the metaphors or the rhetorical world of the, uh, of the treatise seems so often to be against censorship. And it's fairly easy to see that, at least in this case, Milton's, Milton's rhetoric and his imagery, uh, begin to undo, begin, begin to unravel the logic of the argument. And it's this, it's a process of undoing an undermining that really eats away at the argument. We could argue, uh, throughout the entirety of very OPA, Jennica and I, so I'm, I'm willing to bet, I'm willing to bet that some of you have had, had noted in your reading last night or whenever you did your reading.

Speaker 1:          23:55          Um, perhaps you actually underlined the sentence that we've just looked like convinced you, underlined it perhaps because you were convinced that this was Milton's wonderful and libertory progressive celebration of the absolute and viable inviolability of the written word. And if you did that on some level, I think you were, you were absolutely right. Even though you were utterly misconstruing the logic of the argument. One of the most, one of the most remarkable things about this text is that it's invariably the soaring, the libertarian rhetoric that we end up noting and that we end up remembering that, that, that sticks with us. Um, turn to turn to page seven, 41 in the Hughes. This is where Milton gives us his, his celebrated narrative of the history of truth. And this is one of those, uh, highly and elaborately, uh, rhetorically ornamented passages. So in Milton's argument against licensing, Milton explains the importance of the coexistence and it's very moving.

Speaker 1:          25:01          The coexistence is an argument for diversity, the coexistence of so many conflicting opinions and beliefs. And, and, and as, and as I've suggested before, he's more conservative. Contemporaries were, were appalled by the proliferation of religious sects in mid 17th century, in the mid 17th century England. And so it would have been perfectly reasonable for them. He's opponents to assume that only one set of religious beliefs could actually represent the truth, that there was only one possible manifestation of divine truth. Um, one has, one has roommates, one has parents, um, uh, in our own day and age who of course share such a belief in an absolute singularity of, of the truth and ones sometimes one has parents or, or, uh, roommates who not only believe that there is a single tooth, but of course are themselves in possession of it. It's just this limited and for Milton restrained or constrained and reductive notion of a single truth that he devotes a so much a very open Shitaka to attacking.

Speaker 1:          26:09          So this is page seven 41 truth indeed came once into the world with her divine master and it was a perfect shape, most glorious to look on. But when he ascended and his apostles after him were late asleep, then straight arose or wicked race of deceivers who has that story goes of the Egyptian Typhon with his conspirators, how they dealt with the good, oh Cyrus took the wicked deceivers took the virgin truth, hued her lovely form into a pieces and scattered them to the four winds from that time ever since the sad friends of truth such as Durst appear imitating the careful search that isis made for the mangled body of Oh Cyrus went up and down, gathering up limb by limb still as they could find them. Let me, I'll, I'll stop there with this original utterly original fable about the fragmentation of what we think of as, uh, as religious truth.

Speaker 1:          27:13          Milton goes out of his way is this, is, this is, this is remarkable. He's actually enacting and he's enacting it rhetorically the fragmentation of religious culture in, in 17th century England. Uh, but one of the, one of the most intriguing aspects of this amazing passage is the fact that this, the fragmentation that Milton is describing and on some level even enacting is something that he seems to be celebrating here with the, with the ascent of Christ, the lovely form of the Virgin truth is hued into a thousand pieces and scattered to the four winds. The violence of this action, of course we can't deny, um, but it gets more complicated than that. The Egyptian Goddess Isis seeks out the mangled body of, of, of her lover Oh Cyrus, because of her powerful affection for him and because of her desire presumably to see him whole again.

Speaker 1:          28:10          There's also though I think a hint here that part of the pleasure behind isis is search involves this, the process of reassembling her lover, the process of gathering him up limb by limb, the act of gathering, uh, present participles a in general, in area up. Angelica being probably the most important form of speech. The active gathering him may be more pleasurable, more desirable than actually having him fully reconstituted. And it's, it's likewise, I think part of our pleasure. I'm in this crazy world of disparate and confusing truths. If we imagine ourselves in the 17th century, it's part of our pleasure to read, to sort out and to reassemble the various manifestations of truth. That's, that's our common project here. In fact, um, in, in an English department saying the sad friends of truth in this fable have gone up and down, gathering up truth limb by limb still as they could find them.

Speaker 1:          29:16          We have not yet found them all Lords and Commons, nor ever shall do till her master's. Second coming. We have not yet found the modelers and Commons, nor ever shall do till her master's. Second coming. He shall bring together every joint in member and shall mold them into an immortal feature of loveliness and perfection. I surely these last two sentences come as a surprise. We have not yet found them all nor ever shall do. We'll never find truth in her entirety, at least not until the second coming. And who knows when that will be. And I think that for Milton in this passage, the fact that we never shall do is is just as well because it's the labor of, it's the Labor of reading. It's the labor of researching. It's the labor of assemblage rather than the actual finished product, uh, that, that, that motivates and spurs the miltonic individual.

Speaker 1:          30:12          Milton Milton wants to, Milton wants us to get, to get us to feel the excitement as we, uh, as we read a passage like this though, and the language that he uses in this passage is itself a kind of demonstration of the, of the pleasure of the process of intellectual assemblage, intellectual coalition of various diverse ideas as readers. It's our duty. It's our obligation to, to sort out and to reassemble. We sort out, for example, as we read this passage, we sought out Christian myths from Egyptian myths or let's say we sort out from what we've been to Milton be Christian truth from Egyptian myths, but the fact that they're putting on the same plane here suggests that both perhaps are either truths or both perhaps or either are or both myths. Um, and, and we sort out the similar confusion of gender roles, which is truly remarkable.

Speaker 1:          31:04          Um, as we balance the masculine Christ with the Feminine Truth with which the Masculine Christ is identified here, we have to balance the, the mysteriously female isis is searched for her lover. Oh, Cyrus. Um, uh, there, there's, there, there are so many entities in this passage that seemed to be mysteriously conjoined in some kind of Hermaphroditic hermaphroditic unity. Um, and we have to, uh, imagine the relation of the female, oh, Cyrus with the implicitly male readers search for his lost lover, which is the feminine truth. Milton's infusing this passage with a powerful sense of, I don't know, what can we call it? This is a of gender nonconformity and, and, and cultural relativity. Christianity emerges from this passage as just one truth out of many. And it's almost as if we're, we're, we're being given our choice as readers. We're going to being given our choice of which set of myths is the most attractive, the most believable.

Speaker 1:          32:04          And maybe ultimately here we're being given a choice as to which set of myths is the most desirable. The, now, as I mentioned, the official purpose of the track is the political subject of licensing. Milton's responding to an immediate set of historical circumstances and he wants to explain the usefulness, the value, and in fact the beauty of religious controversy. But when you read it, when you read an intensely a poetic, highly ornamented passage like the one that we've just looked at, I think you can see why Milton was so interested in this contemporary problem of, of religious diversity in the first place. Contradictions and in consistencies and contemporary religious society are so much like, or at least look so much like the contradictions and inconsistencies that we find in a work of literature that we find in a poem. And Milton's defense of controversy is, seems in a lot of ways continually to be slipping into something like a defense of poetry or certainly a defense of his own poetic practice.

Speaker 1:          33:10          One of the, one of the structural elements that that Lens Aereo Virginica, it's, it's a curious power is a carefully crafted network of images that Milton has, has, uh, has employed to structure the thing, the end. And I'm thinking particularly of images describing the activity of reading. Um, one of the, one of the central images here is the image of eating. Reading is continually being described in terms of eating and, and digestion. We have already encountered on some level the importance of the, of the figure of eating to John Milton. You think of think of commerce, the ladies refusal to drink of comas. His Cup was just the f the first of Milton's attempt to, Milton's attempts to bring the action of ingestion to the very center of a, of a literary work, a paradise lost will be filled with, with the, the activity of eating. And Milton devotes more than a few lines and it's shocking, uh, to the process whereby the heavenly angels not only eat food but they also digest it.

Speaker 1:          34:18          And Milton lets us know whether we want to know or not, how they, those angels actually excrete the food they have taken in. But the most central act of eating of course in Milton's great epic is obviously has nothing to do with angels. It's the eating of the forbidden fruit by Adam and eve. And it's because this action of eating is so absolutely central to the plot of paradise lost were obliged to spend. Let's spend the rest of our time here focusing on Milton's consideration in this treatise in the area of [inaudible] 1644 of, of the, of the problem that we will find haunting paradise lost the problem of the eating of the fruit, the problem of God's prohibition, God's censorship of, of the fruit, of the tree,

Speaker 1:          35:11          of the knowledge of good and evil. God's licensing. We'll see Milton's a turn to page 727. This is the left hand column. Milton's quoting Dionysius Alexan dryness in this passage. And he tells us the Diane Ics Alexon Dryness, um, wrote, read any books, whatever that come to thy hands for thou art sufficient both to judge a right and to examine each matter. And Diane I see has compares to this command to read everything. Read everything you possibly can to Saint Paul's command in the epistle to the Thessalonians, which is prove all things hold fast to that which is good. And prove proof here means to test, to try all things. And Paul's making a claim here for the individuals. This is certainly how Milton was able to read it, a claim for the individual's capacity to make a moral judgment after some period of trial or after some period of of experimentation and Milton elaborates on this claim that we should read and prove anything we want.

Speaker 1:          36:17          Four, we are sufficient to judge a right. He's he's, he's, he's moving on here and he might have added, Milton tells us he might have added another remarkable saying of the same author to the pure, all things are pure, not only meets and drinks, but all kinds of knowledge whether of good or evil, the knowledge cannot defile nor consequently the books if the wheel and conscience be not defiled for books or as meat and vines are some of goods, some of evil substance and yet God in that an apocryphal vision said without exception rise Peter, kill and eat leaving the choice to each man's discretion. We should be able to read whatever you want, whatever we want, just as we should be able to eat whatever we want and Milton's language. The image here is of this is it's kind of a combined gastronomical and literary freedom.

Speaker 1:          37:17          This is the freedom of this smorgasbord of the, of the public libraries slash smorgasbord or Atticus, uh, for that matter, a place where you can, um, eat and read. Although not on the same, actually they don't let you, they don't let you eat, um, around the books. You get my point though. Um, we should, we should be able to try all things to prove all things, um, and then decide whether or not we actually like it, whether it brings us some sort of pleasure and this or wisdom and this array of choices is more than just a luxury for Milton. It's, uh, absolutely constituent of, of, of the ideal, of freedom of our freedom. Because if we don't try everything, if we don't give ourselves an opportunity to just, to decide for ourselves, then of course some, well, someone will invariably be making those decisions for us.

Speaker 1:          38:08          So it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be difficult to see a kind of problem that is beginning to arise. Uh, in Milton's text here, as I suggested just a minute ago, that one of the relevant stories that is always lying behind Milton's discussion of human choice is the story from the book of Genesis about Adam and Eve's choice to eat the forbidden fruit. And so much of [inaudible] involves Milton's bringing together competing images and traditions in arguments. So he's injured, as we've already seen, he interweaves a Christian figures with, with pagan figures. He positions pro censorship argument alongside anticensorship rhetoric or metaphor. And there are dozens of moments in which it's just these opposites that are being asked to coexist in some kind of piece, but nowhere, nowhere in area politica do the conflict seems so pronounced, are so painful or make us win so much as the tension that arises between the genesis story of Adam and eve.

Speaker 1:          39:11          God knows why Milton feels compelled to bring this story up. The tension between the story of Adam and eve and Milton's own impassioned argument against licensing. So I've, as I've just noted Milton quotes, Paul's dictum that to the pure all things are pure. If you're a pure, not only our meat, meat's vines, pure meets and drinks pure, but all kinds of knowledge, whether of good and evil and you, oh, you just have to extend for a little bit this, this Pauline philosophy of freedom to the situation of unfollowing, uh, the unfollowing Eden of Adam and eve to see a kind of logical trouble that Milton is getting himself into the, the Genesis Story of God's peremptory prohibition of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the strongest analogy that I can think of to the licensers peremptory prohibition of a book. Uh, obviously Milton isn't able to make this analogy explicit.

Speaker 1:          40:13          It would completely dash any logical sense that area [inaudible] is still retains. Um, but it's nonetheless, I'll, I'll, I'll always there this, this tension, God's forbidding of the fruit removes from Adam and Eve. Any capacity for choosing and deciding. And you can see Milton worrying in area politica about the uneasy relationship of his, of his own argument to this central text. In divine scripture. So look at page seven 28 in the Hughes. This is the left hand column, good and evil. We know in the field of this world grow up together almost inseparably and the knowledge of good is so involved and interwoven with the knowledge of evil and in so many cutting resemblance is hardly to be discerned that those confused seeds which were imposed on psyche as an incessant labor to coal out and Sorta Sunder. We're not more intermixed. It was from out the rind of one apple tasted that the knowledge of good and evil is two twins cleaving together, leaped forth into the world and perhaps this is that doom which Adam fell into of knowing good and evil.

Speaker 1:          41:29          That is to say of knowing good by evil. This is, there's so many things to say about this passage, but one thing that I'll just throw out now is that it's a remarkable description of of the modern world of, of moral uncertainty like Isis whom we saw piecing together the body of Oh Cyrus or like this add friends of truth, picking up the torn limbs of that beautiful virgin. We are left to coal out and sort asunder the confused seeds of, of good and evil. Now, on one level of this passage, Milton's describing this modern condition is the product of the fall. It's, it's too bad that we live in this world. This is the doom which Adam fell into. This is the fallen condition to which we've all been consigned. But the passage is so much more complicated than that because good and evil seem to have been mixed up in the apple before the fall.

Speaker 1:          42:24          There was good in that forbidden fruit as well as evil. This is that Dune which Adam fell into of knowing good and evil. That is to say, of knowing good by evil, adamant the fall didn't simply come into a knowledge primarily of of evil. Adam, by tasting the apple came into a knowledge of good and he was only able to know this good by means of the experience of the knowledge of evil. Um, there are a lot of perspectives, a discernible or extractable from this treatise area. Politica from which the fallen state seems in so many ways, maybe in every way superior to its unfollowing, to it's unfollowing counterpart. Um, we will see, we will see Milton returning to all of these, all of these questions in paradise lost. And we will even see Milton place in the mouth of Eve that the next sentence in this passage, or at least, um, uh, a paraphrased and of course versified version of this sentence.

Speaker 1:          43:35          This is when Milton tells us I cannot praise a cloistered virtue. I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue unexercised and, and breathed that never Sally's out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race where that immortal garland is to be run for not without dust and heat. And you'll find eve in book nine of Paradise Lost Voicing essentially this same sentiment when she's explaining to Adam why she, why she needs to work separately. Uh, this is the argument that really of course, puts her at risk of Satan's temptation and to so many readers. It has seemed that eve is actually quoting Milton's much earlier writing area politica in her defense. And it has an incredibly unsettling effect. Evil has to be challenged. It has to be confronted, it has to be tasted before it can be conquered. It, it can't simply be avoided.

Speaker 1:          44:36          This is, this is eaves and area of political argument. We will never be virtuous simply because we've cloistered ourselves or segregated ourselves from any temptation. Virtue is to be fought for, um, raced for not without Dustin heat. So let me conclude. Let me conclude the lecture by, by saying that it's a startling experience and I hope you feel some of the, some of their surprise moving from area Politica, which, uh, has to be Milton's most important and consequential work in prose. Moving from that to paradise lost, which is of course Milton's most important work of poetry. And we'll be doing this in one in one week. And the disjunction between these, between the two works, this disjunction, at least with respect to their treatment of the fall, um, should dramatize the nature or just the enormity of a lot of the conceptual problems and conflicts that Milton is, is, is tackling here as a faithful Christian.

Speaker 1:          45:37          Of course. And I, I'm, I'm not going to try to deny this. Um, as a faithful Christian, Milton believes that the fall is only to be lamented and that Adam and eve should not have eaten the apple. And as a believing Christian, Milton believes that the omnipotent God has had every right to license to prohibit that apple. But it's a measure. It's, and we have, it's a measure that we have to take seriously. It's a measure of Milton's ambition and his intellectual courage that, that, that enables him to set out to justify a God who can inflict upon his creatures such a seemingly Arbitrary Act, act of licensing. The, and, and the extent to which Milton and succeeds and justifying such a God in paradise lost will be. Of course, one of the questions that we will be exploring over the next, over the next couple of weeks, so you will read for Wednesday's class, uh, the first two books of paradise lost.
