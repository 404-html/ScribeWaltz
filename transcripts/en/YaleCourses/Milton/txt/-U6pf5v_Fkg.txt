Speaker 1:          00:01          I want to revisit just, just for a moment, uh, the opening of the invocation to holy light, uh, which is of course, as you know, is it the beginning of book three of paradise lost. So this is page two 57 of the Hughes and this is how Milton begins the vocation as you remember, hail, holy light offspring of heaven, first born or of the eternal coeternal being. May I express the and blamed, and you'll remember the last week we, uh, we looked at Milton's desire to imagine himself on blamed or in some way, unbelievable for the condition of his blindness Milton had for Milton had for years gone out of his way to justify himself before his nation and before his God. But that, that was only one way to read this line. May I ask this question? May I express the on blamed and blamed can just as easily modify it seems to me it can just as easily modify the holy light being addressed by the poet.

Speaker 1:          01:06          It can correspond to the D as well as the eye in that question. And so it's this alternative syntactical possibility that I want to explore in this lecture. Uh, well I'll be focusing on the status of this poem as an attempt to exculpate not only this poet, but, but this poets, this poet's God to render God blameless for the range of losses that this epic so eloquently. Enumerates. So a look at the sentence that I've written on the board from, from doctor Johnson's life of Milton. His purpose was the most useful and the most arduous to vindicate the ways of God to man. And I'll continue. Uh, it continues, uh, uh, I'll finish the sentence to show the reasonableness of religion and the necessity of obedience to the divine law. I'll read it one more time. His purpose was the most useful and the most arduous to vindicate the ways of God to man, to show the reasonableness of religion and the necessity of obedience to the divine law.

Speaker 1:          02:10          And, and, and, and Johnson here is clearly thinking of Milton's ambition of producing a theodicy and attempt to justify the ways of God to men. And he's, I think he's right to identify Milton's theodicy is really one of the central tasks of the, of the poem. Milton's seems genuinely sincere in wanting to provide a rational and reasonable account of the ways of God. But you've, you've probably noticed that Johnson Johnson's gotten his quotation wrong and he may have gotten his quotation wrong. I, uh, because he's not thinking directly of the Milton, but he's thinking of Alexander Pope's earlier thinking of the Milton from at Pope's. Great Poem. The Essay on man, um, pope gets it wrong as well. Uh, Milton, of course, it doesn't end the opening in vocation to book one of Paradise lost with the claim that he will assert a providence and vindicate the ways of God to men. Milton says that he will justify the ways of God to man. And I think there's a slight, but nonetheless, there's a difference between these two words and I think there's instruct something instructive here about Johnson slip and perhaps something instructive to about Alexander Pope's slip, uh, a few decades before. Now when Milton says that he'll justify God's ways. I think we mean he means simply that he will account for the justice of God's ways. He will demonstrate their justify ability but to, but to vindicate God's ways.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Vindicate is a slightly different words, although they could certainly be seen as synonyms to vindicate God's ways. This I would imagine to presuppose at the outset that God is under some suspicion of guilt, that he's assumed to have done something wrong and that it's our job to vindicate him or to get him off the hook. Milton, of course, can't himself and doesn't. Right, and they use the word vindicated. It's too prejudicial. It seems on some level to criminalize God's behavior in advance, and this is of course exactly what he does not want to do. That said, it's on some level, it's impossible for us to read paradise lost and not assume that this God requires vindication. God seems in so many ways to be responsible for the fall and it might even be impossible to read the story of the fall in, in genesis and and, and not attribute some of the guilt to the yard way.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Who, who put, who placed the forbidden fruit in the garden in the first place. Dr. Johnson inadvertently here reveals something about Milton's poem that Milton himself perhaps isn't, isn't willing, willing or able to admit that. And that's the God appears to be guilty and it's up to Milton to clear him of any suspicion of guilt. So look at the head note that Milton attaches to the beginning of book three. This is page two 57 in the Hughes. And when, when paradise lost initially appeared when its original appearance in 1667, um, these arguments, these head notes were weren't there, he added them to a later printing, presumably at the request of, of a printer who thought that the readers needed a little help with a poem. And you actually may want to think about, it's a, this is an interesting, it's an interesting phenomenon and very little written about the, the general relation between these summarized arguments. They're essentially plot summaries, um, to the actual story, the actual narrative that follows in each book. But the beginning of this argument strikes me as an especially interesting one. So this is Milton's argument for book three. God sitting on his Throne Sees Satan flying towards this world. Then newly created shows him to the son who Saturdays right hand foretells the success of Satan and perverting mankind clears his own justice and wisdom from all imputation having created man free and able enough to have withstood the tempter.

Speaker 1:          06:19          I'm just going to focus on, on on a couple of those clauses foretells the say the success of Satan and perverting mankind. Then we get Milton's semi-colon clears his own justice and wisdom from all imputation. You, you, you, you, you kind of get the feeling here at least I get the feeling here that this semi-colon is working as hard as it possibly can to yoke these can seemingly conflicting principles together. And I'm not, I, I'm not sure it's the case that any semi-colon is, is up to such an enormous, uh, theological task. Uh, in this formulation, Milton seems to own up on some level to Johnson's characterization of the theodicy of paradise lost as a vindication. God needs to clear his own justice. He needs to clear his name in essence, because that name has been clouded over with some kind of, with some kind of suspicion.

Speaker 1:          07:13          Now, and I, I take this absolutely seriously, that, uh, I think it's, it's with, it has to be seen as authentic and sincere. Milton's desire to justify God. He needs to imagine a god who can't be held responsible for the fall because only a blameless God could be worthy of Milton's praise or even more worthy of Milton's interest. And I think, I mean, frankly, I think that Milton does a pretty decent job of, uh, of representing a god who cannot be seen as some kind of guilty coconspirator in the fall of man. He does a pretty decent job vindicating God. But then when we think about it, there are few poets more adept at the art of vindication than John Milton. Milton had been practicing the art of indication that the art of defense, something like the art of criminal defense all of his life. Uh, we looked last time at the lengths to which Milton went in is on Monday the lakes too, when she went in his poetry.

Speaker 1:          08:16          And His prose to, to vindicate himself with regard to his blindness. But long before, even long before that, before Milton site had been cut off a long before his Tinder or observe vision had been quenched to use his, uh, his, his poetry, uh, Milton had been exercising his talents in the rhetorical art of self defense in Sonnet seven. And actually throughout the earlier, throughout the early works, Milton was defending himself against that fear. You remember that fear that God would punish him for waiting so long to begin his career that God was angry with Milton. Milton was already 23 years old and he had so little to show himself. And later Milton devoted a good deal of energy to other kinds, other kinds of defense. He labored to vindicate the Radical Puritan Left in England when it was held that they had committed a crime in killing the king, raising a hand against God's anointed monarch and Europe.

Speaker 1:          09:14          Europe was aghast at the barbaric behavior of the English revolutionaries. And so Milton wrote in Latin for the benefit of the entire European intellectual community, two defenses of the crime of the regicide. Um, so he wrote a first defense of the English people and then a work entitled a second defense of the English people. And there is no, there's no question that he would have been capable had there been time or had there been an interest of writing a third defense and a and a and a fourth defense. The Labor of defense, the work of vindication was something that Milton was getting very good at and it really goes to the, the core of his intellectual temperament.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Now, melting lays the groundwork for his sweeping vindication of God in the discussion in book three, uh, between the heavenly father and his son. And this is essentially the same theology that Milton will establish in the theological treatise that he's riding. At the same time that he's writing paradise lost, um, on Christian doctrine, parts of which were assigned, uh, for today's class. Now it's important for Milton to establish something like, and this is what he gets to do in the, in the venue of the prose treatise as opposed to the poem. He, he has the opportunity to establish a theoretical basis for a lot of his beliefs. And so a theoretical basis for his vindication of God. He needs to prove theologically, not just poetically or narratively, that God did not place Adam and eve in the garden with the intent or with the, the purpose in mind of punishing them for eating the fruit he needs to convince himself in. It needs to convince his reader. Milton does that the fact of God's fore knowledge of the fall doesn't in any way cause the fall. And this is a huge worry not just for Milton but,

Speaker 1:          11:05          but for all philosophically minded, philosophically minded Christians that, that the faculty have freewill is that as a genuine faculty, this is something that in Milton really needs to believe and that it's not just some paper McShea con concept pasted together by a cynical and manipulative deity or by a cynical and manipulative poet.

Speaker 2:          11:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:29          And in order to assert this belief in a genuinely meaningful faculty of freewill mean Milton has to tackle head on the theology of his fellow puritans. The prevailing theology of his, of his, uh, of his fellow puritans Milton has to dismantle. And this is no easy task, dismantle the Calvinist doctrine of, of, of divine predestination. Now, the most prevalent, the most prevalent belief among Milton's contemporary puritans was the belief, this belief in divine predestination and nearly all, all the men and women that we can identify comfortably as puritans embrace the faith in God's omnipotence outlined in the works of John Calvin, uh, Calvin being the 16th century Swiss theologian, actually French theologian living in Geneva, who insisted that every one's salvation could be traced back ultimately to the predestined will of God. And so for Calvin, God is not only known since the beginning of time, what we will do, but God actually causes us in some sense to do what we do.

Speaker 1:          12:37          There's very little space for a meaningful, a range of free will in a, in a strict Calvinist system. And it's God then who is, who has for Calvin elected in advance, who will be saved and who will be damned and, and Calvin was, was, was justified, or at least he felt he was justified and many of his followers felt he was justified in this assertion of God's control. Um, when he read the passage from Saint Paul's epistle to the Romans, and this is the, this is the passage for whom I'll, uh, let me read the whole thing. This is Romans eight 29 for whom he did for no, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them. He also called and whom he called them. He also justified and whom he justified them. He also glorified for whom he did for no, he also did predestinate.

Speaker 1:          13:36          It's a devastating, it's a perfectly devastating Bible buffers for anyone committed to a strong stance as Milton wise on the, in the doctrine of free. Well. So on some level, at least in this passage from Saint Paul, Romans eight 29 scriptures seemed to provide in controvertible evidence for the fact that God had already predestined the elect. Those Christians who had arbitrarily at the very foundation of time been elected for our salvation. And that by extension God had also, and this is another important component of the Calvinists theological system, that God had also arbitrarily marked another group of men and women for punishment and eternal damnation seems in controvertible. But we're, we're, this is, this course is about Milton. And of course nothing is in controvertible for Milton. And you see him tangled with just this passage, this passage from the book of Romans for two solid pages in, in on Christian doctrine.

Speaker 1:          14:39          And, and you just have a sense that Milton is saying this can't possibly mean what it seems to me. And there's a, there's a genuine and powerful urgency charging Milton's, it's like a wrestling match almost with a, with a, with a biblical passage like this. And so one of the important conclusions that Milton comes to in his wrestling match trust scripture is that the term elect as Saint Paul uses it in the Bible, doesn't refer to God's absolute predestination. And actually, let me, um, let me ask you to turn to page in your Hughes. This is page nine, 21, uh, uh, of the Christian doctrine. Knowlton writes that I infer I conclude that believers are the same as the elect and that the terms are used indiscriminately. I'm going to read that again. I conclude that believers are the same as the elect and that the terms are used indiscriminately.

Speaker 1:          15:36          Believers are the elect. And because of course we get to choose on some level, we get to choose whether or not we believe. We therefore get to choose. We have some agency in whether or not we are going to be one of God's elect. This is wonder, one of Milton's most compelling and really wonderful perversions of, of mainstream Calvinist theology. Uh, Calvin had insisted on predestination to assert God's absolute control over or over his creation and God's absolute control over that set final separation. At the end of time between the saved and the damned Calvin felt that that, that the, his theology was the least we could, uh, there's the least we owed to the gray, the grand juror and the omnipotence of God. But from Milton to say that believers are the same as the elect is essentially, I think on some level to strip god of that control.

Speaker 1:          16:35          If this is Milton, we're defending something like a usurpation of Gods of God's authority, and it's the same strategy that you will see Milton employing a time and again, he's able to, and it's the damnedest thing. He's able to take the most depressingly constrictive biblical doctrine and he turns it into a proof. He turns it into a proof for his own faith and man's absolutely freewill. And Milton's philosophy of he's not the only person doing this, but he does it with more ingenuity perhaps than just about any of his contemporaries. Milton's philosophy of freewill is often called Arminianism and a Arminianism is named after the 16th century Dutch theologian James. Our mini as, I don't, I can't remember the Dutch name off the top of my head had Jacobus Arminius is the, is the Latin name that he published under. Now, I've been speaking of the theology of freewill as if it were, if I as if it were simply a matter of, of religious doctrine or exclusively a matter of religious doctrine.

Speaker 1:          17:38          And of course, probably more importantly than any than any other way, it is a matter of religious doctrine, but religion, and I think this can be said not just for Milton, it surely it can be said for all of us. Religion serves a whole range of cultural functions. We saw last time some of the deeply personal uses to which Milton was able to put his theology just as he needs to, just as he needs to prove that God's omniscience and omnipotence is not a sign of, of his responsibility for the fall. Milton needed to prove that his blindness, his blindness wasn't a sign of God's punishment of, of Milton. That was a personal motivation for some of the theological energies of Milton's poem. But I think more central to Milton's theology, uh, than anything like a personal motivation is Milton's politics. Although the political sphere is, is intimately intertwined with anything that we would want to think of is as personal theology and, and political philosophy.

Speaker 1:          18:43          These obviously seem to us such radically distinct spheres of thought. Um, but they're incredibly closely intertwined in the 17th century. And I think there are all sorts of all sorts of political and social motivations for Milton's theology. There are political and social reasons for the fact that some of the periods radical intellectuals like Milton are beginning to assert radically to assert the importance of man's freewill and beginning at the same time to diminish the authority that had traditionally in the Calvinist system been accorded to God. And I think there's a political significance to the, the periods renewed renewed attachment to and investment in the philosophy or the theology of Arminius who, as you can see, he had died at the very beginning of the 17th century. Um, Arminianism has a new way, maybe it's third wave by the later, the later part of the, of the 17th century.

Speaker 1:          19:45          Now, as we know from the, the, the treatise area politica and from Milton's regicide a writings as well, Milton was establishing himself in the middle part of the century as one of England's foremost, one of the England's most articulate spokesman for a phenomenon that we can call. Although it's an [inaudible], it's an anachronistic term liberalism. And so obviously the word liberalism hasn't, hasn't emerged yet, but you have something like a theory of liberalism, or at least a theory of libertarianism, a beginning to assert itself in the middle of the 17th century. You have a serious formulation of, of liberalism later in the 17th century, shortly after Milton dies, um, with the philosopher John Locke, who was a great reader of Milton. I'm traditional renaissance political thought was before lock. And I think you can say before Milton was more or less authoritarian, it placed a monarch at the top of the society at the top of the polity and traditional renaissance political thought needed to imagine that monarchs control.

Speaker 1:          20:55          Um, his ultimate governance over the behavior and the actions of all of the individuals in that society, that this political philosophy in variably asserted the, the importance of a radical image of centralization of power. And it's really not until the middle of the 17th century that Europeans, and it's not just not just Englishman or beginning to articulate any serious alternative to the authoritarian, the centralized model of, of political organization. There are people on the, on the radical left and, and Milton is one of them, um, who begin to posit the idea that the dispersed individuals throughout our society can be reasonably depended on, to govern themselves with, with sufficient self control. Of course, such a theory assumes a lot of things. It assumes a sufficient degree of self control that every individual would have. Um, with this self controlled rational individuals could organize themselves with that without a king, without the top down. A hierarchical structure of, of a monarchy and the, and the, the, this, this position most is most often associated in England, at least in the middle of the century with the levelers. Um, the levelers are the intellectual,

Speaker 1:          22:22          the highminded intellectual component of the, of the army of during the English revolution during the middle of the 17th century. Um, and uh, the, the, the level or theory of sovereignty is something like an intellect and elected sovereignty. If there's a sovereign, that sovereign will be elected or chosen by the people and it won't be the sovereign not going to be imposed upon the people. Um, and so it'll election in a lot of ways. It's not simply a theological Turnitin, obviously to, to this day it has political resonances as well. So this brand new liberal, what I'm calling a liberal theology is not only political in nature, however, it's also, it's also economic. It's at precisely the same period, the mid 17th century when something like,

Speaker 2:          23:13          yeah,

Speaker 1:          23:14          again, I'll use the term anachronistically when something like a liberal market theory of economic exchange as being theorized. So up until, so I'll give you a little, a brief history of, of the, the, the of economic thought. In the early modern period. Up until this point, it was assumed that the only efficient way to organize the economic life of a nation was to have the monarch, the sovereign, the authoritarian center of the government, fixed prices and a to and to, to determine the value of currency in general, to oversee the dynamics of just about all economic exchange. But suddenly, and this really is happening in the 1650 and it's happening first in England, suddenly a liberal economic theory is coming into view and it was being conjectured that individuals, meaning individual merchants could freely set prices and values according to the law of supply and demand rather than according to the law of the authority, the authoritarian will of the king.

Speaker 1:          24:16          And there's a wonderful book on this subject by Joyce Appleby. If any of you are interested, um, it's, I can't remember what it's called, but you'll figure it out from orbis. Which of joy's Apple Bee's wonderful books. This is a, but the argument is essentially that a free market philosophy had simply been unthinkable. The free market philosophy that we just take as a, as a given almost was unthinkable before the middle years of the 17th century. And so you have these two enormous shifts in the way that English intellectuals were thinking about their political and also about their economic lives. And it seems to me that it only stands to reason that there's going to be a corresponding shift or some site sort of related shift on the level of religious thought. If individuals are going to be liberated from their earthly monarch, if merchants are going to be liberated from the centralizing power of the, of the sovereign in charge of the economy, then individual souls are going to have to be liberated at least to some extent from the predestined very stronghold of the heavenly monarch as well as if, um, intellectual life could operate in these huge analogous in these with these huge analogous forms.

Speaker 1:          25:38          And I think that that's one of the functions of Milton's insistence on the, his liberal, his liberal theology of freewill. It's as if he needs to bring his religion in line with his, with his liberal politics. So now let's look at the dialog and heaven. Um,

Speaker 2:          25:58          okay,

Speaker 1:          25:59          turn to page

Speaker 1:          26:03          260 in the Hughes. This is book three, line 93. Uh, it's, it's hearing the dialogue and having between the father and the son were so many of the tensions between Calvin is predestination and miltonic freewill get, get worked out. Um, but let, let me digress for a moment before we actually look at the dialogue. I think it's important to ask why it is. And I think people have been asking this question since people have been reading paradise lost. Why it is that God, the father and God the son needed to be holding a dialogue at all? What, what is it that they need to say to one another? Um, I think we can reasonably ask, ask for Orthodox Christians in Milton's time. And I think for a lot of Orthodox Christians in, in our time, the father and the son, or members of what's known as the trinity, the father, the son and the Holy Spirit are paradoxically according to most trinitarian thinking, are paradoxically three separate entities.

Speaker 1:          27:03          But they are also most importantly, one unified entity. And because they are all one and all equally one, it borders almost on blast for me to imagine the father and the son needing to discuss anything. But, but Milton realized that, and this is uh, this was, uh, an extraordinary and bold move on his part. Milton, uh, argued that there was no basis in scripture for a belief in the trinity. And people had always known that the word trinity actually appears nowhere in the scripture. And you can see Milton in the Christian doctrine, uh, supplying mountains, literally mountains of evidence of scriptural evidence to disprove the doctrine of the Christian, the Christian doctrine of the trinity. So Milton took very seriously the biblical metaphors of father and son. The father and the son are, are not mere, they're not aspects of the same deity. They are literally for Milton, a father and a son. And when the God refers in Scripture to my only begotten Son or to my first begotten son, he really means it. According to Milton, the father generates the son. Uh, he gives birth to him at a specific moment in, in, uh, in, in pre creation history. And Milton is therefore we can call him or he has been called a subordination hissed. He subordinates the son to the father because the sun will never be, or at least not until the very end of time, will never be the fathers equal.

Speaker 2:          28:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:37          And, and so the sun can in no way be imagined, um,

Speaker 2:          28:42          okay.

Speaker 1:          28:42          Identical or equal to the father and the father can, when he chooses, and this happens in paradise lost, he can grant a certain measure of power to the sun, but the sun, no in no way, possesses a this, the same in any kind of power that hasn't been granted to him at God's, at God's pleasure or, or the, the, the, he and the sun has nothing like the fore knowledge or omnipotence that the father has. Now we see this undoing things, performing actions in paradise lost, for example, he's responsible for having created or serving as the vehicle for the creation of the entire known universe. Not, not negligible perhaps, but he, he can only perform these godlike feats. And he goes, can they only be called God? Like not actually God, when the father permits him to perform such feats, he needs his father's permission.

Speaker 1:          29:38          And like Adam and eve, it's beholden upon the to obey the father. This is, this is crucial to Milton's theology. So look at how all these, this, these domestic essentially domestic relations get theologized in the dialogue and heaven, um, line 93 of book three and the father of course, and it just drives me crazy. The father speaks in the future tense of absolute for knowledge because he can, and, and, and, and you're right to think, I hope you've thought that there's something, a little chilling about the fathers discursive manner here. Um, the, the way in which he can shift so easily between the past tense and the future tense. So the line 93, this is the Father Furman will hearken to Satan's closing lies and easily transgressed the sole command sold pledge of his obedience. So we'll fall. He and his faithfulness progeny, whose fault, whose but his own in great.

Speaker 1:          30:47          Ouch. Whose fault, whose but his own in great. He had of me all he could have. I made him Justin, right sufficient to have stood though free to fall such I created all the, the ethereal powers and spirits, both them who stood and them who failed freely. They stood, who stood and fell, who fell. Now I'm going to set aside here because I can't deal with it. Um, this, this little outbursts that seems so incredibly in decorous and inappropriate in great. Um, and uh, I'm, I'm going to discuss instead the last line that I just read, uh, which is indicates, indicates I think one of the central rhetorical strategies of the father's speech. Now look at line 99. First. There's something literally liberating about the father's credo here. I created man, sufficient to have stood though free to fall.

Speaker 1:          31:47          This is, this is kind of rousing and as rousing as this is, the father doesn't leave it there. He broaches the subject of the fallen angels and he repeats the same formulation, but he repeats it with the difference. Look at line 101 he has just, he's just discussed both of them who stood and them who failed freely. They stood, who stood and fell, who fell freely. They still do stood, fell, who fell. The father recasts that, that original statement within a, within a repetitive rhetoric, it's essentially a repetitive rhetoric of totology. And in so doing, I think he exposes something of the highly schematic nature of, of his sense of justice. And, and, and this last line is often cited and Milton criticism as a, as a positive example of Milton's commitment to the doctrine of free will. But I don't, I don't really buy it though.

Speaker 1:          32:42          I'm not convinced by the fathers, the fathers statement, this line may begin with that exuberant an adverb freely, but the rest of it, at least to me, the rest of it smacks of something like predestination and it's a little depressing. They stood who stood and fell, who fell? Is it a stretch to extrapolate from that? Um, uh, a paraphrase like this, the type of person who was created to stand didn't stand and the type of person who was created to fall did fall. There's something disconcertingly programmatic about the father's repetition here. The repetitiveness of his explanation and the tautological force of this formulation seems to rob the opening word in the line, freely robs it of some of its liberatory energy. Okay. That was the father speech

Speaker 1:          33:32          wonderfully. The Sun seems almost to recoil from the, from the rigidity of the father's position and in fact he seems actually to soften the father a little. He asked the father to show mercy toward man, since man like the son himself is, is a son of God and it's at this point you get the the fathers and you want to, you want to throttle him. The father's condescending claim that of course he knew all along that the sun would be asking for mercy and Milton is obliged to make the father omission of course, because the father is omniscient. Although the entire drama of this dialogue is structured as any drama or any dialogue has to be structured to suggest that there are two individuals who are reacting genuinely to one another speeches because they don't know in advance what the other is going to say.

Speaker 1:          34:19          That's what a dialogue, that's what a dialogue is. But there's clearly a powerful asymmetry here in this dialogue. Um, and that the asymmetry threatens, I think too, to cast this entire scene into some something like, uh, uh, a potentially ridiculous light, but the sun does seem, at least he does seem to have made a kind of impact on the father and the father seems to relent and, and the father agrees to accept the repentance of Adam and eve. So look at line one 94. This is at the top of page two 63. The father promises to show mercy and he promises to permit Adam and eve a safe journey back into his good graces. So line one 94 and I will place them,

Speaker 1:          35:12          I will place within them as a guide my umpire conscience whom if they will hear light after light, well used, they shall attain. And to the end persisting safe arrive. It's as if the father has been cajoled by the sun, cajoled out of his repetitive cyclicality and nudge towards something like a more linear and to my tastes are more palatable form of, of human progress. And I think we sigh with relief at the knowledge that all will be well. All will be well. Again, after the fall we have all of the earmarks here of a, of a narrative. I'm moving from a, from a a beginning through a middle, toward an end. Then we sigh with relief at the knowledge that all that, that everything is going to be okay. But of course this relief is only momentary. As soon as the father has agreed to this concession, as soon as he's promised they're safe journey back to God, he adds a condition.

Speaker 1:          36:18          And this condition appears at line 203. This is near the top of page two 63. Um, he returns to that rhetoric of repetition and equivalents that had marked his earlier speech, but yet all is not done. What had led us to well used, they shall attain unto the end, persisting, safe, safe arrive. It did seem that pretty much all was all was done, but there's some backtracking here, but yet all is not done. Man. Disobeying, disloyal breaks his field team and sins against the high supremacy of heaven effecting godhead. And so losing all to expiate his treason hath not left but to destruction, sacred and devote he with his whole posterity must die, die. He or justice must unless for him some other able and as willing paid the rigid satisfaction, death for death, but yet all is not done. You can almost hear Milton in this line catching himself and, and realizing that man, of course wasn't redeemed simply because Adam and eve were repentance simply because they said they were sorry.

Speaker 1:          37:34          It has the scene force is that incredibly startling moment in the naitivity owed when Milton tells us. But why is this? Fate says no, this must not yet be. So, uh, Milton just can't get away. Although he certainly gives it a shot. He can't get away from the unhappy fact that man was not redeemed simply because Adam and Eve said they were sorry man was redeemed through the much more troubling for Milton, the troubling mechanism of the father's sacrifice of the son. And Milton has successfully avoided finishing his poem about the crucifixion, The Passion, the poem called the passion when he was a young man, it just went unfinished. And as you read the dialogue in Heaven in Book Three of Paradise lost, it seems for a while at least it seems that Milton is going to be able to evade the entire question of the sacrifice one more time. But, but, but he catches himself, but yet all is not done. And he forces consideration of, of the atonement of the crucifixion. And it's crucial to understanding exactly how it is that Milton here is imagining the dynamics of the redemption.

Speaker 1:          38:48          So Milton, first of all, it has to reject the Orthodox understanding of the Christian redemption. Um, I'll, I'll, uh, I'll, I'll remind you what that looks like in the New Testament and for a lot of Christian theologians, the redemption seems to work along the lines of something like a revenge sacrifice and Q and as cultural anthropologists have taught us, there's something like a primitive logic, uh, an intensely primitive logic at work behind the notion of the Christian notion of the crucifixion. One of the Fathers Sons Adam, has died. And so the father will avenge that death by murdering someone else. And of course that means murdering another son. And Th th this model of redemption is based on the repetition or a repetition of the initial crime. And this logic of repetition I think is largely responsible for that rhetoric of repetitiveness that, that we hear so often in the father's speech.

Speaker 1:          39:49          And so according to this, we can think of it as a sacrifice theory of redemption or of the atonement God chooses to sacrifice his son. Since someone is going to have to be punished for Adam's sin. That's the logic demands that, but Milton I think can imagine no aspect of his religion, no aspect of Christianity, more barbaric than the image of the father's willing sacrifice of his son. Th th this would be a god truly unworthy of Milton's justification. And Milton struggling here, and there are a few of his contemporaries are doing the same thing in the 17th century, he struggling to bring Christianity in line with certain standards of rationality. And as Dr. Johnson had said in the, in the, in the rest of the sentence that I wrote on the board, Milton wants to show the reasonableness of religion. And so Milton replaces the sacrifice model of the redemption with something like a satisfaction model of redemption.

Speaker 1:          40:56          According to this, according to this way of thinking in Adam's sin, a debt has been incurred and this debt can be satisfied by someone else's payment. So revenge is no longer the motive. It's, it's something like an economic desire simply to balance the books. It, there's something impersonal about this new way of imagining the atonement. And it's here that Milton gives the notion of the Christian redemption. It's, it's particular miltonic twist. Milton's father does not willingly sacrifice the son. He, it's, it's magnificent. He simply asks for a volunteer and, and the son out of his goodness volunteers, he chooses to make himself mortal. And, and, and it's a perfect example. Have I have a foul? Milton has shifted the emphasis away from Christian Orthodoxy and, and, and forcing the authoritarian image of God's sacrifice to yield to Milton's liberal image of a kind of volunteerism or libertarian image of volunteerism.

Speaker 1:          42:01          The son chooses to humiliate himself and subsequently God chooses to compensate that humiliation with the Sun Supreme Exaltation. And you see the extent of this compensation at line three 11 and book three, page two 65, uh, near the bottom of the page, God says to the son, because in the Love Hath abounded more than glory abounds. Therefore the humiliation shall exalt with the dye manhood also to this throne. Here shelt sit here shalt, I'll sit incarnate here. Shelt rain. Both God and Man, son, both of God and man anointed, universal king, all power. I give the reign forever and assume the merits under the, as head supreme Thrones. Princeton's powers dominions, I reduce to reward the son for having sacrificed himself for having sacrificed himself. The father is going to give the son all power and, and this complete, it seems like it's going to come be a complete transference of power and, and it's a transfer that will hold until at the end of time.

Speaker 1:          43:16          There will no longer even be a difference presumably between the father and the son because as the father says at line three 41 God shall be all in all, there will be no power differential whatsoever between the father and the son. And presumably they'll note be no power differential between or among any of us. Um, we're will all be joined at the end of time and one massive liberal nonhierarchical state of heart harmony. And the image of the all in all is, is, is Milton's most exuberant visionary endpoint. And it satisfies, I think a lot of Milton's most liberal impulses and even the authoritarian instruction structure of heaven. And of course Milton's heaven is as a is as authoritarian as, as any heaven has ever been conceived. Um, even it will be transformed into something like a fantasy of, of egalitarianism, a fantasy of absolute equality.

Speaker 1:          44:18          And this ecstatic redistribution of power and glory at the end of time can only come about because the sun has so willingly humiliated himself. He subjects himself to the father's wrath. No, and I think we, I think we recognize this gesture, this image of the noble and voluntary self sacrifice. This is the matter. This is the, this is the image that Milton had established in his defenses of his blindness. Milton had written in the Sonnet that we looked down on Monday, meant to Mr Syriac Skinner. And he had also written in the second defense of the English people that he had willingly sacrificed his site for the good of his fellow Englishman. He lost his eyes over, applied in Liberty's defense, my noble task Milton had written in that sonnet. And in the second defense, Milton explains that he continued to write his regicide treatises despite the advice of his doctors who insisted that he would go blind if he continued.

Speaker 1:          45:16          That's how important the project was for Milton and the sacrifice. And you'll begin to see a way in which the two dominant features of book three, uh, Milton's invocation to light and the discussion of blindness they're in and the dialogue between the father and the son, that, that they're, they're speaking to one another and they're, they're functioning in, in a, in a kind of parallel fashion. So just as the sun's voluntary sacrifice will rewarded with his inheritance on some level, the, the heavenly plot of Paradise lost is essentially an inheritance narrative. Um, the sun's voluntary sacrifice will be rewarded with his inheritance of all of God's power, um, presumably to Milton sacrificed. We'll also be rewarded by God. It's as if Milton wants the same compensation of paternal power that the son had been granted for undergoing his sacrifice. Look, look at, let me see.

Speaker 1:          46:16          What do I have time for the, the transfusion of divine power. That Milton imagines the transfer of power from father to the son if extrapolated to the situation of the poet and his God would, would guarantee the inspired success of the poem. And what would that mean? It would guarantee essentially the status of paradise lost. As as scripture itself as something divinely authorized or perhaps even divinely authored. That at least is is its relation to Milton's personal concern with his own composition of, of paradise lost. But, but this, this image of a kind of divine, divine transfusion of power and an ultimate transference of power also I think speaks to the political component of Milton's theology. You, you having this passage, an image of a transfer of power from a, from a centralized authority, the creator of the entire universe to the humble individual, the, the image supplies, essentially the conceptual foundation for Milton's liberalism, that form of social organization whereby power has been shifted away from the center, away from the monarch and toward the subject.

Speaker 1:          47:39          And you will find images of, of inheritance and of transference. And if transfusion abounding in, in paradise lost and they, and they crop up in all sorts of venues, often having nothing whatsoever to do, um, with the, with the interact, the domestic interactions of the, of the godhead. And these images prepare us for that beautiful but truly outrageous endpoint of Christian history that Milton foresees the point at which God, the, the, the one that God had foretold in his speech to the sun. There will be a point, there will come a point in time in which God shall be all in all. And that's an idea that works on the level of theology to satisfy, uh, nearly every desire to satisfy, uh, the personal, the social and the political desires of what we can, I think, not entirely wrongly. Think of as Milton's idea of the liberal Christian. Okay, I'm going to end there. And uh, we will all read very closely book for, for Wednesday's class.
