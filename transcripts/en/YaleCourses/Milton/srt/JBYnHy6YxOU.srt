1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,650
We ended the last lecture.
Um,

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,080
or actually I ended my last lecture, not,
uh, the last lecture was, was was Matt.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,213
Um,

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,510
I ended my last lecture on Paradise
regained with a brief consideration of the

5
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:16,740
riddle of the Sphinx.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,090
And Satan was compared to the
Sphinx who had the sphinx,

7
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:25,080
who had thrown herself off the as meany
and steep when her riddle had been

8
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:26,000
discovered.
And,

9
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,940
and the son of God you'll remember was
implicitly compared to Oedipus, um,

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,960
who had figured out the riddle
of his own identity with,

11
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,940
by means of his exchange with this sphinx.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,870
I think it can be sent to Samson agonists.

13
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:43,871
Ds is more explicitly concerned with
riddles and with riddling even then

14
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:48,650
paradise regained was one
of the key moments. Although
this isn't anything that,

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,110
that Milton does very much with one of
the key moments of the story of Samson

16
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:53,790
that we get from the
book of judges in the,

17
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:58,500
in the Bible involve Samson's posing
of this big riddle, the riddle of the,

18
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:03,150
of the, of the honey and
the lion. And it's Sampson,

19
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,150
at least in the judges in the
judge's version of the story,

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,750
who can be seen as assuming
the role of the Sphinx.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,930
He poses the riddles and it's really
his duty throughout his life, uh,

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,110
to know when it is.

23
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,290
You should reveal the answer to the riddle
to the secret and Samsung agonists ds

24
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,490
as I think a profoundly
interested in this,

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,010
in this problem.
And it's continually asking the question,

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,010
how do you know when it's time?
How do you know when it's time to,

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,100
to reveal your secrets or to use the
language that Milton uses in the seventh

28
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,930
sonnet? Um, how soon? Half the time.

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,100
How do you know when it
is that you have ripened?

30
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,350
That's a riddle. That is the, it's the,

31
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,450
it's the job of Samson
in Samsung agonists,

32
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,170
gs to figure out the answer to now.
It's one of the,

33
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:01,410
it's one of the ironies of,
of literary history that this poem,

34
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,840
which is really all about
riddles and secrets,

35
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:08,340
this poem surely poses the
biggest riddle for that scholarly,

36
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,440
the academic study of,
of Milton.

37
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,590
It has proven nearly impossible
for scholars of Milton
to determine when it was

38
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:20,550
the Samsung agonists ds to determine or
authoritatively are definitively when it

39
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,730
was that this text was written.
Um,

40
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,700
and so in that respect,
it's utterly different from the,

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,580
the other works of Milton's that can be
dated with much more authoritative flame.

42
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,780
Samsung agonist is, we do know
this, it first appears in 1671,

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,300
it's published alongside
paradise regained.

44
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,590
So you have the title page
of that 1671 volume paradise,

45
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,080
regained a poem and for books.

46
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,960
And then in a little
little type phase two,

47
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,920
which is added Samson
agonist cheese and a,

48
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:56,370
and actually the Hughes
Edition [inaudible] produces
for you just this title

49
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:59,000
page. It's on page four 70. Um,

50
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,100
but there's no hard evidence for the
date of the composition of the poem.

51
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:06,670
And there are conflicting accounts
as of course you can imagine of the,

52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,720
of the date of composition.

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,570
So I want to spend a little bit of time
here and I'll just do this briefly. Um,

54
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,900
thinking about the various
scholarly accounts of the, of,

55
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,640
of when it was that Milton
wrote Samsung agonists, ds.

56
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,910
Because all of these theories I think
concerning the placement of Samson

57
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:22,271
agonists,

58
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:27,160
ds in the miltonic Canon assume in
one way or another that this poem is

59
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,660
autobiographical or that there's some
kind of intimate autobiographical

60
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,900
component, uh, to, to,

61
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,260
to this remarkable work
as if the assumption is,

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,450
is that on some level Sampson agonists,

63
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:44,950
ds almost necessitates a type
of biographical reading. So,

64
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,620
uh, first and this is the most popular
theory of the dating of the poem. Um,

65
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,630
and it's the one I happened to, uh,
and that most people subscribe to. Um,

66
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,860
it's the theory that places Samson
agonists ds as Milton's last poem,

67
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,650
which means that this is a poem that's
written well after, uh, we will,

68
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,090
after the middle of the 1660s,

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,440
Milton seems to have started writing
paradise regained around 1665.

70
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,540
So it would have been after that
at some point well into the Stewart

71
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,410
restoration.

72
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,940
And this reading really suggested Samson
to the extent that this is a dramatic

73
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:25,570
reading of the poem,
suggest that Samson is like Milton,

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,770
the great political hero or the
erstwhile great political hero.

75
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Samson had almost led the Hebrews to
freedom by destroying so many of the

76
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:39,460
Philistines with his extraordinary
divinely inspired violence.

77
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,900
But the Hebrew leaders failed to join
Samsung in this mission and they ruin

78
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:47,590
their chance for freedom
from the Felicity and yoke.

79
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,530
And in the 60s,
50s and in the 1660s,

80
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:55,531
Milton was always continually representing
himself and just this same light with

81
00:04:55,841 --> 00:05:00,370
the help of Milton's own, uh,
aggressively propagandistic efforts.

82
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:05,000
The English had begun a tick to,
to fulfill the promise of a,

83
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:08,860
of something like a full fledged
revolution. But the parlor,

84
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,420
the weak minded parliamentary leaders had
failed to carry it out and out of some

85
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,390
sort of a moral,
moral weakness,

86
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,440
the English people began to yearn
again for a subjection to, to,

87
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,340
to the Stuart monarchy and its response.

88
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,750
It's in response to the tone of political
disappointment that we can read in

89
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,990
Samsung agonists,
Ds,

90
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,400
that scholars are led to date this
work as the late one as a final poem,

91
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,540
the final poem.

92
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,530
Now the second theory of the date of
the composition of Samsung agonists.

93
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:46,531
These places it in the late 1640s in the
period somewhere between 1647 and 1653

94
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,850
and this reading suggests
that Samson agonists,

95
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:56,851
ds constitutes Milton's first great
response to the onset of his blindness by

96
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,500
placing the poem in this period,
you and you can tell what's gone well,

97
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,180
what scholars are responding to
in the poem with this theory,

98
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,230
they're clearly trying to make some
sense of the tremendous amount of pathos.

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,280
And, and you could actually say the
tremendous amount of self pity, uh,

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,300
that charges a Milton's treatment
of Samson's Samson's blindness.

101
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,190
Now the third theory of the,

102
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:27,191
of the poems composition places it even
earlier in Milton's career during the,

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,300
during the early 1640s, this is the
period in which Milton was revived.

104
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,950
Ra was writing the divorce pamphlets.
And in this account, the poem is,

105
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,460
is the center of the poem becomes the,

106
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,700
the betrayal that are become the center
of the poem becomes a reflection or some

107
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:48,610
sort of representation of the betrayal.

108
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,980
Milton must've experienced
himself when his wife,

109
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,760
his wife of six weeks, Mary
Powell left him, um, uh, just,

110
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:02,090
just, just abandoned him. It seemed,
uh, she, she went home to her parents.

111
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,070
Now in the poem in Samson Agonists,
[inaudible] Dolly law,

112
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,300
you'll remember she was a Philistine.

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,600
She was a member of a political
tribe that had so oppressed.

114
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,380
The Hebrews and Mary Pals family had,

115
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,060
had all been royalist during the English
civil wars and to so, so to some extent,

116
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:24,160
Mary Powell, perhaps Mary Powell
herself. Um, what, what was,

117
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:27,400
it was a royalist.
And so the,

118
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,860
the leanings at least of the Powell
family, um, it has been conjectured, um,

119
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:37,570
contributed significantly to what turned
out to be merely the temporary erosion

120
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,180
of Milton's first marriage.
And according to this theory,

121
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:46,150
then the main thrust of Sampson agonists,
ds isn't exclusively political. Um,

122
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,190
but it's domestic or
domestic and political.

123
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,210
And Milton uses a biblical story
to reinvent. And in some way to,

124
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,870
to work through, uh, you know,
the private disaster that was,

125
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,230
that was the early portion of
his marriage to Mary Powell.

126
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,710
Now I think the third theory is
it, it has to be wrong, um, that,

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,140
that Samsung agonists, Ds was written so
early in Milton's career in the 1640s,

128
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,260
but,
uh,

129
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,170
I'm personally much too invested in the
notion that this is the last poem, um,

130
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,010
to, to, to have its status
be relinquished as a,

131
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:25,790
as a post restoration work. But
nonetheless, I want to think about that,

132
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,920
that third option that I've,

133
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,060
that I've just mentioned and to focus
on the nature of the relation of the

134
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:36,470
nature of Milton's representation
of the relation of Samson to Dilla.

135
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,870
Two Dalai Lama in this poem,
um,

136
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,690
which is an undeniable and undeniably
powerful aspect of this work.

137
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,590
Let me, um, let me, uh,

138
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,570
just digress here for a moment and
explain to you why I pronounced her name

139
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,980
Dolly Law and not Delilah. So when
I'm, when I used the word Delilah,

140
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,830
this lecture that will be referring to
the character in the Old Testament from

141
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,680
the book of judges,
the name with an h on the end,

142
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,720
a Milton doesn't have an h on the
end. He uses the Latin spelling, um,

143
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:10,260
from the Latin Bible of all
the characters in Samson.

144
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:15,120
Agonisti so the father is
Manawa rather than Minoa. Um,

145
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,140
he makes up the name [inaudible] but
it's along the same sort of Latin Nate

146
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,710
lines of DOL, Layla and Manoa. Um,

147
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,420
who knows why Milton wants to class
size these names rather than using,

148
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,160
uh, the English transliteration
of the, of the Hebrew. Um,

149
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,140
it's been conjectured that is just, it
sounds prettier. Uh, you have a line like

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,310
the sumptuous Dolly
love floating this way,

151
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,170
those extraordinary doctorals that
seem incredibly central and seductive.

152
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,390
You couldn't have that with Delilah.

153
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,050
There's some shoe was Delilah floating
this way? It just doesn't, it's not as,

154
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,420
it's not a sexy. Okay. That
was just a, a pronunciation.

155
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:58,254
Degression.

156
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,940
Now the evidence for Milton's,
uh,

157
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,170
for the scholars who, who
date this poem as, as, as,

158
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:11,910
as a really early one, is usually
taken from the scene in Milton's life.

159
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,410
Um, that actually was narrated for us
by Milton's nephew, Edward Philips.

160
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,480
So I'm going to ask you
to turn to Milton's nephew
Edward Phillips's biography

161
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,840
of Milton at the end of the hues edition.

162
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:28,530
So this is page 1032 in the Hughes.

163
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,110
This is Phillips, his account of
how Milton and Mary Powell reunited.

164
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,670
And it's an a, it's a, it's a,

165
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:39,990
it's an absolutely adorable narrative
and involves an elaborate trick straight

166
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:43,110
staged by friends of both
Milton and of Powell.

167
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,200
So we learned here and we
learn that it's a, it's a,

168
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,620
it's an amazing little window into what
the texture of this man's life was like.

169
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,790
A Milton was evidently in the habit
in the six weeks he lived alone as the

170
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:57,360
abandoned husband.
He was in the habit of visiting a friend.

171
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,500
We don't know who this guy was,

172
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,860
but a friend named Blackborow
and according to Phillips,

173
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,400
this is the top of the right hand
column according to Phillips.

174
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:10,110
It was at black Burrow's house that the
scheme to reunite the couple to reunite

175
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:11,550
them was pulled off.

176
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,990
So I'm quoting here from
Phillips one time above the rest,

177
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,720
he,
John Melton making his usual visit.

178
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,410
The wife was ready in another room and
on a sudden he was surprised to see one

179
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:30,111
whom he thought to have never seen more
making submission and begging pardon on

180
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:31,560
her knees before him.

181
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,880
He might probably at first make some
so show of aversion and rejection,

182
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,340
but partly his own generous nature.

183
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,740
And this is the loving Phillips
who so admires the uncle, um,

184
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,670
but partly his own generous nature.

185
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:52,671
More inclined to reconciliation then to
perseverance in anger and revenge and

186
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:56,440
partly the strong intercession.
Have friends on both sides.

187
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,650
Soon brought him to an act of oblivion
and affirm league of peace for the

188
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:07,070
future. And Mary Powell and John Milton
get back together again and they,

189
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,980
they have a, they have a child,
they have a few children.

190
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,990
Um,
this,

191
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,030
this seen bears and obvious resemblance
to the initial entrance of Dolly law

192
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,200
into the poem. Samson agonists, ds. Um,

193
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,780
now there's, there's no proof. Of
course. Then Milton Samson is a,

194
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:33,030
is a reworking of this biographical
event in the stormy life. That was,

195
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,630
that was Milton's domestic,

196
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,460
the Stormy's career of Hilton's domestic,
uh,

197
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,300
domestic life. Um, there's no proof
that this event ever happened at all.

198
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,010
And my guest actually is that Phillips
who's writing this biographical

199
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:50,740
narrative, well after the
publication of Samsung agonists,

200
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:55,741
Ds is actually staging his account of
this moment in Milton's life in some ways,

201
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,000
a reworking of the analogous moment
from Samson agonist. These, um,

202
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,650
I think he's giving us an, an imaginative
engagement of Sampson agonists decent.

203
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,900
He's probably because he's,

204
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,370
he wants to stave off what
he knows will be the easy,

205
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,350
obvious auto biographical reading that
we'll bring to Milton's poetic death,

206
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,790
a representation of a perfectly
disastrous marriage. So I don't,

207
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,070
I don't actually trust
Phillips's biography here,

208
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:27,430
but I want to linger on this passage for
just another moment because I think it

209
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,520
starts to aluminate.
Uh,

210
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:34,490
one of the most puzzling aspects
of Sampson agonists, ds. Um,

211
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,620
look at that.

212
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,620
Look at Phillips is metaphor in the
last sentence that I just quoted.

213
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,500
Milton's own generous nature brought him
to an act of oblivion and affirm league

214
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,600
of peace for the future.

215
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,040
Phillips is alluding here
to actual political events,

216
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,370
political events that took
place not in the 1640s.

217
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,150
When this reunion,
we know this reunion occurred,

218
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,540
but after the restoration that the act
of oblivion and the League of peace are

219
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:08,671
both actual political events that
followed the restoration of the Stuart

220
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:10,390
monarchy in 1660.

221
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,790
So the royalists in 1660
passed the act of oblivion,

222
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,140
the act of oblivion,

223
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:22,141
that profit prohibited
any further punishment of
puritans who were seen to have

224
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:26,950
behaved suspiciously, uh,
during the revolution. So in a,

225
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,840
in a gesture of magnanimity,

226
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,580
the royalists were agreeing to
be oblivious. They would forget,

227
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,640
they would forget the crimes of
the Puritan parliamentarians.

228
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:41,530
And one of the most notable beneficiaries
in fact of this act of oblivion was

229
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:45,100
Milton himself, Milton,
whose life was I think,

230
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:48,910
really mercifully spared. Um,
uh, after the registration,

231
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:53,911
he could easily have been prosecuted
and executed for his composition of the

232
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,150
regicide. Trina says, then once, I
think it's fascinating what Phillips is,

233
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,070
is doing here.
He situation,

234
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,220
he situates the relation of husband
and wife in the context of a political

235
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:10,830
accord, a political agreement between
two warring parties. And, and,

236
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,720
and in doing so, he's reproducing, I
think, one of the strangest aspects.

237
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,710
And it is a really strange
aspect of this poem that's the,

238
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,020
the remarkable conjunction
of the representation of
love and the representation

239
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,470
of, of war, uh, the,

240
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:30,620
the militaristic nature of sexual
relations in Samsung agonists, Ds,

241
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:35,621
and also the disturbingly sexual
nature of political conflict as it's

242
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:40,220
represented in Samson agonist ds and to,
and we won't,

243
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,680
we'll pursue that in a moment.
So one of the curious elements of,

244
00:15:44,681 --> 00:15:48,200
of Phillips as account of Mary Powell,
his return is the implicit reversal,

245
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,780
I think, of, of political identities here.

246
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Milton becomes the royalist passing the
act of oblivion by way of forgiving Mary

247
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,950
Powell and that, so the, these domestic
enemies Powell and Milton have become,

248
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,570
it says, if they become mirror
images of one another, the, the,

249
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:08,540
the moral alignment of their
identities suddenly becomes in this,

250
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:13,050
in this retelling of it. Um, vague
and, and indistinct. And it'll,

251
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:13,731
in a lot of ways,

252
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:16,640
they're kind of pictured like Satan and
the son of God and paradise regained.

253
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,680
Satan's in so many ways, seems to be the
son of God's evil twin. There are mirror,

254
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,100
they're mirror images of one another,
but obviously they represent, uh,

255
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,420
utterly different things.

256
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,890
The Sun you'll remember in paradise
regained only discovers his identity in

257
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:37,930
paradise in that poem in
opposition to Satan. And the,

258
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:40,820
this is something that the late poems
of Milton are continually doing.

259
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:45,280
They're exploring what we can think
of as the dialectical nature of,

260
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,990
of identification.
Um,

261
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,710
virtue cannot exist in a vacuum.
And in fact,

262
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,100
I think for Milton, the, the
knowledge of oneself can't, uh,

263
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,070
come about in, in, in a vacuum. Um,

264
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:04,090
any virtuous identity will inevitably be
the process will be the product of some

265
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:11,081
kind of antithetical process of some sort
of agonistic encounter with ones with

266
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:12,824
ones opposite.

267
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,170
Now the antithetical construction of
the heroes identity is really central to

268
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,720
this poem, a Samsung agonists, ds. And,

269
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:25,721
and I think keeping this in mind
will help us try to make sense of,

270
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,910
of some of its most troubling components.

271
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:32,180
And I think the components
of Sampson agonist,

272
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:35,840
these are as troubling as anything
you'll find anywhere in, uh,

273
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,930
in the reading for this course.
Um,

274
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,730
and for me what's most
troubling is this fat.

275
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,010
And this is an undeniable
unquestionable fact. Samson agonists,

276
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,020
[inaudible] is the or gives
us the intensivist expression
of misogyny that you

277
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:57,780
will find in the miltonic Canon. And
that's because this program goes further,

278
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,970
I think, than any of Milton's other poems
in narrowing the problem of identity.

279
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,020
And this is a problem that Milton
has been concerned with all along,

280
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,070
but narrowing this larger problem of
identity to the much more circumscribed,

281
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:16,960
the much more focused question, a
problem of sexual identity, the,

282
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,030
the masculine heroes identity can only
be established by contraries by an some

283
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,420
sort of antithetical process.

284
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,130
Samsung can only identify
himself as a hero by rejecting,

285
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:34,131
by actively excluding absolutely
everything that's not masculine.

286
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,950
Every rejecting everything
that's not heroic,

287
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,720
rejecting everything that's not Samson
and it's a,

288
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:46,200
and it becomes a kind of violent
process of rejection. Um,

289
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,890
the character Samson is
continually impelled,

290
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,070
it seems by a powerful
need to expel all forms of,

291
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,690
of sensual pleasure,

292
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,910
the types of pleasure that we know
to be prized and sanctioned by, by,

293
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,800
by, by Milton, um,

294
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,660
forms of sexual pleasure that Milton
will identify and Samson agonists,

295
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:14,640
ds as types of femininity.

296
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,050
And all of this has to be
expelled by Samson from Samson.

297
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,510
And as you reread the poem,
I think you'll, you'll,

298
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:23,670
you'll be shocked if you
haven't been shocked already.

299
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:28,671
You will be shocked by the violence of
the really weirdly sexualized rhetoric

300
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:34,440
that makes up so much of the,
the metaphorical texture of this poem.

301
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,820
I'll give you just one example.
There are innumerable examples.

302
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,870
You may have noticed how this poem refers
routinely to the Philistine enemies as

303
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:50,520
the, um, as the uncircumcised. And,
and this is to be on some level,

304
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,600
this is to be expected.

305
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:56,490
The Bible refers to havens
as the uncircumcised.

306
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,020
And so this is conventional, we could
say. But Milton, of course, it goes,

307
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,960
goes needlessly,
goes further than that.

308
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,320
And he actually refers to
the enemies of the Hebrews.

309
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,680
As for skins,

310
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,710
with his sort of bones,
Samson slew a thousand for skins.

311
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,910
This is an unbelievable
synecdoche [inaudible].

312
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,510
He being the rhetorical trope
of using a part for a whole.

313
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,250
And Milton as far as I can tell,

314
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:30,330
had absolutely no precedent whatsoever
for the use of this predict earlier

315
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,500
particular synectics [inaudible] to refer
to an entire people the enemies of the

316
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,950
uncircumcised enemies of the Hebrews.

317
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,480
There's a kind of sexual violence
continually welling up in the,

318
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,830
in the rhetoric used to
describe political violence.

319
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,660
Um,
and think about what that,

320
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:54,900
what that implies to slay a thousand
for skins is in some way to imagine a

321
00:20:55,241 --> 00:21:00,241
military victory as something like a mass
circumcision or symbolically some type

322
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:05,800
of mass mass castration.
And this is just one,

323
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,380
one of many examples of,
of,

324
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:12,330
of a related kind of figurative
pattern in Samsung agonists, ds, um,

325
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,980
political violence seems so
continually to be figured in the,

326
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,380
in the literary rhetoric of
this poem as a sexual cleansing,

327
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,740
as a kind of purging the painful
excision of something unclean,

328
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,540
um, something presumably unnecessary
and something excessively sensual.

329
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,200
Look, for example, at the way this,

330
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,550
this text sexualizes the key event,

331
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:44,440
um, in Samson's life, which is
of course the loss of his hair.

332
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,560
Uh, look at Samson's account
of the moment of his, the,

333
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,690
the moment at which he lost his strength.

334
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,020
This is a page five 64 in the Hughes
lies lines five 29 and following

335
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,600
now when the book of judges,

336
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,550
a Samson tells Delilah that the secret
of his strength lies in his hair.

337
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,320
Only after her continued verbal assaults,
she pleads with him,

338
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,270
she nags him, she pleads with him,
unremittingly to tell her his,

339
00:22:13,271 --> 00:22:17,620
his secret. And finally he just freelance.
That's the, that's the scriptural story.

340
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,930
But in Sampson's accounting, in Melton
story, Dalai Lama doesn't harass,

341
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,130
harass Samson into telling the secret.
She seduces him.

342
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,500
Look at line five 29.
This is Samsung talking and here he's the,

343
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,390
he describes, he describes himself
as the cock of the walk here.

344
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,090
Fearless of danger,
like a petty God.

345
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:44,950
I walked about admired of all
and dreaded on hostile ground.

346
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,480
None Daring Maya Front,

347
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,030
then swollen with pride into the snare.
I fell of bear,

348
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,070
fallacious looks venereal.

349
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:58,480
Trains softened with
pleasure and voluptuous life.

350
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,010
Now the voluptuous life that he's
describing here in line five 30 forest.

351
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,190
What is this?
Uh,

352
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,900
I think this is what we would
have to name the life of marriage.

353
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,221
Um, the, the,

354
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:16,930
the woman he's to calling a deceitful
concubine is actually in Milton's telling

355
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:20,710
of this story. Samson's
wife. And there's a,

356
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:23,860
there's a profound confusion about the
cause of his weakness here. Was it,

357
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,270
was it the actual act of
his head being shaved or,

358
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,740
or simply the state, the
condition of marriage, this
condition of marriage itself.

359
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,910
Um, listen to Milton's
figuration of the event,

360
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,280
of the cutting of his hair.
And,

361
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:45,430
and you tell me if this is an unusually
charged even for Milton with I'm a

362
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:50,921
pretty intense degree of sexual anxiety
at length to lay my head and hallowed

363
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:57,071
pledge of all my strength
in the lascivious lap of
a deceitful concubine who

364
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:03,680
shore me like a tame weather.
All my precious fleece.

365
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,380
Um, you, you haven't, you haven't,
you have an image here of,

366
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,900
of sexual intercourse.
This is the,

367
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:16,640
this has been suggested in a brilliant
reading of this poem by John Gallery, um,

368
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,700
embedded in the image of Samson's head
in the doll and Dolly Liz lascivious lap.

369
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,290
Um, her, her violation of Samson, her
cutting of his hair seems almost extreme,

370
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,940
inextricable here from a,
from a perfectly simple seemingly,

371
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,740
it's never simple of course, but
an act of conjugal intercourse. Um,

372
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,900
but the figurative
chain doesn't end there.

373
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:43,440
It gets better or worse depending
on your, on your perspective. Um,

374
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,570
because in this play,
marital intercourse is equated,

375
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,810
at least figuratively,
is equated with castration,

376
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:54,770
the cutting off of the hallowed
pledge of Samson's strength.

377
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:59,630
And Samson makes this explicit when he
describes himself as a team, whether,

378
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:04,100
but what is a, whether you ask a
whether is a, is a castrated ram,

379
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:05,880
the slot,

380
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,880
the slayer of a thousand for
skins is himself slain and,

381
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,860
and part of the intensely
violent figurative world of,
of Samson agonist. These,

382
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:19,730
this is a world that continually
identifies Dolly Luz.

383
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:24,410
Betrayal as a kind of
castration and castration
itself has nothing more than the

384
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:27,770
male experience in marriage.
Um,

385
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,720
a darker or more anxious reading of the
relation between the sexes. You will,

386
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,600
you'll have a,
you'll have a difficult time finding.

387
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,850
Uh,
let's look now at Dolly Liz own language.

388
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,280
Uh,
turn to page 570 in the Hughes.

389
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:53,960
Um,
a round line hundred 803,

390
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,530
eight [inaudible] three.
Uh,

391
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,780
and I think Darlene was languages and a
lot of ways just as powerful though it's

392
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:02,720
configured a little differently,
much more than Samson.

393
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,570
Dolly La contradicts herself
throughout this poem. And, and the,

394
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:10,400
and the contradictions have proven
baffling, uh, to, to the poems critics.

395
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,190
Now, one way of reading the
character dollar law is to,

396
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:18,191
is to insist that are
contradictions a point point out,

397
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,370
emphasize her mendacity. These are
just simply lies that she's telling.

398
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,940
And in a lot of ways Milton does seem
to be setting her up as a type of, of,

399
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:26,774
of Satan.

400
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,530
Satan who own mount knife eighties at
the beginning of book four of paradise

401
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:34,470
lost was continually contradicting
himself. Um, and, and,

402
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:39,440
and critics have typically dismiss Dolly
Liz explanations for justifications of

403
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:41,070
her behavior,
um,

404
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,660
and with the assumption that Milton is
simply trying to discredit her and it's

405
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:50,040
not a, it's not an unjustifiable
assumption. And, and,

406
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,200
and I think that's because the,

407
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:56,201
the central contradiction of for
discourse involves her use of two types of

408
00:26:56,791 --> 00:27:01,110
arguments. The first is an
erotic or romantic argument.

409
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,970
And the second argument she deploys
is a political one. And once again,

410
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:07,140
it's this conjunction,

411
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,980
the conjunction of the sexual and the
political that in this poem proves so,

412
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,150
so unsettling and so,
so puzzling. So let's,

413
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,970
let's look at Dolly Luz reasons
for betraying her husband.

414
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,960
This is her first argument line eight
oh three. She's essentially saying,

415
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:25,770
I wanted you at home. You were always
going out. You're working all the time.

416
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,970
I knew that liberty would draw the
fourth to perilous enterprises while I at

417
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:37,371
home set full of cares and fears whaling
thy absence in my widowed bed here.

418
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,390
I should still enjoy the
day and night here at home.

419
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,070
I should still enjoy the day and night.
Mine and loves prisoner.

420
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,320
I unmanned you.
She's saying because I loved you so much.

421
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,610
That's the gist of the argument.
Um,

422
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,730
Dalai Lama's second argument is entirely
different. Um, and it's the, it's, it's,

423
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,720
it's distinct from the complaint
of the housewife that we just,

424
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,290
that we just looked at.
Look at the top. No,

425
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:09,870
look at the very bottom of page five 71.

426
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,770
This is line eight 57 and following here,

427
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:17,910
Dali law tells us that she, she had to
betray Samson for political reasons.

428
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:21,570
She had to do it to liberate her people.
The Philistines,

429
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,560
the priest was not behind.
Darla law says,

430
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,110
but ever at my ear preaching how
meritorious with the Gods it would be to

431
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:34,740
ensnare an irreligious
dishonor of day gone.

432
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,360
What had I to oppose against
such powerful arguments.

433
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,730
Only my love of the how long
debate and combated in silence.

434
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:48,510
All these reasons with
hard contest at length,

435
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:53,810
that grounded maxim so rife and celebrated
in the mouths of wisest men that to

436
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:56,520
the public good private respects,

437
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:59,220
must yield with grave authority,

438
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,960
took full possession of me and prevailed.
Virtue as I thought,

439
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,820
truth duty.

440
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:11,330
So in joining and Delillo here gives
us an extraordinary revelation.

441
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:15,690
She turns out to be on some level.

442
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:20,280
She turns out to be the mirror
image of the great heroic Samson.

443
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:24,060
She plays the same role as
the deliverer of her people.

444
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:29,061
She's the deliverer of the Philistines
that Samson plays for the Hebrews.

445
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,240
She defends the Gentile God day gone and,
and Samson,

446
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:37,020
her husband defends, uh, the Hebrew God,

447
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,590
Yahweh or Jehovah. Um, they're,

448
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:44,260
it's in direct competition here.
They're, they're political opposites.

449
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:47,950
And Milton is playing with the kind of
something approaching a sort of cultural

450
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:52,540
relativism by means of his
representation of this competition.

451
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,960
There is however, a difference
between them and it's a difference.

452
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,400
We have no choice but
to, to, to deal with the,

453
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,900
the difference between
them is that Dolly law,

454
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,320
the wife sacrifices private concerns
for a public commitment to her people.

455
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,000
She yields in her word, she reels
private respects to the public good.

456
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,840
This is precisely what
Samson was supposed to do.

457
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,530
But of course this is exactly
what Samson failed to do.

458
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,390
So the a and a lot of ways the,
these two explanations,

459
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,940
these two arguments of dollar
loans contradict one another.

460
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,270
And on the literal level of the plot,
the first motive,

461
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:35,080
the motive appropriate for
a wife is revealed as a lie.

462
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,540
But the, but the presence of
these two conflicting motives, um,

463
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:41,800
bespeaks more,
I think,

464
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:46,700
than the mere fact that Dalai Lama is a
liar or some way in some way the Dolly

465
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:50,530
loves a satanic figure WHO's Justin?
A very embodiment of evil.

466
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,140
That these two conflicting
arguments really speak to
Samson's deepest anxieties.

467
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,890
And perhaps the deepest anxieties of
this poem, Sampson Agonists, these,

468
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:05,250
the prospect of domestic pleasure is
invariably a dangerous one for Samson.

469
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,710
And that's because domestic success,

470
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:13,600
success at home for Samson
is indistinguishable from,

471
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:18,040
from political defeat. Um, Darlene lists
two arguments are, are, are, are utterly.

472
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,750
It's as if inside of Satan,
Satan Samson's head,

473
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,700
they're utterly intermingled with one
another and inextricable in Samson psyche

474
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,950
in the severely restricted,

475
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,350
circumscribed world of this
hero's consciousness. Um,

476
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,480
domestic comfort and political failure.

477
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,920
S turn out to be something like one in
the same thing. I'm in both instances,

478
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:45,580
the hero is seen to have
relinquished his masculinity.

479
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,420
He's undergone a humiliating defeat.

480
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,670
And with this dual identification of
Dhalla as wife and us and as fierce

481
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:55,670
warrior,
um,

482
00:31:55,671 --> 00:32:00,190
you have a sense of the fragility of
a powerful sense of the fragility of

483
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:04,750
masculine, heroic consciousness
as it's represented in this,

484
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:07,210
in this text.
Okay,

485
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:11,110
turn now to Dhalla's
final offer to Samson.

486
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,860
This is line nine 20 a the
middle of the huge page five 73.

487
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,730
The most tempting and the most terrifying
offer of Dolly laws is her offer to

488
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:28,210
nurse Samsung.
He's old.

489
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:32,980
He's blind, um, to nurse him
after his release from the prison.

490
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,530
So Dolly tells Samson I to the Lord's
will intercede not doubting their

491
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:42,230
favorable ear,

492
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,680
that I may fetch the from forth this
load some prison house to abide with me

493
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,990
where my redoubled love and care
with nursing diligence to my glad,

494
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,571
to me,

495
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:58,571
glad office may ever tend about the
two old age with her nursing diligence.

496
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:05,880
Dolly luck can perform the work
of, she can be Samson's nurse, uh,

497
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,410
better yet she can function
as Samson's mother.

498
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:14,150
I think that's essentially the gist of
her argument. Sampson has already claimed,

499
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:16,730
we know this was at line six 33.

500
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:21,590
He's claimed that he is a nurse Ling of
God and he's been struggling throughout

501
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:25,820
this text to establish himself as a child,
not of human parents,

502
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:31,230
um, certainly not of this
perfectly sweet natured, but v uh,

503
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:34,220
kind of adult dad of his [inaudible].
Um,

504
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,620
but he's a child solely exclusively
of God himself. And so it's,

505
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:43,621
Dolly was offered to nurse Samson
that elicits his most violent,

506
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:47,710
the most powerful fit of rage.
And it's, it's, it's horrible.

507
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,170
Look at line nine 52,
Darla says,

508
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,540
let me approach at least,
and touch by hand

509
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,280
in Samson's response.
Shocking,

510
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,010
not for thy life.
Less fierce remembrance.

511
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Wake my sudden rage to
tear the joint by joint.

512
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,380
It's Dolly Liz.

513
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:22,370
Simple offer to touch Samson's hand,
uh,

514
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:26,830
has received an extraordinarily
extreme, uh, reaction.

515
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,570
And it's usually thought this,
this typically how we read this.

516
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:35,430
I think that the fierce remembrance
that will awaken Samson is his room,

517
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,610
is his memory of his powerful
desire for her. A memory that,

518
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:44,150
that he has to forestall with
this violent rejection. But,

519
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,040
but I think the violence of
this, of this reaction, uh,

520
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:52,540
surely exceeds the violence. Myriad
merely have a remembered sexual passion.

521
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:54,790
This is,
this is too intense even for that.

522
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,930
And I think it's possible to see in this
reaction to Dolly has offered to nurse

523
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,440
Samson another memory that,

524
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,970
that that has been suppressed.
Um, and, and it's not just a memo,

525
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,660
not just the remembrance of a
sexual, bisexual love. And our,

526
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:16,200
our best clue to this suppressed memory
might come from that aspect of this

527
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:20,740
story of Samson from the book of judges
that has been most notice simply have

528
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:24,850
suppressed, perhaps it's been
circumcised from Milton's,

529
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,550
from Milton's own poem.
Um,

530
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,600
you'll remember from your reading of
the poem that Milton is continually

531
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:36,601
referring to the Heavenly Messenger
who descended to prophesied Samson's

532
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,150
Sampson's greatness. Uh, this
was happening well before
Samson was actually born,

533
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,470
but to whom?
To whom did this heavenly messenger speak,

534
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,810
the angel spoke according
to the judge's story,

535
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:53,811
the angel spoke to Samson's mother or a
character who figures prominently in the

536
00:35:54,391 --> 00:35:55,920
scriptural original of the story,

537
00:35:55,921 --> 00:36:00,780
but who was very carefully excluded
from the text of Samson agonists. These,

538
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,740
um, and I'm, I'm, I'm indebted
for this point to, uh, to, uh,

539
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,160
a wonderful reading of this poem by, uh,
I think she's a great Milton Krennic.

540
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,400
Her name is Stevie
Davies. Um, in, in this,

541
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:19,980
in Samson's violent rejection of Dalai
Lama and his rejection of her offer to

542
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:22,500
nurse him in his old age,

543
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,710
Samson is rejecting on some
level the very existence of a,

544
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:29,191
of his mother.

545
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:33,330
He's denying the obvious fact that
he had ever been mothered at all. Um,

546
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,440
W which is another way of course of
don denying his humanity of denying his

547
00:36:38,491 --> 00:36:40,890
status as a creature has creativeness.

548
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,620
Now it has been years now
Milton has four years,

549
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:52,130
addressed himself to the attraction and
also to the danger of the fantasy of

550
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,100
heroic self sufficiency. Um, I'll,

551
00:36:56,101 --> 00:37:00,180
I'll just remind you of book
five of Paradise Lost in
which Milton explored the,

552
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,590
the fantasy of self creation.
Satan's remarkable.

553
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,840
And of course, implausible claim that
he was, that, that he was self be got.

554
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Satan needed to deny he wanted to
deny God's agency in his creation.

555
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,110
Now Samson's case is related,
but of course it's a little different.

556
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,760
I'm Samson wants more than
anything to be a nurse Ling of God.

557
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,450
And it's as if he needs to deny that he
had ever had any tie to the womb or to

558
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:35,121
the breast of an earthly mother if he
is to be the nursing exclusively of God.

559
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,610
Of course,
it's the fact the existence of the mother.

560
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,430
That is the thing that
guarantees the truth,

561
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:45,960
which is that he is inescapably human.
Um,

562
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,180
but like us,

563
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,510
Samson obviously owes a fundamental
physical debt of fundamental physiological

564
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,920
debt and obligation to a mother.
And,

565
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,490
and there's a sense in this poem that
the very existence of the mother of any

566
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:07,380
mother seems to doom all of our attempts
to think of ourselves as independent,

567
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,460
as, as autonomous in any
way self sufficient beings,

568
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,600
or to think of ourselves as beings whose
primary debt can be exclusively to the

569
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:16,500
heavenly father.

570
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,100
And Milton Milton had been so bold in,
in,

571
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,110
in paradise regained to emphasize
the thorough going humanity of the,

572
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:31,380
uh, of the son of God. He had, he had the,
the, the son of God and paradise regained,

573
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:34,830
had no more divine knowledge about
his situation. It seemed then,

574
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:38,200
then we could possibly have had,
um,

575
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,940
that it's in, that we're, we're,

576
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:46,100
Milton should have been anxious
about the humanity of the hero. Um,

577
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,250
but all of that theological anxiety
that should have existed in paradise

578
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:55,880
regained seems to have been displaced
onto, onto Sampson agonists, ds,

579
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:00,760
um, turn to the very opening
of Samson agonist. These,

580
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,021
the,
the,

581
00:39:02,021 --> 00:39:06,970
the exquisitely beautiful lines
with which Milton begins this poem.

582
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,070
A little onward.

583
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:14,360
Len did thy guiding hand to these
dark steps a little further on,

584
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,940
a little onward lend by guiding hand
to these dark steps a little further on

585
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,750
Milton Milton's poem opens with,
with these beautiful lines

586
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,190
addressed by Samson to someone
presumably who's holding his hand,

587
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,770
who is touching his hand.

588
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,210
And he's an assisting his
movements in his blindness,

589
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,220
Samson's wandering steps and slow.
And,

590
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,700
and the sense of absolute dependence
here is, is, is that with which we began,

591
00:39:47,701 --> 00:39:51,450
this palm is overwhelming and it's often
argued that Milton is suggesting here

592
00:39:51,451 --> 00:39:54,750
something like Samson's
complete dependence on God.

593
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:56,550
This is the nurse Ling of God.
After all,

594
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,440
Samson's ultimate victory comes from his
absolute submission to the will of God.

595
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:05,280
This much we will learn at the end
of the poem, but the character,

596
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,320
it's a character. In fact, it's
not. It's not, uh, the divinity.

597
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,400
The character leading Sampson around at
the opening of the play has never named

598
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,280
this characters never identified.
And this mysterious omission is,

599
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:23,070
is certainly has to be purposeful.
Um,

600
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,190
the, and the, and this is a,

601
00:40:26,191 --> 00:40:30,200
another clever argument forwarded by
Stevie Davies that the unnamed character

602
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:35,201
holding Samson's hand reminds us here of
another unnamed character in the Samson

603
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:37,611
Story.

604
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:42,611
And that's of course Samson's mother
Samson as the champion of the Hebrews is

605
00:40:42,771 --> 00:40:46,610
supposed to be able to submit himself
utterly to the will of the father.

606
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,880
Not Manoa but the heavenly father.

607
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,380
But the play reminds us overwhelmingly
and continually that even the greatest

608
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:56,570
heroes are our subject.
And this,

609
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,000
you can tell that Milton was an enormous
fan of Shakespeare stragedy Cory

610
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:04,260
Elena's which to explore a
lot of the same problems, um,

611
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,440
that even the greatest heroes are subject
to other far less dignified forms of,

612
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,610
of submission.

613
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,940
And that human figure most likely to
lend a hand to one steady steps is

614
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:18,860
obviously the mother that the, the, the,

615
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:23,870
the person in the child's life who
touches the child's hand and serves as his

616
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:29,480
first guide, first teacher in,

617
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,191
in paradise,

618
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:34,340
regained Milton was after all that
we went through in paradise regained,

619
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:39,341
Milton was able to allow the sun to
return home to his mother's house.

620
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:46,010
He unobserved home to his mother's house,
private returned,

621
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:52,010
the son of God had successfully proven
his son ship to the heavenly father and

622
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:56,710
he could thereby a Ford to
return to the domestic space. Uh,

623
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,530
of course it's a domestic space that
had been utterly purged of any, any,

624
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:05,240
any type of sensuality.
But in Samson agonists does this,

625
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,350
this space,

626
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,560
the place of maternal affection and
domestic piece of just happiness in one's

627
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:16,781
domestic life is continually
threatening to contaminate the hero.

628
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,010
Um, and obviously this is a hero who has
a lot less well adjusted. We could say,

629
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,620
um, then the son of God, um,

630
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:31,460
I that didn't make any sense, but on
some level, at least to me it does. Um,

631
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,520
heroism in this poem depends on
the heroes ability to exclude,

632
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,560
uh, to expunge from his system
any attachment to the home.

633
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,870
Any dependency on an
origin that could come,

634
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,570
could compete with the ultimate origin,

635
00:42:47,571 --> 00:42:49,520
which is of course that if
they haven't only father,

636
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:52,400
and that's why this poem
is continually voicing.

637
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:57,790
It's terrible conviction in the
necessary exclusion of all things,

638
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,250
of all things feminine. And
it's in respect, I think,

639
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:03,710
to this exclusion that we
can best understand the,

640
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:08,980
the horrible violence and the terrible
misogyny charging the language of,

641
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:13,430
of, of Samson agonists,
these, this, this poem,

642
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,490
this play that's not really a play.
Um,

643
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:20,000
seems to be arguing for
the necessary exclusion

644
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:26,390
of the feminine from the Hero's life.
And if that's true,

645
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:30,710
if that is the old one of the ultimate
arguments that Samson agonists,

646
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:33,890
ds is actually making than where
I think we also have in this poem,

647
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,330
the pain and also the painful rhetoric.
Um,

648
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,763
we have the,

649
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,670
the painful sense that Milton gives us
of the cost of that exclusion here in,

650
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:49,520
in,
in Milton's final poem,

651
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:54,521
we have an acknowledgement that the
process whereby one becomes the miltonic

652
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:59,450
hero is potentially ruinous.

653
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,350
Okay. That's a, that's it for today.
