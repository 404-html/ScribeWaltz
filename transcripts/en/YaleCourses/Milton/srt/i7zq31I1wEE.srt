1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,681
We looked,

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:06,681
we looked last time at Saint Peter's
declamatory speech in enlisted us,

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:11,760
and we spent a lot of time on it and we
looked at its relation to the new career.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,540
The John Milton,
uh,

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,720
ended up assuming in the late
teen 16 in the late 1630s,

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:21,900
the,
this new career as a polemical,

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,260
a writer of political pros and Milton
becomes increasingly in this period.

8
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:32,040
And this is the period of the, of
the, of the English revolution.

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:36,570
It's what is the English revolution you
ask? Uh, whether that's a good question.

10
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:39,480
And there they're still,
um, in numerable, uh,

11
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:43,110
often competing answers to that question,
but it seems to be more or less,

12
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,930
this is one way of framing,
framing an answer.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,480
It seems more or less to
be a puritan revolution.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,040
Middleclass puritans like John Milton,
um,

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,210
find themselves upholding the authority
of Parliament over the authority of King

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,040
Charles and over the authority
of the official Church of
England. Um, that's the,

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,980
the roughest possible sketch of
what the English revolution is. Um,

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,020
we find ourselves in today's reading area.

19
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,170
Politica in the middle of
the English revolution,

20
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,940
sometimes called the puritan revolution.

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,290
It's in this period that
Milton increasingly begins
to adopt or assume Saint

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,510
Peter's a confident and
denunciatory rhetoric. Um,

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,500
he adopts it as his own.
Milton does,

24
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:35,850
and he writes a series of treatises and
supportive, uh, and this is a really,

25
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:40,851
really out there and he alienates a lot
of his natural organic base with these

26
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:42,570
actions.

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,680
But Milton writes a series of treatises
in support of the right to divorce a

28
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:50,490
divorce for reasons of in compatibility.
And he continues to assist.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,560
The Puritan left the progressive
movement in overthrowing the hierarchical

30
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:59,940
structure of the, of the Church
of England. The bishops, uh,

31
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:01,380
also called the prelates.

32
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,190
Those church officials essentially
appointed by Archbishop William Lord,

33
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,330
who we looked at last time,

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,600
were replaced in the early 1640s by
means that the success of the Puritan

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,120
revolutionaries were replaced by
Presbyterians ministers who were chosen by

36
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,530
individual congregations.

37
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,850
And Milton was able to think of this new
form of church government as the most

38
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:27,410
reasonable form of church government
because it seemed to be the product of,

39
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,860
of individual choices.

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,250
It seemed to be the product of individual
decisions made by the rational church

41
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,730
going English public.

42
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,120
So by the time we get to 1644, this is
the year that area politica appears, um,

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,230
we're well into the English revolution.
And this is the, this is the year

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,880
in which we have two dominant groups
in the new revolutionary parliament.

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,950
Um, the, that you have the
conservative Anglican royalists,

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,690
they've already been ousted.
They're not,

47
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,700
they're no longer a central
component of the political scene.

48
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,650
So you have left the Presbyterians and
the independence. And at this point,

49
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,490
the Presbyterians are in firm control.
Now,

50
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,270
as with most most political groups
who suddenly find themselves.

51
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:19,660
And this is just an ancient piece
of wisdom that I'm sharing with you,

52
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,210
but it's something obviously that
you will have heard before. Um,

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,050
as with most political groups who suddenly
find themselves in possession of a,

54
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:27,340
of a measure of power,

55
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,670
the ideas and values of the Presbyterians
and who had of course started out as

56
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:37,970
radicals. Um, we're beginning to harden
into something like a new orthodoxy. Um,

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,680
with this new aggregation
of political power,

58
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:46,681
they began laboring to
suppress and laboring to stamp
out of forces that forces

59
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:52,210
that oppose them, whether those forces
were on the right or on the left.

60
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,261
[inaudible].
Now,

61
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:56,800
of course the presbyters had seized
control in the first place because they

62
00:03:56,801 --> 00:04:01,060
disapproved of the tactics of suppression
and intervention that had been in that

63
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:05,650
had been deployed by the bishops or the,
or the prelates of the old church.

64
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,783
But,
but the new,

65
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,580
but the new Presbyterian
party soon developed its own
methods of employing state

66
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,610
power to control and regulate the church.

67
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,440
And this is just a general historical
irony that surely at some point,

68
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,720
um,
besets all revolutionary movements.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,830
And it's an irony that
particularly appalled John Melton,

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,050
and it's in recognition of what we can
think of is this time honored historical

71
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:35,620
irony that that Milton rights,
that such a, such a memorable line,

72
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,660
a wonderful line in his sonnet
on the new Presbyterian regime.

73
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,070
Um, that's the, it's
the, it's the poem, uh,

74
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,800
of the force of the new foresters of
conscience, uh, which ends with that line.

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,470
You'll remember new presbyters are,

76
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:53,290
but old priests writ large.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,600
The new pres bitters are, but
old priests writ large. The, the,

78
00:04:57,601 --> 00:05:02,601
the revolution has essentially become
a revolution in name only priests.

79
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,780
These are the bishops of the old system
have changed their name to presbyters

80
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,370
perhaps,
and they look like revolutionaries,

81
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,560
but their manipulative
controlling actions haven't,

82
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,440
haven't essentially changed at all.

83
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,040
And for the Presbyterian Party in 1644,

84
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,090
it turns out there are in
fact a number of factions, uh,

85
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,880
to control and to
manipulate and to regulate.

86
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,450
The new Presbyterian Orthodoxy soon,

87
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,160
soon developed its own methods of, uh, of,
of control, of employing state power to,

88
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,830
to control and to regulate
and to manipulate the church.

89
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,470
And that's where we get
this a rousing line.

90
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:48,340
New [inaudible] is but old
priests writ large. Um,

91
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,100
so I, I had mentioned, um,

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,120
the various factions in parliament that
the Presbyterian party had to confront,

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,540
um, uh, the,

94
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,530
the independence who are to
the left of the Presbyterians.

95
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,950
And we can count John Milton as a,
as a supporter of the independence,

96
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,330
the independence,

97
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,560
resented the new authoritarianism of
the Presbyterians and they support it,

98
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,220
or at least they tolerated
a new phenomenon,

99
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,880
a relatively new phenomenon on
the English cultural landscape.

100
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,820
And this is the freedom
of the printing press.

101
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,780
It's a freedom that of course
parliament had pushed for. Um,

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,330
but now that they got it, uh, there,

103
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:33,331
there are some misgiving
from 1641 to 1643,

104
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:39,101
there had been an unprecedented explosion
of printing and publishing an England,

105
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,910
every conceivable Protestant
sect was publishing treatises of,

106
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,800
of theological speculation,
publishing treatises of,

107
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,830
of religious propaganda at
an extraordinary rate. It's,

108
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,270
it's really remarkable, a remarkable
things that happens, uh, in the,

109
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:59,420
in the mid century religious
propaganda of course,

110
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,860
and this is always the case.
Um,

111
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:06,380
unregulated religious propaganda
only reads more unregulated religious

112
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:09,950
propaganda and more religious division.
And by the end of the period,

113
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,360
there was an unprecedented,

114
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,160
unprecedented number of new
religious groups, some of whom,

115
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,050
uh, some of these groups born
at this moment, I'm still exist.

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,130
We still have the Quakers. Uh, we have
the baptists, but there are of course,

117
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,020
many groups,
uh,

118
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,730
thriving in the 1640s that
have absolutely faded,

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,440
um, from the religious scene,
the grantor's, the family
[inaudible], the Mughal,

120
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:39,620
Tony, Ian's. These are churches
of almost every imaginable stripe.

121
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,780
And they're springing up. And from a
mainstream perspective perspective,

122
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:48,740
they're quickly eroding the authority
of the, of the Church of England.

123
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,320
It was becoming absolutely
impossible, in fact, or at least much,

124
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:58,460
much harder to claim that there was a
single expression of religious truth to

125
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:02,330
which the English nation
could consensually subscribe.

126
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,250
And suddenly there are dozens and dozens
of competing expressions of religious

127
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,190
truth.
And so you have a,

128
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,360
a new proliferation of new religions
and new religious ideas, uh,

129
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,410
that comes about is the immediate
product of the freedom of the press.

130
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,050
And so it's in this decade, in fact,
that we have the first newspapers,

131
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,570
the printed word begins
to take on assumes, uh,

132
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,220
a political and the cultural importance
that it had never had before.

133
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,670
So the proliferation of religious texts
and the proliferation of religious sects

134
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,940
produced,
uh,

135
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,910
what was widely seen to be a potentially
anarchic political situation in the

136
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:41,930
early 1640s.

137
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:46,931
And it's in response to what was deemed
to be the chaotic condition of English

138
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:52,661
religious culture that the Presbyterian
led parliament issued in 1643.

139
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,370
The Licensing Act, the, the, the,

140
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,740
the Presbyterians needed to hold the
endless generation of dangerous religious

141
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,390
propaganda and uh,
and continued Mattel.

142
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,110
What they felt on some level was,
uh,

143
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,580
was the continued metastasis of,
of Protestant sects.

144
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,240
And this is a recurring rhetoric,
the,

145
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:19,800
this notion that there is a
cancer in the body politic.

146
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,800
So parliament enacts
through this legislation.

147
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,070
A mechanism for the state control of,

148
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,240
of the press books now
have to be licensed.

149
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,220
They have to be preapproved by the state
before they can actually be published.

150
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,190
And so when the controversies that
are leading up to the licensing act,

151
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:43,191
one of the authors most
frequently mentioned as
opposing especial threat to the

152
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:48,060
wellbeing of the of the English nation
is our very own, is our very own Milton.

153
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,920
The treatises that he had written in
favor of the right to divorce for reasons

154
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:54,450
of in compatibility,
um,

155
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:59,280
in the earlier 1640s hadn't
scandalized his contemporaries,

156
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:02,160
isn't it? Especially scandalized
dispirit and contemporaries on the left.

157
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,050
So meet Milton was particularly
singled out as one of them, uh,

158
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,390
as one of these dangerous new
voices that had to be stopped.

159
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,470
And in a sermon that was preached to
parliament and the August and August of

160
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:18,150
1644 a by Herbert Palmer,
um,

161
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,800
it's, it's Milton whose
name is cited as one of the,

162
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,820
as one of those figures
most dangerous to the state.

163
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,640
So now my guess is that maybe
not all of you, but some of you,

164
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,990
uh, we'll have, we'll have, uh,
heard about or perhaps actually, um,

165
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,800
have read snippets from a today's reading,

166
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:44,390
this amazing treatise long before you
got to it last night area politica it,

167
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:49,290
this is without question one of the
English languages most powerful and most

168
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:53,230
most browsing expressions of the freedom
of the press and actually of the, of,

169
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,950
of a kind of libertarian philosophy
in general. And, and, and,

170
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,100
and the logic,

171
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,280
the argumentative logic of very OPA
Jenica rests on the distinction between a

172
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,930
distinction between
external compulsion on the,

173
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:10,770
on the one hand and internal
discipline on the other,

174
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,990
an internal discipline being something,

175
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:17,310
looking something like an internalization
of the discipline and the authority of

176
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:20,400
the, uh, of, of the
monarch. So we have the,

177
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,240
we have the compelling official
authority of the new state licenser and,

178
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,290
and Milton pits that external state
power against the powers of reason and

179
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,720
against the powers of conscience
that of course govern.

180
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,000
We're seem to govern human action
from within an internalized authority.

181
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,070
And it's of course not just John Milton
who's authorized to determine his own

182
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,670
actions. Everyone according to
the logic of very open, Ritika,

183
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:52,671
everyone has the potential to assume the
inner authority of conscience and self

184
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,580
discipline. Everyone has potentially
a licenser within himself.

185
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:02,040
And so there's no need. There's no
logical need for a state license.

186
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,930
Sir. Um, it's hard. It's a,

187
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,480
let me, let me, uh, there,
there's a, there's a,

188
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,400
there's some passages in area
politica that I would be,

189
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,440
I would be remiss to overlook.
Um,

190
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,290
so I'm going to ask you to
turn to page 739 in the Hughes.

191
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,720
So there's and Milton's arguing that
there's no authority that can rightfully

192
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:33,770
exist outside of the conscience of the
individual and even religious truths,

193
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,410
which of course are the most potent
forms of knowledge that we have.

194
00:12:36,411 --> 00:12:40,460
Even religious truths have to be
subjected to the final arbiter who is the

195
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:44,540
individual's conscience and the
individual's power of, of reasons.

196
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,080
So Milton is taking the argument.

197
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:49,640
It's at so many points in area
politica as far as it can possibly go.

198
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,630
This is page 739. Um, uh,

199
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,810
a man may be a heretic in the truth.
Milton writes,

200
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,880
a man may be a heretic in the truth and
if he believes things only because his

201
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,170
passenger says so,

202
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,430
or the assembly so determines
without knowing other reason,

203
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,170
though his belief to be true,
though his belief to be true,

204
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:16,070
yet the very truthy
holds becomes his heresy.

205
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,560
Don't think of that though.
Is Belief be true?

206
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,570
Think expand in your minds
the implications, the
possible consequences of this.

207
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,130
Any belief, any belief is
heresy. If you haven't managed,

208
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,770
managed to determine
that belief for yourself.

209
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,840
If you haven't managed to determine
that belief on the basis of your own

210
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:41,060
conscience or through the powers of
your own faculty of reason, you can be,

211
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,060
you can be a heretic in the truth.
If you accept a belief.

212
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,260
However true that belief turns out
to be at the end of time when we,

213
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,680
when we enter the pearly gates and
we finally get the last word. Um,

214
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:54,950
you're a,

215
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,170
you're a heretic because you've accepted
that belief only because it's been

216
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:03,171
handed to you by an External Authority
and external authority like a pastor or a

217
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:09,140
bishop or a member of the
state assembly, um, or uh,

218
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,770
or a lecturer in the English department
for that, for that matter. Um, you,

219
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,110
it is your obligation. Milton argues
in this remarkable treatise, uh,

220
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,470
determine for yourself.

221
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,230
Yeah.

222
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,540
What will constitute truth.

223
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,410
All truth have to be acquired directly
by the individual. It is, it's,

224
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,990
it's perfectly impossible,

225
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:34,220
I think to imagine a stronger statement
than this of the authority that Milton

226
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,450
gives the end,

227
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,190
the intellectual self possession
that he ascribed to the individual.

228
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:40,850
And I think we can,

229
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,830
you can see why area politica has been
memorialized for centuries now as one of

230
00:14:45,831 --> 00:14:50,390
the central precursors, well to a number
of things. One of them would be the, uh,

231
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:53,720
the, the, the, the, the
18th century enlightenment.

232
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,870
And it's subsequently seen as one of the,
uh,

233
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,710
one of the precursors of
the first amendment to the,

234
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,140
to the American constitution.
It's here,

235
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,470
it's here in area politica that we
find one of the first expressions

236
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,380
of the idea that an individual's freedom
to read and the individual's freedom to

237
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:16,100
write is more important.
It outweighs in value,

238
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,200
the state's right to limit
the individual's freedom to
read and the individual's

239
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:22,480
freedom to write what,

240
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,390
whatever danger a particular text may
pose to this date is outweighed by the

241
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:30,470
greater harm of the official elimination
of the, of the, of that text,

242
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,010
or by the greater harm of
the punishment of the author.

243
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,520
So it, in light of what
we have to concede is the,

244
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,020
is the extraordinary achievement of area
politica and in light of its reputation

245
00:15:45,021 --> 00:15:49,930
as one of the foundational texts for the
principle of the freedom of speech. Um,

246
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,020
readers have been puzzled and
they've been rightly puzzled by,

247
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,880
by the fact that nowhere in areopagite
[inaudible] does Milton explicitly

248
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,890
denounce censorship?

249
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,970
Nelson doesn't say,
doesn't denounce censorship at all,

250
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,060
although it comes up. Um, in fact,

251
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,490
he even claims and he does this explicitly
an area politica and you might've

252
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,210
caught this, he even claims to be in favor
of censorship in a number of cases. Uh,

253
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Milton's argument in this treatise is
directed exclusively at licensing and

254
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:28,870
licensing differs from censorship in
some important ways. And so let me, um,

255
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,510
and uh, indulge me in making
this important distinction.

256
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,520
We know what censorship is.

257
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:38,150
Censorship is the banning of books that
had been published and that had been

258
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:42,350
deemed by the state authorities to
be dangerous or harmful in some way.

259
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,850
So censorship would involve
the burning of books, uh,

260
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:50,780
the prohibition of any further additions
of those books or perhaps even the

261
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,880
punishment, um, by imprisonment,

262
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:57,440
say of the author or maybe the printer
or the publisher of the books. That's,

263
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,360
that's censorship. Utterly
straightforward. Licensing
on the other hand,

264
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,140
is an action that precedes censorship.

265
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:11,141
And so according to the 1643 licensing
order against which Milton is directing

266
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,410
this treatise area,

267
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,490
Politica a book has to be sent to the
licensing office for approval before,

268
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,880
before it can be published.

269
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,880
And the licensing agent reads the book
and determines whether or not to print it

270
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:25,330
at all or, or, or,

271
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:29,750
or license it to appear in print. Um, and,

272
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,540
and this isn't simply a distinction
without a difference. Uh,

273
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:37,640
Milton Milton places in enormous amount
of weight on this, on this distinction.

274
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,850
Censorship only comes into play once a
text has actually been in circulation for

275
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:43,520
a while,

276
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,520
only after a number of readers have
found a published text to pose a threat.

277
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,030
Um, only after that point can
a text actually be censored.

278
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,150
The book has to be tested.
It has to be tried, um,

279
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,330
by the public, by a reading public before
it can be censored. Um, and it's, uh,

280
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,150
it's censorship by consensus almost and
it's a truth that has come about. The,

281
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,310
the truth of whether a book should or
should not be censored is something that's

282
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:20,220
come about through the diligent effort
of a group rather than a single arbitrary

283
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:22,050
judge like those state licenser.

284
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,400
Milton is,
uh,

285
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,990
Milton devotes a lot of time in area of
Politica to making a number of attempts

286
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:34,860
to distinguish licensing from censorship.
And you can see,

287
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:38,880
I'm actually making this distinction,
but what I'm interested in here,

288
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,220
and I think what a lot of readers
are interested in when they,

289
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:45,600
when they approach [inaudible]
is why this treatise,

290
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,320
which does in fact permit
the practice of censorship,

291
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,660
why it can so easily be read as
an argument against censorship.

292
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,161
And in fact,

293
00:18:56,161 --> 00:19:00,930
this treatise is often described or
maybe even most commonly described as the

294
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:05,220
western traditions greatest
argument against censorship.

295
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,880
Obviously there's something going on
in this text that has produced this

296
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:13,110
confusion or we could think of it as a
misreading. Um, and it, this is of some,

297
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,850
this is of some interest to us.
So,

298
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,860
so turn to the left hand column
of page 720 in the Hughes edition.

299
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,220
This is where Milton speaks of the
importance of censoring dangerous books.

300
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,000
Milton explains that the licensing order
of 1643 is ineffective [inaudible].

301
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,020
It's useless because,
and I'm quoting here,

302
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,260
this order avails nothing to suppressing
of scandalous seditious and libelist

303
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:44,490
books, which were mainly
intended to be suppressed.

304
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,740
Milton striking, uh, such a strange
authoritarian note here that it's easy,

305
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,570
it's easy,
it's easy to skip over it.

306
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,610
It seems unaccommodating will almost
a look at the next look at the next

307
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:59,410
paragraph.
Id nine odd,

308
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,870
but that ended up is of greatest concern
went in the church and the Commonwealth

309
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,740
to have a vigilant eye,
how books demean themselves,

310
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:12,741
how books demean themselves as well as
men and thereafter to confine in prison

311
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,450
and do sharpest justice
on them as malefactors.

312
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,190
Now we know of course,

313
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:24,270
that this is an argument for censorship
and not an argument for licensing

314
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,750
because the punishment of the books and
the implicit punishment of their men who

315
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:32,450
write those books occurs after
their appearance in print. And,

316
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,240
and Milton then goes on to explain,
and I want you to look closely at this.

317
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:40,860
Milton goes onto explain why books
need to be brought to justice,

318
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:42,210
why books need to be punished,

319
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:47,040
essentially like criminals
in this personify in the,
in Milton's personifying.

320
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,960
So Milton continues for books
are not absolutely dead things,

321
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,660
but do contain a potency of life in
them to be as active as that soul was.

322
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,090
Who's progeny?
They are nay.

323
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:09,091
They do preserve as in a vial the purest
efficacy and extraction of that living

324
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:14,110
intellect that bred them.
Okay, let me stop there.

325
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,930
The ostensible purpose of this sentence,
um,

326
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,190
at this point as I take it in Milton's
argument is to explain the importance of

327
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:23,300
censorship. But the, uh,

328
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,760
surely this sentence has an entirely
different effective on us as, as readers.

329
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,550
Um,

330
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,550
a different effect than the syntax or the
logic of this sentence may demand that

331
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:39,100
the scandalous seditious and libelous
books that need to be brought to justice

332
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,160
are suddenly in this remarkable sentence
or suddenly revealed to have a soul.

333
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,370
However,
dangerous books are in a lot of ways,

334
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:52,180
these books look like good,
good Christians. And in fact,

335
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:55,060
they're better than good Christians
because books are the purest,

336
00:21:55,061 --> 00:22:00,061
the most rarefied extract of the
originary goodness of the author,

337
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,930
and absolutely unfollowing
perfect creation.

338
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,840
And, and, and it's important to understand
that clearly something very strange has

339
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:12,220
happened here.
This sentence,

340
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,110
which by the logic of the argument should
be demonstrating to us the importance

341
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:17,530
of being,

342
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,360
bringing bad books to justice
seems to be doing something else.

343
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:27,480
And, and, and in making this point,
Milton has just made us, I think, um,

344
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,590
almost utterly unwilling to effect this
justice that he himself has called for

345
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,550
which of us,

346
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,390
which of us would want to punish the
purest efficacy of a living intellect? It,

347
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:41,760
it,
it doesn't make sense in,

348
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,750
in the simplest possible terms.
You could say that Milton's sentence,

349
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,580
Milton's argument here in this
paragraph has gotten away from him.

350
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,350
And there's a sense in which you can
see this happening all the time in Aereo

351
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:57,080
politica there.

352
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,080
It's as if a gap has opened up a gap
between the official argument of the

353
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:05,900
treatise. And that's an argument
that permits censorship. And,

354
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,500
and the rhetorical
figures are the metaphors,

355
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,220
the Milton's elaborately
construed language,

356
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,830
which he uses to illustrate that argument.

357
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,850
And the metaphors or the
rhetorical world of the, uh,

358
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,660
of the treatise seems so often
to be against censorship.

359
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:25,480
And it's fairly easy to see that,
at least in this case, Milton's,

360
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,500
Milton's rhetoric and his imagery,
uh,

361
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,660
begin to undo,
begin,

362
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,670
begin to unravel the logic of
the argument. And it's this,

363
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,790
it's a process of undoing an undermining
that really eats away at the argument.

364
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,470
We could argue, uh, throughout
the entirety of very OPA,
Jennica and I, so I'm,

365
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,390
I'm willing to bet, I'm willing
to bet that some of you have had,

366
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,060
had noted in your reading last night
or whenever you did your reading. Um,

367
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,140
perhaps you actually underlined the
sentence that we've just looked like

368
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,550
convinced you,

369
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,390
underlined it perhaps because you
were convinced that this was Milton's

370
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,640
wonderful and libertory progressive
celebration of the absolute and viable

371
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:14,270
inviolability of the written word.
And if you did that on some level,

372
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:16,040
I think you were,
you were absolutely right.

373
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,460
Even though you were utterly
misconstruing the logic of the argument.

374
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,603
One of the most,

375
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,400
one of the most remarkable things about
this text is that it's invariably the

376
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:26,061
soaring,

377
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:30,590
the libertarian rhetoric that we end up
noting and that we end up remembering

378
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,040
that, that, that sticks with us. Um,

379
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:40,040
turn to turn to page seven,
41 in the Hughes.

380
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,980
This is where Milton gives us his,

381
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,600
his celebrated narrative of the history
of truth. And this is one of those,

382
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,900
uh, highly and elaborately, uh,

383
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,510
rhetorically ornamented passages.

384
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,870
So in Milton's argument against licensing,

385
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:01,220
Milton explains the importance of
the coexistence and it's very moving.

386
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,500
The coexistence is an
argument for diversity,

387
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,710
the coexistence of so many conflicting
opinions and beliefs. And, and,

388
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
and as, and as I've suggested before, he's
more conservative. Contemporaries were,

389
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:17,641
were appalled by the proliferation of
religious sects in mid 17th century,

390
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,750
in the mid 17th century England.

391
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:24,050
And so it would have been
perfectly reasonable for them.

392
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,090
He's opponents to assume that only one
set of religious beliefs could actually

393
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:29,930
represent the truth,

394
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:34,190
that there was only one possible
manifestation of divine truth. Um,

395
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,960
one has, one has roommates,
one has parents, um,

396
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:39,861
uh,

397
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:44,861
in our own day and age who of course
share such a belief in an absolute

398
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:50,870
singularity of, of the truth and
ones sometimes one has parents or,

399
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,350
or, uh, roommates who not only
believe that there is a single tooth,

400
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:57,170
but of course are themselves
in possession of it.

401
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,440
It's just this limited and for Milton
restrained or constrained and reductive

402
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,570
notion of a single truth that he
devotes a so much a very open Shitaka to

403
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:09,404
attacking.

404
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:14,410
So this is page seven 41 truth indeed
came once into the world with her divine

405
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:20,300
master and it was a perfect shape,
most glorious to look on.

406
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,940
But when he ascended and his
apostles after him were late asleep,

407
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,450
then straight arose or wicked race of
deceivers who has that story goes of the

408
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:35,240
Egyptian Typhon with his conspirators,
how they dealt with the good,

409
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:40,241
oh Cyrus took the wicked
deceivers took the virgin truth,

410
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:45,550
hued her lovely form into a pieces and
scattered them to the four winds from

411
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:52,251
that time ever since the sad friends of
truth such as Durst appear imitating the

412
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:57,681
careful search that isis made for the
mangled body of Oh Cyrus went up and down,

413
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,450
gathering up limb by limb
still as they could find them.

414
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,880
Let me, I'll, I'll stop there with this
original utterly original fable about the

415
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:12,690
fragmentation of what we think
of as, uh, as religious truth.

416
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,440
Milton goes out of his way is this,
is, this is, this is remarkable.

417
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:20,610
He's actually enacting and he's enacting
it rhetorically the fragmentation of

418
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:24,340
religious culture in, in
17th century England. Uh,

419
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:25,883
but one of the,

420
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,890
one of the most intriguing aspects of
this amazing passage is the fact that

421
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:32,364
this,

422
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,580
the fragmentation that
Milton is describing and on
some level even enacting is

423
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:42,980
something that he seems to
be celebrating here with the,

424
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,100
with the ascent of Christ,

425
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:48,510
the lovely form of the Virgin truth is
hued into a thousand pieces and scattered

426
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:53,240
to the four winds. The violence of this
action, of course we can't deny, um,

427
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,830
but it gets more complicated than that.

428
00:27:55,831 --> 00:28:00,150
The Egyptian Goddess Isis seeks
out the mangled body of, of,

429
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:01,650
of her lover Oh Cyrus,

430
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,570
because of her powerful affection for
him and because of her desire presumably

431
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:09,000
to see him whole again.

432
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,770
There's also though I think a hint here
that part of the pleasure behind isis is

433
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,780
search involves this,

434
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,140
the process of reassembling her lover,

435
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:25,410
the process of gathering
him up limb by limb,

436
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,780
the act of gathering,
uh,

437
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,050
present participles a in general,
in area up.

438
00:28:32,051 --> 00:28:36,720
Angelica being probably the
most important form of speech.

439
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,960
The active gathering him
may be more pleasurable,

440
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,680
more desirable than actually having
him fully reconstituted. And it's,

441
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,870
it's likewise,
I think part of our pleasure.

442
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:50,130
I'm in this crazy world of
disparate and confusing truths.

443
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,240
If we imagine ourselves in
the 17th century, it's part
of our pleasure to read,

444
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:59,190
to sort out and to reassemble the
various manifestations of truth.

445
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,030
That's, that's our common
project here. In fact, um, in,

446
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,860
in an English department saying the sad
friends of truth in this fable have gone

447
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,790
up and down,

448
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,590
gathering up truth limb by limb
still as they could find them.

449
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,410
We have not yet found them
all Lords and Commons,

450
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:23,640
nor ever shall do till her master's.
Second coming.

451
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,270
We have not yet found
the modelers and Commons,

452
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:29,550
nor ever shall do till her master's.
Second coming.

453
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,550
He shall bring together every joint
in member and shall mold them into an

454
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,920
immortal feature of
loveliness and perfection.

455
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,860
I surely these last two
sentences come as a surprise.

456
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,570
We have not yet found them
all nor ever shall do.

457
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:48,010
We'll never find truth in her entirety,
at least not until the second coming.

458
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:51,550
And who knows when that will be. And I
think that for Milton in this passage,

459
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,730
the fact that we never shall do is is
just as well because it's the labor of,

460
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,120
it's the Labor of reading.
It's the labor of researching.

461
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,950
It's the labor of assemblage rather
than the actual finished product,

462
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,050
uh, that, that, that motivates
and spurs the miltonic individual.

463
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,150
Milton Milton wants to,
Milton wants us to get,

464
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:19,660
to get us to feel the excitement as we,
uh,

465
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,180
as we read a passage like this though,

466
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,910
and the language that he uses in this
passage is itself a kind of demonstration

467
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,751
of the,

468
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:30,490
of the pleasure of the process
of intellectual assemblage,

469
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:34,690
intellectual coalition of
various diverse ideas as readers.

470
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,880
It's our duty. It's our obligation
to, to sort out and to reassemble.

471
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,830
We sort out, for example,
as we read this passage,

472
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:46,831
we sought out Christian
myths from Egyptian myths or
let's say we sort out from

473
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:50,830
what we've been to Milton be
Christian truth from Egyptian myths,

474
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,740
but the fact that they're putting on
the same plane here suggests that both

475
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:58,360
perhaps are either truths or both
perhaps or either are or both myths.

476
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:01,720
Um, and, and we sort out the
similar confusion of gender roles,

477
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:04,390
which is truly remarkable.
Um,

478
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,450
as we balance the masculine Christ
with the Feminine Truth with which the

479
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,700
Masculine Christ is identified here,
we have to balance the,

480
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,600
the mysteriously female isis is
searched for her lover. Oh, Cyrus.

481
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,850
Um, uh, there, there's, there,

482
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:22,120
there are so many entities in this
passage that seemed to be mysteriously

483
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:25,390
conjoined in some kind of
Hermaphroditic hermaphroditic unity.

484
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,270
Um, and we have to, uh,

485
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,570
imagine the relation of the female,
oh,

486
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:37,330
Cyrus with the implicitly male
readers search for his lost lover,

487
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,650
which is the feminine truth.

488
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,640
Milton's infusing this passage with
a powerful sense of, I don't know,

489
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:46,780
what can we call it? This is a
of gender nonconformity and, and,

490
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,340
and cultural relativity.

491
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:54,030
Christianity emerges from this
passage as just one truth out of many.

492
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,570
And it's almost as if we're, we're,
we're being given our choice as readers.

493
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:01,690
We're going to being given our choice
of which set of myths is the most

494
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:03,640
attractive,
the most believable.

495
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,570
And maybe ultimately here we're being
given a choice as to which set of myths is

496
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:11,950
the most desirable. The,
now, as I mentioned,

497
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,520
the official purpose of the track is
the political subject of licensing.

498
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,930
Milton's responding to an immediate set
of historical circumstances and he wants

499
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:23,350
to explain the usefulness,
the value,

500
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:26,860
and in fact the beauty of religious
controversy. But when you read it,

501
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,740
when you read an intensely a poetic,

502
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,920
highly ornamented passage like
the one that we've just looked at,

503
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,540
I think you can see why Milton was so
interested in this contemporary problem

504
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,360
of,
of religious diversity in the first place.

505
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Contradictions and in consistencies and
contemporary religious society are so

506
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:48,734
much like,

507
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,330
or at least look so much like the
contradictions and inconsistencies that we

508
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:56,420
find in a work of literature
that we find in a poem.

509
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,230
And Milton's defense of controversy is,

510
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,700
seems in a lot of ways continually to be
slipping into something like a defense

511
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,780
of poetry or certainly a defense
of his own poetic practice.

512
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:14,480
One of the, one of the structural elements
that that Lens Aereo Virginica, it's,

513
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,500
it's a curious power is a carefully
crafted network of images that Milton has,

514
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,890
has, uh, has employed to
structure the thing, the end.

515
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:29,410
And I'm thinking particularly of images
describing the activity of reading. Um,

516
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,260
one of the,

517
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,670
one of the central images
here is the image of eating.

518
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,630
Reading is continually being
described in terms of eating and,

519
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:40,550
and digestion.

520
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,250
We have already encountered on
some level the importance of the,

521
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:50,170
of the figure of eating to John Milton.
You think of think of commerce,

522
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,160
the ladies refusal to drink of comas.

523
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:56,450
His Cup was just the f the
first of Milton's attempt to,

524
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,990
Milton's attempts to bring the action
of ingestion to the very center of a,

525
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:07,640
of a literary work, a paradise
lost will be filled with, with the,

526
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,630
the activity of eating.

527
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:12,250
And Milton devotes more than a
few lines and it's shocking, uh,

528
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,300
to the process whereby the heavenly
angels not only eat food but they also

529
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:18,140
digest it.

530
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,180
And Milton lets us know whether
we want to know or not, how they,

531
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:27,320
those angels actually excrete
the food they have taken in.

532
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,940
But the most central act of eating of
course in Milton's great epic is obviously

533
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:34,130
has nothing to do with angels.

534
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,280
It's the eating of the
forbidden fruit by Adam and eve.

535
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,630
And it's because this action of eating
is so absolutely central to the plot of

536
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:44,420
paradise lost were obliged to spend.

537
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:49,450
Let's spend the rest of our time here
focusing on Milton's consideration in this

538
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:54,560
treatise in the area of
[inaudible] 1644 of, of the,

539
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,830
of the problem that we will find
haunting paradise lost the problem of the

540
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:02,990
eating of the fruit,
the problem of God's prohibition,

541
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,030
God's censorship of, of
the fruit, of the tree,

542
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,460
of the knowledge of good and evil.
God's licensing.

543
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,040
We'll see Milton's a turn to page 727.

544
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,390
This is the left hand column.

545
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:26,391
Milton's quoting Dionysius
Alexan dryness in this passage.

546
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:31,980
And he tells us the Diane Ics Alexon
Dryness, um, wrote, read any books,

547
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:36,870
whatever that come to thy hands for thou
art sufficient both to judge a right

548
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,030
and to examine each matter.

549
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,920
And Diane I see has compares to
this command to read everything.

550
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:47,250
Read everything you possibly can to Saint
Paul's command in the epistle to the

551
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,120
Thessalonians,

552
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:53,100
which is prove all things hold
fast to that which is good.

553
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,630
And prove proof here means to test,
to try all things.

554
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:59,760
And Paul's making a claim
here for the individuals.

555
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:01,800
This is certainly how
Milton was able to read it,

556
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,690
a claim for the individual's capacity to
make a moral judgment after some period

557
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:11,691
of trial or after some period of of
experimentation and Milton elaborates on

558
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:16,680
this claim that we should read
and prove anything we want.

559
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,770
Four,
we are sufficient to judge a right.

560
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,170
He's he's, he's, he's moving on
here and he might have added,

561
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,940
Milton tells us he might
have added another remarkable
saying of the same author

562
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,780
to the pure,
all things are pure,

563
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,660
not only meets and drinks, but all kinds
of knowledge whether of good or evil,

564
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,960
the knowledge cannot defile nor
consequently the books if the wheel and

565
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:50,790
conscience be not defiled for books or
as meat and vines are some of goods,

566
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:55,170
some of evil substance and yet God in
that an apocryphal vision said without

567
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,610
exception rise Peter,

568
00:36:56,611 --> 00:37:01,611
kill and eat leaving the choice
to each man's discretion.

569
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:06,360
We should be able to read whatever
you want, whatever we want,

570
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:10,650
just as we should be able to eat
whatever we want and Milton's language.

571
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,920
The image here is of this is it's kind
of a combined gastronomical and literary

572
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:20,430
freedom. This is the freedom
of this smorgasbord of the,

573
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:25,350
of the public libraries slash smorgasbord
or Atticus, uh, for that matter,

574
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,770
a place where you can, um, eat and read.

575
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,160
Although not on the same, actually they
don't let you, they don't let you eat, um,

576
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,860
around the books. You get my
point though. Um, we should,

577
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:42,250
we should be able to try all
things to prove all things, um,

578
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,150
and then decide whether or
not we actually like it,

579
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,780
whether it brings us some sort of pleasure
and this or wisdom and this array of

580
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:52,230
choices is more than just a
luxury for Milton. It's, uh,

581
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,970
absolutely constituent of, of, of
the ideal, of freedom of our freedom.

582
00:37:56,971 --> 00:37:58,410
Because if we don't try everything,

583
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,130
if we don't give ourselves an opportunity
to just, to decide for ourselves,

584
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:03,270
then of course some,
well,

585
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,660
someone will invariably be
making those decisions for us.

586
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,121
So it shouldn't be,

587
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:14,121
it shouldn't be difficult to see a kind
of problem that is beginning to arise.

588
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,960
Uh, in Milton's text here, as
I suggested just a minute ago,

589
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:23,850
that one of the relevant stories that is
always lying behind Milton's discussion

590
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:27,960
of human choice is the story from the
book of Genesis about Adam and Eve's

591
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:30,840
choice to eat the forbidden fruit.

592
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:36,290
And so much of [inaudible]
involves Milton's bringing
together competing images

593
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:39,040
and traditions in arguments. So
he's injured, as we've already seen,

594
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:42,670
he interweaves a Christian figures with,
with pagan figures.

595
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:47,671
He positions pro censorship argument
alongside anticensorship rhetoric or

596
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,323
metaphor.

597
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:56,560
And there are dozens of moments in
which it's just these opposites that are

598
00:38:56,561 --> 00:39:00,100
being asked to coexist in some
kind of piece, but nowhere,

599
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,460
nowhere in area politica do the
conflict seems so pronounced,

600
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:08,461
are so painful or make us win so much
as the tension that arises between the

601
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:10,600
genesis story of Adam and eve.

602
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,850
God knows why Milton feels
compelled to bring this story up.

603
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:21,060
The tension between the story of Adam
and eve and Milton's own impassioned

604
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:26,110
argument against licensing. So I've,
as I've just noted Milton quotes,

605
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:31,060
Paul's dictum that to the
pure all things are pure.

606
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,890
If you're a pure, not only our meat,
meat's vines, pure meets and drinks pure,

607
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:39,690
but all kinds of knowledge, whether
of good and evil and you, oh,

608
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,220
you just have to extend
for a little bit this,

609
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:45,640
this Pauline philosophy of freedom
to the situation of unfollowing, uh,

610
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,700
the unfollowing Eden of Adam and eve
to see a kind of logical trouble that

611
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,640
Milton is getting himself into the,

612
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:57,641
the Genesis Story of God's peremptory
prohibition of the fruit from the tree of

613
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:03,760
the knowledge of good and evil is the
strongest analogy that I can think of to

614
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:08,380
the licensers peremptory
prohibition of a book.

615
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:13,330
Uh, obviously Milton isn't able
to make this analogy explicit.

616
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:18,130
It would completely dash any logical
sense that area [inaudible] is still

617
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:20,920
retains. Um, but it's
nonetheless, I'll, I'll,

618
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,040
I'll always there this,
this tension,

619
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,130
God's forbidding of the fruit
removes from Adam and Eve.

620
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,130
Any capacity for choosing and deciding.

621
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:34,570
And you can see Milton worrying in area
politica about the uneasy relationship

622
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:38,830
of his,
of his own argument to this central text.

623
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,450
In divine scripture.

624
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,010
So look at page seven 28 in the Hughes.

625
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:48,790
This is the left hand column,
good and evil.

626
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:53,530
We know in the field of this world grow
up together almost inseparably and the

627
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:58,480
knowledge of good is so involved and
interwoven with the knowledge of evil and

628
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:03,481
in so many cutting resemblance is hardly
to be discerned that those confused

629
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:08,971
seeds which were imposed on psyche as
an incessant labor to coal out and Sorta

630
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,950
Sunder.
We're not more intermixed.

631
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:17,550
It was from out the rind of one apple
tasted that the knowledge of good and evil

632
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:20,200
is two twins cleaving together,

633
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:25,710
leaped forth into the world and perhaps
this is that doom which Adam fell into

634
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:32,920
of knowing good and evil.
That is to say of knowing good by evil.

635
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,820
This is, there's so many things
to say about this passage,

636
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:41,300
but one thing that I'll just throw out
now is that it's a remarkable description

637
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,430
of of the modern world of,

638
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:48,431
of moral uncertainty like Isis whom we
saw piecing together the body of Oh Cyrus

639
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,810
or like this add friends of truth,

640
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:53,120
picking up the torn limbs
of that beautiful virgin.

641
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,450
We are left to coal out and sort
asunder the confused seeds of,

642
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:02,150
of good and evil. Now, on
one level of this passage,

643
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:06,740
Milton's describing this modern
condition is the product of the fall.

644
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,140
It's,
it's too bad that we live in this world.

645
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,840
This is the doom which Adam fell into.

646
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:15,050
This is the fallen condition to
which we've all been consigned.

647
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,670
But the passage is so much
more complicated than that
because good and evil seem

648
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:24,020
to have been mixed up in
the apple before the fall.

649
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,980
There was good in that
forbidden fruit as well as evil.

650
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:32,420
This is that Dune which Adam fell into
of knowing good and evil. That is to say,

651
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:34,820
of knowing good by evil,

652
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:40,540
adamant the fall didn't simply come
into a knowledge primarily of of evil.

653
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,111
Adam,

654
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:47,111
by tasting the apple came into a knowledge
of good and he was only able to know

655
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:53,831
this good by means of the
experience of the knowledge of evil.

656
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,090
Um,
there are a lot of perspectives,

657
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,470
a discernible or extractable
from this treatise area.

658
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:07,820
Politica from which the fallen
state seems in so many ways,

659
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:12,370
maybe in every way superior
to its unfollowing,

660
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,250
to it's unfollowing
counterpart. Um, we will see,

661
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,620
we will see Milton
returning to all of these,

662
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,630
all of these questions in paradise lost.

663
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:28,631
And we will even see Milton place in the
mouth of Eve that the next sentence in

664
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:30,720
this passage, or at least, um, uh,

665
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,690
a paraphrased and of course
versified version of this sentence.

666
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,460
This is when Milton tells us

667
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,130
I cannot praise a cloistered virtue.

668
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:49,570
I cannot praise a fugitive and
cloistered virtue unexercised and,

669
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:53,810
and breathed that never Sally's
out and sees her adversary,

670
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,170
but slinks out of the race where that
immortal garland is to be run for not

671
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:00,950
without dust and heat.

672
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,620
And you'll find eve in
book nine of Paradise Lost
Voicing essentially this same

673
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:09,470
sentiment when she's
explaining to Adam why she,

674
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,040
why she needs to work separately. Uh, this
is the argument that really of course,

675
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:17,060
puts her at risk of Satan's
temptation and to so many readers.

676
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:22,061
It has seemed that eve is actually
quoting Milton's much earlier writing area

677
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:26,810
politica in her defense. And it has
an incredibly unsettling effect.

678
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:30,980
Evil has to be challenged.
It has to be confronted,

679
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,870
it has to be tasted before
it can be conquered. It,

680
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,200
it can't simply be avoided.
This is,

681
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:39,900
this is eaves and area
of political argument.

682
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,700
We will never be virtuous simply
because we've cloistered ourselves or

683
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:47,550
segregated ourselves from any temptation.

684
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,530
Virtue is to be fought for,
um,

685
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,990
raced for not without Dustin heat.
So let me conclude.

686
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,000
Let me conclude the lecture by,

687
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,990
by saying that it's a startling experience
and I hope you feel some of the,

688
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,250
some of their surprise moving
from area Politica, which, uh,

689
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,200
has to be Milton's most important
and consequential work in prose.

690
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,260
Moving from that to paradise lost,

691
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:15,840
which is of course Milton's
most important work of poetry.

692
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,550
And we'll be doing this in one in one
week. And the disjunction between these,

693
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,370
between the two works,
this disjunction,

694
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:26,890
at least with respect to their
treatment of the fall, um,

695
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:32,060
should dramatize the nature or just
the enormity of a lot of the conceptual

696
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,920
problems and conflicts that Milton is,
is,

697
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,830
is tackling here as a faithful
Christian. Of course. And I, I'm,

698
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:42,450
I'm not going to try to deny
this. Um, as a faithful Christian,

699
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:47,070
Milton believes that the fall is only
to be lamented and that Adam and eve

700
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:51,240
should not have eaten the apple.
And as a believing Christian,

701
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:56,241
Milton believes that the omnipotent
God has had every right to license to

702
00:45:56,401 --> 00:46:01,330
prohibit that apple. But
it's a measure. It's,

703
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,420
and we have, it's a measure
that we have to take seriously.

704
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:07,990
It's a measure of Milton's ambition
and his intellectual courage that,

705
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:08,460
that,

706
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,460
that enables him to set out to justify
a God who can inflict upon his creatures

707
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:18,630
such a seemingly Arbitrary Act,
act of licensing. The, and,

708
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,060
and the extent to which Milton and
succeeds and justifying such a God in

709
00:46:22,061 --> 00:46:24,090
paradise lost will be.
Of course,

710
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:26,880
one of the questions that we
will be exploring over the next,

711
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,890
over the next couple of weeks,
so you will read for Wednesday's class,

712
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,260
uh,
the first two books of paradise lost.
