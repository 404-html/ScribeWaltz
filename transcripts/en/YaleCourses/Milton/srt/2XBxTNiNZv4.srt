1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,490
Milton is typically sited by literary
historians is one of the first major

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:10,340
English poets to praise in verse,
uh, the institution of marriage. And,

3
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:13,410
and in this, in this respect, he
seems to have followed Spencer,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,840
a Edmund Spencer who's fairy queen is
in large part a tribute to the sacrament

5
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,870
of marriage. Although
interestingly, the fairy queen, uh,

6
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:24,850
the Great Spencerian poem,
uh,

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:29,760
never actually manages to feature a,
a marriage between two human beings,

8
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:33,720
the only marriage that actually appears
there as a marriage between two rivers.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,430
Uh, nonetheless, the fairy queen
can be said, however, strangely,

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,270
uh,

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,040
that it is the first great
poetic celebration and
English of the institution of

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:45,540
marriage.
Uh,

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,510
and this was important to Milton and
one of the big set piece speeches and

14
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,130
paradise lost you,

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,880
and you may remember it if you've read
that poem is the hymn that begins hail,

16
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:58,470
wedded love. And Milton is
adamant throughout the epic in,

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,020
in his insistent imagining Adam and eve,

18
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,930
quite specifically as a married
couple and a married couple.

19
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,870
And this is important to Milton,
a married couple with an active sex life.

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,010
There are a couple who's marital blessing
has been granted by none other than

21
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:12,750
God himself.
Now,

22
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:17,040
the treatise is that Milton wrote on
the rights of divorce and the 1640s are

23
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:21,590
also, uh, extravagantly. Pro-Marriage.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,673
Um,

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,180
a happy marriage for Milton was founded
on a couple's likeminded opinions and

26
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,450
values, their ability to
converse with one another.

27
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:33,790
And so this is why the notion of the
divorce for reasons of in compatibility is

28
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:37,260
so important to Milton because
compatibility and melt marriage is,

29
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,570
is the very essence of marriage.

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,510
I can only imagine though at
this point in this semester, uh,

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,260
what will become Milton's eventual
championing of marriage, um,

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,940
is, is pretty hard to imagine a w in part
because we're just devoting our second

33
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:58,941
class to a literary work given almost
entirely to the virtue of chastity.

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,840
And there's every indication that as I,
and I mentioned this before, of course,

35
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,430
there's every indication that Milton
have a lot of these early works bespeak

36
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,920
something like a serious interest,
um,

37
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,020
in the ideal of a lifelong
state of chastity.

38
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,310
And chastity is not only an obsessive
topic in the early poems for Milton, um,

39
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,880
or in the published a treatise
that we looked at last time,

40
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:27,630
the apology for smack Tim Lewis.
It's also a subject,

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,430
uh,

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,000
in the reading that we can find in the
reading journal that Melton kept for the

43
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,180
better part of his life.
So the text into which, uh,

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,240
any early modern 17th century writer
would jot his or her thoughts into his

45
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,000
reading notes was always called
a commonplace book. And Milton,

46
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,420
uh, like so many of his contemporaries
kept a commonplace book. And, and, and,

47
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:55,560
and as you can imagine, he kept
it, um, for the most part in Latin.

48
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,270
And actually we have Milton's
commonplace book is reading notes. Um,

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,740
and you can find it all in
English translation and volume.

50
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,820
One of the complete prose works of John
Milton. It's a in the CCL collection.

51
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,780
Now one of the entries in
Milton's commonplace book
that touches on the subject

52
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:15,430
of chastity strikes me as a
particularly charged one four.

53
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,700
It's a terrifying image of,
of, of violence. And I've,

54
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:21,700
I've never really known what to do
with this. And I think at the entry

55
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,510
can be seen as in some way helpful for
our understanding of this poem, the mask.

56
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,110
So this is what we know.
Sometime in the year 1639,

57
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:36,640
Milton read a history book entitled the
General General Chronicle of England,

58
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,220
um, in which there was a
discussion in, in disco, in,

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,510
in a, in a, in a, in its
treatise on medieval England,

60
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,850
the discussion of a brutal Danish invasion
in the ninth century of a Catholic

61
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:54,460
convent in the English city of Coldingham.

62
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,900
It's a Milton jots down the historical
deal detail from this account that seems

63
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,240
to have caught his attention.
And this is what,

64
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:05,580
this is what he knows as
particularly memorable. Uh,

65
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,680
the nun abba cut off her nose and
lips and urge the other sisters,

66
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:13,630
the other nuns in the
convent to do the same thing.

67
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,090
So that frustrated in this way,

68
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:20,110
the Danes would make no
attempt against their virtue.

69
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,660
It's the, it's the violence of this
a horrible act of self sacrifice,

70
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,930
tragic act of self sacrifice.
Um,

71
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,130
an act of self sacrifice
intended obviously to preserve
the state of virginity

72
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,130
that, that, that,

73
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,680
that grabs our attention and presumably
grabbed Milton's in order to avoid the

74
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:42,360
violation of their virginity at the
hands of the brutal Danish Brigans at

75
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:47,361
believes a conflict convent full of nuns
to disfigure themselves every knows and

76
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,680
lip. Um, as you can imagine,

77
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,440
there's no historical evidence that
anything like this took place in.

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,580
It actually seems to be something
of an urban legend among, uh,

79
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:02,530
among medieval writers, a
recounting, uh, early, uh,

80
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,140
early Christian convents.
This same story, um,

81
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,970
about the nuns deceleration of their nose
and their lips seems to have been told

82
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:14,380
about just all, um, all of the
early, early Christian nunneries,

83
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,680
uh, a strange cultural fantasy
manifesting itself in some way, but,

84
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,400
but nonetheless, Milton Milton includes
this in is commonplace entry. No,

85
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,680
no commentary, no observation, no
interpretation of it. But, but,

86
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,730
but I think we could make some estimation
of its significance if we juxtapose

87
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:34,810
it,
uh,

88
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,160
with comas since the mask
attempts to tackle in a much more,

89
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:43,150
in a much more expanded form.
So many of the same issues.

90
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,880
Comas is an elaborate meditation,
not simply on chastity but,

91
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:51,220
but also on the threat of rape. And,
and of course as I mentioned last time,

92
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:53,050
comas himself suggests
nothing more than he,

93
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:58,051
than wanting to get the lady to
drink a sip from the Chairman Cup.

94
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,520
But it's clear from his language that
the subtext, at least behind his,

95
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,990
his deduction involves in some
way at least an intimation of the,

96
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,730
of the lady sexual submission,

97
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,960
the potential danger a besetting the lady
is certainly a subject of some concern

98
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,070
for her due to full brothers.

99
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,280
You remember they're wandering around
the forest without her picking,

100
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,950
picking berries that the younger brother,

101
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,100
the second brother is most
concerned about his sister's safety.

102
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,240
So I want you to look at this passage.
Um,

103
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,470
this is line three 98 of comas,

104
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,230
page 99 in the Hughes. So the,
the second brother says that the,

105
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,200
the lady is an open target
out there for an assault.

106
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,560
You may as well spread out the unsend
heaps of misers treasure by an outlaws

107
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:52,310
den.
And tell me it is safe as bid me hope.

108
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,680
Danger will wink on
opportunity. We'll, we'll,

109
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:00,140
we'll not allow itself to see opportunity
and let a single helpless maiden pass

110
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,190
uninjured in this wild surrounding waste.

111
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,450
So, so notice first year that
the younger brother compares, uh,

112
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,180
compares his sister, his virginity
to a misers treasure. Um,

113
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,230
and in this particularly odd image, you
have something like a veiled accusation.

114
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:22,670
And it's not unlike comas, his
accusation that the lady is hoarding her,

115
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,290
her God given treasurer of
her chastity, and the, with,

116
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,680
with all of the resonances that the of
the parable of the talents that, that,

117
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,620
that we see in comas,
a similar language,

118
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,670
but you also notice the
sense of limitation and the
vulnerability associated

119
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,920
with the physical state of virginity here.

120
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,440
As wonderful as the
ladies chastity might be,

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,670
it's certainly not going to protect her
from the dangers lurking in this wild

122
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,710
surrounding waste.
And if anything,

123
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,870
her chastity will only
attract such injuries as,

124
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,430
as we saw in the last lecture,

125
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:59,240
the elder brother holds an entirely
different theory of, of chastity.

126
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,500
And of course it's a lot more optimistic.
Um, he believes that the, that a virgin,

127
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:08,501
like the lady is secure or safe from
the violent attacks imagined by as a

128
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,080
younger brother.
So look at line four,

129
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,370
23 of Comas,
uh,

130
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,710
where the elder brother explains that
the chase lady can actually travel

131
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:23,480
anywhere. She pleases utterly
unafraid. She may trace huge forests.

132
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,471
I mean,
both.

133
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:28,910
Both of these positions are voice was
such a magnificently hyperbolic rhetoric.

134
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,690
She may trace huge forests
and an harbored heats,

135
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,200
infamous hills and
sandy parallettes wilds.

136
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,700
We're through the res, the sacred
rays of chastity. No savage,

137
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:45,701
fierce bandit or mountain ear will
dare to soil her virgin purity.

138
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,560
He dismisses his brother's entirely
practical argument because for him,

139
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:56,430
chastity is a lot more than it's a
simple exercise of sexual abstinence.

140
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,700
It's a positive for us and it exerts a,

141
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,740
an actual and somehow palpable
discernible force in the world.

142
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,940
The sacred rays of chastity are going
to be emanating from the chase to maiden

143
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,810
and protecting our lumps like
some magical force field.

144
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,850
And actually we'll keep her safe from
the physical assaults of a savage bandit

145
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,120
or a mountaineer.
Now.

146
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,460
Now this is just a thought
exercise. Um, but we're,

147
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,920
we're the elder brother to
read the general chronicle
of England that Milton had

148
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:32,930
read in 1639. I am assuming he
would have found in coherent the,

149
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,360
the story that had so interested in
Milton that the story about St Ebo,

150
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,210
the nun who had, um, who had,

151
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,240
who was driven to such terrible lengths
to protect herself and her fellow

152
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:47,241
sisters in the nunnery from attack for
the elder brother Ebis bodily purity

153
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:51,490
should excel, exudes a sufficiently
powerful strength that the,

154
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:56,130
that the terrible Danes would be repelled
by the sacred rays of her chastity.

155
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,970
Um, so you get something
like a conflict, uh,

156
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,090
developing Milton in Milton's mask
attention between the extravagant virgin

157
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,400
virgin oil, idealism of
the, of the elder brother.

158
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,760
And what I have to concede as the much
more practical sense of virginities

159
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:17,070
limitations, uh, voiced by
the, by the second brother.

160
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:19,650
And so Milton is actually
staging a debate,

161
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,290
but between these two positions

162
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,850
enacted on the stage in 1634 by an a
nine and nine and an 11 year old boy,

163
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,570
I'll remind you, but
the very presence, uh,

164
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,630
but the very presence in a theatrical
piece of a, of a long and weighty,

165
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,150
a philosophical debate like this one,
um,

166
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,930
could easily be seen as having
a pretty tedious effect. And,

167
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:44,700
and Milton is taking a
pretty great risk here.

168
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:48,840
And so it's worth asking what's at
stake, uh, because this is such an odd,

169
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,520
an odd thing to find.

170
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,870
And so I want to consider a way in which
this debate between these two brothers

171
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,740
can be seen as related to other debates.
Um,

172
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,730
other conflicts between
competing aspects of, of,

173
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:05,770
of Milton's own consciousness
that would be one perspective and,

174
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,420
and maybe more grandly between opposing
factions in the, in the culture of,

175
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,540
of 17th century England at large.

176
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,670
First though,

177
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,430
I need to say a couple of
words about the word chastity.

178
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,170
Um, as I've been using it throughout
this, throughout the discussion,

179
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:26,400
so far of comas,
both,

180
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,960
both today and Monday up to this point.
Um,

181
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,550
and some of you may have felt this,

182
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:36,630
I've been throwing the word chastity
around a little promiscuously and, and,

183
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:40,020
and throwing it around with
this kind of looseness. Um,

184
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:44,940
I've been reproducing what I take to be
a certain sloppiness in Milton's text.

185
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,470
Um,
I,

186
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:51,150
I've been speaking of chastity
as if chastity and virginity,

187
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,570
we're were absolute synonyms or
are always synonyms just to, uh,

188
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,660
uh, forever interchangeable. And this
simply isn't true in the 17th century.

189
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,850
Um, now it goes without saying
that we all know what virginity is.

190
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,420
Virginity is that bodily
state that predates inactive
of sexual intercourse and

191
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,910
therefore for, at least for
most of Milton's contemporaries,

192
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,920
that is the bodily state that
predates marriage. Chastity,

193
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:21,260
however,

194
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,570
was beginning to mean something new in
the period for a lot of Protestants in

195
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:26,680
the early 17th century.

196
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:31,600
The word chastity could also be used
to refer to this state of what could be

197
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:35,440
called married chastity and Mary Chaston.

198
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,860
He was a type of bodily purity that could
be extended or in spiritual purity as

199
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:43,390
well that can be extended even to into
marriage. This is sort of the theory.

200
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,381
If a,

201
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:49,381
if a couple of practice temperate moderate
and more or less dispassionate act of

202
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:53,530
sexual intercourse,
they could be said to remain chaste.

203
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,240
A married couple of course they could
keep for themselves the prestigious title

204
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,920
of chase even though they were obviously
performing an act that almost anyone in

205
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:07,300
an earlier period would assume
disqualified them, um, from, from the,

206
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,520
from being,
from being called chaste.

207
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,720
And so their opens up a kind of
distinction between virginity,

208
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,140
which is of course actual physical,
sexual,

209
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:19,360
abstinence and chastity,

210
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,750
which for some could actually include
the moderate practice of sex within,

211
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,790
within marriage.

212
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,830
And it's one of the interesting and
curious features of the Protestant mask

213
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:37,790
comas that this is a distinction
that's never really observed or,

214
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,580
or,
or acknowledged.

215
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,130
Virginity and chastity seemed to be
used often and kind of awkwardly,

216
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:49,570
I think interchangeably. And the
confusion between these two words, um,

217
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,570
is closely related.
I propose to the,

218
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,290
some of the confusions and dilemmas
confronted by the work as a whole.

219
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,220
And I'll go so far as to say that some
of the semantic difficulty here in the,

220
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,210
in our understanding of the word
chastity has something to do with an

221
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:08,200
indisputable,

222
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,760
indisputably awkward element of Comas,
this plot.

223
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:17,320
And that's the fact that for so much of
this mask, the lady is stuck to receipt.

224
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,070
Okay.

225
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,950
So I mentioned at the beginning of the
lecture that Milton would go on to become

226
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,580
the English languages premier poet of,
of marriage.

227
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,410
But it's important to note that the
celebration of marriage is not at all an

228
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:32,510
obvious thing for,

229
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:36,480
for an English poet and Milton's
time to be a attempting to,

230
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,370
to strive toward.
And in fact,

231
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:42,600
it's just at this point in early modern
England that that marriage is beginning

232
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:46,080
to assert itself as a,
as a cultural ideal,

233
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,063
uh,

234
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,120
uh, religiously inflected cultural ideal
through it throughout their renaissance,

235
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,680
uh, throughout the 16th century. The
popular ideas about marriage and celibacy,

236
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:01,540
we're still firmly tied to the values
of the Roman Catholic Church. Uh,

237
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,590
well after the actual reformation,

238
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,610
the Roman doctrine of course had
prized the state of Celibacy, um,

239
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,520
insisting that it was the superior
state, um, over marriage. Now,

240
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,470
it's true that,
and this has always been the case,

241
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,290
that a proper marriage was obviously
always one of the churches,

242
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:23,291
sacraments and marriage obviously had
always received the church's blessing.

243
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,010
But nonetheless, the higher ideal was
still seem to be celibacy. And it was,

244
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,640
it was the ideal, uh,
embraced by priests and nuns.

245
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:34,040
And it was the ideal to which
all Christians theoretically,

246
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,980
at least should shouldn't.
We're in a position to,

247
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,550
to aspire to it.
It's in the period that,

248
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,490
that Milton is writing in a,

249
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,510
it's in the period in which
Milton has writing that the, that,

250
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,200
that the tide is beginning to turn.

251
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,440
And so the Protestant reformation
and especially, uh, the,

252
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,450
the risings energies of puritanism in the
early 17th century are beginning to do

253
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:02,600
a lot to change this state of affairs.
And so over the course of the century,

254
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,500
you can see a gradual as if something
like this could actually be charted.

255
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,191
Nonetheless,

256
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:11,960
I think it's safe to say you see a gradual
decline in the cultural idealization

257
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:16,961
of virginity and a corresponding increase
in the valuation of marriage and this

258
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:21,730
new form of chastity that we can
think of as married chastity. Um,

259
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,150
it's a transition in the
valuation of, uh, of,

260
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,740
of marriage that is not at
all an easy one. However,

261
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,360
um, there, there are debates,

262
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:35,720
there are disagreements even
among puritans about which state,

263
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:39,210
virginity or married chastity
is the superior one, um,

264
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,310
in the eyes of God.
And it's an in,

265
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:47,070
in light of this ongoing cultural
tension in the period, um,

266
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,740
that I think we can understand some
of the strange confusions concerning

267
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:54,350
chastity that we, that we
find in, in the, in the,

268
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:58,220
in the poem that we're looking at now,
one of the moments in which the,

269
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,310
this tension between virginity and
chastity seems to be most pronounced is in

270
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:07,760
the encounter between Columbus and the
lady that we looked at in the last class.

271
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,900
A comas attempts to seduce
the lady you'll remember with,

272
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,940
with something like an economic theory of,

273
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:16,460
of natural beauty for comas.

274
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,290
Nature has given us all of
her riches and it's our duty.

275
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,880
It's our obligation to spend them,
to consume them, to consume the,

276
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:30,530
to Lug luxuriate in
natures, uh, generosity.

277
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,830
You can think of this and this
has actually been described, uh,

278
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,740
by,

279
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,630
by critics as something like an
aristocratic theory of natural expenditure

280
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:46,070
because comas imagines in this
fantasy rhetorical world of his,

281
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,650
something like an almost endless
supply of natural wealth, um,

282
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,020
nature's wealth can continually
and forever be spent and expended.

283
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,780
Now,
the lady responds to coma,

284
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:02,490
says what we can think of is
his aristocratic debauchery
with an economic theory

285
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:06,720
of our own. And we haven't looked at that
yet. So this is line seven 68 of comas.

286
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:11,490
And in the Hughes Edition, it's on
page 108. This is the ladies a retort.

287
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,960
She explains that nature of course,

288
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:17,760
wants us to live according to her
sober laws and holy dictate of spare

289
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:18,660
temperance.

290
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,690
And in this description of the moderate
and temperate enjoyment of nature,

291
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,840
the ladies giving us something like a,
uh,

292
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,990
a puritan economic theory.

293
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,480
And so this is her argument line seven 68

294
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,190
if every just man that now pines with
want headbutt a moderate and besieging

295
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:44,580
share of that which lucidly
pump pampered luxury. Now,

296
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,280
heaps upon some few with vast access.

297
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,800
Nature's full blessings would be well
dispensed in unsuppressed Louis even

298
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,500
proportion.
It's,

299
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,530
I think it's sometimes hard to remember
in reading his speech like this,

300
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:02,490
that the ladies actually talking
about Justin, he, her argument sounds,

301
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,650
and some of you may
recognize this argument.

302
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,660
It sounds so distinctly like a political
argument and argument from political

303
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:14,460
economy. And it actually, it's been
shown, um, seems to foreshadow the, uh,

304
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:18,930
the political philosophy of, of Milton's
much younger contemporary John Locke.

305
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,420
Uh, the, the notion that nature
demands that every human individual,

306
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,860
uh, has just enough is given just
enough to be self sufficient.

307
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,540
But when you remember that the subject
at hand is actually in some way sex,

308
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,700
then you can begin to associate the lady's
image of this moderate consumption of

309
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:41,520
natural wealth with some version of,

310
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,280
if this makes sense, some version
of an act of sexual consummation.

311
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,640
The ladies called call
for, uh, a tempered,

312
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:56,060
a moderate distribution and
con consumption of natural
goods seems to point us

313
00:19:57,151 --> 00:20:00,840
towards something like a
particular attitude toward sex.

314
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,400
And this [inaudible],
this is sex she's seeming to refer to it.

315
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,970
It's clearly not
virginity that's at stake.

316
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,900
And this isn't sexual abstinence that
the lady's pointing to a with revision of

317
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:16,320
the moderate and temperate
enjoyment of nature's beauty.

318
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:21,060
The lady is sketching this
new 17th century ideal of, of,

319
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:24,150
of married chastity,
the ideal of the temperate,

320
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,300
moderate indulgence in sexual pleasure,
pleasure of course,

321
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:31,540
within the sanctified confines
of marriage. And, and,

322
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,850
and this makes sense. We have to assume
that the lady is resisting comas,

323
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:40,851
his advances because she has before her
the higher ideal of married chastity.

324
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,290
One day she will become
a wife herself and it's,

325
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,600
it's in her husband that she will
eventually invest the talent of her bodily

326
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:52,570
wealth. To use the metaphor
that we get from Matthew 25,

327
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,150
it's a perfectly reasonable sentiment to
include an an example of the particular

328
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,320
genre that Milton is writing.

329
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:02,980
This mask in the form of this
mask is that of the romance.

330
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,020
It's a literary genre that,
that that dates back to classical Greece,

331
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,190
late classical Greece,

332
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,430
and which typically charged the trials
and tribulations of a hero in many cases,

333
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:17,200
the trials and tribulations
of a virginal heroin.

334
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,150
The romance heroin is often
threatened with rape, um,

335
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:27,070
but by her cleverness or by good
luck or concatenation of forces, um,

336
00:21:27,071 --> 00:21:30,850
she can always invariably avert that
tragedy. And by the end of the work,

337
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:34,840
she can present herself to her
future husband as, as a virgin.

338
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,030
And, and, and this,

339
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,790
this last twist is without question
the central element of the convention,

340
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,510
the Conventional Romance Plot.

341
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,230
And this remains a central element in
the Harlequin Romances for example,

342
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:51,300
that are, that are still I think
consumed. Um, so voraciously,

343
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,260
even today after her brush with danger
after her brush with sexual peril,

344
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,300
the romance heroin always gets married in
the end, the story has to end that way.

345
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,950
And her marriage is invariably seen as
her reward for all the trouble she's been

346
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,690
through.
Now,

347
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:12,010
given this the romance frame of
Milton's comas where we're not surprised

348
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:12,970
actually to see,

349
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,150
even though we don't see at the
end her actually getting married,

350
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:20,170
we're not surprised to see the lady in
this speech embracing a form of chastity,

351
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,410
that that promise is something
like an eventual turn to marriage.

352
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,060
This makes sense. And it's with
this hint at the state of marriage,

353
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:31,900
chastity, you know, kind of this,

354
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:34,890
it seems like a healthy
perspective. Um, it's,

355
00:22:34,891 --> 00:22:39,891
it's with this hint that the lady ended
her speech at the only 17th century

356
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:41,830
performance in comas,
which as you know,

357
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:46,831
took place at Ludlow Castle in 1634
on McComas night at this original

358
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:52,540
performance of the mask, the lady speech
read by the Lady Alice Edgerton, age 15,

359
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,160
um, ended at line seven 79 in, in,

360
00:22:57,161 --> 00:23:01,780
in your text. And, and I think after
hearing the lady enter speech at nine,

361
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:05,530
seven 79 that the audience
could reasonably expect
that the lady would someday

362
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:10,120
get married. But yeah, you can see from
the text that you have in your hues,

363
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:13,240
additions or any addition.
Um, and he printed edition.

364
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:16,600
Now the speech continues in the
version of the mask that, that we,

365
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,660
that we have while Milton wrote most of
the mask in 1634 he published it in 1637

366
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:29,641
and it's at this 0.3 years later that he
seems to have inserted into the lady's

367
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:35,530
speech and also elsewhere in the
poem, um, for, for this certain lines,

368
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:36,700
for the published version.

369
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,240
So the lady's speech and the
printed version continues
at line seven 79 and this

370
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:44,740
is what the lady asks,
how can you not love this?

371
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,260
Shall I go on or have I said enough?

372
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,000
Clearly Milton is instead of the way a
wonderfully speaking through the lady

373
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:56,160
here,
but then we get the lady again,

374
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,140
shall I go on or have I said enough to
him that dares arm his profane tongue

375
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:05,280
with contemptuous words against the
sun cloud power of chastity thing.

376
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:10,281
Would I something say yet to what end
thou has nor ear nor soul to apprehend the

377
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:16,701
sub sublime notion and high mystery that
must be uttered to unfold the sage and

378
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:22,080
serious doctrine of virginity.
She's speaking reluctantly here.

379
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,590
She'd love to tell calmness
something about chastity, but he has,

380
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:30,630
he has neither ear nor soul
to apprehending the sublime
notion and high mystery.

381
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,763
Okay.

382
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,310
The speeches as proceeding
rather smoothly.

383
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:39,760
And I think kind of Vic's
explicably as the lady defense,

384
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:42,330
The sun cloud power of chastity. Uh, but,

385
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,090
but look at the end of the passage
that I've just read a few lines down.

386
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,830
The doctrine that the lady
wishes to advance suddenly
seems so absolutely not to

387
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:56,190
be a doctrine of Mary chastity.
It's the,

388
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,780
it's the sage and serious doctrine.
The virginity that concludes the speech.

389
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,430
It's clear that something's
happened between 1634 and 1637. Uh,

390
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,740
Milton's lady doesn't proceed as we
expect her to talk to Marshall for their

391
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:15,540
arguments for the, for the
moderate fulfillment of one's
conjugal obligations. Uh,

392
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,840
there, there's no more talk of temperate
sex or the virtuous and moderate,

393
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,850
the virtuous moderation that's so
important to the ideal of Mary chastity.

394
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:27,960
And The lady begins to speak instead
of the unyielding virtue of sexual

395
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:32,910
abstinence. That's absolutely central to
an entirely different kind of doctrine.

396
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,620
The doctrine of, of, of
virginity. So we have to ask
this question. What's happened?

397
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,540
The lady has claimed that she's
hesitant to say anything at this point.

398
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,470
Tacoma's how could such a double edged
character possibly understand the

399
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:51,060
mysterious truths about chastity?
She re interestingly,

400
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:55,530
she refuses to unfold for her audience.

401
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,560
The Sagent serious doctrine of divinity.

402
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,540
Okay.

403
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,890
Of Virginity.
Um,

404
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,650
but she does anticipate what that doctrine
of virginity would look like if she

405
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:07,830
were to unfold it.

406
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,190
She explains to comas what would happen
should she actually choose to break her

407
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:13,641
silence,

408
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:16,940
should she actually choose to unleash
all of the rhetorical powers that she has

409
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:20,900
pent up inside of her? And,
and, and in some important way,

410
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:24,500
I think the lady can be seen as being in
the same position that Milton had been,

411
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,190
had been representing himself in.
And so many of the early poems,

412
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:33,191
he was continually imagining himself
to be someone on the verge of saying

413
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:36,140
something spectacular, but he
wasn't. He wasn't quite there yet.

414
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,530
But the lady continues.
Look at line seven 92.

415
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,520
Thou art not fit to hear
thy self convinced yet.

416
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:48,120
Should I try and she means shit. Should
I try voice the doctrine of virginity,

417
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,900
the uncontrolled worth of this pure cause
would kindle my rap spirits to such a

418
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:59,151
flame of sacred vehemence that dumb
things would be moved to sympathize and

419
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:04,371
their brut earth would lend her nerves
and shake till all by magic structures

420
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,390
weird so high were shattered
into heaps or thy false head.

421
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,920
She's making us a strong acclaim as, as
possible to make for the, for the, for,

422
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,570
for her potential for rhetorical power.

423
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,520
She implies that she's the equal,
uh,

424
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,600
to any of the great poetic heroes that
Milton so admires as a virginal order.

425
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,790
Should she choose to unleash your powers.
Um,

426
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,670
she would have the power of an Orpheus.

427
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,890
I'm moving dumb things to sympathize
Orpheus being one of Milton's most prized

428
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:42,630
mythological figures of the,
of the powerful poet.

429
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,430
She'd have the strength of a Samson,

430
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:48,840
the biblical hero who could shatter
huge structures over the heads of his

431
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:52,470
enemies.
She has way more power than she needs.

432
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,190
It would seem to destroy a petty
little may just like comas.

433
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,190
The power that the lady claims for herself
as a virgin is, is, is, is titanic.

434
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,560
And it allows us to understand,
I think,

435
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:07,920
why she has slipped
from her discussion of,

436
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,400
of married Chassidy to this new
discussion of what seems to be,

437
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,820
or what she claims is virginity it the
lapse makes a certain kind of sense.

438
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,300
I think because it's virginity and it's,
and not married chastity,

439
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:26,301
that the lady imagines will allow her to
demonstrate such a remarkable show of,

440
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,780
of rhetorical strength. It's, it's,

441
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,600
it's almost apocalyptic
in, in its force. Um, it,

442
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,570
it promises something like the power
of God is he brings the, the, the, the,

443
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:44,370
the shattering close of the
entire Christian narrative, uh,

444
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,210
t to an end at the, at the last
judgment and beyond. Um, and, and,

445
00:28:49,211 --> 00:28:53,040
and one of the,
one of the cultural phenomena fueling,

446
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:57,240
I think this rhetorical bursts of the
ladies is the prevalence 17th century, um,

447
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,630
anticipation of the end of the
world, the millennium, the,
the, the, all of these, uh,

448
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,780
uh, apocalyptic, uh,

449
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:07,620
beliefs that were swirling
around almost all of the,

450
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,240
a sectarian,

451
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,260
a sectarian religious
figures in the 17th century.

452
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,800
So,
given all of these cultural resonances,

453
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:21,330
there's a lot riding on the lady's
claim for her rhetorical powers here.

454
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,630
And, and you can understand that
initial hesitation when she asks,

455
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:29,030
shall I go on or have I said enough? She's
probably said way more than enough. Uh,

456
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:29,880
uh,

457
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,880
in her testimony to the potentially
apocalyptic power of her virginal speech.

458
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,560
She, she's, she's making extraordinary
claims for virgin and oratory.

459
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,030
And it has all of the power of,

460
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:46,960
of prophecy that Milton had had been
associating with a biblical prophets.

461
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,690
But, but as, as I've mentioned before,

462
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:53,440
she doesn't deliver
this anticipated speech.

463
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,120
And so virginities power remains untested.
W We,

464
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,540
we can't know just what force
virginity would exude. And,

465
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:04,520
and so the speech leaves
us where we begin, um,

466
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,860
in a state of uncertainty concerning
the ultimate strength of this virtue of,

467
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,320
of, of sexual abstinence. It leaves
this where we began asking what finally,

468
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,750
what is virginity good for?

469
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,330
We're reproducing a, the
problem that the, that the,

470
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:25,390
that the two brothers were
rehearsing in their debate.

471
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:31,410
So the lady in the 1637 vision version
of this poem of this mask is at an

472
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:33,334
impasse.

473
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,590
She stuck between a competing
ideals of bodily purity, uh,

474
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:43,591
just as just as surely and as
firmly as she is stuck to her seat.

475
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,020
And, uh, this is a,

476
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:51,520
this is a kind of a literary metal
literary allegories ation that I'll be

477
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,590
performing here.
But you could also think of Milton,

478
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,030
the poet as being stuck at this.
At this same juncture,

479
00:30:58,031 --> 00:31:00,640
he stuck between two meanings of chastity.

480
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,290
Chastity has absolute virginity and
chastity as the moderate and besieging

481
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,480
sexuality sanction within marriage.

482
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:13,260
And he's also stuck between two models
of speech with which we have become quite

483
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:18,430
familiar by this point. On the one hand,
he's, he wants to wait before he talks.

484
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:21,640
He wants to keep anticipating
producing the great speech, uh,

485
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:25,150
which is exactly what the lady has
been doing. But on the other hand,

486
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:30,151
Milton's possessed of a competing desire
to speak and to speak now to publish,

487
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,780
uh, to succeed, to consummate
his hat, his talents.

488
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,260
And it's as if Milton were paralyzed
almost at this moment in his choice,

489
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,910
uh,
between these various alternatives.

490
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:50,250
Now we know that the lady doesn't
end the masks happily us imagine how,

491
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,410
but it would be like
if this were the case,

492
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,380
she doesn't end the mask
stuck Tacoma's chair.

493
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,420
And it's important to figure out
exactly how the lady gets unstuck.

494
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,430
And so that's what we're going to
look at. Now. This is the [inaudible].

495
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,740
Remember there's first the bungled attempt
by the two brothers to release her.

496
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,430
Um, they forget to reverse. Comas
is won when they rushed into,

497
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,200
when they rushed him to his
layer. That didn't pan out. Um,

498
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,800
they had even obtained with the help of
the attendance spirit, the magical herbs,

499
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,070
Haman knee with all of
its Homeric associations.

500
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:25,720
But this too seemed inadequate to
the task of rescuing their sister.

501
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,140
The lady is only rescued once the
attendant spirit calls on the Nymph.

502
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,150
Sabrina the genius Loci,

503
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:37,480
the natural spirit of the Severn stream,

504
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:42,170
that which is the river that separates
England from Wales and Milton uses for

505
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:45,960
his source, for the
character. Sabrina, um,

506
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,970
another character named Sabrina
from Spencer's the fairy queen.

507
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,560
There's a wonderful work of literary
criticism. I mentioned it last time, um,

508
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,990
on Milton's indebtedness to Spencer,
um,

509
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,110
in the book by John Guillory
called Poetic Authority.

510
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,000
I urge you to look at it if
you're interested in, um,
the, the fact that Sabrina,

511
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:09,680
this little character here has her origin
and Spencer's important. Uh, Spencer's,

512
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:13,760
the great early Christian Poet
in English of Holy Matrimony.

513
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,130
Um, and, uh, according to
Gillery is brilliant argument.

514
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,710
Um,
he has the power to counteract.

515
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Spencer does the magical
effect that Shakespeare wields
through the character of

516
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:31,970
comas. The lady had claimed for
herself a remarkable set of powers,

517
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:33,560
but she wasn't yet ready to use them.

518
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:39,110
She was paralyzed in speech just as just
as she was prevented from even moving.

519
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,910
And it was almost as if a sobrinas a
sent from the Severn stream to assist the

520
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:48,911
lady in her time of need
suggests Spencer's arrival
from the realm of English

521
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:53,840
literature to assist the
young poet John Milton,

522
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,270
Edmund Spenser arrives,

523
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,440
arises to help Milton
overcome the paralyzing effect

524
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,850
of the comas like power of Shakespeare.
Uh,

525
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:11,600
let's see if this makes any sense.
Uh, look at line eight 52 of comas.

526
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,840
This is page 110 in the Hughes.
The attendant experience,

527
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,490
the attendant spirit
explains that sobrinas in,

528
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,750
in possession of precious vialed
liquors that have the capacity to heal.

529
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,460
So at line eight 52 up,

530
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:30,461
Sabrina can unlock the clasping charm and
thaw the numbing spell if she be right

531
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:35,681
invoked and warbled song for maidenhood
she loves and will be swift to aid a

532
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:40,760
virgin such as was herself
in hard besetting need this.

533
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:44,780
Will I try and add the power
of some ad during verse?

534
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,420
The power reverse has everything to do
with the power wielded by Sabrina to save

535
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,940
the lady from,
from her paralysis.

536
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,880
If if right invoked in warbled song,

537
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:00,040
Sabrina can actually be called
down for assistance. Um, and,

538
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:04,640
and it's just this or called up for
assistance and it's just this interest in

539
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:08,120
the right, the proper form of warbled
song that's so important here.

540
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:13,330
She resists represents a power that
might enable Milton to warble a right or

541
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:17,510
proper song. She represents a power that
might enable Milton. Perhaps someday.

542
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:21,770
Actually to fulfill,
to consummate his,

543
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:26,360
his much anticipated poetic promise.
But how does she do that?

544
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:29,300
Look at line 910.

545
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,690
This is page 111 in the Hughes.

546
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,410
Sabrina says to the lady,
she rises from the water,

547
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,690
Brightest Lady, look on me.
Thus I sprinkle on my breasts,

548
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,850
drops that from my fountain pure.

549
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:49,080
I have kept of precious
cure thrice upon my fingers.

550
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:52,200
Tip Thrice upon the ruby lip.
Next,

551
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,760
this marble marble venom
seat smeared with gums,

552
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:57,900
have glutenous heat.

553
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,580
I touch with chased palms moist and cold.

554
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,800
Now, if this is a, this is a, if this
is a scene as it's been argued of,

555
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,790
of Sabrina's baptism of the lady, it's
a, it's a curious baptism. Indeed,

556
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,120
we might think that the,

557
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:18,390
that sobrinas chased palms moist and
cold would only make more frigid and more

558
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:22,050
frozen, uh, the the body
of the lady. But in fact,

559
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,020
it's just the opposite that happens.
Um,

560
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,350
I think of the delicate, really beautiful
sensuality here and sobrinas speech.

561
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,480
I don't think we were expecting this.
Uh,

562
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,160
she evokes the beauty
of the ladies Ruby Blip.

563
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,170
How inappropriate the eroticization of
the ladies beauty has up to this point

564
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:48,060
come exclusively from comas. And in
and in touching the lady's fingers tip.

565
00:36:48,061 --> 00:36:52,860
It's as if Sabrina were awakening the
first time, the lady sense of, of,

566
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:53,694
of touch.

567
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:58,230
Now the lady we know has an exquisite
and powerful sense of hearing.

568
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,490
Uh, she's a poet and she
has an impeccable ear,

569
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,750
but this fiercely virginal lady
has not up to up to this point,

570
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:10,650
even begun to develop
her other sensory realms.

571
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:14,880
And when Sabrina touches the surprisingly
sensual ruby lip of the lady,

572
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,200
she's an essence baptizing,

573
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:20,940
I think in sanctioning the erotic drives
that the lady has been so fiercely

574
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,260
repressing.

575
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,950
She baptizes the entire domain of non
auditory sensual experience that the lady

576
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:33,030
so forcefully avoids. And you can think
of Sabrina as she touches so gently.

577
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:37,800
The lady, this is the, this is to use the,

578
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:38,100
uh,

579
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:43,100
the wonderful phrase that John Guillory
used actually in this very room when I

580
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:45,720
was a, when I took the Milton
mature as an undergraduate.

581
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,910
That's what Sabrina is doing is,
uh, and this dates John Gallery.

582
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:52,170
This is a very seventies phrase,

583
00:37:52,171 --> 00:37:57,171
but Sabrina is activating the lady's
erogenous zones and there's something,

584
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,100
there's, there's, there's
something to that with,

585
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,830
with this magical touching of the
lady with their precious liquor.

586
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,180
Sabrina's saves the lady
from her paralysis and,

587
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:11,010
and Milton stage directions. Just
say at all. It's very simple. Uh, uh,

588
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,910
the lady just rises out of her seat.
I don't want to suggest that the,

589
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,040
that sobrinas work is purely erotic hair.

590
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:23,470
There's a lot more than sex implied in
this redemptive touching and touching the

591
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:27,360
ladies ruby lip.
She's also,

592
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:32,361
I think releasing the ladies hesitation
to speak after after comas is masterful

593
00:38:34,441 --> 00:38:38,890
seduction replete with all of
its illusions to the, to the, uh,

594
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,200
the parable of the
talents from Matthew 25.

595
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,980
The lady you'll remember had
been so hesitant to speak.

596
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:49,981
I had not thought to have unlocked my
lips in this unhallowed air and when she

597
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:55,030
does unlock our lips ever so slightly
when she doesn't lock our lips, uh,

598
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:59,320
she does do only to anticipate the effect
that our speeches would have if she

599
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:02,150
were to unlock them even more.
Um,

600
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,530
everything is entirely
conditional and future oriented.

601
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:08,690
Sobrinas touching of the ladies lip,
uh,

602
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:14,170
seems to unlock perhaps permanently
the rhetorical hesitation that has

603
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:19,030
paralyzed, uh, the lady and
the lady is, is, is liberated.

604
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,190
Uh, of course we have no evidence
of the ladies rhetorical liberation.

605
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,710
There's no, there's no further
speech on her part. Um,

606
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,260
but it's an important action.
I think nonetheless, the
touching of the ladies rip,

607
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,920
the touching of the ladies lip touches
us in, in, in other ways as well though,

608
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:43,540
at least in this lecture because we
remember that, uh, that unfortunate,

609
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,680
that horrifying image of,

610
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,720
of the lip that Milton had
noted in the commonplace book,

611
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,390
St Abba Abba had not
only severed her nose,

612
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,900
she had also severed her lip.
And I think it's worth thinking about,

613
00:39:55,901 --> 00:39:57,720
at least for a moment,
um,

614
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,030
of the oddity of this terrible act
of self mutilation, the Superflow,

615
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,180
his action suggest that there was
something more at stake perhaps than C

616
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:12,210
[inaudible] attempt to ward off
sexual assault to disfigure the mouth.

617
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,170
This is how I would
interpret it to disfigure.

618
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:21,820
The mouth has a primary
effect in rendering one,

619
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:23,710
at least temporarily speechless.

620
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,790
And I think there's a connection here
between the image from the commonplace

621
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:32,791
book and the treatment in Milton's
mask of this strange strangely can join

622
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:37,510
phenomenon of virginity and speechlessness
and the little scene from the early

623
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:39,970
English history that Milton
had selected from his reading.

624
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,110
You have an image of silencing of a,
of a,

625
00:40:43,111 --> 00:40:48,040
of a horrifying and unredeemable
speechlessness that is
so closely connected to

626
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,340
virginity. And it would seem
to be the terrible thing of,

627
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,930
of Saint [inaudible] to die,

628
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:57,490
both speechless and virginal that
Milton is struggling to avoid here.

629
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,430
So yeah,

630
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,840
Columbus is a celebration of virginity
and it might even be a celebration of

631
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:08,890
Milton's endlessly anticipatory mood,
the mood of,

632
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,340
of imaging himself as
a, as, as a great poet.

633
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,410
But th but these virtues,

634
00:41:14,411 --> 00:41:18,660
however great I think are also associated
in the mask with the ladies Petro

635
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:19,494
faction,
her,

636
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,920
her fixation on the seat that
Comis has has fashioned for her.

637
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,330
And it's one of the duties
of the masks plot, uh,

638
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,860
to get the lady out of her seat.
And you,

639
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,810
and you can see in the song that the
Sabrina's sings something of the mechanism

640
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:40,610
perhaps by which this transition is,
is affected. Uh, look at line eight 97.

641
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,110
We're almost done here.

642
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,910
Sabrina rises from the water and
appears gradually on the land making a

643
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:50,750
transition a lot like the one the
lady will eventually have to make.

644
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:55,751
She sings sobrinas sings whilst
from off the water's fleet.

645
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:59,600
Thus I set my print lists
feet or the cows slips,

646
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:04,130
velvet head that Ben's not as I trend now,

647
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:08,990
her feet are of course print lists
because she's Arie and a theorial and she

648
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:11,690
leaves no tread on the
cowl slips or the flowers.

649
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:17,160
But this is an odd phrase.
You'll concede parentless feet and,

650
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,490
and it's odd. This is
important. Feed of course,

651
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:22,190
has a lot of meanings
and Milton's poetic feet.

652
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:24,080
The material of the verse written in,

653
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,470
in six and eight and 10
syllables in this poem, um,

654
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:32,210
are also in 1634 print lists there.
They're unpublished.

655
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:35,100
And when comas is first
perform per first perform,

656
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:38,150
Milton's poetry hasn't yet been printed.
Um,

657
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,020
but it's almost as if Sabrina,
um,

658
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,000
seems to have died print
lists or unpublished so that
Milton wouldn't have to,

659
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:52,790
um, it's a sacrifice on, on, on our
poet's behalf. That would be one, uh,

660
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,260
literarily allegorical way to think
of it. Now, as I noted earlier,

661
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:01,310
there's a difference between the two
existing texts of Milton's comas.

662
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:06,170
There's the performance version of 1634
and the printed version of 37. And,

663
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:10,040
and the additions to the texts that Milton
is making for the published version,

664
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:14,960
uh, reflect, I think he's since that
he liked the lady is in process,

665
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,180
in the process of making
an important transition.

666
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,050
He is no longer or no longer
wants to be an infants.

667
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:25,010
I'm a poetic virgin,
a speechless poet.

668
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:30,530
There's also another, another
transition that he's making. Um,

669
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,260
and this, this involves the subject
of virginity not as speechlessness,

670
00:43:36,261 --> 00:43:40,630
but his actual abstinence. The,
the final. Um, and I'll just, uh,

671
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,510
I'll just point you quickly to
this passage. Look at line 1003.

672
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,030
It's on page 113 in the Hughes.

673
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,570
After we have the lady
wandering through the forest,

674
00:43:50,571 --> 00:43:54,110
she joins her father with
her brothers and we get this,

675
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:57,320
but far above in spangled
sheen celestial cupid,

676
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,240
her fame son advanced
holds his dear psyche,

677
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:05,241
Sweden tranced after her wandering
Labor's long till free consent,

678
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:10,600
the gods among make her his eternal bride.
Uh,

679
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,420
you can see an image here of cupids
eventual marriage to psyche as a pointed

680
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:18,620
reference to the,
the,

681
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:23,590
the likelihood that the lady to will
will become someone's eternal Brian. Um,

682
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,780
in 1634 in the first version,
we didn't have this anticipation of,

683
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:32,490
of the ladies for future
marriage. This, this didn't exist.

684
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:37,990
The lily remained much more fixed in
her idealization of virginity and a lot

685
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:40,590
more silent in her responses to comas.

686
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,330
But it's almost as if the prospect of
publishing this mask seems to have induced

687
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:50,010
in Milton and interest in trying to move
beyond the idealization of virginity,

688
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,120
um,

689
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,680
beyond simply the
anticipation of future power.

690
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,300
Um,
and you're,

691
00:44:57,301 --> 00:45:01,950
you're getting to see something
like an intimation of John Milton,

692
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,960
the published poet,

693
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:10,980
a poet whose energies are going to be
directed toward making his poems public.

694
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:15,900
The poet of anticipation is beginning
to think of himself as the poet of

695
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:16,734
achievement.

696
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,940
And the poet of the radical
power of virginity is
beginning to redirect a lot of

697
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:22,650
his interests to the radical pair,

698
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,490
the radical power of married sexuality.
Now,

699
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,150
it won't be another four or five
years after the publication of,

700
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:32,640
of calmness that Milton will
himself actually be married.

701
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,010
But the transition from virginity to
marry chastity charted in this poem that

702
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:43,011
we'd been looking at nonetheless
reflects a marked interest in the nature,

703
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:48,000
not only of Milton's personal life, but
in the nature of his literary interests.

704
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,390
He's beginning to put aside all of
those literary anxieties induced by his

705
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:54,870
reading of Shakespeare.

706
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:00,290
And it's as if he's more and more willing
to use as a kind of literary assistant

707
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,750
or Helper Spencer,
the great,

708
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:07,230
the Great Poet of Holy Matrimony
and married sexual bliss.

709
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,470
And in the works that Milton is going
to be publishing now with greater and

710
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:11,340
greater frequency.

711
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:16,170
It's this Spin Siri and ideal of marriage
that will be the new, and believe me,

712
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:21,090
that endlessly complex
miltonic subject now for, um,

713
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,940
for, for next time we'll
be reading lists at us, uh,

714
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:27,480
which is about the death of a friend
and a death of a friend. In fact,

715
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:31,740
two died a virgin. We have to assume,
um, it's not about marriage and it will,

716
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:36,180
a marriage will still seem quite a
quite a ways off. I fear when you read,

717
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:37,020
listen to us.
Um,

718
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,740
but we will be marking the transition
to the poetry of marriage soon enough.

719
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:41,341
Listen,

720
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:45,630
this is probably the most difficult poem
linguistically that we'll be reading

721
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:50,070
all semester. Um, it repays in
numerable readings and re readings.

722
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:55,050
So I urge you to read it a 75 times,

723
