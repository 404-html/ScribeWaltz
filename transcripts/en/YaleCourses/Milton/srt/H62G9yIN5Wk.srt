1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,280
In the invocation to book nine of paradise
lost. Milton describes, and it's a,

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:05,640
it's,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,660
it's wonderful to see this representation
of this process that I think we've

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,560
been wondering about.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,860
He describes the process by which the
heavenly muse inspires and he says

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:20,400
inspires nightly the
composition of his epic.

7
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,820
And he explains that the subject for
his heroic song and of course we'll be

8
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:26,610
getting to book nine later.
Uh, but it's, it's a, it's,

9
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:30,880
it's relevant for our discussion today.
Uh,

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,360
Milton explains that the
subject for his heroic song,

11
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:38,361
the subject of the fall of man pleased
me long choosing and to beginning late,

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,560
pleased me long choosing and beginning
late. And as we know very well,

13
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:46,530
Milton decided to write an
epic poem at a very early age,

14
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:49,060
but his decision to write an epic poems,
uh,

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,730
some epic long predated his sense of
what exactly that epic was going to be

16
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,710
about. He was long and choosing
the subject of his heroic song.

17
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:02,160
And as well as we know from all of,
and we've encountered a number of them,

18
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,560
all of those protestations of delay.

19
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,730
Milton began his epic late.

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,170
So we last left.
We last left the poet in a 1640s.

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,630
A area epigenic you'll remember
was written in 1644. Uh, the, the,

22
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,631
the story of Adam and eve and of the
end of the fall of Satan may strike us

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
having read or about to read paradise
lost may strike us as a natural subject

24
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:33,750
for Milton to have chosen for his, for
his epic poem. After all, this is a,

25
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,380
an extremely pious puritan,
but as late as the 1640,

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,270
this was not at all of the epics subject
that Milton was intending to use Milton.

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,120
And we know this.
Milton was a political revolutionary,

28
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:47,640
and when he anticipated
writing the great poem,

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,410
he consistently imagined
that it would be a poem on a,

30
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,000
on a nationalist theme.

31
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,220
Milton's would be an epic demonstrating
the origins and the heroic achievement

32
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,140
of his own, of his own nation, England.

33
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,770
Or maybe he'd be thinking a little broadly
of Britain, which is England, Scotland,

34
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,220
and Wales. And in this
respect, it would resemble a,

35
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:11,940
it would resemble a
Spencer's fairy queen or, or,

36
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,350
or perhaps more importantly,

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,380
Virgil's Aeneid other nationalist
epic's now Milton at the same time we're

38
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,300
talking about the 1640s had had been
contemplating writing a play and that was,

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,340
that was supposed to be a tragedy that
in some manuscript drafts that we still

40
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,600
have today. Um, he in
some manuscript drafts,

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,440
he titled This Prospective
Prospective Tragedy,

42
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,460
paradise lost and another drafts,
uh,

43
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,390
Adam on paradise on
paradise. Um, and by, by the,

44
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,930
by the time Milton and actually all these,
uh,

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,660
all of these early drafts,
these notes,

46
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:52,170
these outlines for this tragedy that
actually never seemed to have gotten

47
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,260
written, um, are, are
included in the Tyco packet.

48
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,830
But by the time Milton
begins writing his epic, he,

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,310
his plan for a nationalistic poem,
a nationalist poem,

50
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:07,450
and decides instead to use the subject
matter that he had been 10 intending for

51
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:10,600
that perspective, tragedy, paradise lost.

52
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,780
And so were the reasons for this really
enormous shift in plans and the enormous

53
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,550
shift in subject matter
are worth exploring.

54
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,850
Milton had devoted 19 years
to the world of politics and,

55
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,600
and a lot and a lot has happened since
the exuberant optimism of police,

56
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,480
of the political spirit that we see in
attract like, like area politica. In, in,

57
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,990
in 1649, the, this, the Great
Puritan Revolution reached, uh,

58
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,400
an unspeakable, a climax, a minority,

59
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,720
a minority government of revolutionary
puritans had effectively taken control of

60
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:47,554
the state.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,870
And so the radical puritan parliament
voted to execute the tyrant,

62
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,310
what they consider to be the tyrant King
Charles the first and to establish its

63
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,270
own government.

64
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,690
And Milton participated with
a extraordinary enthusiasm
and considerable zeal in

65
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,690
the establishment of England's
new non monarchic government,

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,470
initially a commonwealth. And then
what we can think of as a republic.

67
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,790
He had been the foremost propagandists
for the, for the puritan side.

68
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,010
And he had not only written really quite
daringly on behalf of the execution of

69
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,670
this particular king, but he wrote
another pamphlet, iconic class DS,

70
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,830
which is included in the Hughes edition,
which is a shocking defensive,

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,540
just regicide in general, uh,
not just in England, but as a,

72
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,040
as a kind of political principle.

73
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,390
Milton probably around this time
around the time that he was writing and

74
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:44,300
finishing the regicide treatises
began to lose his eyesight. Uh,

75
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,210
this is the earliest years of the,
of the Commonwealth government.

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,160
Nonetheless,

77
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,330
even blind Milton could serve the
serve the new regime as both the state

78
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,164
licenser.

79
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,820
And I won't even get into the irony of
the fact that Milton seems to actually

80
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:05,821
become the license or the license or a
printed texts that of course he had seven

81
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:09,050
or eight years before,
so utterly abhorred in the area.

82
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,850
But Jenica he seems to have had
some work as the state licenser,

83
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,080
but also more importantly,

84
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,560
and this is a much bigger commitment
as the nation's Latin secretary,

85
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,900
which means that he would compose
and translate all of the, uh,

86
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,690
England's correspondence with,
uh,

87
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,700
with the governments on the
continent to and from Latin.

88
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,860
So up until the, oh, up until this
period, the early 1650s, Milton was a,

89
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,480
a devoted contributor to the
ideal puritan notion of this,

90
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,690
of this government. And it was really
the height of his political idealism.

91
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,590
Fast forward a few more years. By the end
of this decade, by the end of the 1650s,

92
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:49,960
Milton can see as good others,
uh,

93
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,760
fairly clearly that what we can think
of is the eminent collapse of the

94
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:58,030
Republican, of the Republican. Uh,

95
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,760
the majority of Englishman we're
calling for the return of their nations

96
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,990
rightful monarch. And it wasn't, it
wasn't long before the revolution failed.

97
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,250
And, and, and the Stuart
monarchy was restored.

98
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,280
The son of the executed king
who had been an exile and,

99
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,540
and France was returned
to the throne in England.

100
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,330
And so at the restoration,
as it's called the restoration,

101
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:23,720
which took place in 1660,
the puritan revolutionaries,

102
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,670
the revolutionaries like Milton who had
devoted their labors to the success of

103
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:33,671
this Utopian ideal of
the Puritan Commonwealth
experienced a humiliating and,

104
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,910
and bitter defeat. Um, a
lot of Milton's friends,

105
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,390
a lot of Milton's comrades were hanged
and quartered and Milton himself was

106
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:48,470
jailed and jailed for his,
for having written.

107
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,120
The regicide treatise
is we have to assume,

108
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:53,720
and it seems to have been solely the
influence of some important friends that

109
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,750
kept Milton from being held in prison.
And definitely,

110
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:01,751
and it's entirely imaginable that
Milton could have been executed for his

111
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,300
writings on behalf of the killing of,
of King Charles.

112
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,300
So it's at this point, this is when, uh,

113
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,220
this is when Milton begins. Finally,
this is after the revolution has failed,

114
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,740
that Milton begins to write as epic poem.

115
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,900
And it's at this point
that Milton to chooses,

116
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,030
chooses to write an epic not on a
nationalist theme as Virgil went on,

117
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,540
or as Spencer had done there,

118
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,470
there was simply no nation
worth writing about. And,

119
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,740
and all of Milton's labors in the cause
of liberating England from the tyranny

120
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:39,650
of monarchy had in some way could,
could,

121
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:42,650
could be construed as having having
been useless and all of Milton's

122
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,320
expectations that England
might actually be transformed.

123
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,170
And they were glorious expectation.

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,160
Did it transformed into something like
a pure it and utopia or even a puritan

125
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,420
paradise.
All of that had been destroyed.

126
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:57,850
And so it's at this point that Milton
shows for the subject of his era,

127
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,693
epic poem,

128
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,220
the subject of the tragedy that he'd
been contemplating for so many years.

129
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,640
The epic was going to treat the fall,

130
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,770
the fall of, uh, both of Adam
and eve, Adam and eve from there,

131
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,320
a blissful state.
I'm in Eden,

132
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,330
but also the fall of the rebel
angels after their failed revolution.

133
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,000
And there's a continual analogy
running through paradise lost.

134
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:27,560
And it's a very troubling one that
associates the paradise that man lost with

135
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,150
Utopian government that England lost.
And of course,

136
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,570
perhaps even more troubling is the
satanic parallel as well. And you'll,

137
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:40,571
you'll want to think about why Milton
seems so aggressively to invite the,

138
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:46,501
the association between the failure of
the Association of the failure of the

139
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,010
just revolution of the puritans.
Of course,

140
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:52,670
that's how he would see it with the
failure of the unjust revolution of the,

141
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:55,070
of the rebel angels under
the guidance of Satan.

142
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,250
Milton began writing his epic poem too
late to celebrate a virtuous political

143
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:06,810
realm. It's, it's, it's too late
for this to be a political poem. Um,

144
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,430
but paradise lost is, is, is late for
all sorts of reasons. It's a, it's,

145
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,640
it's late for some personal reasons as
well. Uh, Milton had been, as you know,

146
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,620
anticipating writing
this poem since he has,

147
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,740
since he was at least 19 years old,

148
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,630
but he didn't even begin to fulfill
what we can think of as his epic promise

149
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,940
until he was nearly 50 years old,

150
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,200
until he had actually lost the use of
his eyes and telling you could no longer

151
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:36,201
read until he could no
longer use a pen to write.

152
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,210
And finally, Milton's poem is late by the,
by virtue of the simple fact that it's,

153
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,730
that it's written in the form of an epic.

154
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,400
An epic might seen like a
great idea when Milton was 19,

155
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,560
but by the time Nelson gets
actually around the writing, it, um,

156
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,290
it's an entirely superannuated,
utterly outdated form. Uh,

157
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,480
there's of course the, the, the undeniable
fact that the greatest epics, the Iliad,

158
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,190
the Odyssey,
and then the Aeneid were all written in a,

159
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,060
in a heroic literary past that would
have struck anybody as is irrecoverable.

160
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,070
But even the modern practice
of epic riding or romance,

161
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,390
epic writing had basically
entirely fizzled out by the
end of the 16th century.

162
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,610
Um, then, uh, the, the Italians,
I'm thinking of Tesco and,

163
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,270
and Ariosto there,
there,

164
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,300
there had been a half century that had
passed since any great modern epic or

165
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:33,210
romance epic had even been produced and
there would have been a prevailing sense

166
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:35,190
and Milton has to have
been sensitive to this,

167
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,410
that it was simply to write too late to
write an epic of any kind on any subject.

168
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,930
Milton began his epic poem late.
So it's in,

169
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:50,550
it's relate in relation to all of these
forms of lateness that we can best

170
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:54,210
understand the, the opening
invocation of paradise lost. So look,

171
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,690
look at the first, the first lines of
the poem. This is page 211. And the hues,

172
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,770
um, and Harold Bloom has,
has, uh, has written,

173
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,420
and I think he's absolutely right that
Milton begins paradise lost with a

174
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:13,500
powerful defense,
a defense against lateness.

175
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,970
And it's this,
it's,

176
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:18,690
you can think of it as this reaction to
the problem of late and us that accounts

177
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,180
for one of the invocations,
most distinctive features.

178
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,150
And that's the repetition
of the word first.

179
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:28,410
You actually have the word first appearing
six times in the first 33 lines of

180
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,110
paradise lost. Just,
uh, we'll, we'll, we'll,

181
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:35,280
we'll do a little catalog of them of
man's first disobedience and the fruit.

182
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,900
That was line one. Of course, line eight,

183
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,070
that shepherd who first taught
the chosen seed, lily 19.

184
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:44,970
Now from the first west present,
go down to line 27. Say First.

185
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,710
First heaven hides nothing from my view
a line 28 say first what cause and line

186
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:53,950
33 who first seduced them to that revolt.

187
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,580
Milton is alerting us to the
significance of the word first. Um,

188
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,800
in the very first line in this wonderful
act of violating the laws of I ambig

189
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,630
pentameter. Then now the, the, the rhythm
of a true line of I ambig pentameter.

190
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:15,370
And there of course, hundreds, maybe
thousands of such lines in this poem.

191
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,810
Um, a true line of I amic pentameter
would run like this, you know, this Duh,

192
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,830
Duh Duh da Duh da Duh da Duh
da UN unaccented syllable
followed by an accented

193
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:29,770
syllable and that little pattern
repeated five times. And so with this,

194
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I am bic template in mind with this little
paradigm in our head and we may feel,

195
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,320
we may feel metrically constrained to
read the first line of this poem like this

196
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,520
of Man's first disobedience and the fruit,

197
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,970
not an no hundred, hundred,
hundred of man's first
disobedience. And the fruit, it,

198
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,550
it sounds stupid. Uh, it,
it shouldn't sound stupid.

199
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:57,220
It's impossible to get away
with such an awkward reading.

200
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,370
But that's the reading that the metrical
form is pushing us into producing that

201
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:07,210
word first. And the problem
is with the, the, my,

202
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,420
my awkward metrically a proper reading
of that first line is that the word first

203
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,690
insists on being accented
and it screws up,

204
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,900
it screws up the template of man's
first disobedience and the fruit.

205
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,880
And so Milton is, is, is,

206
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,840
is rebelling against an implicit law of
poetic meter in the very first line of

207
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,674
what?

208
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Of course we know we'll be
this extraordinarily self
conscious poem and you

209
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:39,910
could think of this as the poems first
by no means by no means, it's last.

210
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:42,340
It's first act of poetic disobedience.

211
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,340
Now the word first begins to take on a
a much bigger range of significance is

212
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,990
then we might at first think
when Milton instructs his muse,

213
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:55,030
say first for heaven hides
nothing. From my view, there's,

214
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,340
there's something more here than
the primary sense of the word,

215
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:59,200
which is just first in sequence.

216
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,420
And Milton of course is instructing the
muse to explain first before she gets

217
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:08,230
around to explaining anything else
what caused Adam and eve to fall.

218
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:10,420
That's just the simple
sequential sense of first,

219
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,570
the first that comes before
second, third, and fourth.

220
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,120
But there's something more radical here.

221
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:21,121
Then the ordinal or sequential sense
of first first can also mean earliest.

222
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,970
And Milton's describing his muse,

223
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,880
describing his muse now at
the present moment of the,

224
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:30,460
of the writing of the
poem to be the first one.

225
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,530
Perhaps ever to explain
the cause of the fall,

226
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:40,000
to be the first to tell the story of
the loss of paradise, or I don't know,

227
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,530
to be the first perhaps to be the
first poet ever to write an epic poem.

228
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,010
Milton's Milton's constructing a, it's a
remarkable and impossible strategy here.

229
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,920
And it's when we can call a strategy
of retrospective anticipation.

230
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,020
And it's a type of, uh, of course, this
retrospective anticipation can only be,

231
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,130
can only be a fiction one can never
come before something that of course has

232
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:08,740
already happened. Uh, but this
fiction of an impossible first,

233
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,580
and this is something that Miss Milton is,

234
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,620
is working very hard to accomplish
here. Um, and, and we know this,

235
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,250
Milton has already indulged this fantasy
of coming before something that's

236
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,640
already happened.
Um,

237
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,690
we recognize this desire to anticipate
and already existing narrative from,

238
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,450
from what? From Milton's
first major poem, the, the,

239
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:32,450
the naitivity own Milton directed
the heavenly news. In that poem,

240
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:34,490
you'll remember to prevent,

241
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,840
to come before the three wise men
who were, who were hasting to there,

242
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,400
to the manger with their gold and
their frankincense and myrrh. Oh, run,

243
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,110
prevent them with my humble load.
Have Thou the honor first by Lord degree

244
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,090
and I, and I suggest that we can,
we can hear some of the echos.

245
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,940
We can hear echoes of that same youthful
competitiveness in Milton's first major

246
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:02,120
poem in these opening
lines in the, in the, in,

247
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:05,000
in the beginning of the great
epic of Milton's maturity.

248
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,880
Milton wants to write an
epic that in some way,

249
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,540
in some ways comes before or prevents
the great epics of homer and Virgil.

250
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,200
This is it. Safe to say that
this is no, no, no easy feat,

251
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,651
no easy feat,

252
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:26,300
but as presumptuous is that desire is
to come before homer or to come before

253
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,910
Virgil.
It's by no means the final sense,

254
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:33,380
I think of Milton's ambitious drive
to be first. Milton invokes the seam.

255
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:38,330
Heavenly news here. Who Inspired Moses?
That shepherd? Look at line eight,

256
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:42,290
Moses, that shepherd who
first taught the chosen seed.

257
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,530
It's almost as if could this be.

258
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,800
It's almost as if Milton wants to narrate
the events of the creation and the

259
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:53,240
fall with the same kind of
firstness that Moses, Moses did.

260
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,291
Milton would of course,

261
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,790
steps have assumed that it was Moses who
had written the first five books of the

262
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,010
Bible, the Pentateuch, and

263
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,300
to prevent or come before Moses is a,
is an act of,

264
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:11,720
of prevention or anticipation,
far more dangerous. Uh,

265
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,070
then mere literary competitiveness.
Milton, what's Milton doing here?

266
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:21,450
We could see him as actually
vying with scripture and,

267
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,480
and implicit in this invocation is a,

268
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:28,070
is a truly remarkable claim that
this poem is the same product,

269
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,550
is the product of the same
divine authority that had
informed and inspired the

270
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:37,250
writing of the Holy Bible,
seeing heavenly muse,

271
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,390
that on the secret top of Oribella or
of Sinai did inspire that shepherd who

272
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:47,240
first taught the chosen
seed in the beginning,

273
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:52,241
how the heavens and earth rose out
of chaos or of Zion Hill delight.

274
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,880
The more in Siler was Brooke that
flowed fast by the Oracle of God,

275
00:17:56,881 --> 00:18:00,660
I then invoke thy aid
to my adventurous song.

276
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,760
Now, Milton doesn't want, uh,

277
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,570
Milton doesn't want simply to be an
epic poet like homer and Virgil. Ah,

278
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,640
that, that's that. No sweat with that one.

279
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:16,641
But Milton wants to be a divine prophet
like one of the great Hebrew poets of

280
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,211
the Old Testament,

281
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:21,690
and this is why he's continually placing
the imaginative origin of the poem.

282
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,580
Back back to the very dawn of time,
perhaps even back before,

283
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,430
if you can imagine such a time
before the very dawn of time,

284
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,440
Milton wants to create the illusion that
he's predicting or that he's prophesied.

285
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,070
The actions recounted in the poem
is it Milton were prophesying what?

286
00:18:38,071 --> 00:18:39,750
Of course we know to be already passed.

287
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,790
This is the strategy of
retrospective anticipation. Now,

288
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,791
Milton can make this implicit claim for
a prophecy because he's being inspired

289
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,990
by none other than the divine spirit
that had inspired Moses to sing of of

290
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:55,980
divine creation.

291
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,400
How the heavens and earth
rose out of chaos. This is
already an outrageous claim,

292
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,460
but Milton dares to go even further.
Now,

293
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,220
not only is this the same muse who ended,

294
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,760
had inspired Moses to
write about creation.

295
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,830
This heavenly spirit was actually
present at the moment of creation.

296
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:21,831
Look at line 17 and chiefly thou spirit
that does prefer before old temples,

297
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:25,080
the upright,
heart and pure.

298
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:30,170
Instruct me for Thou knowest thou from
the first wants to present and with

299
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:31,831
mighty wings.

300
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:36,140
Outspread Doug like sets brooding
on the vast abyss and made,

301
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:41,141
stood pregnant of of all
of the appearances of the
word first in these opening

302
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:47,430
lines, this is the first that
has to bear the most weight.

303
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,680
This spirit to whom Milton is praying

304
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,900
was the actual vehicle through
which God created the universe.

305
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:02,310
This is the spirit through whom God
fashioned the world out of chaos.

306
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,340
This is the spirit that Moses
says in the first book of Genesis.

307
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,630
This is the spirit that moved upon
the face of the waters at the time of

308
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:14,100
creation and Milton. Milton goes
beyond the image of this creation,

309
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,880
this creative power
provided for us by the,

310
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:21,690
by the King James Translation of the
Bible or by any English translation of the

311
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:24,480
Bible. In Milton's time,
he looks back even further.

312
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,050
Milton goes back to the
Latin version of the Bible,

313
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:33,051
which translates the Hebrew word
for move moved as in Cuba Bot.

314
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,040
That's Jerome's translation.
Uh,

315
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,030
incubate is the strange
Latin word and it's a verb.

316
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,860
Of course, as we know, it's
a verb typically used with
relation not to spirits,

317
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:52,180
but to just dating birds.
And it literally means to brood,

318
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,440
to incubate means to brood or to
sit on one's eggs until they hatch.

319
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,300
And so Milton's Holy Spirit,
the,

320
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:04,301
the creative force behind the entire
universe actually sat brooding on the vast

321
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:09,820
abyss sitting on the wall there.
Waters of chaos,

322
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:13,930
just as a mother dove might sit
on her eggs and, and Milton,

323
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,870
think of what Milton's asking us
to here. It's a, he's asking a lot.

324
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,230
He's asking us to imagine God or perhaps
this is God's creative spirit as some

325
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:27,691
sort of feminine being
laying the universal egg and
brooding over it until it

326
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,940
bursts forth with, with new life. I
remember Milton is, is this is a risk.

327
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:37,550
Milton's treading an extraordinarily
fine line between the,

328
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:40,600
the tremendous beauty of this image
on the one hand and what it's,

329
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,550
it's potential impiety or just
grotesquery on, on the other.

330
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,590
And no sooner is Milton conjured this
already unbelievable image of a kind of

331
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:55,591
maternal creation than he reverses all
of the gender categories that he's just

332
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:57,424
established.

333
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,760
And he adds to this image
that is perfectly sufficiently
filled with grotesquery

334
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,720
as it is. He adds this next
phrase and mates to pregnant.

335
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,820
I ran, how do we even begin? How
do we even begin to appreciate the,

336
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:23,480
the, this, this amazing imagery
here in portraying the deity?

337
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,940
Yeah,

338
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,030
I would think if I were to
write an epic poem, I would,

339
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,060
I would feel that I would be expected
to stay within the fairly narrow

340
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:37,150
parameters of religious, of religious
decorum. There's, there's no,

341
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,270
Milton had no precedent for this.
Um,

342
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,150
there's no precedent for this depiction
of a god or a Holy Spirit as a kind of

343
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:46,210
hermaphroditic being.
Um,

344
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,270
and I think it's safe to say that
were intended to be, to be shocked.

345
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:54,670
Maybe even we're POLST bye bye.
This remarkable description of the deity.

346
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:58,090
And so I'm hoping you'll feel
something of the shock of, of,

347
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,500
of these lines and mates.

348
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,000
Pregnant Milton and his is taking
a huge aesthetic risk here.

349
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,800
And it's always when w
whatever you're reading,

350
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:10,801
it's always worth thinking about and
considering what the motives might be

351
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:11,170
first.

352
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,170
The first such extraordinary literary
risk taking that they made this image of

353
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:21,301
the curious process by which the
heavenly spirit creates the universe is,

354
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,630
is absolutely central. It's
central to this poem. Um,

355
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,630
and it's central to the
poem for two reasons.

356
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,400
It's central to Milton's
theological debate,

357
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,000
a theological vision that will soon
establish itself throughout the poem.

358
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,720
And it's also, I think,
central to his poetic vision,

359
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,930
his vision of what a poem is or should,
should be.

360
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,190
And so shocking image,

361
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,550
this impossible to imagine image of a
brooding impregnation establishes the

362
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:59,030
foundation for, for two of the two of
this poem's most, most daring elements.

363
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,600
The first is the radical
theology and, uh, and,

364
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:07,601
and the second is this poem's equally
radical and equally daring original verse

365
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:13,790
form. Let's let, let's take the first
thing first radical, the radical theology.

366
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,920
It's, it's with, and
I'll just look at a all,

367
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm only able to talk about a small
component of Milton's theological daring

368
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,051
here.
Um,

369
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:24,020
it's with this image of a brooding
impregnation that Milton announces the

370
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:28,790
presence in his poem of his most potent
when I think is the most interesting

371
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:33,020
theological, um, innovations,
the innovation that he
comes up with here. This is,

372
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,560
it seems to be the case that Milton
rather late in his life has become a

373
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,403
modernist.

374
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,720
He embraces the Hetero docs idea of Mon
ism or sometime sometimes called animus

375
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:48,530
materialism or vitalism,
which is essentially a denial

376
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,360
and denial of any distinction
between the body and the soul.

377
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,340
And so the principle of Moana Ism had,

378
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,200
had just introduced itself
in England around those,
around the mid 1640s, around.

379
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,030
It's been argued around the time that
Milton's writing area political and,

380
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,330
uh,
and it met with all sorts of opposition,

381
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,900
Orthodox scientists,
Orthodox Christians,

382
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:16,901
everyone agreed in the 17th century
that matter or substance a body was,

383
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,650
it was entirely separate from
and distinct from the immaterial,

384
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:23,880
the Incor pauriol stuff,
uh,

385
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,740
called spirit or soul and,

386
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,620
and so orthodoxy is definitively dualist.
There are two,

387
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,950
there are two types of stuff in
material stuff and matter or body,

388
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,880
but Milton insisted that there's no
such thing as an immaterial spirit,

389
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:42,590
that that was a contradiction in terms.

390
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,950
And so everything that
we call soul or spirit,

391
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,220
even God himself for John
Milton is bodily. Um, spirit,

392
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,550
spirit is mirror merely a kind of
bodily form of energy and, and, and,

393
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:59,570
and God at the beginning of time and fuse
this energy into the entirety of the,

394
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,760
into the entirety of the material world
at the creation. So physical life,

395
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,320
physical matter for Milton,

396
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,200
for the mature Milton has never
lifeless or dead. Uh, it's uh,

397
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,060
all matter contains within it
something like a potency of life.

398
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:19,880
That's Milton's phrase. It's,
and it has a capacity for action.

399
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,480
I actually a capacity
for motion and just as,

400
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:28,160
as books can take on a life of their own
and [inaudible] so all matter for the,

401
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,390
for, for later Milton, um,

402
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,850
even what we think in our vulgar
ways to be inanimate objects,

403
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,320
even they even,

404
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:40,670
they seem to have within them something
like a potency of a potency of life or

405
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:45,480
an infusion of divine spirit.
And of course the human
body is the perfect is the,

406
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:50,481
is the supreme example of the
spiritually infused corporeal substance.

407
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,760
Um, it's, it's infused with divine
spirit. Um, and, and, and this was,

408
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:58,770
this is a huge problem
in the 17th century,

409
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:03,390
Milton's contemporaries were endlessly
conjecturing where it is exactly in the

410
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:07,500
body that the soul resides. And some
of you may, may know that Descartes,

411
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,280
the great French philosopher,
Milton's slightly older contemporary,

412
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,740
had decided that the soul,

413
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,440
the soul resided in the pineal
gland of the, of the body.

414
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,850
The soul infused,

415
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,010
the sole managed to cover in the body
from this tiny little tiny little place in

416
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:30,390
the rears, the pineal gland. I think it's
in your brain, the back of your head.

417
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,700
Thank you. Um, keep that
and keep that in mind. The,

418
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,890
the soul for Milton though
isn't distinct from body.

419
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,920
It is the body,
the soul infused.

420
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,250
It's power throughout the entirety of
the bodily frame. And so bottle it,

421
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:51,660
body and soul in Milton's incredibly
moving and I think really beautiful vision

422
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:56,910
almost becomes indistinguishable. And
so all of this Mona's stick philosophy,

423
00:27:56,911 --> 00:28:01,360
I think is implicit in the image of,
of divinities impregnation of,

424
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,610
of the vast abyss. Milton's God
doesn't, as we learned from genesis,

425
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:09,480
doesn't fashion the matter
of chaos with his hands.

426
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,120
He impregnates it with spirit and
he gives it a potency of life as,

427
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,170
as you'll see in book seven,
the book of creation.

428
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,320
He gives it a liberty to organize itself
into the order of the created world,

429
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,820
a freedom to create itself.
And now that's,

430
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,760
that's one,
that's one consequence of,

431
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,720
of Milton's Milton's image
of a brooding impregnation.

432
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,590
There's a second type of potency that's
also established in with this image.

433
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:43,010
And that's the potency of the kind of
verse that Milton is writing and paradise

434
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:45,900
lost. And, and, and, and, and
it's been argued, and I think,

435
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:50,901
I think there's something to this that
Milton's Moen ism is closely connected to

436
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:55,420
his implicit theory of poetry.
There's there,

437
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,750
there's no question that,

438
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,710
that the shock experienced by the
first readers of paradise lost

439
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,140
had next to nothing to do
with the content of this poem,

440
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,940
which might strike us as,
as, as shocking in itself.

441
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,400
We would think that Milton's
contemporaries might be, um,

442
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,500
might be aghast that such a,

443
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:23,280
such as sympathetic portrait
of Satan could be used at
the beginning of the poem.

444
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,600
No, it, the most immediately shocking
aspect of the poem was it style.

445
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,270
And, and, and we have to look at
the actual poetic form by which, uh,

446
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,260
this poem is constructed because it's,
the poetic form is absolutely integral to,

447
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:40,810
it's to, it's to its meaning. So
if you, if you don't, right? Uh,

448
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,660
and if you're not taking
notes in this lecture, um,

449
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,640
you have to write down
at least one sentence.

450
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:49,930
You must write this down because this
will be the most important thing I say all

451
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,410
morning.

452
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,410
Milton's paradise lost is
the first narrative poem in
English that didn't rhyme.

453
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,640
Milton Milton road is epic
and lines of unrivaled,

454
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,550
I am big pentameter or what we call
and what Milton would have called blank

455
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:10,840
verse. And up to this point, up to
this point and literary history,

456
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:15,841
only verse written for the theater
had had been written in this unrivaled

457
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,660
unrivaled lines of I ambig
pentameter in blank verse.

458
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:20,840
This is the verse form you'll read,

459
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:24,010
you'll recognize it in so
many of the long speeches of,

460
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,490
of characters and the plays
of Marlo and Shakespeare.

461
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,200
But all those are plays though
in all English narrative poems,

462
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,680
including all of Shakespeare's
narrative poems. Um,

463
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,700
they had all been written in rhyme,
either a long verse,

464
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:41,830
paragraphs of rhymed,

465
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:45,820
heroic couplets or in
intricately rhymed stances.

466
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,420
And so for most readers
in Milton's Milton's time,

467
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:54,820
Ryan was actually constituent IV of
poetry and Milton's lines of unripe verse

468
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:58,960
here may well have not seen poetry at all.
It was shocking.

469
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,240
And so there seems to have been something
of a kind of outcry about the style of

470
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:09,190
paradise lost and it look
at page 210 in the Hughes.

471
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,960
It's in response to what seems to have
been an aesthetic reaction to the poem

472
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,970
that the printer of Paradise lost ask
Milton went back to Milton and said and

473
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:22,660
asked him to append a note, two
et seq the book, second printing,

474
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,810
append to note that explains why
the poem rhymes, not, you know,

475
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,800
there's people can't deal with this
problem until they get that they can get a

476
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:32,020
handle on why the fact it doesn't rhyme.
So that,

477
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:34,630
so Milton Milton writes this and adds it,

478
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,410
appends it to all subsequent
additions of the poem.

479
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,230
This is,
this is what Milton tells us.

480
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:46,231
The measure is English or
work verse without rhyme as
that of homer in Greek and

481
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:49,540
a Virgil in Latin Ryan being known,

482
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:54,541
necessary adjunct or true ornament
of poem or good verse in longer works

483
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:56,980
especially,
but the invention,

484
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,040
and this has this so familiarly miltonic,

485
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,340
it's the invention of a barbarous age to
set off wretched matter and lane meter

486
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,900
Greyston Dean since by the use of
some famous modern poets. Okay.

487
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,450
Spencer might've done it kind of well,
the whole rhyme thing, but nonetheless,

488
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,620
the modern poets are carried
away by custom much to
their own vexation hindrance

489
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,770
and constraint to express many things
otherwise and for the most part worse than

490
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:27,670
they would have expressed them.

491
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,230
Milton brings to his critique of
rhyme that same and this is familiar,

492
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:36,790
the same political rhetoric that he had
brought to his critique of monarchy in

493
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:37,240
the,

494
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,810
in the regicide treatises and can also
hear Satan's Satan's critique of the

495
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:46,610
tyranny of heaven in, in, in, in these,
uh, in this account of the rhyme as well.

496
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,860
Like kingship. Rhyme is a custom,
it's an invention of a barbarous age,

497
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,210
which a blind and ignorant population
will exempt only to its own vexation

498
00:32:56,211 --> 00:33:00,140
hindrance and constraint.
And it's always Milton's duty.

499
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,400
This is John Milton's.

500
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:05,360
The reason that he was put on this earth
is to liberate a people from any such

501
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:08,750
constraining customs.
It's the rhetoric of liberation,

502
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:11,660
that this is the rhetoric that permeates
all of Milton's political pros.

503
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,880
And so while Milton decided
against writing an explicitly
political nationalists

504
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:17,714
poem,

505
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,910
he didn't see himself as writing a poem
that performs some kind of political

506
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:26,630
function and it performed
it's revolutionary function
in a much more subtle,

507
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:29,360
though I'm much more
insinuating kind of way.

508
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,040
And so at the end of
this note on the verse,

509
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:35,090
Milton claims the Paradise lost
is to be esteemed and example,

510
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:37,730
set the first in English.

511
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,310
Another important first of ancient
liberty recovered to heroic poem from the

512
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:47,950
troublesome and modern bondage of rhyming.
It's a,

513
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,290
this is a, is is a wonderful
metaphor. Milton's thinking.

514
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,060
It's as if Milton is thinking of of the
poem as if it were a human body and the,

515
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,090
and the rhyme words at the end
of the typical heroic couplet.

516
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,620
Two lines that w that rhyme at the
end and then another two lines with a

517
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:07,580
different rhyme at the end of those two
lines. Um, he's, he's describing the,

518
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:12,581
these lined rhymes of the
poems by his contemporaries,

519
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,540
his competitors as the couplets,
the rhyme,

520
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,230
the rhyme words function as shackles.
I think that's the image here,

521
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:26,350
there manacles that confined the otherwise
vulnerable and tender flesh of the,

522
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:28,010
of the body of the poem.

523
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:32,510
Rhymes are barbarous forms of constraint
that impinge upon the true freedom of

524
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:33,410
the body of the poem.

525
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:37,280
And so that's why Milton explains
here in the middle of the note,

526
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:42,281
that's why other cultures have rejected
rhyme as a thing of itself to all

527
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:46,610
judicious ears,
trivial and have no true musical delight,

528
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,890
which consists only true musical
delight consists only an app number fit

529
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:56,480
quantity of syllables and the sense
variously drawn out from one person to

530
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:59,210
another,
not in the jingling sound of like endings.

531
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,890
So Milton refuses to force to force his
poem to make sense through the barbarous

532
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:07,790
mechanics of rhyme, which, which for
Milton reduces all of the spirit,

533
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:12,791
all of the life of a poem or of a line
simply to that jingling sound at the end

534
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,730
of the line.
And so when Milton's verse here,

535
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
sense or meaning is variously drawn
out from one verse into another,

536
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,580
since the very spirit of meaning is
infused throughout an entire line,

537
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:31,870
rather than being singled out
and separated or segregated, uh,

538
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,010
to the end of the line in
the form of the rhyme word.

539
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,940
So since in Milton's poetry functions
a lot like sole does or spirit does in

540
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:42,870
Milton's theology.
And,

541
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:47,871
and Milton's note on the verse clues us
into this intimate connection between

542
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,830
his radical poetics of blank verse on
the one hand and his radical theology of

543
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:56,980
Mona's among the other. Um,
you'll, you'll, you can, uh,

544
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,630
you can see from the handout
that I've, I've, I've given you,

545
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,870
I hope you can see from the handout that
I've given you a quotation here from

546
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:07,130
Milton's Christian doctrine. Yes. Um,

547
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,140
in which built and describes the process
whereby a God actually impregnates the

548
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,980
human body with soul. Nor did God
merely breathed that spirit into,

549
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,780
into man, but molded it in each
individual and infused it throughout.

550
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,090
The divine soul is everywhere in
the miltonic body, the human body.

551
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,800
And of course, that means that all
human acts are sanctioned by God,

552
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:36,280
including the, maybe most
importantly, the sexual act. Um, it,

553
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,310
it has given the highest form of divine
approval imaginable. And Milton wants to,

554
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,810
Milton wants us to think of the sense
of his verse as being similarly unfused.

555
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:49,460
The poem is similarly infused
throughout the entire,

556
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,730
with with some kind of soul or spirit
or divine energy throughout the entirety

557
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:54,900
of a verse.
Paragraph.

558
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,790
Milton refuses in paradise lost to
constrain a thought or to confine it to a

559
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:08,310
grammatical,
to a grammatical unit of sense.

560
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:13,311
He reframes a grammatical unit of sense
is never identical to align in Milton's

561
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:15,730
poem.
Um,

562
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,520
since doesn't simply end at
the end of a 10 syllable lines.

563
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,150
Now,

564
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,150
now most most rhymed poets
in poems in Milton's Day.

565
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,470
Uh, we're in stopped lines of verse and
an end stop line is one in which the

566
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:35,790
grammatical unit of sense stops
precisely at the end of the line.

567
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:36,951
So,
and the,

568
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:40,620
and the next line of verse picks up a
different thought and the next one after

569
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:41,940
that and, and, and so on.

570
00:37:41,941 --> 00:37:45,960
And you can actually see the mechanics
of this of end stop verse quite clearly

571
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,600
in the Ryan version of
paradise lost that the great,

572
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:51,090
admittedly the great
poet John Dryden wrote,

573
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,790
this was supposed to be
the Libretto for an opera.

574
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:57,750
And Brighton seems to have gotten
permission from the old blind poet Milton

575
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:00,870
himself because Dryden felt that the,

576
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,780
the public had an interest
in reading paradise lost,

577
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:08,370
but they couldn't deal with the fact that
it didn't rhyme. And, um, it's a mill.

578
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:11,910
And so Dryden's set out on this remarkable
project of making the whole thing

579
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:15,180
where I'm, and I invite you
to, I invite you to read.

580
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,250
Dryden's efforts are
really quite remarkable.

581
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:21,340
It's not unlike with the Turner
Broadcasting that work does with, uh,

582
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,770
with old movies colorizing them in order
to make them more palatable to a modern

583
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:28,920
audience.
And you'll notice that every line of this,

584
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,440
of the passage from Dryden
here concludes with a,

585
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,580
with a comma or a period because every
line constitutes own syntactical unit of

586
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:40,060
meaning.
But Milton Milton's poem,

587
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,530
this is a statistical fact that that's a,
I don't know who came up with it.

588
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,430
Milton's poem has far
fewer end to stopped lines.

589
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:53,320
Then the verse of any other poet,
Milton's lines we say are in jammed,

590
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,400
they,
they,

591
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,510
they run into one another and it's in
tactical unit for Milton is continually

592
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,610
spilling, spilling out. It's bursting,

593
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,840
bursting out of the line and infusing
itself into the next line and then into

594
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:08,890
the next and into the next. And I don't
know who came up with this statistic,

595
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:09,700
but I love it.

596
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,680
Nearly three out of every five lines
and paradise lost are in jammed.

597
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,700
The embrace, the practice of
in Jama, the meaning or the,

598
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,830
or the sense of inverse paragraph is,

599
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,430
is diffused throughout a series of lines.
And,

600
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,320
and I think that Milton
intends for us to think of,

601
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:31,350
of of the verse and Paradise Lost
as he wanted us to think of books in

602
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:36,370
areopagite Dukkha, the lines of Milton's
poetry or not absolutely dead things,

603
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,940
but they do contain within
them a potency of life.

604
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,621
So Milton,

605
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:45,270
imagine that his own verse was to be
read and experience something like a,

606
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,270
like a body. Of course, it's a
body that extraordinary that, that,

607
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,360
that enjoys an extraordinary
degree of freedom. And,

608
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:57,290
and is this a freedom that's infused
into the creation when the Holy Spirit

609
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,720
impregnates the
impregnates the vast abyss.

610
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:02,780
And this is also the freedom
enjoyed by the most remarkable,

611
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,770
surely hands down the most remarkable
of all of Milton's corporeal creatures.

612
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:11,410
And those are the angels. I imagine
it sounds strange to hear that, that,

613
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:16,460
that Milton is asking us in some way to
think of the lines of his poetry as if

614
00:40:16,461 --> 00:40:20,210
they were the bodies of
angels. Uh, but, but the,

615
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:25,250
but the notion of corporeal freedom
is so central to Milton that that it

616
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:29,900
actually makes sense in some ways that
Milton would want to attribute it to all

617
00:40:29,901 --> 00:40:33,470
of the most original in the most
daring elements of his poem. This is a,

618
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:35,420
this is our,
an argument that's developed,

619
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:39,620
been developed really quite brilliantly
by a great Milton critic William

620
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,360
Kerrigan. So a lot of book. One is,
is given over to the, as, as you know,

621
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:49,630
given over to those magnificent catalogs
of the names of the fallen angels as

622
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:54,380
Milton names, the demons, the
fallen angels and catalogs,

623
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:58,790
the names that they assumed when they
ascended to earth and took on the form of,

624
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,700
of, of, of Pagan Deities. Look,

625
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,570
look at line four 23 in book one.

626
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:10,610
Okay.

627
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,250
Oh, Erbitux. Even if you're reading
this for the second or the third time,

628
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,910
you were surprised again when you came,
you came to this point,

629
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,270
Milton Milton's been noting
that some of the pagan deities,

630
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:24,530
that the fallen angels eventually became,
were male and some were female.

631
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:29,150
And it's here that Milton for no
explicit or no apparent reason at all.

632
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,220
It's here that you provides a little
theoretical digression on the flexibility

633
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:38,910
of angelic bodies. Uh,
and in the context it's a,

634
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,730
it is a little gratuitous blind for 23
for spirits when they please can either

635
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:45,620
sex,
assume or both.

636
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,120
So soft and uncompounded
is their essence pure,

637
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,180
not tied or manacled with joint or limb,

638
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:57,050
nor founded on the brittle strength
of bones like come braze flesh,

639
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,670
but in what shape they choose.
The highlighted or condensed,

640
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,700
bright or obscure can execute their area
purposes and works of love or amnesty

641
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,970
fulfill. Clearly the angels
have bodies here. They're,

642
00:42:11,971 --> 00:42:14,840
they're made of matter just
as, uh, as human beings are,

643
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,070
but their bodies aren't compounded,
have separable elements.

644
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,270
They don't have joints and
limbs or Oregon's or flesh.

645
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,630
They're nothing but a strangely
embodied form of pure,

646
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,120
pure spirit,
corporeal spirit.

647
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:35,180
That's a spirit that's been infused
through or loosely circumscribed shape.

648
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:41,090
Now we learned later that the fact that
these spirits can either sex assume

649
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:42,160
actually comes,
uh,

650
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,530
comes in rather handy as the angels
are permitted to experience a form of,

651
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,590
of sexual union that far exceeds the
miserable coalition that creatures like us

652
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,100
are forced to perform.

653
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:58,760
The coalition founded on the brittle
strength of bones Milton rights.

654
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:04,030
Milton's angels in an act of Sexual
Union are fully s smushed Felice smushed

655
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:10,730
together. They're an individuated, if
that makes any sense. In the act of,

656
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,260
in the act of sexual union,

657
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:17,530
there's is the unutterable sexual rush
that can only come about through total

658
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:23,990
corporeal in jam mint. Now this, this,

659
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:25,580
this little discretion
that Milton's give us,

660
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,250
given us here on the amber
sexuality of his angels,

661
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,760
not unlike perhaps the Amba
sexuality of his God seems to have a,

662
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,350
seems to have little to do with the
discussion at hand of the heathen deities,

663
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,430
but I think it has everything to do with
Milton's understanding of his own verse,

664
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:45,590
which he has freed from the bondage of
rhyming just as angels are freed from the

665
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:47,180
manacles of joints and limbs.

666
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,130
And so Milton's not only writing in
a poetic style that he thinks his is

667
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:54,800
politically motivated and ideologically
motivated and he is doing that.

668
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:00,420
But the style of paradise lost is
also powerfully eroticized for Milton.

669
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,940
And in,
in this,

670
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
in it's amazing malleability of form
having dismissed the manacle of rhyme.

671
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,530
Um, the, the, the, the poem
is teaming with the same kind
of erotic energy. This is,

672
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:15,120
I think,
Milton's fantasy from the poem that,

673
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:20,030
that same energies that charge that
image of books in, in Area Politica.

674
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,680
Um, let's, so let's look at how
this, an example of this might,

675
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:29,070
might actually happen. Um, uh, uh,

676
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:33,090
a way in which the verse actually seems
to this sensation of bodily freedom.

677
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:37,350
Just look at the first line of the poem
of Man's first disobedience and the

678
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:40,330
fruit. And, and, and we think it,

679
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,570
we think at first because we have
been so used before we read this poem,

680
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:48,480
we were so used to reading
end stop lines of verse

681
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,070
like the along the lines of verse that
all of Milton's contemporaries where

682
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:57,570
we're, we're, um, we're
just gorging. We assume,

683
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:02,571
I think after the first line or that the
line should be pronounced like this of,

684
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:06,300
of man's first disobedience
and the fruit of,

685
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,790
and implicitly given the
fruit of that disobedience

686
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,483
as if,

687
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,440
as if the line was actually an of
man's first disobedience and its fruit,

688
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,390
the fruit of the disobedience.
And we,

689
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:22,830
and we read fruit naturally here as
if it meant result or consequence.

690
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,420
But we find out, but we don't find
this out until we get to the next line.

691
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,320
That the fruit at the end of the line is
only a kind of temporary resting place.

692
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:34,860
It's a provisional, uh,
it's a provisional ending.

693
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,620
It's not a Ryan Ware.

694
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:40,650
And so it doesn't constitute the end of
a unit of sense as a rhyming word would

695
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:45,350
in most heroic couplets that the sense
of the sentence pushes us onto this.

696
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:46,290
And the next line,

697
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:49,860
which alters our view of the meaning
of the word fruit of man's first

698
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:54,000
disobedience and the fruit
of that forbidden tree.

699
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,130
The word is in figurative,
it turns out to be literal real fruit.

700
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,650
And we realize now that we've
only partially understood, uh,

701
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,510
that the sense of the word fruit,
it, uh, and the combination of,

702
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,350
of our readerly experience of the
two of these two lines. First,

703
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:15,060
the figurative reading that comes from
our habits of reading end stop versus,

704
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,620
and now the literal meaning of fruit
that comes from this newly acquired habit

705
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:21,840
of reading and Jam blinds.
Um,

706
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,870
it's the experience of both of these
cognitive sensations that that provides us

707
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:31,320
with the true signifying experience of,
of,

708
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,840
of what Milton can do
with a word like fruit,

709
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:35,730
which is obviously going to
be a loaded one in the poem.

710
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,090
Look at another instance of the
malleability of this, of this verse. Oh,

711
00:46:40,091 --> 00:46:41,900
a few lines down.
Uh,

712
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:46,050
the heavenly spirit that ditzed inspire
that shepherd who first taught the

713
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:49,410
chosen seed in the beginning, how the
heavens and earth rose out of chaos.

714
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,480
Now at first,

715
00:46:51,481 --> 00:46:55,920
I think Milton seems to mean that the
shepherd Moses inspired by the Muse first

716
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:57,090
taught the Israel Lights,

717
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,030
how the heavens and earth rose
out of chaos in the beginning.

718
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,110
And it was Moses who came up with this
phrase, Milton thought in the beginning.

719
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,850
That's the first, the first, first
words of the book of Genesis.

720
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:12,390
But Milton has clearly placed
this little phrase, this, uh,

721
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:17,520
this adverbial phrase in the beginning
in an awkward place. He frees himself.

722
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,540
And, and, and this is a, this
is an insight that William
Kerrigan has also had. Um,

723
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:24,450
he frees himself from the
strictures of conventional syntax.

724
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:28,230
Any places that phrase in the beginning,
at the beginning of the line,

725
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,100
very strangely, very awkwardly
before the how in the beginning,

726
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:34,390
how the heavens and earth,

727
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,910
and he's done this because he wants to
permit this phrase to do more than simply

728
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:44,560
modify the verb rose. We can also
see in this phrase in the beginning,

729
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,700
we can see it applying to the
end of the proceeding clause.

730
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:51,730
That shepherd who first taught
the chosen seed in the beginning

731
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,500
in the beginning can modify the
verb taught as easily as it can. Uh,

732
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,070
the verb rows,
it can either verb,

733
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:04,750
assume just as Milton's
angels can either sex as soon.

734
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:07,060
And there's an important point I think
that's being made with this second,

735
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:11,920
this second possibility.
Melton needs to imagine the narrative of,

736
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:16,921
of creation as if the narration itself
were taking place in the beginning as if

737
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:22,150
poetic creation could be a first in the
same radical way that the creation of

738
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:25,580
the entire universe is
obviously a first. And, and,

739
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,800
and this is a strategy called
a, uh, uh, double syntax.

740
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:34,150
The notion that in the beginning can
modify one verb or, or the other.

741
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,231
And it's,

742
00:48:35,231 --> 00:48:39,370
and it's just this kind of rhetorical
trick that Milton uses so many rhetorical

743
00:48:39,371 --> 00:48:39,971
tricks like this,

744
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:43,540
that Milton we'll use throughout the
poem that led Dr. Johnson to say an utter

745
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,980
exasperations, but admiration
that Milton wrote no language.

746
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:51,730
This is an English that Milton
is writing here. Um, they,

747
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,980
Milton's language doesn't have the
same kind of headlong rush that most

748
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:58,900
declarative English sentences have.

749
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,610
We're continually being prevented from
reading the text to get to the end were

750
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:07,270
prevented from rushing to the end of the
sentence or two, the end of the poem,

751
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,910
because at least as far as the,
well, you can think, you can,

752
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,140
you can understand why as far as the
plot goes, we know how it's going to end.

753
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,680
We know of course that Adam and eve
are going to eat the stupid fruit,

754
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,880
but Milton is developing a style and
he's working really hard to do this.

755
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:26,320
That works to resist our drive to get to
the end of this story and it's through

756
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:29,800
a mechanism of an entirely new verse,
a new kind of verse,

757
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,880
lonesome weaves into the
metrical fabric of the poem,

758
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:37,570
a New Perspective on that
old theological problem of,

759
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:41,320
of human freewill and
divine foreknowledge. Um,

760
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,400
can it be said that we actually
chose to sin or to eat the apple?

761
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:49,780
If God had known all along how the
story would end or that we would do this

762
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:50,890
thing in the first place?

763
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,490
That's the conundrum that on some
level we've all confronted and, and,

764
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,790
and has been confronted since,
since time began.

765
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,750
But Milton knows that if this
poem is going to be successful,

766
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:06,751
we cannot as readers be permitted to
think this story had to be what it was.

767
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:12,490
We can't be permitted to think that the
story had to turn out the way it did.

768
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,700
Uh, we need to think that
the actions in this story,

769
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:19,450
we're in some way free and
absolutely perfectly undetermined.

770
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,770
We need to get at the story of the fall
from the perspective of its beginning

771
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,770
rather than from the perspective
of its of its ending.

772
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:30,890
And so Milton and fuses this angelic,
this angelic freedom,

773
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:35,891
and he infuses this bodily liberty into
the actual body of the verse itself.

774
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,840
Of course, to make a point.
He's incorporating his style,

775
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:47,450
a radical, original style into the,
into the essential argument of the,

776
00:50:47,451 --> 00:50:48,111
of the poem.

777
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:52,640
And he permits his own
unconstrained indulgence in,

778
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:58,070
in poetic, in Jama. He permits in
Jama to become the verbal medium.

779
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:58,830
This is the,

780
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:03,830
the pulsating vehicle for his
precious theology of freewill and,

781
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:08,450
and for his politics of
liberty. Okay. That's the end.

782
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,070
I want to remind you a final
time to look at your Spencer, uh,

783
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,540
the Cave of mammon episode as well as
Doctor Johnson's brief comments on sin and

784
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:17,870
death.
