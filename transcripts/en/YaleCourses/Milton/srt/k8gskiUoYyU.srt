1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,560
Samuel Johnson in his, uh, in
the life of Milton and that,

2
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:07,640
that's the life of Milton
included in the packet. Um,

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,410
but I've also included
this on the handout.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,700
A Dr. Johnson wrote that paradise lost
is one of those books which the reader

5
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:20,190
admirers and lays down and
forgets to take up again.

6
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,730
And we're, we're, we're used to
this, we've read enough Johnson to,

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,760
to recognize a
characteristic curmudgeonly,

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,810
curmudgeonly nest when it
comes to the subject of Milton.

9
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:35,310
But I think there's something to this
idea that we forget to take paradise lost

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,150
up again after we've laid it down.
Because to say that paradise lost is,

11
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,970
is not exactly a page Turner is simply
to say that we're already familiar with

12
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,510
the plot. We know of
course, how the story ends.

13
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,790
And there's nothing for
us in terms of the plot,

14
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:55,791
at least to anticipate with all that much
eagerness and our for knowledge of the

15
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,020
stories and works continually,

16
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:03,021
I think to reinforce our sense
of God's fore knowledge of,

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,620
of the end of the story. And of
course for knowledge of any kind, uh,

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,740
makes the end seem inevitable.
And,

19
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:14,760
and I think the inevitability of an
ending puts me Milton, uh, this idea,

20
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,290
it puts Milton and a terrible bind.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,670
Any sense of the inevitability
of the fall really makes it,

22
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:21,600
it just makes hash,

23
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:26,070
it makes nonsense of the notion of any
strong sense of any strong feeling of

24
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:29,490
Adams and Eve's freewill.
And if,

25
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,110
and if we're disappointed with
the ending of paradise lost.

26
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:36,960
And I think it's safe to say that
Milton to is deeply troubled by the

27
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,970
implications of an end.
And so it's for,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
it's for all of these reasons that we
can say that paradise lost is obsessed

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,780
with the problem of its own,
the problem of its own ending.

30
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,010
Now we remember that Milton had devoted
enormous sums of energy as a young man

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,440
and anticipating his,
his own,

32
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:02,250
and he was contingent continually looking
ahead to the, to the writing of a,

33
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:06,690
of a poem that after times
would not willingly let die.
You'll remember that, uh,

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,560
that sentence from the reason of
church government in the, in the 1640s,

35
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,480
he looked ahead to a con,

36
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,750
a political future in which the reformed
government would usher in the reign of

37
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:17,760
Christ at the end of time.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,850
And his early poems are filled
with brief lyric narratives of,

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,840
of anticipation.
I'll,

40
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,600
I'll just enumerate a few of
those or will remind you of them.

41
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,990
The Ne they naitivity owed
had anticipated a few times.

42
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,560
The apocalypse comas had anticipated,

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,350
well had anticipated that
the apocalypse as well,

44
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:41,380
but it also anticipated the
eventual marriage of the lady, uh,

45
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,810
enlisted us anticipated among so many
other things. The undying fame of the,

46
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,010
of the poet and Adam too,
in and books 11 and 12,

47
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,090
Adam seems continually to be
anticipating an ending, like,

48
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,440
like the Speaker of the Nativity yoed
Adam's always looking ahead to the

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,500
Christian millennium or the,
or the apocalypse and he's
jumping ahead of himself.

50
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:07,420
And Michael has always chiding him for
this, for this enthusiasm. And Michael,

51
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
it's as if Michael's job is to put the
brakes on Adams anticipatory excitement.

52
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,063
Okay.

53
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,560
Given that role that Michael plays,

54
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,400
I think it's all the more
remarkable that it's Michael.

55
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,270
This is our kill joy
archangel who's just as bad,

56
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,390
who's often just as bad as Adam in his
own eagerness to jump ahead of himself as

57
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:35,671
he tells the story of Michael himself
is the angel of apocalypse from the book

58
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:40,810
of revelation, as we learned from, from
David's lecture on Friday. Um, that's the,

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,820
the book of revelation is the book from
which Milton has taken has lifted this

60
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:50,740
character Michael and perhaps
of his role in, in revelation,

61
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:55,741
the Michael of Paradise lost
seems incapable of keeping
himself from the onrush

62
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:58,780
of expectation as he narrates,

63
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,640
as he narrates and what I'm supposed
should be chronological order.

64
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,310
But isn't that the
story of future history?

65
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,810
So Michael will narrate the
story of the apocalypse.

66
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,970
Four, count them four times over
the course of the last books,

67
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:19,450
once in a once in [inaudible]
11 and three times in book 12.

68
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,310
And in all of this eagerness to, to, to
imagine the final fulfillment of, of,

69
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:25,090
of history,

70
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,350
Michael seems almost in some way to
be parodying Milton Zone tendency,

71
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:32,990
his specialty, his own youthful
tendency to offer those, uh,

72
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,620
prophetic narratives of anticipation.

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,380
Okay.

74
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,590
Now, Mike is, Michael's focused
in the last two books is on God's,

75
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,450
okay.

76
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,450
He's essentially on God's providential
control over the actions of the

77
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,880
descendants of Adam and eve.
And so it's not,

78
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,830
it's not too difficult to see why these,
why these books just structurally, um,

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,500
are, are, are, are so troubling. Uh,

80
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,530
Milton is in the incredibly awkward
position of trying to reconcile divine

81
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:06,570
providence with the,
with the notion of freewill.

82
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:08,280
This has been his challenge all along.

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,870
And this is also the subject of a lot
of Milton's musings in the theological

84
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:16,260
treatise that he wrote at the same
time that he wrote paradise lost the,

85
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,710
the Christian doctrine. And, uh,

86
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,220
so I'm going to have you
turn in your Hughes, uh,

87
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,160
to page nine 84 in the,
in the Christian doctrine.

88
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,330
Um,
Milton devotes an entire chapter to the,

89
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,010
to the problem of the
seeming incompatibilities of
divine providence and human

90
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:35,610
freewill.

91
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,690
And he finds himself continually knocking
up against the representation of the

92
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:43,710
providential God that he finds in the,
that he finds in the Bible.

93
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,340
So this is a Christian doctrine.

94
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,670
This is page nine 84 this is where
Milton tries to carve out a space for

95
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:55,470
freewill and the face of so much
contrary evidence in scripture.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,000
This is on the,
the top of the right hand column,

97
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,900
I believe this is, yes,
this is also on the handout.

98
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,460
Okay. Milton speaking on a
speaking about divine providence,

99
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,310
which is obviously on some level,
it's a sensitive subject,

100
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,480
maybe a sore subject for such a
strong believer in human freewill.

101
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,380
And he's quoting here the scriptural
accounts of the voluntary,

102
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,690
what he calls the voluntary
actions of the deity.

103
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,860
Those moments in which God is acting
out of his own inscrutable will.

104
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,290
So here we have Melton.

105
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,790
I'm acting writing very
systematically voluntary actions.

106
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,690
Second chronicles 10 15,
this is an example.

107
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,470
So the king hearkened not unto the
people for the cause was of God.

108
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,910
And then again from proverbs,
a man's heart divides us this way,

109
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,920
but Jehovah Directeth,

110
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:50,921
his steps and man's goings are of Jehovah
and the King's heart is at the hand of

111
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:56,330
Jehovah as the river rivers of water.
He turneth it,

112
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,290
whither soever he will. And
this from Jeremiah, Oh Jehovah,

113
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:03,320
I know that the way of
man is not in himself.

114
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,870
Now why,
why would Milton do this?

115
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,650
Why would he cite these that
beside these scriptures for, from,

116
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,180
from Milton's point of view and actually
from the point of view of a lot of, uh,

117
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,820
a lot of 17th century Christians,
they would have,

118
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,510
these would have to be bone chilling
statements of the absolute divine control

119
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,450
over our lives.
The verses from scripture,

120
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:31,430
the millstones quoting here at seem
to admit of nothing like freewill.

121
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,600
And they conjure an image of God who
controls us as a puppeteer would control

122
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,220
his, his puppets. And this surely
this has to make Milton nervous.

123
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,520
And so after quoting instances of
divine action, that seemed clearly,

124
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:48,521
I think to counter the idea of
the power of human freewill.

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,270
Milton ads this, and it's
utterly sublime in this.

126
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:56,360
However, there is no infringement
on the liberty of the human will,

127
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,520
otherwise man would be deprived
of the power of free agency.

128
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,910
Otherwise, um, it's, uh,
it's, it's slightly, uh,

129
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,420
loose, uh, logic, but it's a,

130
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:13,700
it's extraordinarily heartfelt.

131
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,470
Milton is telling us once again that it
has to mean what I know it should mean.

132
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,670
It wouldn't make sense otherwise. Um, so,

133
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,980
so we face his head on
the most recalcitrant,

134
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,420
recalcitrant passages of the Bible and
he simply forces them to mean what he

135
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:30,141
needs them to mean.

136
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,980
And this is precisely the challenge that
Milton has confronted with in books 11

137
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:34,461
and 12.

138
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:39,461
The Bible had already written the story
of man after the fall and for most of 11

139
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,810
and 12, Milton has really forced
to amplify. He has, he's, he's,

140
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:49,490
he's pretty constrained here to amplify
and elaborate on the chapters in

141
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:50,001
genesis.

142
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:53,720
This is chapters four through 11 in
the book of Genesis that released speed

143
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:57,630
through generations of, in the,
in the course of a few pages.

144
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,130
Okay.

145
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,680
Now, the most important
biblical texts that, uh,

146
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,630
to my mind that Milton has to confront
is the genesis account of the expulsion.

147
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,170
This is the moment at which Adam and
Eve are actually forced to lose their

148
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:15,000
paradise. And this is of course,
the moment that's heralded the,

149
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:18,360
the loss that's heralded
in the poems title.

150
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,000
And so I think we have
to assume that this, uh,

151
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,840
this moment has a privileged
position in Milton's poem.

152
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,480
So this is the text as it appears in,
in Genesis.

153
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,160
And I've also included
this on the handout.

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,860
Okay?

155
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,850
This is all we learn about the expulsion
from genesis and the Lord. God said,

156
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:35,684
behold,

157
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,460
the man is become as one of
us to know good and evil,

158
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,300
and now lest he put forth his hand and
take also of the tree of life and eat and

159
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:48,770
live forever,

160
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,280
okay?

161
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,761
Therefore,

162
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:55,230
the Lord God sent him forth from the
garden of Eden to till the ground from

163
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,250
whence he was taken.

164
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,190
Okay?

165
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:01,100
So he drove out the man
by,

166
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:05,290
by any standard, I think that we could
comfortably identify as miltonic.

167
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,130
This text portrays a god. That's
the, that that's unjustifiable.

168
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,523
Okay.

169
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,130
Okay.

170
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,110
We've seen this argument before
though. Um, you'll remember Satan,

171
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,900
Satan had accused God of jealousy,
uh, when, when Satan was tempting eve.

172
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,140
And if Satan was telling you,

173
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,760
God doesn't want you to eat the fruit
because he doesn't want you to become a

174
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:28,720
God like him, uh, uh, being
with the superior knowledge of,

175
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,350
of good and evil and [inaudible].

176
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,110
And we of course rallied
to dismiss Satan's claim as
yet another example of, of,

177
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,100
of his tendency to lie and to deceive.

178
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,530
But Satan is a,
I mean,

179
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:44,470
it seems that Milton Satan has
only gotten this idea from the,

180
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,770
from the words of God and
the book of Genesis itself.

181
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:50,620
What kind of God as genesis portray here,

182
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,920
if not that of a vulnerable and in some
way desperate deity who doesn't fact

183
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,380
punish man out of out of a degree of,
uh,

184
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,590
of jealousy and maybe
even maybe even vengeance.

185
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,260
God here has to force Adam and eve
out of the garden to keep them from

186
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,120
encroaching on any more of his honor,

187
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,630
any more of his privileges or of his
territory to keep them from achieving the

188
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,260
state of the mortality to the
only God himself. And joys.

189
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,890
Now, as you can imagine, um,

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,520
this biblical passage has been
troubling to generations of, uh,

191
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,150
of readers of the Bible and specially,
but bill biblical scholars and,

192
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,370
and the 16th century Theologian Calvin
was when confronted with his passage was

193
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:39,300
really forced to conclude that
God was speaking. Ironically,

194
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:42,900
here he doesn't actually mean
w w what are you saying? Oh,

195
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,810
you have to say something when you're,
uh,

196
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,090
when you're dealing with a
passage like this. Um, but,

197
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,000
but Milton's incredibly scrupulous here,

198
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,970
any fields he feels compelled
to reproduce this very dark,

199
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,810
very dark genesis text in his
own story of the expulsion. Uh,

200
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,860
look at book 11 of Paradise Lost
Line 93 in the Hughes edition.

201
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:09,850
It's page four 35,
and this is God speaking

202
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:16,590
less therefore his now boulder hand reach
also for the tree of life and to eat

203
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,160
and live forever dream
at least to live forever.

204
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,420
To remove him.
I decree and send him from the Gordon,

205
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,700
send him from the garden fourth to
till the ground whence he was taken.

206
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,630
And this has mean fitters,
soil.

207
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,840
And Milton depicts a god in this passage.

208
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,300
Who has all of those and
maybe even then some, oh,

209
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,600
those anthropomorphic qualities of the,

210
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:48,601
of the y'all way of so much of genesis
and God to hear is distinctly human in

211
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,060
personality. And, and he's,

212
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,220
he's able without hesitation to
intervene in the lives of, in,

213
00:12:56,221 --> 00:13:00,130
in the affairs of man, in order to,
to effect his desire for punishment.

214
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,070
And,
and,

215
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,400
and I take this to be precisely that
type of God that Milton is trying to

216
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:11,370
counteract or to do a way with throughout
so much of the Christian doctrine of

217
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:13,000
God who is all encompassing.

218
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,230
We'll just steam rolls
right over the freewill,

219
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:21,730
the free agency of human individuals.
And,

220
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,720
but nonetheless, we have this
passage in the poem and you can, uh,

221
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,330
it's not hard to see that the
moment of expulsion is a crisis,

222
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,730
a crisis moment in paradise lost.

223
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,410
It's not only that point at
which paradise gets lost,

224
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:40,411
it's also that moment I think in
which Milton is most hard pressed to,

225
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:45,130
to depict who's a god, whose
actions are justifiable, whose,

226
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:49,420
whose behavior can be reconciled with
all of the claims of reason that Milton

227
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,230
wants to hold him too.
And,

228
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,390
and it's because of the moment of the
actual expulsion is such a crisis that

229
00:13:55,391 --> 00:14:00,391
Milton provides us with an
alternative understanding of it.

230
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,980
Uh, and this, this,

231
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I believe this is the conversation between
the father and the son at line 45 of

232
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:13,270
book 11 page four 34 of the Hughes.

233
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,730
The Sun is just pleaded with the father
to show some mercy on the repentant Adam

234
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:23,170
and eve and the father. It's,
it's, it's, it's wonderful.

235
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:26,230
The father argues that he would like,
he'd love to be merciful,

236
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,250
but there are some things that are
simply out of his control. Adam and eve,

237
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,400
we'll have to leave the garden.
And the,

238
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:38,020
and the justification that God gives
for their departure, I think is, is, is,

239
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,240
is truly extraordinary.

240
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,510
So this is line 48 of book 11 but
longer in that paradise to dwell.

241
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,230
The law I gave to nature him forbids
those pure immortal elements that no,

242
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:57,560
no gross, no unharmonious mixture, foul,

243
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:02,590
eject him tainted now and purge him
off as a distemper gross to as gross.

244
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,270
Okay.

245
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,661
And,
and,

246
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:13,661
and we suddenly have a rationale for
the explosion that's really completely

247
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:16,620
opposed to the account of
the explosion that had, that,

248
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:21,621
that begins at line 93 and completely
opposed of course to to it's original and

249
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,570
the book of Genesis,
where did Milton get this?

250
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,470
He's made this up and suddenly,
um,

251
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,820
Milton has a god behaving really
very differently. Uh, God is saying,

252
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,360
well, I'd love, I'd love for
them to stay in paradise,

253
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:37,680
but you see there's nothing I can do.

254
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,160
I establish this natural law in Eden
whereby the pure immortal elements of

255
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:49,461
paradise necessarily inexorably expel
and purge anything a that's foul or

256
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:52,170
tainted.
And because of course,

257
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:56,340
the fall bodies of Adam and eve are
actually Fallon tainted the atmospheric

258
00:15:56,341 --> 00:16:01,341
mechanisms already in place in paradise
are in the process as we speak of

259
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:06,000
purging them from the garden. Uh, these,

260
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,630
uh, they'll, the lines
are, they're beautiful and
they're, and they're shocking.

261
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,760
Milton puts in God's mouth an
explanation for the exposure of an, uh,

262
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,180
of Adam and eve that really runs,

263
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,790
deliberately runs counter
to the explanation in the
book of Genesis and I think

264
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:28,791
completely contradicts the one that God
himself had given so publicly to the

265
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,550
assembly of angels about
50 or so lines later.

266
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,590
And it's an explanation that
that completely counters
the image of the jealous

267
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:41,850
and vengeful God that,
that Milton inherited from scripture.

268
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,230
Milton is really resting
this poem away, um, from,

269
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:49,920
from its source and skip scripture and
he's pushing it toward an entirely new

270
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:50,401
genre.

271
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:54,180
This is something much closer to what
we would think of as science fiction.

272
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,710
I think then,

273
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,950
then any kind of anthropomorphic
biblical narrative and,

274
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,890
and Milton is taking a tremendous,
uh,

275
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,710
taking a tremendous risk and to embark
on such a fanciful flight of mythmaking

276
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,090
at such an incredibly important moment,
um, has to be seen as consequential.

277
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,471
And,
and,

278
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:18,360
and I think that Milton is taking this
risk for the purposes of his theodicy.

279
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,780
His need to justify the ways of God to
men here at last is an image of the God

280
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,410
of God who expels Adam and eve from
the garden for an entirely justifiable,

281
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,060
a rational reason here at last is an
image of a god who's not at all the evil

282
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,100
puppeteer who deliberately forces the
movements of his, of his human creatures.

283
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,960
It's a,
it's an entirely benign,

284
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:47,961
it's almost an impersonal God who
willingly subject himself to the law,

285
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,010
to the law of nature,

286
00:17:50,011 --> 00:17:54,240
to the natural moral processes of nature
that are inevitably at work in the

287
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,074
garden.

288
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,280
This of course isn't the first time
that we've encountered, uh, this, this,

289
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:07,290
the, the force of contradiction. I'm
in paradise lost throughout the poem.

290
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:12,291
Milton has been opposing a competing
notions of God opposing accounts of,

291
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,490
of crucial events. Um, you'll remember
a Rafi feels account of creation in,

292
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:20,820
in book seven in which Milton had
opposed the literal, the, the,

293
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:25,350
the anthropomorphic story of genesis
with his own really wildly original.

294
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,600
I'm incredibly beautiful. A story of
something like a natural self creation.

295
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,430
And, and, and,

296
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,430
and there are two accounts as I mentioned
in the last class to accounts of,

297
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,250
of Noah's flood, in, in Michael Zone,
in Michael Zone, a history lesson.

298
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:41,670
Events,

299
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,670
events are continually being related
twice and sometimes even three times in

300
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:52,200
paradise lost. And, and the purpose
of these narrative repetitions,

301
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,490
um, I think has nothing to do with
the Milton's desire to make this poem

302
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:58,690
impenetrable, are just confusing. Uh,

303
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,540
Milton is juxtaposing on
something like a systematic level,

304
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,230
I think juxtaposing the
poems, official, uh,

305
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,430
theological reading of
events with an alternative,

306
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,500
what we can think of as a naturalistic
or maybe a more rational reading of

307
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:20,190
events. And He's struggling
to represent a more palatable,

308
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,650
more rational alternative to the
arbitrary anthropomorphic deity who was so

309
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:31,960
capable of jealousy. And these
all too human motives, um,

310
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,900
that he finds in the book of Genesis.
So up to this point in Milton's poem,

311
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:41,670
we really haven't known what
to do with, uh, with all,

312
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:45,600
with a lot of these conflicts
and contradictions that
the poem was presenting us

313
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,490
with. Um, conflicting accounts of,

314
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:51,570
of key moments in Christian history
just seemed to be held and held in

315
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,850
suspension in the,
in the text.

316
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,870
And it's often difficult to
discern what we're supposed to,

317
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,430
how we're supposed to interpret
the relation between, um, uh,

318
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,580
opposing views or among opposing views.

319
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,300
And I think this is a problem that
we've been confronting all along is,

320
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,440
is one version,
right?

321
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:11,010
And the other version and wrong is one
version of satanic perspective on these

322
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:14,220
events and the other is a divine view.
What's the point of,

323
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:17,850
of all of these oppositions and conflicts?
Well,

324
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,510
if those are the questions that we're
asking and safe to say that Milton in his

325
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,800
magnificent genius has already
anticipated those, those questions.

326
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,950
And I think here in the
last books of the poem,

327
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:33,951
Milton is struggling and to some to some
effect to make some kind of sense of

328
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:36,894
this problem.

329
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,350
Michael presents a theory of reading that
on some level can account for some of

330
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:47,710
the confusions of, of
paradise lost. And it's the,

331
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:51,430
it's the theory of scriptural
interpretation known as topology.

332
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,681
Um, and, and,

333
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:57,640
and it had been around for centuries
and according to the type of logical

334
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,170
interpretation of Christian history,
characters and events in the Hebrew Bible,

335
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:06,860
which Christians called the Old Testament,
are seen as types of,

336
00:21:06,861 --> 00:21:09,640
of characters and events
in the New Testament.

337
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,600
And this Mozart motive reading became a
way for Christian readers of the Bible

338
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:18,220
to reinterpret everything in the Hebrew
scriptures as to appropriate the Hebrew

339
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:22,420
scriptures, um, as an anticipation of the
Christian truth that would be revealed.

340
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,120
They believed, um,
later in the gospel. Um,

341
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,050
and this was a central way in which
Christians could assert some kind of

342
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:37,051
superiority over over Judaism in light
of the fact that Judaism had this awkward

343
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,500
but nonetheless, incredibly
significant temporal priority, um,

344
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,380
over Christian Christianity. Um,
so typology becomes a big deal.

345
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,650
And look at, uh, look at Milton's, uh,

346
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,680
dealing with the typological perspective
in Paradise Lost Book 12 Line three 10.

347
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,510
This is page four,
61 in the Hughes.

348
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,900
Milton looks at the Old Testament figure
of Joshua and he's not making this up.

349
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:09,370
This is, there's a long tradition of
thinking of Joshua as a type of Jesus.

350
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,020
And Joshua represents a in this reading
and the early version of the Jesus that,

351
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,180
that Christians come to call Christ.

352
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,740
And the full significance is of Joshua's
life can't have been revealed in his

353
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:27,010
own lifetime or actually during,
during, during anyone's lifetime.

354
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,060
In the Old Testament,

355
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,320
the full significance of the old testament
type isn't known until the emergence

356
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,520
of the New Testament anti type, uh, the,

357
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,350
the anti type being the Christian
fulfillment of the HEBRAIC type.

358
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,180
And in this case,
the anti type is the birth of Jesus and,

359
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,690
and Chris Christian exit gates.

360
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,760
We're constantly mapping out elaborate
systems of types and anti types as they,

361
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,430
as they read the Bible.
And there's a,

362
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,150
there's a very interesting book
on Milton's use of Topology, uh,

363
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,710
by William Madsen,

364
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,310
mad SCN called from
shadowy types to truth.

365
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,220
Look a look a little further
up on page four 61, uh,

366
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,460
this is Michael's actual
theory of typology,

367
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,780
a line 300 book 12.
So true meaning in the,

368
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:18,400
in the typological view of history,

369
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:22,780
true meaning emerges over time by
means of an historical process.

370
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,390
And this is how Michael articulates it.

371
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,900
So law appears in perfect man.
A bylaw.

372
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,650
Michael means a mosaic law.

373
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,400
The law dispensed on Mount
Sinai in the Old Testament.

374
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:41,401
So law appears imperfect and but given
with purpose to resign them in full time,

375
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,330
up to a better covenant,
disciplined from shadowy types to truth,

376
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,160
from flesh to spirit,

377
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,700
from imposition of strict laws to free
acceptance of large grace from survival,

378
00:23:55,461 --> 00:24:00,440
fear to filial works of
law to works of faith.

379
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,800
Christian history obeys a process whereby
the shadowy types of the old testament

380
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:11,801
or eventually revealed and all of their
truth in the New Testament Old Testament

381
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:17,141
law gives way to new testament faith and
the laws of the laws of the flesh start

382
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:20,750
to yield to something like a
faith in the spirit. That's the,

383
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,440
that's the message here. And
Michael presents us, um, with the,

384
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,190
the official theological understanding
of the significance of Christian history

385
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,940
and this is really the official doctrine
of the revelation of all of the types

386
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,870
and anti types that Michael has given
us in this whirlwind history, um,

387
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,470
of life after the fall.

388
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,740
Michael is also doing
a lot more than that.

389
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,100
Michael's theory of Reading Biblical
history is also I think is also something

390
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:52,490
like a theory of reading this very poem.

391
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,420
He's giving us an interpretive key.

392
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,880
I submit to some of the most,

393
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:02,420
to some of the most difficult aspects
of paradise lost the history of

394
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:06,850
civilization that Michael offers
us is filled with moments of,

395
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,910
of, of seeming repetition. Joshua
appears in the Old Testament,

396
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:15,020
but he seems to point ahead to
the new Joshua Jesus. In the,

397
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:20,021
in the New Testament and these and these
type of logical repetitions are closely

398
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,240
related I think to the
narrative repetitions that we,

399
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,890
that we have in Milton's poem,

400
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,450
narrative repetitions like the competing
accounts of the creation or the

401
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:32,490
competing accounts of
the explosion. Um, the,

402
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,320
these are things that we've looked at
and the theory of the type of topology

403
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:40,640
works to make sense on some level of
some of the differences in some of the

404
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:44,720
conflicts among these repeated
narratives in Milton story.

405
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,350
Now we may have been confused,

406
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:53,360
we may have been confused about what to
do with the poems competing accounts,

407
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,780
um, uh, various moments
of, of Christian history.

408
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:59,660
And this is why this is where
the theory of typology comes in.

409
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,310
The old fashioned anthropomorphic
image of the, of the deity,

410
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,130
the images that Milton inherits
in large part from the,

411
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,450
from the text as genesis begin
to look like shadowy types,

412
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,160
the shadow, we types of the old
testament and the more modern,

413
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,330
what we could think of is something
like the quasi scientific rational

414
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:24,140
explanation in the poem of certain events
begins to emerge as something like a

415
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:28,730
type of, as a new kind of truth
that the shadow we types of,

416
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,470
of Milton scriptural literalism.

417
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:34,130
And there no question that that's an
important component of this poem. Um,

418
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,020
yield maybe they yield,
uh,

419
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,950
to the truths of the more scientific,

420
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:43,370
the more naturalistic side
of Milton's imagination.

421
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,350
It's not exactly the case that one
version is wrong and the other version is

422
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:47,184
right.

423
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:52,140
We could think of one version as being
an early literalist understanding of an

424
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:56,280
event and the other as a, as
a later, more, more rational,

425
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,600
more sophisticated
understanding of an event, uh,

426
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,080
an entirely natural as opposed to a
supernatural account of the forces at work

427
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,360
in the world.
And you can,

428
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,570
I think you can see Milton inviting just
this type of typological reading of his

429
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:20,040
own poem. Um, at the conclusion
of paradise lost. Look,

430
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:26,030
let's look at the poems final assembly
and just take a moment to be grateful

431
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,290
that Milton has decided to give us a
final simile after all of what we've,

432
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,770
what we've been through
with, with Michael. Okay.

433
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:38,220
This is a line six 25 of book 12,

434
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,360
page four 68 in the Hughes.
Now,

435
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,470
we've already had two anticipatory
narratives of the expulsion so far.

436
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,460
Uh, and I'll, I'll just remind you of
them. In the literalists narrative,

437
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:51,560
God explains that the,

438
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,740
the exposure will occur by
means of Michael's actually
shoving Adam and eve out

439
00:27:58,141 --> 00:28:02,070
of the garden. But you'll remember
also that more naturalistic,

440
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:06,600
that clausy scientific version of this
story in which God explains that Adam and

441
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,080
Eve are going to be ejected,

442
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,260
ejected out of Adam by means of some
certain atmosphere, Eric pressures.

443
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,230
And here at the end of the poem,

444
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:20,850
we have what I take to be
the actual representation of,

445
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,000
of the, of the real event. This is taking
place on the literal level of the, um, uh,

446
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,720
at the present moment of the story.

447
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:32,580
And on the literal level of the
genesis account, a line six, 25

448
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,360
for now two,
nine,

449
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:42,050
the archangel stood and from the
other hill to their fixed station,

450
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:46,650
all in bright array,
the Cherubim descendant.

451
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,770
So you have these amp anthropomorphic
beings, the chair of him,

452
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:53,790
these angels,

453
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,270
these armed angels descend to Earth
to effect God's punishment of man.

454
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,010
And,

455
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:07,010
but no sooner has Milton given us this
literal genesis based description of the

456
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,750
expulsion.
Then he embarks

457
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,700
for a final time on,

458
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:16,980
on a simile that really throws everything
that he's just written into question.

459
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:21,900
The Cherubim have descended there
on the ground. Gliding materialists,

460
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,530
uh, materials is like a
meter there on the ground.

461
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:30,531
Gliding materials as evening mist risen
from a river or the marriage glides and

462
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:37,320
gathers ground fast at the laborers.
He'll homeward returning,

463
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,310
look, look, pay, pay attention
to what Milton is doing here.

464
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,520
He's juxtaposing the descent of
the angels with the ascent of,

465
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,930
of, of the rising miss. The angels
who are gliding materials, um,

466
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,980
is being likened to the,
the, the mist that's rising.

467
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,140
And that also glides. And, and, and
through this antithesis, he signals,

468
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:06,040
I think to the reader that there are
something like two competing perspectives

469
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,563
on this

470
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:13,830
horrible but sir consequential
event of the expulsion.

471
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,250
There's the literalists,
the anthropomorphic image
of the descending angels.

472
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,180
And you have something like
the naturalistic image of
the vapors and the myths

473
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:26,540
of Eden that will eject Adam and eve by
means of a kind of atmospheric reaction.

474
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:30,990
And it's as if God's expulsion
of Adam and eve from the garden.

475
00:30:30,991 --> 00:30:35,991
We're such a terrible event and certainly
it is for us after our many weeks long

476
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:40,020
investment. Now in Milton's,
in Milton Story of Eden,

477
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,230
I'm so terrible that Milton has compelled
to suggest some explanation of it that

478
00:30:45,781 --> 00:30:50,160
actually absorbs God, uh, of
any jealousy or any vengeance,

479
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:53,410
any of those things that
the genesis account, um,

480
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,710
invites us to attribute to God.

481
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,040
And you can see Milton struggling to
make this event more compatible with,

482
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,000
with his theodicy more compatible with
what we can think of as the naturalistic

483
00:31:06,001 --> 00:31:07,320
side of his imagination.

484
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,020
So where has Milton taken us in this,

485
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,910
in this, in this beautiful. Similarly,

486
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:18,660
he's returned us here
at the end of book 12.

487
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,370
He's returned us to one of the most
beautiful similes of the entire poem.

488
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,410
And that was the similarly with which
he had ended book. One of paradise lost,

489
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,250
um,

490
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,250
book one that the end of paradise
lost also features a labor.

491
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,860
You'll remember the belated peasant who
sees or dreams he sees Ferrio elves at

492
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:43,344
twilight.

493
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,663
Okay?

494
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,070
Now Milton began paradise lost with
the claim that he would assert,

495
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,910
assert eternal providence and
justify the ways of God to men.

496
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,440
And it may very well have seen that the
beginning of the poem, that the idea of,

497
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,700
of God's Providence,

498
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:04,470
of God's fore knowledge for seeing what's
going to be completely at odds with

499
00:32:04,471 --> 00:32:06,120
the idea of man's free will,

500
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,570
a god who knows what's going
to happen and advanced.

501
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:13,590
And I know I've made this argument a
number of times simply isn't justified on

502
00:32:13,591 --> 00:32:14,430
some level.

503
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,680
This is certainly what a lot of Milton's
contemporaries thought and generations

504
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:23,610
of readers of the Bible before Milton
thought simply isn't justified.

505
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:26,370
And setting up a paradise that
he knows isn't going to last.

506
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,830
That will have to be lost.
But,

507
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:33,000
but if we were struck by the difficulty
of Milton's theodicy when we began the

508
00:32:33,001 --> 00:32:33,720
poem,

509
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,720
that's because we had no idea then just
how far Milton was going to be able to

510
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:44,351
push our conception of God and our
notion essentially of divine providence.

511
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,070
Th Th th th the whole not the whole idea
of divine providence has undergone an

512
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:56,840
amazing transformation over the
course of, uh, of paradise lost. Um,

513
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:02,030
and it makes its final appearance
in the poems. Final lines.

514
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,360
Michael has just escorted Adam and eve
to the eastern gate of paradise and then

515
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,950
he's disappeared. Thank
God we, uh, we say,

516
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,780
and just before Adam and eve
leave Eden forever, they look back

517
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,590
some natural tears they dropped,
but wipe them soon.

518
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,690
The world was all before them,
where to choose their place of rest.

519
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,820
And Providence,
their guide,

520
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,080
they hand in hand with wandering steps
and slow through Eden took their solitary

521
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:44,550
way.
This,

522
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,580
this exquisitely beautiful and
quiet ending has always teased,

523
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,650
uh, the, the, the readers
of Milton's poem. And, and,

524
00:33:52,651 --> 00:33:57,651
and our puzzlement I think derives from
the opposition here of ideas that really

525
00:33:58,141 --> 00:34:00,690
seem entirely at odds with one another.

526
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Adam has just been presented by Michael
with a powerful vision of the workings

527
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,110
PR precisely of the workings of
divine providence in the universe.

528
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,510
And we're not surprised to see Adam and
eve departing the garden with Providence,

529
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,780
their guide, given what we've
just learned from Michael.

530
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,720
But in the light of the presence of this
guide, the final two lines of the poem,

531
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,100
okay.

532
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,320
Always seems so difficult to understand.

533
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,560
They hand in hand with wandering steps
and slow through Eden took their solitary

534
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:37,734
way.

535
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,080
Okay.

536
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,160
The, the, the, the,

537
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:45,540
the 18th century a critic
and classical editor,

538
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,390
Dr. Richard Bentley was the,
was the first reader,

539
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,790
surely not the first reader
to be puzzled by these lines,

540
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:55,791
but he was the first Streeter to spell
out the difficulties of these last two

541
00:34:55,981 --> 00:35:00,180
lines. Um, and, and, and, and look here
on your handout. I'm Dr. Bentley had,

542
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:05,070
had found the conclusion of the poem so
conflicted that he suggested that Milton

543
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:07,620
couldn't pee, couldn't possibly have
been responsible for them. These are,

544
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,603
once again,

545
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,170
the lines as a peer in our
texts are clearly the garbled
product of the confused

546
00:35:13,171 --> 00:35:16,020
secretary, um, to whom
Milton was dictating.

547
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,400
So look at the handout.
This is near the bottom third of the text.

548
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,820
Bentley asks how the expression of
the last two lines can be justified.

549
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,070
I'm going to quote mentally here and
how can the expression be justified with

550
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:36,660
wandering steps and slow?
Why wandering

551
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,280
erratic steps very improper went in
the line before they were guided by

552
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:47,100
providence.
And it goes without saying,

553
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:50,550
the Bentley gets everything
almost consistently wrong
when he talks about Milton.

554
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:55,360
But you have to, you have to give him
this. He's an amazingly astute reader of,

555
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,500
of poetic tension and,
and poetic contradiction.

556
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,330
And it's an awfully good question.

557
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:04,080
How can it be that Adam and eve are
wandering at the same time that they're

558
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:05,310
granted by Providence?

559
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,480
Milton is able to pack into the
final lines of the paradise lost.

560
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:12,120
Really the central question
of the entire poem.

561
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:14,250
How can it be that human beings are free,

562
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:19,370
free to wander if there's a providential
force out there that seems to

563
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:25,080
determine, uh, their, their
movements. In other words,

564
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:29,580
how can God's fore knowledge B squared
or be reconciled with man's free will?

565
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,900
This is a problem that has been gathering
ground fast at our heels throughout

566
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
our reading of,
of,

567
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:42,810
of paradise lost and it's here at the
end that Milton makes a final attempt at

568
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:45,840
resolution,
a final attempt.

569
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,650
This is his last chance
at at reconciliation.

570
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,220
Milton tells us that the
world was all before them,

571
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,830
where to choose their place of rest.

572
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,930
And it seems on a first reading that the
guiding power of providence will assist

573
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:06,270
them in their choice of a place,
a place of rest. But, but it,

574
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,720
but of course it's more
complicated than that.

575
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:09,550
The word providence in this sentence

576
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,710
can I think also be the
object of the verb to choose.

577
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,140
Adam and Eve are not only choosing
a place out of their own freewill,

578
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,890
it's also possible that they're
also choosing providence.

579
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,320
And I think this possibility,
this,

580
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,740
this secondary syntactical
possibility is a,

581
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:36,680
is a really daring and radical remove on,
on Milton's part,

582
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,430
even the most absolute certainties
of divine for knowledge.

583
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,440
This enormous institution
of, of, of God's Providence,

584
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,750
even that can be subsumed within the
all encompassing power of the human

585
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:53,870
capacity to choose freely.

586
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,660
Adam and Eve not only have a
paradise within them, happier if our,

587
00:37:56,661 --> 00:38:00,350
perhaps they also have a
providence within them.

588
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,360
And surely that is happier far as well.
You'll,

589
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:09,890
you'll notice on the bottom of the
handout that that Bentley proposed at the

590
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:12,190
last lines of paradise lost,
um,

591
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,290
be rewritten this. And so he
gives us what he is. So, um,

592
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:22,450
must've been what Milton actually
dictated but had gotten miss transcribed.

593
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,070
Um, and so, uh,

594
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,730
so Bentley wants to do away with all
of the ambiguity and he suggests these

595
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:32,780
lines as an alternative.

596
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:38,590
Then hand in hand with social steps
their way through Eden took with heavenly

597
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:41,890
comfort cheered.

598
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,440
Oh yeah, no, you have to
hand it to him. You, I mean,

599
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:51,590
of course it goes without saying that
he's a terrible, he's a terrible poet,

600
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,360
but you can see what he's trying to do.

601
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:58,340
He's trying to reconcile the entire
poem with a much more familiar, uh,

602
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,270
Sunday school image of,
of divine providence.

603
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:07,130
Bentley is just so much more
orthodox than our Milton.

604
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:11,360
And he wants to imagine a God who is
still capable of offering assistance and

605
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:16,361
constellation but also punishment for
from above a god who is still capable of

606
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:18,710
intervening in the realm of nature.

607
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,360
And Milton I think wants
very much to resist that.

608
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,280
And, and the world of paradise
lost by the end is, is,

609
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,290
is an almost entirely secular world.

610
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:38,291
The new world order that this great
religious poem has prepared us for is on

611
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:43,280
some level, the, the, the secular
world of, of modernity. Our world,

612
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,150
Adam and Eve are solitary here at the
end of the poem because there's no longer

613
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:50,670
a personal,
uh,

614
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,520
an anthropomorphic deity whose in
a position to intervene in, in,

615
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:56,750
in,
in their lives.

616
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,800
Now they may drop some tears
in in leaving paradise,

617
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:06,460
but they leave behind that shadowy type
of the personal arbitrary deity from the

618
00:40:07,161 --> 00:40:08,000
book of Genesis.

619
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:13,001
They are free now as Milton is free to
choose providence by which I mean they

620
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:18,470
can choose an alternative
image of providential guidance,

621
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,120
an alternative understanding of that.

622
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,550
Now Dr. Bentley takes issue with also
an issue with the term wandering here

623
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:30,110
because he assumes that the word
wandering has to have its evil fallen

624
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:35,260
connotations that it did for Adam and
book 10 wandering steps for Dr. Bentley or

625
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:40,220
necessarily erratic steps since
after the fall. Of course,

626
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:44,150
the whole concept of wandering and all
the freedoms that wandering implied have

627
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:45,140
become suspect,

628
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,340
but now at the end of the poem,

629
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,190
Milton's attempting to reassert the
innocent meaning of the word wander.

630
00:40:56,711 --> 00:41:01,711
All of the dock trinal structures of the
poem have been internalized by Adam and

631
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:04,540
eve.
By the end of the poem at some level,

632
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:07,710
this was the point of Michael's
history lesson. They, they,

633
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:13,020
it was his attempt to compel
their internalization of
provenance and wandering

634
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:21,130
can be seen as sanction now
and is innocent now because
wandering is predicated

635
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,690
on something like an internalized
providential guide and it's,

636
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,650
it's, and we knew this had to be
the case. Eve was right all along.

637
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,140
Wandering is in the end,

638
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:35,480
perfectly allowable in Milton's universe.

639
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,580
And we get to the end of this biblical
epic not with prophecy. Uh, but we're,

640
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:40,801
we,

641
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:45,610
we ended the poem in the mode
of romance wandering this,

642
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,810
this is an ending that's
not an ending at all.

643
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,910
But Milton successfully
resists the drive to closure.

644
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,600
Now we didn't know, of course,
when we started reading the poem,

645
00:41:56,601 --> 00:42:01,601
just what Milton could have meant by his
desire to assert divine providence to

646
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:09,170
assert eternal providence.
And I may assert a turtle.

647
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,530
I may assert eternal providence
and justify the ways of God demand.

648
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,380
He told us in the first and vocation,

649
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,670
but the significance of this claim becomes
clearer by the time we get to the end

650
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:20,504
of the poem.

651
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:25,510
We move from a shadowy type of the
claimed closer to something much more like

652
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:26,750
it's the truth.

653
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:31,040
And there's a sense in which Milton's
claim to as cert eternal providence find

654
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:33,590
it may find its ultimate meaning.
This is,

655
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:38,750
this is one critical conjecture and
I'm quite taken with it may find its

656
00:42:38,751 --> 00:42:43,400
ultimate meeting in the original there,
the root sense of the word as Cert,

657
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,240
the verb to assert, and you can see
this from the bottom of the handout,

658
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,380
comes from the Latin Verb Asur Ray rhe um,
to,

659
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:57,130
to remove from service to declare a
slave free and ultimate is declaring this

660
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:04,100
slave providence free.
And so I'll,

661
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:06,530
I'll conclude here with
a consideration of why,

662
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,590
what that alternative meaning of the
verb assert might actually portend there.

663
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,291
There's,

664
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:18,680
there's the obvious arrogance in this
assertion that that Milton might on some

665
00:43:18,681 --> 00:43:20,810
level is assuming the
role of the slave master,

666
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:26,210
a slave owner placing providence
in the role of a slave. That's,

667
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,400
you know,
that's identifiably miltonic I guess.

668
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:32,690
But there's another sense in which
Milton can be seen as asserting divine

669
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:35,120
providence asserting eternal providence.

670
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:40,121
He's liberating a conception of providence
that has been enslaved and silenced

671
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:44,240
by Orthodox Christian theologians.

672
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:48,680
It's as if the notion of providence
had been enslaved by the literal minded

673
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:50,540
doctrinaire readers of genesis.

674
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,040
And Milton wants us to know that it is
our good fortune as readers of paradise

675
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:58,670
lost, that we have John
Milton, John Milton,

676
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:03,350
like some wandering knight in a chivalric
romance to come to come to the rescue.

677
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,060
You'll, you'll, you'll remember,

678
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,580
you'll remember the note on the verse
that Milton had depended to a later

679
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:12,980
printing of paradise lost explaining
why his poem didn't rhyme.

680
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,960
And Milton told us there that he was,

681
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:20,140
he was saving poetry from the troublesome
and modern bondage of rhyming.

682
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:25,660
Milton was liberating poetry
from a type of enslavement,

683
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,310
but Milton is trying to
save us as readers. Two,

684
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,960
I think just save us from our enslavement,

685
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,860
freeing us from the shackles of what
he takes to be, are the shackles of,

686
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:42,890
of religious orthodoxy from normative
social and poetic conventions to save us

687
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:47,620
from the shackles of the, of the
tyranny of literary tradition. Um,

688
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,610
he is attempted in
paradise lost to free us.

689
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,910
Finally from the troublesome and
modern bondage of literary reading.

690
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,080
Okay. I'm going to end the, the
lecture on Paradise lost there,

691
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:05,850
but I have a word to say about the
reading for after the Thanksgiving break.

692
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:10,830
Do give yourself some time with the first
two books of paradise lost. You might,

693
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,240
you won't, you won't be the
first to think if you think this,

694
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:17,580
that Milton is writing in shackles,
uh,

695
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:21,150
when he writes his sequel
to pet paradise lost.

696
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,300
But you have to give yourself a little
bit of time to appreciate the severity of

697
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,613
this poem.

698
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,740
It's uncompromising aesthetic discipline
because by d only by doing that will

699
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:38,781
you develop what I know will be your
ultimate affection for its mmm delicious

700
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:43,050
peculiarities. Okay. Have
a good, have a good break.
