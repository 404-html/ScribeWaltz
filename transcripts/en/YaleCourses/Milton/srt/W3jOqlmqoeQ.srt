1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,600
So the first thing I want you to do is
turn to page 378 this is the beginning of

2
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:12,540
book nine.
It's a curious feature,

3
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:14,670
I think of book nine that it,

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,300
that that it begins with
a consideration of talk.

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,010
The narrator's lamenting the fact that
that Raefiel has just departed the garden

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,090
and that soon not ought not long after
Raphael's departure that Adam and eve

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,020
will fall and this fall is
going to have an impact.

8
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:33,510
And this is something that the
the is really emphasizing here.

9
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:38,430
It's going to have an impact on
the way they talk. For example.

10
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:42,480
It's going to be impossible after
this point for human beings to enjoy a

11
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:47,010
friendly conversation with an angel.
So this is how book nine begins.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,450
No more of talk where God
or angel guest with man,

13
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,620
as with his friend,

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,510
familiar used to sit
indulgent and within per take,

15
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:02,511
rural repast permitting him the while
venial discourse on blamed with the,

16
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:09,540
with the departure now of a of Raefiel
man will never again be permitted to

17
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:14,190
enjoy venial discourse on blamed.
And venial here has a,

18
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,400
has a special meaning.
It means allowable or permissible.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,260
And Milton suggesting that the,

20
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:22,020
that the fall brings with
it certain restrictions,

21
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,510
specifically restrictions of language,

22
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:30,050
and they're start to arise constraints
on speech or what Milton calls here talk.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,900
And when you read the last
two books of paradise lost,

24
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,930
which we'll be doing for the next week,
you'll begin to see just,

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,140
just what kinds of restrictions Adam
speech will be subjected to the the Angel

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,080
Michael Will,

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,080
we'll continually criticized
and correct Adam's talk.

28
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:48,371
And,

29
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:51,990
and the general feeling I think of the
last two books can be quite uncomfortable

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,900
for,
for just this reason after the fall,

31
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:59,901
Adam and eve live in a world in which
mere speech itself can be blamed or in

32
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,060
some cases it can be,
it can be prohibited altogether.

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,690
The fall is imagined in, uh, in, in books
nine and 10 to have a, as you can, uh,

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,500
of course, this is the, this is the event
herald and the heralded in the title.

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,120
So it's a big deal. It's imagined to have
a, an enormous range of consequences.

36
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,490
And Milton divides these consequences,
um, into essentially a two categories.

37
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,343
The first,

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,990
you have the mythic consequences that
take place are imagined to take place in

39
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:31,410
the physical world.
And then there are also the psychic,

40
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,440
the psychological consequences that
takes place somewhere within the

41
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:38,420
consciousnesses of, of Adam
and eve. And it's with,

42
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,010
it's with a great amount of,
of literary,

43
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,100
imaginative literary Gusto that Milton
enumerates the mythic consequences,

44
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,190
which he does at some length. Then in
book 10. So you'll remember that, um,

45
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,710
after the fall, Adam and eve are punished
with bad weather and Milton, it's,

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,020
and it's wonderful when Milton
does this kind of thing.

47
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:02,680
He tries to represent punishment with
as much scientific specificity as he

48
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,461
possibly can.

49
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:08,230
So the angels are instructed by God to
shift the sun around and to tilt the

50
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,070
poles of the earth, some, some
20 degrees from the sun's access.

51
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,370
And these mythically imagined astronomical
alterations will bring with them the

52
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:22,000
four seasons, uh, new to
new to earth. And of course,

53
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,590
the inclement wins, the biting cold
that will plague forever and forever.

54
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,760
The sons and daughters of Adam and eve.
Needless to say,

55
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,200
these are enormous changes,

56
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:36,580
but when you consider the sheer
magnitude of these cosmic shifts,

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,620
it's all the more interesting I think.

58
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:42,120
And all of the more noteworthy that
the effect of the fall that Milton and

59
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:47,121
laments first in book nine is the effect
on consciousness and the effect on is

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,850
specifically on speech.
It's,

61
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,170
it's here in book nine that
Milton signals that his own talk,

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,950
his own speech has been
affected by this new subject,

63
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:03,010
the subject that he has no
choice but to deal with now,

64
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:06,070
which is that of the fall.
Milton, we'll have to alter,

65
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,450
this is how the argument goes.

66
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,130
He will have to alter the style of his
poem in order to suit the subject matter

67
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,080
of the fall. And so this is, um,

68
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,000
this is what he's doing at line five
or what he tells us he's doing. Um,

69
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,080
I must now change these
notes to tragic and then in,

70
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,010
and the change in Milton's poetic notes,
these musical notes that are of course,

71
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,190
um,
his poetic verses or the,

72
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,850
his is the nature of his
literary literary representation.

73
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,760
The change in these notes
is manifest in a, in a,

74
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:41,380
in a lot of ways throughout the final
books of paradise lost for, for one thing,

75
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:46,180
it's here that we have the,
the last invocation of the poem.

76
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,640
Um,
and it's not coincidental.

77
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,280
I think that this last in vocation
in paradise lost is not actually an

78
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,040
invocation at all.

79
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:58,750
Milton does not directly address the,
um,

80
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,130
Urania the, the, the muse. He could
only speak of her in the third person.

81
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,260
If this is line 20,

82
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:10,261
if answerable style I can obtain of my
celestial patroness I'm in Milton is

83
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,440
enable, it seems to address the
Muse directly anymore. Um, and how,

84
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:22,300
how big that if is if answerable
style I can obtain. Um, we,

85
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,580
we, we don't, we don't actually know.

86
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,120
We don't know whether he'll be able
to obtain the answerable style.

87
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:32,230
There's been a huge, a
falloff in the poets, uh,

88
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,580
poetic self confidence.

89
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,930
He can't express himself on blamed as
he had tried to do in the invocation to

90
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:40,510
holy light in book three.
You'll remember that question.

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,530
May I express the and blamed he's,

92
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:47,290
he's failed here to clear the
lines of communication, uh,

93
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,560
between himself and, and
this heavenly being. And,

94
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,570
and of course in this, in this
failure, Milton, the narrator,

95
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:58,730
the persona of the poet
resembles Adam any,

96
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:03,770
he's no longer permitted this kind of
direct dial access to Urania just as Adam

97
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,680
and eve are no longer permitted.

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,210
They're friendly conversations with
a friendly angel like, like Raphael,

99
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:16,100
they will have conversations with an
angel or Adam will. Um, but Michael's,

100
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,180
as you will see,
Michael's a stern toodle edge.

101
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,810
It can hardly be described as, as
friendly. It's certainly instructive,

102
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,580
but Milton would never be able to bring
himself to use the adjective affable in

103
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:32,120
characterizing Michael as of course
he did. So charmingly with Raefiel.

104
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:33,921
So for Milton,

105
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:38,921
the fault is inextricably connected
to problems of language and,

106
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,170
and specifically no problems of,
of literature.

107
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,510
And so this is what we're going to,

108
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,740
one of the things that
we'll be looking at and,

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,390
and this is why I'm not, I'm, I know
I'm always beginning lectures with,

110
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,291
can you believe it,

111
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:55,550
that we don't find out in paradise lost
until now that this incredibly important

112
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:59,210
thing happens and I'll be doing it
yet. One more time. It's not until now.

113
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,700
And this seems as a, as, as big a
postponement as any of the postponements.

114
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,534
So that I've mentioned,

115
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,400
it's not until now in book nine that
Milton finally gets around to explaining

116
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,860
why it is he, he decided to write his
epic about the fall, the fall of man.

117
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,850
Look at line 25 since first,

118
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:24,851
this subject for heroic song pleased
me long choosing and beginning late,

119
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,860
not set jealous by nature to indict wars.
Hither to the only argument,

120
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,780
heroic deemed chief mastery to
dissect with long and tedious havoc,

121
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:41,110
fabled nights in battles famed and Milton
had intended for for quite some time

122
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,230
as we know to, to write his epic poem
on the subject of a fabled night.

123
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,710
I mean he actually wanted, uh, to,

124
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,640
to have his great English
epic be something like a
continuation of the legend of

125
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:53,474
King Arthur.

126
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,680
And his epic was going to
be a chivalric romance epic,

127
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,030
like the poems by the great,

128
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,500
the great renaissance
poets Ariosto and Taso,

129
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,700
or of course like the fairy queen by
his own countrymen, Edmund Spenser.

130
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,631
And in fact,

131
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:12,020
one of the central figures you could say
these central figure in the fairy queen

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
is just that legendary Arthur that
Milton had as a young man wanted to write

133
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,224
about.

134
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,980
But Milton now insists that it was on
moral grounds that he chose finally chose

135
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,830
not to write his poem in the form of
a heroic Chevelle. Rick Romance. Um,

136
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,600
this is line 32
of book nine.

137
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:37,410
Milton decided not to devote
or invest his poetic talent in,

138
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:37,730
in,

139
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:42,320
in all of those meaningless features of
romance literature that he's now saying

140
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,800
improperly, uh, go into the
title of heroic. So he refuses.

141
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:50,801
This is line 32 he refuses to describe
races and Games or tilting furniture,

142
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,140
emblazoned shields and praises,

143
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:58,260
quaint comparisons and steeds
bases and tinsel trappings.

144
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,210
Gorgeous nights at gels and tournament.
And this,

145
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,120
this list is something like a [inaudible].

146
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,570
This is a common,

147
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,840
these are the common elements of the
Romance Trisha tradition and it's kind of

148
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:12,380
like a,

149
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,380
a cliff notes summary of
all of the conventional
features of a romance like Sir

150
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,570
Phillips, Sydney's Arcadia or
Edmund Spencer's, fairy queen.

151
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,500
And in some cases Milton is actually
lifting entire phrases such as tinsel

152
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:27,610
trappings, which appears a few
times in the fairy queen. Um,

153
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,860
he's lifting them out of
the pages of Spencer built.

154
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:35,861
Milton knows perfectly well that this
is a disservice to his favorite poet,

155
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,550
Spencer and the Romances of the very
queen. They're their, their romance.

156
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,080
That is the fairy queen is clearly a lot
more than merely a depiction of battles

157
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,950
and games, although that
certainly is a feature of it.

158
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,670
The most characteristic
feature of the romance genre,

159
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,230
not just in Spencer's hands,
but in the hands of all writers,

160
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,270
all renaissance writers,
their romance,

161
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,510
the most characteristic feature is the
hero or the heroine who travels the

162
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:09,620
country side in search of adventure,
in search of an opportunity to,

163
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,570
to prove his or her virtue
or an opportunity to prove,
prove his or her courage.

164
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,930
And the principal means by which the
romance plot advances is almost always by

165
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:22,610
the wandering of its of its heroes.

166
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,710
Heroes and heroines wander
the landscapes of romance,

167
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,970
and there's a lot of ideological
significance attached to
to, to this wandering.

168
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:35,300
They,
they rarely have set out before them,

169
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:40,301
some kind of specific map or a guide
that will allow them to proceed along.

170
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:46,241
They're narrowly defined goal and the
demons and the demons that romance he Rose

171
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,810
Battle and the serpents that they fend
off nearly always come as as this,

172
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:56,030
this surprise, uh, they're not
discovered with the help of a map.

173
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,150
They're almost always, and this is
certainly the case in the fairy queen,

174
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,180
they're almost always happened upon
the fact that Romancey rose have simply

175
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:07,070
wandered into an adventure,

176
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,810
only proves their virtue and
their courage all the more. Um,

177
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,880
once of course they have prevailed.

178
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,480
It's important. It's important
that Milton has waited so long to,

179
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:25,160
to explain his rejection of the genre of
romance as the form that the great his

180
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:27,770
great poem would take. And
that's because the, the,

181
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,900
the rejection of romance I think has
everything to do as he's imagining it with

182
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,490
the consequence of the fall
in paradise lost. Um, what,

183
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,090
what are the most convincing elements
I think of Satan's temptation of eve is

184
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:46,091
his attempt to turn her
act of disobedience into
an act of romance chivalry.

185
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,970
So look at the look at
book nine line six 90

186
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,550
Seton suggest to eve at six 92 that that
God won't incense his eye or for such a

187
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,930
petty trespass as eating the
fruit. Um, and then he continues.

188
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:09,931
God will praise rather you're dauntless
virtue in the world of romance.

189
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:11,640
Uh,
the,

190
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,640
the idea of obedience isn't nearly as
important as the idea of courage or what

191
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:19,340
Satan calls here, uh, in,

192
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,560
in perfect chivalric language
dauntless virtue and Sec St.

193
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,770
It was essentially attempting,
he's tempting to,

194
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,900
he's tempting to eve to think of
herself as a heroine of a romance, as,

195
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,310
as if you were saying you're listening,
I don't know what you've heard,

196
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:41,050
but you're not a character in a biblical
tragedy. You're not a character.

197
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:45,240
Even in a biblical epic,
you are Wandering Knight in a shovel,

198
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:50,241
Rick Romance and your only job actually
is to prove your courage to prove your

199
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:54,660
virtue. And of course, um,

200
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,070
eve is dead wrong to,
uh,

201
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:02,130
to apply the assumptions of romance to
this decidedly unromantic test of her

202
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:06,910
obedience. But Milton gives us
for that moment a little glimpse,

203
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,710
this moment of Satan's temptation.

204
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:13,711
He gives us a little glimpse into a
possible alternative to the story of Eve.

205
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,090
The, the, the, the told in
the book of Genesis, if the,

206
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,890
if the story of Eve had been framed in
the genre of romance rather than in the

207
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:27,010
genre of tragedy than eve
might've been rewarded.

208
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,460
Rather than punished for
her eating of the fruit,

209
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,380
I'm her courage would have been praised
rather than her disobedience blamed.

210
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,120
So bill Knowlton rejects
the genre of romance.

211
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Of course he has no choice but to as a
viable literary mode in the description

212
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,200
of the fall in book nine.

213
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:52,201
But he does so only after he's made
ample use and he's exploited it,

214
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,120
uh,
to an extraordinary degree.

215
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:58,960
And I think he's made ample use of
the principle movement of Romance.

216
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,040
And that's the movement of wandering milk.
This,

217
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:07,570
this poem is filled with
images of wandering as if,

218
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,690
as if the poem shows traces or some kind
of literary residue of the genre that

219
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:19,040
Milton decided not to write this
epic poem in the Romance as,

220
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,620
as if somewhere inside of this is,
uh, of this, uh, this biblical epic,

221
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:28,060
there's a romance, epic's Chevelle,
Rick epic struggling to get out. Uh,

222
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,000
when Milton rejects the romance
genre in this, in vocation,

223
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:35,680
he begins to alter the poem sense of
the meaning and the poems since of the

224
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:40,160
significance of the very activity of,
of wandering.

225
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,640
So Adam and eve, and it's incredibly
depressing if you, as most people have,

226
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,360
um, have grown up listening
to your parents argue. Um,

227
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:55,050
they began about the causes of
the fall and they, they, they,

228
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,960
they lapse into a,
uh,

229
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:02,150
a depressing cycle of mutual recrimination
and Adam insists that eve fell

230
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:06,470
because of a tendency she had to wander,
you know,

231
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,540
look what happened. He let her wander
off yesterday morning. And you know, you,

232
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,660
you know the story,

233
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,740
that's essentially his argument and the
subject of eads wandering becomes the

234
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:20,660
focal point of the first
marital argument after the fall.

235
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,480
So Adam rejects eves wandering just as
Milton as rejecting the whole genre of

236
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,690
wandering, the, the, the, the
literary form of the Romance.

237
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:33,700
And I think that there's a way in which
these two forms of rejection or are

238
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,390
closely related and what's at stake
with both of these forms of rejection,

239
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,290
these acts of rejection is, is a
problem of language. [inaudible] nope.

240
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,060
So when Milton Rights in line 20 of
the invocation that he's struggling,

241
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,570
he,
he,

242
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,540
he writes that he's struggling to find
an answerable style as style that will

243
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:57,830
answer to this, this new occasion,
the tragic occasion of the fall.

244
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,450
He needs to change his style in a way
that can actually answer to the tragedy

245
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:05,810
that he's about to describe. And
so as a literary event, the, the,

246
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:09,420
the fall makes its biggest
impact I think on the,

247
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,290
through a change in the style of the
poem through the systematic. And,

248
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:19,291
and by that I mean there's something
like a systematic alteration of,

249
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,810
uh, of the use of certain
key words. So I'm going to,

250
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,950
I'm going to be focusing for a moment
on the changes undergone by a particular

251
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:32,060
word. Um, and you've probably
already guessed what it
will be a particular word in

252
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,020
paradise lost.

253
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,490
Although there are a number of words
that seem to undergo similar or at least

254
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:41,210
closely related, uh, changes
over the course of the poem.

255
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,730
But here I'll be looking
at the word wander.

256
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,310
That word wander or wandering or some
version of that word appears no fewer than

257
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:53,300
32 times in a, in, in paradise lost.

258
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,710
And without question,

259
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:59,480
I think every appearance of of the
word is loaded. The energy charging,

260
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:03,830
the word wander comes from the fact I
think that it has embedded within it or

261
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:08,831
attached to it in some way the entire
genre of the Chevelle rec romance that of

262
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:13,310
course Milton has rejected and it's almost
as if the word wander is a code word

263
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,150
for romance.
And when Milton uses the word wandering,

264
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:20,750
it's almost as if he's alluding to this
Spencerian type of poem that he rejected

265
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,330
when he decided to write paradise lost.

266
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:28,331
It's a reminder of the kind of poem that
this could have been if it hadn't been

267
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:30,970
a biblical epic.
And,

268
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,090
and you can see a way in which the
word wandering and paradise lost, um,

269
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:40,091
seems to range somewhere or move perhaps
back and forth between two distinct

270
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,040
meanings. And so I've, I've, um,
it's a little confusing, but I've,

271
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,100
I've given us, uh, something,

272
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:54,350
a schematic version of the
semantic spectrum that the
word wander in habits in,

273
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,800
in, uh, in paradise lost.

274
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,950
So I guess you could think of the pure
or the innocent meaning of wander is,

275
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,050
is, is purely spatial. It,

276
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,680
it is purely a spatial description of
a kind of directionless or unforced

277
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:13,400
motion. Um, and then as,

278
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,220
as the further you move to
the right of the spectrum,

279
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,700
you get it's figurative and
therefore its moral meaning,

280
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,950
which is error error.

281
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,960
The pejorative sense of Aaron Aaron out
simply has wandering and straying from

282
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,180
the law, wandering as a divergence
from that which God wants you,

283
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,280
that which God wants you to do.

284
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,380
So from a kind of pure and
uncontaminated meaning, um,

285
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,030
to the right of the spectrum to
something much more morally pejorative,

286
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,590
you can actually think of the word
wander as something like a Chevelle Rick

287
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,340
Knight that undergoes its own set
of adventures and challenges and

288
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:54,690
transformations over the course
of this poem. So let's, um,

289
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,620
let's look at an early
instance of the word wander.

290
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,270
This is book two line one 46.

291
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,750
This is be legal in the console.

292
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,320
The great debate in in Hell when Billy
Allen book to ponders the possibility of

293
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:13,530
the annihilation of the angels.
It's a horrible possibility for him.

294
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,710
The consequences that,
uh,

295
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,320
the consequence theater he imagines
as most painful and most absolutely

296
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:24,321
unbearable is the possibility that his
mind will no longer be able to wander.

297
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,550
So be legal asks this question.
This is line one 46 at book too,

298
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,360
for who would lose though full of pain.

299
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,870
This intellectual being these thoughts
that wander through eternity and sure

300
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,400
Bilio is a fallen angel and nothing goes
out of his way to provide a kind of doc

301
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:48,840
trinal condemnation of
everything and be Leo speech.

302
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,740
But there's no sense actually that
there's anything wrong with the general

303
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,150
concept of,
of,

304
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,040
of intellectual wandering and in fact be
Lele seems to be quoting Milton himself

305
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:02,190
from Aereo budgeted can,
which Milton celebrates above all things,

306
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:06,000
the white to wander,
the right to wander through literature,

307
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,090
through all of one's reading
and all of one's cultural,

308
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,520
cultural exposure without a guide.

309
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,050
Milton rights scenario politica that God
gives us mines and he loves this fact.

310
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,640
God gives us minds that wander
beyond all limit and satiety and,

311
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:25,430
and the whole principle
of divine wandering. Now,

312
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,030
the whole principle of human wandering
has given a powerful divine sanction, um,

313
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,260
in, in area politica. And so
initially in paradise lost,

314
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:38,250
we have just that kind
of innocent, uh, innocent

315
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,560
meaning to the word wandering
it as, as it appears. Um,

316
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,190
early in the poem, um, look
at another early instance.

317
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:52,480
This is book four line two 33.
Page two,

318
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,340
83 of the Hughes.
Um,

319
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,810
Milton's describing here how the four
rivers of paradise spread out and travel

320
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:00,644
through the earth.

321
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,940
How the river divided into four
main streams runs diverse wandering,

322
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:08,650
many of famous realm and country.

323
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,850
So the river divides into four streams,
wandering,

324
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:16,240
many of famous realm and country. Um, and,

325
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,270
and here it's a river that's been
actually cast in the role of, uh,

326
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,450
of the hero of a chivalric romances.

327
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,180
Typically of course it's the night a
Chevelle Rick Knight who wanders many of

328
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,070
famous realm and country.

329
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,470
Now we may be tempted to assume that
because of the rivers of Eden or wandering

330
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:33,640
through the countryside,

331
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,880
that there's already a tendency toward
something like moral error or straying

332
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:43,930
from the law of built somehow
into the landscape of the garden.

333
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:45,880
We may assume that Adam
and eve will naturally,

334
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,810
how could they not stray from the proper
path of obedience if they live in a

335
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:53,680
natural world that is itself
continually Strang and and wandering.

336
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:56,560
But Milton invites us
to make that connection,

337
00:21:56,561 --> 00:22:00,700
but then a slaps our wrists for
even entertaining it for a moment.

338
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,770
He uses wandering here in these early
passages in an almost aggressively

339
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:10,750
innocent sense. He simply wants
to describe a nonlinear emotion,

340
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,240
a direction that hasn't been dictated
or directed by a by a higher power.

341
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,610
And, and one of the, and
I've made this point before,

342
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:23,611
but one of the labors of reading paradise
lost is knowing when to recover and

343
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:29,020
then actually trying to recover the purely
innocent significance of some of the

344
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,130
poems.
Keywords.

345
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,380
So the idea of an innocent wandering
is central to Milton's poem because the

346
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:38,000
activity of wandering and the,

347
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,610
the activity of wandering and the
principle of freewill are so absolutely

348
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,270
intimately connected.
If think about it,

349
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
if wandering is a,

350
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:53,230
is is a motion that doesn't follow a
predetermined or a predestined path,

351
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,580
then then the wanderer is necessarily
always free from the constraints of,

352
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,880
of,
of an external force.

353
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,450
Or You could say that the wander is
always free on some level from the

354
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:07,960
constraints or the guidance
even have an omnipotent God.

355
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:12,850
The variability to wander the right to
wander is something like a guarantee or a

356
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,490
strong proof of one's freedom.

357
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,620
In book nine, though, this is,

358
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,750
this is one of the reasons this book
can be so hard to read. Um, the,

359
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,040
the very notion of wandering starts to
come under suspicion and there's a sense

360
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:31,510
that Milton can't afford any
longer to be so free. Uh,

361
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,140
and his talk about wandering,
no more talk of innocent wandering.

362
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,260
He might've begun. Uh, this book with the,

363
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:43,261
with the fall wandering is no longer
and blamed or venial to use those words,

364
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,050
uh, from the, from the
opening, quasi in vocation, it,

365
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,400
it comes under a new set
of ethical constraints.

366
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,750
And it's almost as if I'm wandering by
the time you get to book nine no longer

367
00:23:55,491 --> 00:24:00,491
has an opportunity or the liberty to
occupy the innocent or the left hand side

368
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,620
of the semantic spectrum,

369
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,860
but it's almost entirely forced
to occupy the figurative,

370
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:12,950
the moral and specifically
the morally pejorative, uh,

371
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,730
side of that words meaning.
Um,

372
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,280
so look, let's take a look at
how that, that happens. Um,

373
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,180
this is page three 93 in the Hughes book,
nine line six,

374
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:31,181
36 34 and Milsons describing Satan's
leading a vive to the tree of knowledge,

375
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,950
obviously a consequential event and eve
as compared to an amazed night wanderer,

376
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,350
I would night wander or who has been
diluted and misled by a wandering fire.

377
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,730
And I'm wondering if fire is a
meteor, uh, moving across the sky.

378
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,280
And at the moment of the fall,

379
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,350
all of those wonderfully liberating
significance is that had been attached to

380
00:24:57,351 --> 00:25:00,290
the notion of wandering suddenly
seem to just drop out of the equation

381
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,660
altogether.
And the evil that we have,

382
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:06,320
no choice but to associate
with Satan starts to start.

383
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,620
The evil starts to absorb and,

384
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,510
and suck up all of those innocent,

385
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:16,310
those beautiful associations
that the word wandering had had.

386
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:20,900
And so instead of, uh, a
capacious semantic spectrum,

387
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,640
you get something like a rigid and much
more fixed sense of the meaning of this

388
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:29,370
word wandering by the time
we get to the fall. Um,

389
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,380
let's look on this is page
404 in the Hughes a line,

390
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,660
1000, 134 of book nine, 1134.

391
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,630
By the time Adam gets around a blaming
eve for the fall. And of course,

392
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,670
of course he does that, um, uh, uh,

393
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,840
that the word wander has been
entirely confined to the moral,

394
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,160
the morally pejorative part of its
semantic range. And so for Adam,

395
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,700
and he says remarkable. Uh, the,

396
00:25:57,701 --> 00:26:02,360
the point at which he falls isn't what we
know to be the point at which he falls,

397
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,100
which is the moment
that she eats the fruit.

398
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,410
The point at which he
falls according to Adam.

399
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,260
Here is that moment in
which you wandered away.

400
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,560
She wandered away after their argument
or their conversation about their

401
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:16,130
separation. And so we, it
says to eve at line 11, 34

402
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,960
would vow hat's Tarkin to my words and
stayed with me as I'd be softy when that

403
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:28,970
strange desire of wandering
this unhappy mourn, I know,

404
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:33,830
not whence possessed theme,
that's strange desire of wandering.

405
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:38,420
I think it's, I think it's painful
almost to hear Adam used that phrase,

406
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,930
that strange desire of wandering
as if wandering. We're a concept,

407
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:45,650
so alien and so foreign,
uh,

408
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:49,700
in the world of Paradise,
Milton tells us, uh,

409
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,370
just above this passage
at, at, at line 1132,

410
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:58,371
that Adam is speaking in an altered
style and this alteration of style is,

411
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,250
uh,
surely on the one hand this,

412
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,470
the angry tone of voice that he's
using as he's speaking to his wife.

413
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,761
But it's also,

414
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:10,650
I think a certain restriction
of semantic possibility.

415
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,490
The possibility of,

416
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,840
of the significances of the
words that he's using and,

417
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,850
and hear the word wandering can only
have it's morally pejorative meaning,

418
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:24,960
and there's a sense in which Matt in
which Adam is condemning not just eve,

419
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,340
but the whole range of freedoms that lip
that Milton had been working so hard to

420
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,500
establish in as,

421
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:35,510
as important actually crucial
components of the, uh,

422
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:38,880
of his liberal universe.
Well,

423
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:43,680
Eve hears this and she's right.
She's right to be perfectly aghast.

424
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,200
And she's a gas not simply because
Adam is, as he is, is, is, uh,

425
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,100
is exhibiting a kind of surprisingly
unbecoming capacity for rudeness.

426
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,190
It's not just the tone of
voice that appalls her.

427
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:59,550
She's also appalled by the
altered style of Adam speech,

428
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,070
by which I mean the powerfully reductive,

429
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,220
a force of his tall talk.

430
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,920
Look at line 1144 this is Neve,

431
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,450
what words have passed by lips,

432
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,840
Adam's severe imputes that that
imputes Dow that to my default or,

433
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,850
and you can see the kind of quotation
marks that Eva's putting in the air right

434
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:24,684
now.
Um,

435
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,700
imputes though that to my default or
we'll have wandering as now cost it.

436
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,310
Eve is eve is right.

437
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:37,311
I think to be surprised that this altered
this fallen use of the word wandering

438
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,660
has passed Adam's lips. And you can
almost hear her say, listen, you know,

439
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:45,270
what's going on? I always thought
wandering was a good thing.

440
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,990
A wandering is of course what the
river's in paradise do. Adam and I,

441
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,480
and I thought that the right to wander,

442
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,630
it's a right that we possess as
creatures in a creatures of freewill in,

443
00:28:57,061 --> 00:29:01,710
in a, in a free place. How dare
you blame the fall on wandering

444
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,080
and, and one thing I think we can say
for eve is that she's an excellent,

445
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,560
she's an excellent reader of poetry.
And like a good reader.

446
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:15,561
She's bristling here at the
suggestion that a word as capacious,

447
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,430
as wandering is capable,
only have one type of significance.

448
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,900
There's a sense that before the fall
words in Milton's poems had a kind of

449
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:26,640
nimbleness.
There was a,

450
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,320
there was a flexibility to them and
ultimately as you, as you remember,

451
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,743
Milton unimagined,

452
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,310
his verse style is something like the
verbal equivalent of an angel's body.

453
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,000
Um,

454
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
his poem was a body of verse that was
free of restrictive joints and limbs of

455
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,550
the traditional rhymed couplet.

456
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,080
And there was a suppleness that that'll
allowed words and phrases and whole

457
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:55,081
sentences to assume a h a a huge array
of meanings just as angels can either

458
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:58,450
sexism in,
in heaven.

459
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:04,360
But there's a sense in which words seem
to lose a lot of their suppleness. Um,

460
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:06,690
after the fall. And this
depressing, lots of, of,

461
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,190
of a kind of linguistic
mobility is for Milton.

462
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,410
I think one of the central crises of,
of the poem,

463
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,440
a word like wander suddenly begins
to to assume joints and limbs.

464
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,430
It becomes arthritic and, and its meanings
become restricted and reduced to a,

465
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,070
to a black and white world of
good and bad. Uh, and, and, and,

466
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,000
and it's not,
it's not just wander.

467
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:34,450
There are other keywords that
undergo similar transformations. Um,

468
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,060
slightly different
transformations of course,

469
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:39,280
because they are different
persons are different characters,

470
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,410
but I'm thinking of words such
as fruit or error or taste.

471
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,500
Any of these would make
an excellent paper topic,

472
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,870
a tracing of the history of the word
as it progresses through the poem.

473
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,920
So words that had been so polyvalent,
so,

474
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,780
so multifaceted are, are beginning
suddenly to be concretized as,

475
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,320
as moral error.
The words are becoming polarized.

476
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,360
They're pushed to the opposite
poles of good and evil. And,

477
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:13,960
and this moved to reductive
signification has seem to have, I think,

478
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,620
and Milton wants us to see it as having
some disastrous consequences for his

479
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:20,614
poem.

480
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:25,750
And one of the most disastrous
consequences of the new
altered style of paradise

481
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:28,000
lost involves the poems,

482
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:32,770
new understanding of e four for a while,

483
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:39,150
for a while it seemed possible that the
official line on sexual hierarchy was

484
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:44,050
just one was just one of of of the
possible readings of of Paradise.

485
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:47,290
They'll government.
There were at least some suggestions.

486
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,700
I thought they were at least
some suggestions that that
that there was actually

487
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:56,650
a kind of natural equality between Adam
and eve and that the matter of hierarchy

488
00:31:56,651 --> 00:32:01,651
was like a cultural imposition of an
arbitrary order onto the naturally

489
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,630
egalitarian status of their relationship.

490
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,450
A cultural imposition that
God himself had imposed,

491
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,260
at least as you know very well at least
I have found myself over the last couple

492
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,480
of weeks trying to make a case for
a certain openendedness to the,

493
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,680
to human relations,

494
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:24,460
to the relations between the sexes in
Milton's Eden and I'm willing now to

495
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:25,294
confess,

496
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,380
I will confess here and now that maybe
I pushed that case a little too far.

497
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,120
I pushed that case of this openendedness
to the relation between Adam and eve a

498
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:44,630
little further than the
poem would actually allow me
to push it. And if I have,

499
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,070
um, if I have had, uh,

500
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,400
gone too far in that particular
interpretive direction
over the course of these

501
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:59,270
last, let's say three or four lectures,
the poem now is correcting me,

502
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,040
my wrist is being slapped, and by the
time we get to the end of book nine,

503
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:07,340
it's becomes impossible. And it becomes
even possibly impossible for me.

504
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:12,230
And I can push this stuff pretty hard to
maintain the case for the gray areas or

505
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:16,250
the blurred edges that
surround the, the, the poems,

506
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,220
the poem sexism. So, so no more of talk.

507
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:24,221
No more of Rogers's talk of
Milton's infinitely feel good,

508
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,800
flexible feminism. Um, your, your,

509
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:32,801
your professor can now be seen to
have strayed beyond the bounds of,

510
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:37,940
of responsible, responsible pedagogy. And
perhaps you'd be, you'd be well advised.

511
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:38,390
I Dunno,

512
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:42,930
it's up to you whether you should just
throw away your notes from the last, um,

513
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,330
three or four lectures or I will advise
Dan the cameraman simply to erase.

514
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,490
We'll erase the last three tapes.
Um,

515
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,560
because maybe I was entirely
wrong after the fall,

516
00:33:53,561 --> 00:33:57,560
there's less and less of an alternative
to Raefiel his insistence on,

517
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,830
on sexual hierarchy. Everything
is much more black and white now.

518
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,240
And any ambivalence that that may have
been expressed about the justice of Eve's

519
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:10,220
subjection to Adam seem simply in some
way to just disappear after the fall.

520
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,400
One of the divine punishments,

521
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,300
and it's always started strikes
students has kind of odd that one of the

522
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:21,920
punishments that follows the fall is the
official subjection of women to man the

523
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:26,670
sun. The Sun and Paradise lost passes
judgment on eve and he declares it.

524
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,560
This is in book 10 to thy
husbands will vine shall submit.

525
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,940
He over thee shall rule. And a lot,
you know, often we ask, well, what's,

526
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:38,630
what's the big deal? How is this
different from their situation before?

527
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:41,750
But it is the big deal and
this is a punishment. Um,

528
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:46,310
you'll remember that eve before the fall
had always been in a position to choose

529
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,610
to yield, to add them. Um,

530
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,220
and here she, she no longer has
a choice. She just gets seized.

531
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,430
And she's never given
the opportunity to yield.

532
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:02,690
And maybe the distinction strikes some
of us as as, as a little specious,

533
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,210
but it's a,
it's a meaningful one I think to Milton,

534
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,040
but there's more to the fall than just
this official de la laying down of a new

535
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:10,874
law,

536
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,410
a newly rigorous and newly and
forest law of sexual subordination,

537
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,850
of involuntary, involuntary
sexual, uh, subjection.

538
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,220
Look at page four 27 in the Hughes.

539
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:25,550
This is book 10 line eight 67.

540
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,980
There's, there's a, there's
a new subjection of language,

541
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,710
the subjection of language
to a new altered style. Um,

542
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:40,150
and in this passage we have Adam really
at his most misogynist eve comes to Adam

543
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:44,430
and try to make amends after the fall.

544
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,730
And Adam just lets loose with this
powerful antifeminist invective.

545
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,210
So this is line eight 67 of book 10 out
of my sight vow serpent that named best

546
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:03,390
befits the with him lead thy
self is false and hateful.

547
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,260
Nothing wants but that they
shaped like his and colors.

548
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:12,261
Serpent teen may show the inward fraud
to warn all creatures from the henceforth

549
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,900
and the fall brings with it a
new name for eve serpent and,

550
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:23,190
and is actually thinking of one of the
incredibly mean spirited and I think it

551
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:27,390
was actually mistaken, but it was a
traditional etymology for the name Eve,

552
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,030
which had at various
points over uh, the, the,

553
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,460
the history of biblical interpretation
actually in the Hebrew was believed to

554
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,840
have meant serpent.

555
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Adam here identifies eve with the serpent
and he's providing a significance for

556
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,220
eve the word eat,

557
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,130
that that drastically constricts
the enormous range of meanings that,

558
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:53,390
that we may have associated with
her up to this point that we,

559
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,300
we were right presumably do
associate with her up to this point.

560
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,180
You'll remember that in
book for the weaving,

561
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:04,860
motions of Eve's hair had been juxtaposed
implicitly with the waving winding

562
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:06,090
motions of the serpent.

563
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,950
And one of the points of
that juxtaposition was to
come to understand that the,

564
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,960
the waving wandering motion was
entirely innocent before the fall.

565
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:19,530
That only comes to be associated
with with moral error.

566
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,830
I'm the right hand side of the semantic
spectrum after the fall. But, but,

567
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,290
but once again,
um,

568
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,460
Adam reveals to suddenly reveals himself
to be an abominable reader of poetry

569
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:34,020
and uh,

570
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,790
and absolutely incapable of nuance and
suggestiveness and he reinterpreted,

571
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,590
he reinterprets all of the
innocent similarities between
the wandering waviness

572
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:48,591
of eve and the serpent into something
like an absolute identification with evil.

573
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:55,190
The neem eve suddenly takes on the force
of something like a morally pejorative

574
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,310
word,

575
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,840
and Adam only makes his case stronger
by reiterating this new black and white

576
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:05,580
understanding of the concept of
wandering. Get this, um, this is,

577
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:10,500
um, line eight 73 of book 10, but for the,

578
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:14,580
he tells eve, but for the,
I had persisted happy,

579
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,590
had not die pride and wandering
vanity when least was safe.

580
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,150
Rejected my fore warning

581
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,750
pride in wandering vanity wandering as
practically taken on the force of a, uh,

582
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,110
of a curse word.
In this sentence,

583
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:35,800
it's lodged contemptuously between
pride and vanity. As if out of nowhere,

584
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:38,920
Milton is elevating the notion
of wandering to something
like the eighth deadly

585
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:43,270
sin. Uh, the, the, the very, the
very idea of wandering. Of course,

586
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:47,950
we know this insists upon the importance
of, of ambiguity and ambivalence.

587
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,690
And I think it's just this ambiguity and
Ambo ambivalence that Adam has really

588
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:54,280
lashing,
lashing out out.

589
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:59,281
He's struggling to align the concept of
wandering with some of the most hateful

590
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,570
and some of the most misogynist
impulses of the poem. It's,

591
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:08,170
it's, it's important though to,
to understand that it's not just,

592
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,520
and it's depressing also to understand
that it's not just Adam who's responsible

593
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:17,521
for the reduction of eve and the reduction
of Eve's wandering to the status of

594
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:18,490
moral error.

595
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,460
That the poem itself seems to be
lending a kind of disconcerting, um,

596
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,350
authority to this
misinterpretation of eve.

597
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:29,320
I think it's a misinterpretation
of eve when Adam Falls, the, the,

598
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:34,321
the text makes clear that it's for very
different reasons from Eve's fall even

599
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:37,750
fallen out of deception.
And Adam had fallen out of love.

600
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,440
He knew precisely what he
was doing. Uh, this is,

601
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,030
this is what the narrator
tells us at line. Uh,

602
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,510
and you don't need to turn their
line nine 97 to book at book nine.

603
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,280
Adam scruple not to eat against
his better knowledge, not deceived,

604
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,520
but fondly overcome with female charm,

605
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,580
fondly overcome with female term,

606
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,230
fondly overcome with female charm.
What sense does that make? That that's,

607
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,840
that's the narrators in interpolation.

608
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:12,430
The narrator is giving an a new
authoritative interpretation
of the event of the

609
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:16,510
fall. And I think it's an entirely
unfair, and it's not just unfair.

610
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:19,000
This is wrong.
Adam falls,

611
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:22,210
we know this because of his
sense of his marital bond.

612
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,480
I think he's wrong to fall actually.
Um, but it's not that he was, uh,

613
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,150
overcome with thieves.
Uh, female charm. He says,

614
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:34,060
our state cannot be severed.
We are one,

615
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:39,310
one flesh to lose the word to lose myself.
And he falls.

616
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,790
He falls out of this,
his sense of connectedness with the,

617
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,800
but he doesn't fall because he's been
seduced by his wife that the narrator has

618
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:49,630
interpreted Adam's fallen away.

619
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,560
That I think the text
itself simply can't support.

620
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,950
And it's a central example of
how reductive interpretations
aren't just to be

621
00:40:58,961 --> 00:41:00,520
attributed to Adam,

622
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:04,360
but they're beginning actually
to insinuate themselves
into the authoritative

623
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:08,200
voice of the, of the narrator book.

624
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,580
10 of paradise lost is,

625
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,990
is the book given to the representation
of the consequences of the fall?

626
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,470
And given that one of the effects of
the fall is, as I've been describing,

627
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:22,040
is something like the imaginative
shrinkage that language suffers. We,

628
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,040
we shouldn't really be at all surprised
by one of the early and very strange

629
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:30,970
actions and book 10 it's,
it's here that we,

630
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:34,110
that we witness that
we're forced witness the,

631
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,740
the reappearance of the debased.

632
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,160
And what I think is for this poem the
entirely inappropriate genre of allegory.

633
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,870
Suddenly as if from,

634
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:49,930
as if from nowhere a Milton re-inject
into his otherwise realistic poem,

635
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,770
the decidedly unreal figures
of, of, of sin and death.

636
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,250
So look at book 10 line to 29 this is
page four 11 and the Hughes a Milton

637
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:05,600
describes the sun's descend to Earth
to pass judgment on Adam and eve.

638
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,120
And at line two 29,

639
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:11,480
he gives us a description of a set
of events that's been happening

640
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,220
simultaneously.

641
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,610
And he uses this meanwhile structure
a few times in paradise lost. Uh,

642
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:22,310
meanwhile air thus was sinned and judged
on earth within the gates of hell.

643
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,150
Set Sin and death and, and the, and,

644
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:29,760
and with this use of the meanwhile
structure of the narrative, um,

645
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:32,680
Milton's allow,

646
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,750
allowing us to see the activity of sin
and death not happening at a later point

647
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:42,320
in the story of the fall. It's happening
at the same time as the fallen. In fact,

648
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,600
it's the same event.
It's simply at the same event,

649
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:47,600
told from a different perspective, a
different point of view. And of course,

650
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:51,440
it's told within an, within an
entirely different literary mode.

651
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,700
And one of the consequences of the fall
has been a certain reduction of meaning,

652
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:59,900
as I've been describing, undergone
by some of the poems, uh,

653
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,390
keywords.
And here in book 10,

654
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:07,280
Milton Constructs an entire
scene out of that literary mode,

655
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,950
traditionally most given to reductive
meanings. And that's the, the,

656
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:13,770
the mode of allegory.
It's,

657
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,960
it's an allegory that when
performed hamfisted Lee,

658
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:19,910
um,

659
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:24,800
you have a one to one correspondence
between an image and it's meaning there

660
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:28,960
isn't that, there isn't traditionally an
allegorical writing the same kind of a

661
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,150
proliferation of meanings that you
can have in other literary modes.

662
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,560
The follows the moment of course at
which Adam and eve sin and the moment at

663
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:39,950
which they are consigned to suffer
the penalty of death. You know,

664
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,740
that much we accept and is
perfectly reasonable. Um,

665
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,610
but,
but here after the fall,

666
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:51,611
Milton chooses to represent this new
introduction of sin and death within the

667
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:52,520
motive allegory.

668
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:56,810
And the result has to be
one of the most bathetic,

669
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,670
one of the most preposterous scenes
in all of paradise lost. It's a,

670
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:03,650
it's a, it's an embarrassment. Um,

671
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,680
turn to page the top of page
413 in the Hughes line to 82.

672
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,820
This is the argument since there
will presumably be after the fall,

673
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:18,870
a greater deal of communication between
Earth and hell. The allegorical monsters,

674
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:23,871
sin and death find
themselves in the position of
constructing and actual bridge,

675
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,430
uh,
constructing an actual,

676
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,550
a bridge that will connect the earth
with the home of the fallen angels,

677
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,330
the hell.

678
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,470
And so Milton represents the building
of this bridge as some massive public

679
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:38,760
works project.
And there's,

680
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,890
and I think there's every indication
here that he's intending this

681
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:45,620
representation to strike us
as, as as perfectly absurd, um,

682
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:47,340
sin and death begin to build the bridge.

683
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:52,540
This is the line to 82 then both from out
hell gates into the waste wide anarchy

684
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:59,220
of chaos. Damp and dark,
flew diverse and with power,

685
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:02,880
their power was great
hovering upon the waters.

686
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,700
And you'll notice here
that we have a parody of,

687
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:10,350
of God's creation where the Holy Spirit
had hovered upon the waters of chaos and

688
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:13,920
made it pregnant. Um, I'll
continue what they met.

689
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:19,340
Solid or slimy as enraging see
tossed up and down together,

690
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:22,260
crowded,
drove from each side,

691
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:27,261
show Ling toward the mouth of hell as
when to polar winds blowing adverse.

692
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,130
And I'm skipping around here together.
Drive mountains of ice.

693
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,803
It's a,
it's a,

694
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:38,990
it's a brilliant but a grotesque travesty
parody of Gods vitalist creation of

695
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:41,484
the universe,

696
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,520
the process whereby impregnated matter
or begins organically to organize itself

697
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,740
into the, into the, into
the beautiful creation,

698
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,600
synonyms in death with their
ham fisted creators here,

699
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:57,930
they can't impregnate, caused
chaos of course. So they,

700
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:01,500
they build a bridge over chaos by,
by manhandling,

701
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,360
by manhandling chaos.

702
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:07,500
They forced together all of the solid
and all of the slimy stuff into one huge

703
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:10,890
pile. It's a, it's a grotesque image,

704
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,420
but it's grotesquery I think
serves an important point. I mean,

705
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:18,300
it serves as Milton's emblem for,
among other things,

706
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,310
his emblem for the process undergone
by language after the fall. It's,

707
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:28,330
it's as if he's representing the shoulding
together into one concrete block.

708
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,700
All of the diverse and all of the various
meanings associated with some of the

709
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:36,600
poems, most resonant, most
beautiful and most suggestive words.

710
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,030
Look at looking at how death gets,
um,

711
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:45,030
all of the slippery stuff of chaos. You
know, it's, it's wonderfully slippery,

712
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:50,310
um, to hold together in the
form of a bridge line two 93,

713
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:55,910
the aggregated soil death with his
mace [inaudible] cold and dry as with a

714
00:46:56,851 --> 00:47:00,480
trident smoked and
fixed as firm as de Los,

715
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:03,240
the floating island as
deloads floating ones.

716
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,100
The rest his look bound with
Gorgonian rigor not to move.

717
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:13,850
And with asphaltic slime death has
the ability to fix this preposterous

718
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:15,930
allegorical,

719
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,490
allegorical character death
has the ability to fix
something fluid and flexible

720
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,080
into something from and asphaltic and,
and,

721
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,700
and I think you have one of the most,

722
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:31,030
one of the most powerful images of
the aesthetic disaster that is fallen

723
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:33,700
language. The extraordinary matter of, of,

724
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:38,701
of chaos is being concretized concretized
here it's subjected to a pro process.

725
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:44,890
Exactly like the linguistic conquered
association undergone by a word like

726
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,790
wander or the words fruit or error.

727
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,210
These words begin to succumb to a
kind of link linguistic rigor mortis.

728
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,600
They ossify into a moral rigidity that
I think would have seemed perfectly

729
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:02,470
unthinkable to us at an, at
an earlier stage in, in the,

730
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:06,870
in the poem.
I,

731
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,410
okay. I, I have, um, I've,
I have another second. Um,

732
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,720
we have what we have time.
I think for one more example,

733
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:16,600
this is the punishment of Satan.
When God,

734
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,000
when God punishes Satan for tempting eve,

735
00:48:19,001 --> 00:48:23,440
he does so in a way that makes literal
and actual Satan's association with the

736
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:26,740
serpent. Um, and it's really quite vulgar.

737
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:31,150
Satan had of course just temporarily
inhabited the body of the serpent and God

738
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:35,710
punished is Satan by turning
this temporary association
into something like an

739
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:40,510
actual condition.
Look at book 10 live and five 55.

740
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:45,430
This is page four, 19. Uh, Satan is
metamorphosed. You'll remember in day two,

741
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:50,330
a huge and hideous serpent at the
gigantic public assembly in Hell. And,

742
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,300
but Milton doesn't stop at that vulgar,

743
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:56,530
quasi allegorical representation
after Satan has met.

744
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,560
After that Milton metamorphoses,

745
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:04,210
all of the fallen angels into serpents
and he and he places before them a grove

746
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:08,380
of trees, all of them c
containing the forbidden fruit.

747
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:13,770
So the fallen angels who are announced
serpents are all so thirsty and so hungry

748
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,650
that they can't help but climb the
trees and try to taste the fruit.

749
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,750
This is line five 55, yet parched
with scolding thirst and hunger,

750
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:26,780
fierce vote to dilute them
sent could not abstain,

751
00:49:26,781 --> 00:49:31,781
but on they rolled in heaps and up the
trees climbing set thicker than this

752
00:49:32,831 --> 00:49:35,470
snaky locks that curled McGarrah.

753
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,950
Mcgarrah was one of the,
one of the furies,

754
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:42,730
the feminine figures in classical
mythology who punish sin.

755
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:47,731
And like Medusa Mcgarrah has
serpents for locks of hair.

756
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:50,960
And I think it's impossible to
read these lines and not, uh,

757
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,040
not see in them an embedded an incredibly
unfair and ugly but embedded image of

758
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:59,050
eve.
The beautiful waving,

759
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:03,760
wandering tresses of Eve have been
identified now categorically and

760
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:08,110
unrepentantly with the serpent,
the serpent who was her downfall.

761
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,640
And the poem seems to go about as far as
it can go in the absolute ossification

762
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:18,190
of a character into a kind of empty
embodiment of, of, of, of moral evil.

763
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,240
The actual image of metamorphose
metamorphoses here is, uh, is,

764
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:28,340
is merely a narrative version of a process
that we've seen occur in the language

765
00:50:28,911 --> 00:50:31,940
of paradise lost for,
for some time now,

766
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:37,150
moral ambivalence and poetic ambiguity
has been transmogrified into something

767
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:39,740
like moral definitiveness.

768
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:44,510
And literary ambivalence
has become a literary,

769
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,830
literal mindedness.
Well,

770
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,610
happily the poem isn't over yet.
And,

771
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:56,630
and the grotesque reduction
of Eve to evil is by no means,

772
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,120
uh, the poems, last words.

773
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,590
So think about as you read books 11
and 12 for next time, think about the,

774
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,570
the literary texture of those books as
you compare it to the earlier books.

775
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,230
Um, uh, the poem it has
off. It used to be argued,

776
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:15,980
and it's an incredibly stupid argument
that Milton was simply getting old and

777
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:19,640
tired by the time he got around
to writing books 11 and 12. Um,

778
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:22,940
but of course he rent Wah, he went on
to write statements and Samson agonists,

779
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:25,940
Deason and paradise regained
magnificent works of art.

780
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,500
But there is nonetheless a marked change
in the verbal character of the last two

781
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:32,140
books of paradise lost through.

782
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,990
So think about the implications
of the altered style of,

783
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:39,470
of the book's conclusion.
Okay.
