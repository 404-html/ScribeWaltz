1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,010
It's,

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,270
it's fitting that the first poem of
Milton's that we study in this class is on

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:11,040
the morning of Christ's naitivity.
And in a number of ways, it's both.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,690
It's both the first poem and
it's a poem about firsts.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,000
It isn't exactly though the first
poem that Milton that Milton wrote,

6
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:25,110
the young Milton. As you can see from
your, uh, from actually any addition,

7
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:28,770
any modern edition of Milton,
which arranges the poems, uh,

8
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:30,060
more or less chronologically,

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:33,690
you can tell that the young Milton had
actually written quite a few things

10
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:38,691
before he wrote what we call a
colloquially the note the naitivity owed.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,670
But most of these early
pieces are written in the,

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,930
in the Latin that Milton
had perfected at school.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,980
And these, these, these earliest, uh,

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,020
these earliest of Milton's
Latin poems are our lyrics.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,330
There are of a highly
proficient technical, uh,

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,670
incredibly impressive
technical proficiency and they
are absolutely soaked with

17
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:06,600
the references to the classical writers
that Milton had been ingesting from,

18
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,530
from his earliest youth.
Milton had also written a couple of very,

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,100
very short poems in English.
But there's a,

20
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,780
there's an important and I think a very
real sense in which Milton wanted to

21
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:22,800
make it seem as if the naitivity owed.

22
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,860
We're the first poem that he had
written. And there's also, uh,

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,200
an important and I think a very real
sense in which Milton wanted to make it

24
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:33,630
seem. And obviously this is
a much more difficult feat.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,990
Wanted to make it seem as if the naitivity
road where the first poem that anyone

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,660
had written now, now Milton
was born in 1608. And uh,

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,460
he wrote the naitivity owed
along with the sixth LG,

28
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:52,020
the LG OLED GSX data that we
read for today in December of 16,

29
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,510
29,
uh,

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,320
a couple of weeks presumably
after he turned 21,

31
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,490
it wasn't until 1645 at the age of 36 or
37 that Milton would publish his first

32
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:09,200
volume of poems, which he, which
he titled Simply Poems. And,

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,320
and it wouldn't be another 22
years after that until Milton, uh,

34
00:02:13,321 --> 00:02:15,490
actually published paradise lost.
Now I'm,

35
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:20,490
I'm mentioning these dates here because
the dates on which Milton wrote and

36
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:24,750
published his poems, the, the
temporal sequence of these,

37
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,740
the publication,

38
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,460
it has a p peculiar and particular
importance to to Milton as early as 1629

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,220
that's that. That's
the date we're in. Now,

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,750
Milton is thinking of himself as
a poet who has not yet published.

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,780
He delays for an unusually long time,

42
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:47,781
his poetic entrance into print and he's
musing almost continually on on what it

43
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:51,030
means to be a poet who has,

44
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,040
who has delayed his publication
to be a poet, who's,

45
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,320
who's waiting for something to be a poet,
who always looking to the future,

46
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,010
to the poem that, that he hasn't yet
written down to the future to the readers.

47
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:07,360
He hasn't yet attained and maybe most
gloriously to the poet who was looking to

48
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,200
the future,

49
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,640
to the fame that he has not
yet successfully secured,

50
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,700
were secured at all because
no one at this point knows,

51
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,150
knows John Milton when in 1645 Milton
finally publishes that first volume of,

52
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:22,724
of poetry.

53
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,220
The first poem that he places in this
volume is the negativity out our poem

54
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:32,221
today and s and under this title on the
morning of Christ's naitivity appears,

55
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:37,471
as you can see from your text appears
the subtitle composed 1629 and Milton's

56
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:44,290
taking pains here and he does this,
he does this with very few other poems.

57
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,140
He takes pains to let us know precisely
when it is that he's written it a

58
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,830
composed 1629 whether or not
that's actually true and there's,

59
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,920
there's some, there's some controversy
about that. But nonetheless,

60
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,960
the subtitle announces to all who know,

61
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:03,880
John Milton that the poet was 21 years
old at the moment of its composition and

62
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:07,690
that he had therefore
just reached his majority.

63
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,071
Now,

64
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:14,071
the subject matter that he's chosen for
this poem for this so called first poem,

65
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,930
couldn't possibly be more
appropriate. Uh, when the,

66
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:21,280
when this with this first poem treating
the subject of the Nativity of Christ,

67
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,970
Milton is able implicitly,
uh,

68
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,140
to announce something like his
own naitivity as a, as a poet.

69
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,170
And it goes without saying that
there's, there's, there's just,

70
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,040
there's something outlandish
to say the least about this.

71
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,690
We're struck by the arrogance implicit in,

72
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,480
in Milton's active identification here.

73
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:47,740
What could possibly be more presumptuous
than the Association of the beginning

74
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,410
of one's own career,
one's own literary career with,

75
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,330
with the birth of the Christian Messiah.
Um,

76
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,090
Milton's implicit connection between
his own birth as a poet and the birth of

77
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:02,980
the son of God is inactive of Hubris
that I think a lot of his contemporaries

78
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:06,850
would feel more comfortable calling.
Uh, actually calling blasphemy

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,230
Milton's is, uh, John Milton.

80
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:16,231
We'll remain unique in English letters
for the degree of thought that he gave to

81
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,850
the shape of his literary career or
actually to the notion of a, of a,

82
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:25,360
of a career at all.
No English poet before Milton,

83
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,790
I'm ever suggested that he was,

84
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,530
that he had been chosen by
God at birth to be a poet,

85
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,240
Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare.
These are all pre miltonic poets.

86
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,590
None of these earlier figures had dared
to suggest and it would never have

87
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:46,450
occurred to them to suggest that
there's was actually a divine vocation.

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,280
It takes your, I think it
takes your breath away, uh,

89
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,510
to think of the unspeakably high
hopes that John Milton had for his,

90
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,610
for his career. If you have a chance,
you might want to take a look.

91
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:03,380
I think this is in the cross campus
library at the Facsimile version of the,

92
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:08,090
of the very first edition of Paradise
lost. It's in 10 books rather than 12. Um,

93
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:12,690
it's a, it's a, it's a modest thing, not
the facsimile version but the actual uh,

94
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,710
1667 volume and that the
text looks perfectly ordinary
until you realize that in

95
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:25,421
the margin alongside the lines of the
poem are printed the line numbers for,

96
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,491
for the poem,

97
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,090
just like the line numbers in any modern
edition of Milton that's been produced

98
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,810
for the likes of you, for the, for the
consumption of college English majors.

99
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,160
As far as I know, um, I,
I know of no exception,

100
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:42,620
although someone may well
be able to produce one,

101
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,190
no original poem in English had ever been
published with the line numbers in the

102
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:49,221
margin.

103
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:53,630
And it's very first in its very first
printing and it may well be that that no

104
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:57,660
poem has ever been since
Paradise lost published, uh,

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000
with line numbers in its,

106
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,680
in its very first addition to any right
thinking printer or any right thinking

107
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:08,210
publisher would scarf at the presumption
of a poet who had demanded such a thing.

108
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,740
The only precedent Milton would
have had even for the idea of,

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,550
of line numbers, um, would, would
have been the great ancient classics,

110
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:20,630
the magnificent renaissance
additions of homer and Virgil. Um,

111
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,890
they would have appeared in the 17th
century with line numbers because line

112
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:29,120
numbers obviously facilitate the
production of scholarly commentary and

113
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,510
facilitate the study of
those texts in the classroom.

114
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,790
And I can only assume that,
that,

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,860
that is precisely the point that
the Milton would later in 1667,

116
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:41,420
when paradise lost is published,

117
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,950
he would make his poem canonical just
like the Elliot and just like the Odyssey

118
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,360
and the,
and the Aeneid

119
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,100
before anyone had actually read it meant
Milton would cert into the printed text

120
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,700
of his,
of his poem,

121
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,930
his own anticipation that his epic would
receive the same universal approbation

122
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,180
as homers and, and Virgil's,
uh, it's, uh, it's a,

123
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:10,210
it's a daring way to jumpstart one's
own one's own literary celebrity.

124
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,280
Milton Milton was continually
in a state of anticipation. Um,

125
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,100
and it's the,
it's this rhetoric of anticipation,

126
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:24,050
this language of looking forward that
structures all of Milton's own own

127
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:27,290
narratives about his own
literary career. And, and,

128
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,540
and this is a exquisitely visible to us
in the Nativity out at a very early age.

129
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:38,621
Milton bruited on his poetic vocation as
if it were an actual calling from God.

130
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:39,770
But,

131
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:44,600
but the problem of one's being called
to be a great call to be a great poet is

132
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:45,434
that one,

133
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,210
one may have an inkling or some sense
of a promise of a future greatness,

134
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:54,260
but nothing really to show for it
yet. Milton had, and he knew this,

135
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:58,440
he had obviously been a successful student
at the Saint Paul School in London.

136
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,030
And,
and then later in Cambridge at a

137
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,570
later in college at Cambridge University,

138
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,170
he had written a large handful of college
exercises and assignments in Latin and

139
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,660
he had obviously made a favorable
impression on his teachers,

140
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:20,130
many of whom he stayed in touch with,
uh, for years, even as a young boy,

141
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,210
Milton's Latin seems to have been
impeccable and he was quickly establishing

142
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,530
himself as one of the best Latin
nests in the country. But Milton,

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,641
it's calling,

144
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:34,590
this is what John Milton knew his
calling was to be a famous English poet,

145
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,170
a famous English poet,
writing in English,

146
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,350
a calling that he holds despite the fact
that he appears to have written next to

147
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,570
nothing in English verse.

148
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,050
All Milton has at the beginning of
this poetic career is the promise of

149
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:52,050
greatness, the anticipation of a
luminous body of, of English poetry.

150
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,690
Now in the first original poem that
Milton wrote in English titled Added

151
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,110
Vacation Exercise,

152
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,960
Milton and you will come to recognize
this as so unbelievably miltonic. Uh,

153
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,780
Milton doesn't write about love or about
death or about any of the subjects that

154
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:10,740
typically engage the youngest
practitioners of poetry.

155
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,540
Milton subject in his first
English poem is a, we can guess it,

156
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,950
it's his future literary career.
You can look at page 31 in the,

157
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,330
in the Hughes edition.

158
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,040
So Milton begins by addressing not
a fair mistress or a blooming rose,

159
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,580
or he doesn't even begin by
blooming, uh, by, by addressing God.

160
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,680
He addresses instead the English language,
hail native language.

161
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,930
Milton begins and then he proceeds to
set out in his heroic couplets of I ambig

162
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,810
Pentameter,
a map for his,

163
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,370
for his future career as a famous
poet. Now, when Milton publishes,

164
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,670
publishes this poem, he makes it
clear that it was written at age 19.

165
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:51,600
That's important to him.

166
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,220
Milton claims that he will one day use
the English language to express what he

167
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:58,860
calls some graver subject,

168
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,680
some more important subject matter,

169
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,180
and he proceeds to characterize what
that graver subject will will look like.

170
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,820
So the,
I'm looking at line 33 here,

171
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,170
such where the deep transported mind
may soar above the wheeling poles and it

172
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:20,070
heaven's door look in and
see each blissful deity,

173
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,480
how, how he before the
thunderous throne death lie.

174
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,250
Now the graver subject that Milton is
intending at some point to expound upon is

175
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:32,250
clearly an epic one like homer and Virgil.

176
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:36,270
Milton intends to soar above the wheeling
poles of the visible world and just

177
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,100
describe the otherwise invisible
comings and goings of the gods.

178
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,290
And of course since this is what
he would go on to do in paradise,

179
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:48,291
lost the 19 year old Milton hasn't yet
imagined that his own epic would take for

180
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:52,470
it subject to story,
a story from the Bible,

181
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,890
but the poetic and ambition is clearly
identifiable to us as as epic in scope.

182
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,790
We will hear again in Milton's
intention to write an epic in the,

183
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:07,380
in the versified letter that he writes
to his, his best friend Charles de Dadi.

184
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,890
Um, this is the letter to [inaudible],
uh, which Milton publishes as the, uh,

185
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,010
as the sixth elegy.
Uh,

186
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,260
that's the Latin poem that was
assigned for today's class.

187
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,370
So take a look at page 52 in the Hughes.

188
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,570
Milton Milton naturally,
uh,

189
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:30,380
wrote his friend letters in an
impeccable Latin verse. And,

190
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,200
and this one he seems to have composed
almost immediately after having written,

191
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:40,201
having completed the naitivity out the
letter to Dr he gives us another glimpse

192
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:44,560
of the anticipatory narrative that
Milton is sketching for his career.

193
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:48,400
Milton claims that that epic poetry
is the highest ambition for a poet.

194
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:49,861
And then again,

195
00:12:49,861 --> 00:12:54,861
it goes on to explain how it is that
the epic poet should comport himself.

196
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,980
Uh, I love this. Oh, so this is, um,

197
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,620
this is Milton to,
to his best friend,

198
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,310
but he whose imagine
receiving a letter like this,

199
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,640
but he whose theme is wars and heaven
under Jupiter in his prime and Pires

200
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,870
Heroes and chieftains half divine.
I'll skip a little bit,

201
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,550
let him live sparingly,

202
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,030
like the same me and teacher and let herbs
furnish his innocent diet and let him

203
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:29,680
drink sober drafts from the pure spring.
Beyond this,

204
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,060
his youth,
the youth of the future epic poet,

205
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,240
his youth must be innocent of crime and
chased his conduct irreproachable and

206
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,040
his hands stainless.

207
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,260
So Milton is explaining to Tarell's dod
that if you're going to become an epic

208
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,740
poet, you have to start acting like
one. You have to remain celibate.

209
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,120
And as we will see in the coming
week, um, this is important to Milton.

210
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,370
You have to remain sober
and you must eat vegetarian.

211
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,100
Let herbs furnish his innocent diet.

212
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,410
And then Milton that goes on to explain
that this is exactly what homer did.

213
00:14:08,411 --> 00:14:11,140
This is how homer prepared himself
to be the great, the greatest,

214
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:16,120
and the first of all epic poets.
Um, it's not an uninteresting,

215
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,370
I think to note that there was absolutely,

216
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,970
there appears to be absolutely no evidence
whatsoever available to John Milton

217
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,340
that homer was either veggie
vegetarian or, or, or,

218
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,800
or a lifelong celibate. Um, by
all accounts, Milton has just,

219
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,650
he's just made this up.
Um, it has led her to dia.

220
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:37,510
Dadi clearly this is
something that he wants.

221
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,610
He wants to believe or
that he needs to believe,

222
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,170
but there does seem to be evidence that
at least at this early point in Milton's

223
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:48,910
life, he's intending to remain
sexually abstinent for forever.

224
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,970
Um, he, he would,

225
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:55,940
he would remain a virgin
in order to prepare for and
to maintain this incredibly

226
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:59,590
important role as an epic
poet. And, and, and, and,

227
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:01,700
and as I mentioned a moment ago,

228
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,290
we will return to this question of what
has been interestingly and maybe rightly

229
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:10,220
called the young Milton's chastity fetish.
So,

230
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,200
so Milton applies to dod that he
isn't yet up to the task of, of epic,

231
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,040
but as he describes the naitivity
Yo that he's just written,

232
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:23,270
it's almost as if he considers it
something of a, of a mini epic. Uh,

233
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,010
look at, uh, this is page
one 98 in the Hughes.

234
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,650
I am singing the starry skies and the
hosts that saying high in the air,

235
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:38,180
that and the hosts that sing
high in the air. And the gods

236
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,790
and the gods that were suddenly
destroyed in their shrines.

237
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,900
Now there's some, we have the
trappings here of, of epic Grand Juror,

238
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:53,330
an epic subject matter that the poem on
the morning of Christ's naitivity serves

239
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:57,920
as we can think of it as
Milton's preparation for
something greater than itself.

240
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,190
It's a poem on which this very
young poet is cutting his teeth.

241
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,880
The naitivity of Christ,
as you can imagine,

242
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,570
was that was a popular subject for,
um,

243
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,360
for early 17th century poets for pious,

244
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,390
early 17th century poets.
Um,

245
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,430
nearly all of the poets that we come
now to recognize as the major religious

246
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,550
literary figures of, uh, of the period.

247
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,230
I'm like John Donne whom you may have
read an English one 25 or raw Robert

248
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,430
Herrick or Richard Crash.

249
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,440
All of these poets had tried their hand
at the poetic celebration of the birth

250
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:38,060
of Christ. And it actually,
it's instructive and you
can learn a lot by, uh,

251
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,970
comparing Milton's poem to those
of so many of his contemporaries.

252
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,220
His contemporaries are doing
a kind of thing with the,

253
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,060
their representation
of the birth of Christ.

254
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,390
That Milton seems carefully
to have avoided now most,

255
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,360
and you can actually imagine
without even having read them. Um,

256
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,390
what a lot of these poems
are like most poems,

257
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,710
most poets who write naitivity poems are
interested in the miracle of the Virgin

258
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,180
Birth, emphasizing the Virgin
Mary and the tender mother son.

259
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:12,620
Relationship between,
between Mary and Jesus Melton shows,

260
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,830
uh,

261
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,680
unusually little interest
in the miraculousness of
the conception or anything

262
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:22,160
like the domestic details of the,
of the domain of the manger scene.

263
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,300
The focus of the naitivity owed isn't
even really on the incarnation. Uh,

264
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,550
that's the,
that's the theological doctrine of,

265
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,140
of DV divinities descent into humanity.

266
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,690
How God becomes a mortal.

267
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,600
What Milton is primarily interested in
and his naitivity owed is the redemption,

268
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,640
the promised of what the promise of
what Christ's naitivity will do at some

269
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:48,890
future 0.4.
For mankind,

270
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:53,340
the birth of Jesus doesn't immediately
effect the redemption of fallen man.

271
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:55,730
But it's the moment, and this is why
it's so important to Milton this,

272
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,380
it's the moment at which
that promise is made.

273
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,780
The Nativity for Milton is
purely an anticipatory event.

274
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,430
It's,

275
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,430
it's less meaningful in itself then than
it is than it is for what it promises

276
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,790
for,
for the future.

277
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,150
Because it's not going to be until after
the negativity that we have the event

278
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:18,150
of the crucifixion. Uh, and after that,

279
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,360
the event of the resurrection and
finally the terrible moment of the last

280
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:25,380
judgment, which will bring the
narrative of Christian history to its,

281
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:27,420
to its ultimate close.
So the,

282
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:31,590
the satisfactions of the moment are for
Milton deferred here, and it's this,

283
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,990
it's something like a recognizable process
of deferral and postponement that you

284
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,900
will see beginning to
form themselves at the,

285
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:44,460
at the very center of Milton's
poetic imagination. Okay, let's,

286
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,380
let's look at the poem.
Um,

287
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,760
page 43 in the Hughes as,

288
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,250
as soon as Milton describes for us the
events in heaven that lead up to the

289
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:57,090
naitivity, he begins the, this
is the prelude of the poem.

290
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,530
It's broken up into two
chunks, the prelude, and then
what Milton calls the him.

291
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,010
He begins to third stanza of the prelude
to his poem with a plea to the heavenly

292
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,860
news for inspiration.
Uh,

293
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,460
this is line 15 page. Uh,
page 43 in the Hughes,

294
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,020
the poet is asking for help, uh, with,
with the composition of the poem,

295
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,470
say Heavenly Muse shall not they sacred
vein of four to present to the infant

296
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,900
God.
Hast thou no verse,

297
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,700
no him or solemn strain to
welcome him to this his new abode.

298
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,340
We're, we're struck, I think,

299
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,300
or at least I'm struck by the what I
find to be the oddly negative almost

300
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,070
scolding tone that Milton is adopting
really quite inappropriately,

301
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,320
I think, um, in this address to the muse,

302
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,230
he seems less interested in
actually praying for divine
assistance then he isn't

303
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,340
chiding the muse for not
having come to his aid sooner,

304
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,010
but we might be able to
understand some of the,

305
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,680
the weird anxious energy
behind the stands.

306
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,570
If we think of the phrase
that Milton uses here,

307
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,560
the phrase infant God as,

308
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,530
as someone who had,
um,

309
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,310
quickly establish himself as the most
talented Latin is probably in all of

310
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:18,420
England. Uh, Milton is
naturally, how could he not be
highly attuned to the Edom,

311
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:22,530
illogical prehistory of
the English word infant.

312
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,230
And our word infancy,
uh,

313
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,050
comes from the Latin word in farms,

314
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,360
which literally means not speaking Christ,
whose,

315
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,720
whose naitivity Milton is
honoring is still just a baby.

316
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:39,420
He isn't speaking at this moment yet.

317
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,400
He isn't yet producing language.
And in his role here as a,

318
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:49,330
as a mute, as an infant, Christ
is serving, I think as an,

319
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,670
uh,
an important function for Milton.

320
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:56,010
He serves as something like
a complicated double for the,

321
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,330
for the young unpublished.

322
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,390
And as of yet unproductive poet himself
considered that even even this early on

323
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:08,680
in his career, Milton is harboring
epic ambitions as we've seen. Um,

324
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:12,880
he is very much an infant in 16,
29.

325
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:17,590
He isn't yet able or he hasn't
yet produced epic speech.

326
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,760
And I think it's possible to see that
one of the purposes of this poem is,

327
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,400
is precisely to correct that situation.

328
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,140
It's one of the purposes of this poem to
allow Milton to grow out of his infancy

329
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,680
to incarnate or to put actually into
words the talent that he believes himself

330
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,533
to possess.

331
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,880
Now it's not until the fourth stanza of
the prelude that we can fully understand

332
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,280
the magnitude of the strange,
the strange anxieties here,

333
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,810
we can't know exactly and this is one of
the most wonderfully unsettling things

334
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,550
about this stanza.

335
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,430
We can't know exactly to whom
Milton is addressing this stands.

336
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,700
It would appear that Milton has
stopped addressing the Muse.

337
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:05,230
They haven't my muse and that
he has begun addressing himself,

338
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,410
although that's unclear,
but it may be the case that it's,

339
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,090
it's something like a situation in which
over the course of the previous stands

340
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:17,800
and Milton is actually usurped the role
of the Muse and has begun pro providing

341
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:21,850
something like his own inspiration.
So when the forest stands that we have,

342
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,780
we as readers have no idea
where we are or when it is.

343
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:30,340
The speaker of the poem imagines himself
to be speaking and it's at this point

344
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,390
that something quite strange happens.

345
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,620
Milton tells the muse or is he
telling himself, we don't know.

346
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,160
Milton tells someone to hurry up.

347
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,780
Think of this to hurry up with
the inspiration of the Ode.

348
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,860
Hurry up with the inspiration of the ode
because Milton can see the three wise

349
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:53,510
men bearing their gifts
as they do to flee.

350
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:58,040
Follow the star of Bethlehem
to the manger. This, uh,

351
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:02,830
this may seem to be a perfectly reasonable
vision for a poet considering himself

352
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:07,510
to be an inspired poet to
have, but it, but it's,

353
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,340
but there's something peculiar here.

354
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:14,341
Milton wants to beat the
three wise men to this scene.

355
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:19,531
Milton wants to arrive in Bethlehem to
hand Christ his poem to hand Christ his

356
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:24,310
poem before the wise men are able to bring
their gold and their frankincense and

357
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:26,350
their Merv a look at line 22.

358
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,530
See how from far upon the eastern road,

359
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:33,820
the star led wizards haste
with odors, sweet, oh run,

360
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,560
prevent them with thy humble load and
lay it lowly at his blessing feet.

361
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,370
Think of what this poem
is now asking of us.

362
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:47,000
We're being asked to accept the fiction
that Milton is having very poem laid at

363
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:49,490
the Blessitt feed of the
infant Christ Milton,

364
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:53,540
who was writing at the present moment.
The present moment of December,

365
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,980
1629 is claiming the capacity to arrive
at a moment in history that he has

366
00:23:57,981 --> 00:23:59,930
already described as a long completed one.

367
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,520
Milton tells himself to run and,
and,

368
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:08,780
and naturally he would have to run fast
indeed in order to arrive at a moment in

369
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:12,590
time that had already occurred before,
before he even set out this,

370
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,660
this kind of temporal,

371
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:19,190
this weird temporal disjunction is
naturally an important part of the poem.

372
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,170
And it not only gives the poem,
it's,

373
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,120
it's peculiar air of something
like a conceptual timewarp,

374
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,550
but, but it's an important part
of Milton's profoundly, uh,

375
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,420
anticipatory imagination.

376
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,580
So Milton is struggling here to catch up
with a star led wizards who as you can

377
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:38,360
note,
um,

378
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,360
are already themselves hasting and he
tries to prevent them with his humble

379
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:48,920
load. We'll talk about
humble in a minute. Uh,

380
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,670
um, but I, I'm interested
now in the word prevent,

381
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,740
which for me is really the central,
uh,

382
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,340
the central word of this remarkable
stanza. Now, most I don't,

383
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,130
I don't know if Mary Hughes weighs in
on this or not a most editors of Milton.

384
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:05,840
And tell us that the word
prevent in this line retains its,

385
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,450
its original Latin meaning as
you can see on your handout,

386
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,590
it means to come before, uh,
the Latin is private era.

387
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,560
It means to anticipate Milton wants is
owed to make it to Bethlehem before the

388
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:19,520
three wise men do.

389
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,350
Now this is a form of competitiveness
with which we are all familiar.

390
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,960
This is the straightforward, ah, perfectly
understandable competition to be first.

391
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:31,750
Now,

392
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,750
now it's built ins annotators who tell
us that the word prevent means to come

393
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,450
before to anticipate.
And,

394
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:41,120
and on some level that obviously means
that and it got that goes without

395
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:46,060
question. But I think this
definition is also limiting. And,

396
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:49,520
and this is a phenomenon that I hope you
will come to be familiar with the good

397
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:54,521
scholars of Milton a reveal their typical
resistance to anything even remotely

398
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:58,490
interesting or alive in the text.

399
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,370
Surely this word prevent also has,
um,

400
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,060
a little bit of its modern meaning.
Um,

401
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,020
I think it's might actually be the
more obvious meaning, uh, which is to,

402
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,230
to hinder or to preclude when Milton
tells himself to prevent the starlet

403
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:18,800
wizards with by humble is also saying
that the wise men should be prevented from

404
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:22,250
making it to the manger at
all. That somehow the wise
men need to be headed off,

405
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,370
headed off at the pass and precluded from
presenting any gifts to the infant God

406
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:31,520
that may compete with the,
with this so called humble,

407
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,380
humble ode of John Milton.
Now this is a darker,

408
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,350
this is a darker form of
competitiveness that the kind of, uh,

409
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:42,560
of competitive and respond.
I don't know,

410
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,580
think of our own environment
here in the academy. Um,

411
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,440
that spawned by courses that, that, uh,

412
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,910
grade strictly on a curve, um, uh,

413
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,610
a type of environment where one
succeeds not merely by doing well,

414
00:26:56,611 --> 00:27:01,330
but by doing better than other
people. Um, and especially, um,

415
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,060
in addition by preventing other
people from, from doing well,

416
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,081
it's a,
it's a,

417
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:12,081
it's an extraordinarily
dark way to characterize the
composition and the process

418
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:14,700
of the,
of the poem.

419
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,250
We have a streamed image of the
composition of the poem at its at its very

420
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:21,084
outset.

421
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,690
And we have an image of someone writing
as if he were participating in a race

422
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:31,290
and we're reminded of the etymological
root of our modern English word,

423
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,330
a career, uh, Milton.

424
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:38,550
And we'll only use the word
career once in his, uh,

425
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:41,400
in his poetic of,
and it comes,

426
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:45,030
it will come pretty soon actually
in the sonnet. Number seven, uh,

427
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,410
the word career comes from the French.
Uh,

428
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,210
as you can see on the handout
[inaudible] which means a race course and

429
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,130
etymologically a career.

430
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:57,660
What we think of as a career isn't
simply the benign product of the gradual

431
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:02,430
development of a certain potential.
That's how we generally think of a career.

432
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,040
It's the outcome of a race.

433
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,970
It's that one's running faster
than all of the other guys.

434
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:13,980
And it's as if to have a career at all,
one has no choice but to come in first.

435
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,780
The desire to be first is, is,
is really central to this poem.

436
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,990
And it continues in this stanza have
thou thee have thou the honor first the

437
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:29,970
Lord to greet and join my voice
on to the angel choir from out.

438
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:33,750
His secret alter touched
with hallowed fire

439
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,100
as you may have guessed,
because you have this on your handout.

440
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,950
Milton is alluding here to the old,

441
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:44,310
the famous words of the Old
Testament Prophet Isaiah.

442
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,140
Isaiah in this passage is, is describing
a crucial moment in his career,

443
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,700
his career as a prophet.

444
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:54,530
The moment in which his lips are
cleansed and he is empowered,

445
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:59,160
divinely empowered to speak prophetically.
Uh,

446
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,550
this is the, this is the Old Testament.
These are the old testament lines.

447
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,670
Then flew one of the Sarah Fims unto me.

448
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,110
Isaiah tells us having
a live coal in his hand,

449
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,560
which he had taken with the
tongs from off the altar.

450
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,460
And he laid it upon my mouth and said,
Lo,

451
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,260
this hath touched thy lips and
nine iniquity is taken away.

452
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:26,460
And I sin purged. Also, I heard
the voice of the Lord saying,

453
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,840
whom shall I send? Who will
go for us? Then said, I,

454
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,720
here am I send me.

455
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,080
So what are we to do with
this, uh, with this illusion?

456
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,500
What are we to make of Milton's use
of this striking and painful image of

457
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:47,260
prophetic preparation?

458
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,280
Milton Milton can join his voice to the
angel choir and had the honor of being

459
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:53,170
first to greet the infant God,

460
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,620
but before he can actually be made
present at the actual event of the,

461
00:29:58,931 --> 00:29:59,500
uh,
uh,

462
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,500
the need tivity he has to endure something
painful and obviously momentous from

463
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:08,680
out his secret alter
touched with hallowed fire.

464
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,890
The iniquity of his lips must be burned
off by alive angelic coal that the

465
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:19,630
sinfulness of his lips. And we could think
of it as the sinfulness of his voice,

466
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,870
his poetic voice. We'll,
we'll have to be purged.

467
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,210
What exactly that purgation will entail
and why Milton's voice needs to be,

468
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,740
needs to be purged at all.

469
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,210
I think these questions are really the
subject of the entire rest of the poem,

470
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,230
the him, what Milton calls
the humble owed that follows.

471
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,230
This introduction is the poem that
Milton wants to present to the Lord,

472
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,680
but the but the him at the same time,
it's something like the process,

473
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,040
the process by which Milton
is attempting to purge,

474
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,030
cleanse his proposed etic voice and make
it a voice that will actually be equal

475
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:59,830
to the extraordinary ambition that
Milton has for it. The him, uh,

476
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,310
the large part of the poem can be
divided roughly into three sections.

477
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,550
First I'm in the first date stands is,
um,

478
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:09,880
you have Milton describing the scene of
the negativity and the effect that the

479
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:13,340
birth of this new infant has
on the natural world. And,

480
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:17,050
and I don't have time here to
discuss this section right now,

481
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:18,410
but you've,

482
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,380
you've already had some encounter with
the incredibly impressive level of,

483
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,670
of, of ingenuity and grotesquery
in this remarkable passage.

484
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,570
Nature who's a personified,
a feminized, a feminized,

485
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:36,571
personified being is shamed and humiliated
when she finds herself a naked in

486
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:41,410
the, in the presence of this
new, of this new God. Jesus.

487
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,760
The second section runs from
Stan's is nine through 17,

488
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,820
and it characterizes the
song that the heavenly,

489
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,420
the heavenly choir sings at
the moment of the Nativity.

490
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,550
But when Milton describes the song of the,
uh, of, of the angelic choir, he can't,

491
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,430
and it's amazing.

492
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,070
It's as if the speaker can't seem
to focus on the event at hand. What,

493
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,200
what we should I think be witnessing here
is the naitivity of Christ and all of

494
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:09,640
the events,
uh,

495
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,840
immediately surrounding the
actual birth of the infant God.

496
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,800
But no sooner has Milton mentioned the
naitivity. Then he reminds himself,

497
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,420
and no sooner has he mentioned this,
this singing of the angelic choir.

498
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:25,180
Then he reminds himself of all
the other times that they've song,

499
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,280
it's something like a liner notes
or a performance history of the,

500
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,540
of the cosmos as greatest group ever.
I look at line one 20.

501
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,370
Milton writes that this choir had been
singing at the moment of creation,

502
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,860
not bad while the creator great,

503
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:48,130
his constellation set and the well
balanced world on hinges hung.

504
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,900
It's,
it's almost too much for this poet.

505
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:56,210
He's already been playing around with
the temporality of the poem as we've seen

506
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,400
establishing a fiction that works to,

507
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,640
to place him at the scene of an activity
that obviously occurs 1600 years and

508
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:08,390
change, uh, before his
own, before his own birth.

509
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,160
But it's almost as if Milton were tempted
now to make himself go even further

510
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,360
back to write a humble load that he
could place at the feet of the creator,

511
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,870
the Creator at the moment of the
actual creation of the entire universe,

512
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,190
that the stakes of coming first seem to
get, uh, are getting higher and higher.

513
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,740
And before long,
the speaker realizes that,

514
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,850
that this fantasy and it is a fantasy
that he's been engaged in is starting to

515
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:36,230
sound a little.
And even to Milton,

516
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:39,560
it's a stat sounding a little
extreme or maybe a little dangerous.

517
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:44,910
In in line one 34 Milton indicates that
this holy song has enwrapped his fancy,

518
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,780
that it has in some perilous
way absorbed his imagination.

519
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:56,600
For if such holy song and
wrap our fancy long time,

520
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:01,601
we'll run back and fetch the age of gold
and speckled vanity will sicken soon

521
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,300
and die and Lup ricin will
melt from earthly mold and
hell itself will pass away

522
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,650
and leave her dollar us
mansions to the piering day.

523
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,230
The Holy Song Milton has been describing
is beginning to look almost too

524
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:20,210
tempting even to contemplate.

525
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:24,410
There's almost a danger here and listening
to it too long or describing it into

526
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:28,970
in too much detail and the danger seems
we're at Milton thinks of as the perils

527
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:33,971
seems to involve the problem of time for
if such holy song in rap our fancy long

528
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,160
then then we'll mistakenly convinced
yourselves that that time could actually

529
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,040
run backwards and that we'd
been returned to the Golden Age,

530
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:47,000
the very first age of human history.
According to classical legend.

531
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,100
We, of course know as we, as we
read the prelude to this poem, that,

532
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,890
that this is a work consumed with,

533
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,430
with questions of temporal disjunction
with that problem of temporal

534
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,840
discontinuity.

535
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,460
Milton clearly wants us to know that this
naitivity owed was written by a young

536
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:06,260
Londoner in 16,
29,

537
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:11,950
but it's a poem that is at the same
time deliverable to the infant Christ by

538
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:14,900
some extraordinary violation,
of course,

539
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:17,480
of all of the established
laws of temporal sequence.

540
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,370
And when you reread this poem, um,
and, uh, and you look at it, uh,

541
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:27,470
in your section, perhaps you may
want to think about the tenses.

542
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,360
It sounds tedious, but, but it's, I,
I'm convinced that it's not tedious.

543
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:34,400
The tenses of the verbs
that Milton's using.

544
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:39,140
Milton is switching here from
present to past to future, um,

545
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,590
incredibly rapidly and really what the
bewildering kind of facility and it's in

546
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:46,770
some points impossible I think
for the reader to tell whether he,

547
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,890
the poet is discussing
something that's happening now,

548
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,370
something that's happened a long time ago
or something that will happen at some,

549
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,210
uh,
at the,

550
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,210
at the end of time that the matic problems
that Milton is attempting to tackle

551
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,510
are written into the very grammar
and the syntax of the poem.

552
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:09,060
Now, Milton understands the problems
besetting the poems, what we can think of,

553
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,040
the poems,
confused temporality.

554
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:15,540
He understands it's a lot better than
we do and there's a self consciousness

555
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,890
about the temporal strangeness of
this Poem That Leads I think, uh,

556
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,190
to its crisis moment. Look
at, look at stands a 16.

557
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,330
This is the stance of the
begins with line one 50.

558
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:35,040
Milton has just been entertaining the
glorious moment of the apocalypse at the

559
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,760
end of time because he's always looking
out further and further and further

560
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:39,594
ahead.

561
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,260
He's been doing that when we get this
line one 50 but why is this FAPE says,

562
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:49,350
no,
this must not yet be.

563
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:54,351
So the babe lies yet in smiling infancy
that on the bitter cross must redeem our

564
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:00,720
loss.
So both himself and us to glorify.

565
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,790
But why is this? Fate says no, this
must not yet be. So it's, it's,

566
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:09,270
it's here that we have something like a
crystallizing moment of reality testing.

567
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,110
Milton, he checks himself
reality, true intrudes,

568
00:37:13,111 --> 00:37:16,770
and the poet has no choice but to say,
no, you've gone too far. Okay, John,

569
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:21,240
you've gone too far on your anticipation
of the future event. At the end of the,

570
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,230
at the end of time,
fate will permit no apocalypse before,

571
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,400
before its time,

572
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:30,030
before the necessary and painful
steps that have to lead up to the,

573
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,410
to the last judgment.

574
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,410
But for the ecstatic fulfillment
of all of Christian history,

575
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:35,640
the Great Christian narrative,

576
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,140
Jesus actually of course has to to
to grow up and lead his life and then

577
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,360
sacrifice that life on the bitter cross.

578
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,250
In eluding to the,
to the Prophet Isiah and the prelude,

579
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:51,690
Milton suggested that the iniquity
of his lips had to be purged,

580
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:57,050
purged off a burned off
with the live coal, uh,

581
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,380
supplied by a Sarah from
one of those or a Saraf, uh,

582
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,160
one of those sins.
Uh,

583
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,240
one of those sins I think that needs
to be purged is clearly the sin of

584
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,740
eagerness or over anticipation that the
drive to move ahead of oneself and the

585
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,740
drive to get ahead of others as we saw
Milton trying to do with the three wise

586
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:17,220
men.

587
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,780
These are drives that the poem seems to
be struggling to keep in check or that

588
00:38:21,781 --> 00:38:22,800
Milton is representing.

589
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,340
The poem is struggling to keep
in check or to purge in some way,

590
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,430
but there's something else
that needs to be purged. Uh,

591
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,260
and the poem recognizes that even
more profoundly than naitivity owed is

592
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:39,670
continually presenting the
speaker with temptations,

593
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:43,840
with incitements to sin, that, that,
that need to be purged from the speakers.

594
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:44,674
Poetic Voice.

595
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,800
The final section of the palm presents
us with the most powerful temptation that

596
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:54,880
John Milton, uh, can confront. And we
will find that this is a problem that, uh,

597
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,310
continues for the rest
of his writing life. Um,

598
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,240
he will have to do battle with
this sim temptation forever.

599
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,960
And this is the temptation
offered by classical literature.

600
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,360
You remember that Milton had vowed to his
friend Charles Dod and the LG six that

601
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:12,850
he would,
that he would become an epic poet someday,

602
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,950
and that he was taking all
of the necessary steps to
transform himself into an

603
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:18,784
epic poet.

604
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,540
But it's strictly a Christian epic poem
that Milton seems to imagine himself as

605
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:30,970
writing. Now, he hasn't yet settled on
the, on the, on the topic of the fall,

606
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,040
the fall of Adam and eve from the,

607
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,370
from their place of bliss and
garden and the Garden of Eden.

608
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,370
But Milton knows that the general feeling
of the thing is of course going to be

609
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:43,480
Christian. And he's probably taking as
his model at this point, the Italian poet,

610
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,670
a Toric Quato Taso who,

611
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:50,740
who wrote Jerusalem delivered a Christian
a slightly earlier Christian epic

612
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:53,560
poem, Romance epic poem
that Milton greatly admired.

613
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
But Milton's also sensitive to the fact
that the very phrase Christian epic is

614
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:04,450
in some way a contradiction in terms.
The epic form is a, is a classical,

615
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:05,500
it's a pagan form.

616
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,970
It's a poem structured around
the interaction between
human beings and the and

617
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:14,971
an entire Pantheon of pagan deities and
to write any kind of epic at all might

618
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:20,551
very well seem to be embracing and in
an inappropriate sensual inappropriately

619
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:26,500
sensual paganism at the expense of
the higher discipline of monotheistic,

620
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:31,300
good old fashioned monotheistic Chris
Christianity and, and the Ode to the form,

621
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,320
the form that this poem is written in
[inaudible] is a pagan form invented by

622
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:40,321
the Greek poet Pindar to express the
sublimity of emotion arising from a

623
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:45,280
contemplation of the actions of the gods.
Now in writing to,

624
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,920
in writing in these John was, Milton is,
is of course confronted with a dilemma.

625
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,140
He's a humanist scholar.
He is more steeped in the century,

626
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,980
was beauty of classical literature,

627
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,040
the classical tradition than probably
anyone else of his generation.

628
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,430
Since he was an unusually small lad,

629
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,840
he had been mainlining,
a Greek and Roman poetry,

630
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,250
the the language of homer.

631
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,280
And Virgil and if Pindar and have often
had become an inextricable part of,

632
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,570
of his literary imagination of and
of his consciousness in general.

633
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,220
But Milton was also beginning
to develop in this period, uh,

634
00:41:23,221 --> 00:41:26,890
a much more strict to much more
disciplined religious temperament.

635
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,920
He was beginning to join ranks with those
early 17th century English Protestants

636
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,680
who imposed upon themselves rigorous
and strict codes of behavior and self

637
00:41:37,981 --> 00:41:42,230
denial and who are increasingly being
called by their enemies puritans.

638
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,340
And it's possible that the very idea of
a puritan poet presented Milton with,

639
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,660
with what may have felt like it,
like an insoluble conflict. It,

640
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,790
it's possible that the
Milton would continue. Well,

641
00:41:58,791 --> 00:41:59,330
if,

642
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:04,330
if Milton were to continue this
cultivation of a poetic career career,

643
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:09,260
he would clearly have to purge. This is,
this is the miltonic logic at this stage.

644
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,190
He would have to purge his poetic
Voice of the sin and the taint of Pagan

645
00:42:13,191 --> 00:42:16,430
antiquity. If he was going to become
a specifically Christian poet,

646
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,520
he would have to expelled from his system.

647
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,780
The sensual world of classical learning
that for him was at the very core of his

648
00:42:23,781 --> 00:42:24,614
being.

649
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,230
And it's precisely a silencing
of classical literature
that Milton is attempting

650
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:34,250
to affect here with this scene of the
flight of the Pagan Gods at the naitivity

651
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,084
of Christ.

652
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,240
Milton is also depicting a scenario that
I think on some level he's hoping will

653
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:44,240
occur within himself.
We have the silencing,

654
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:47,870
not just to any literature here,
but, but of Pagan literature.

655
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,080
It's now the pagan deities who
have turned into infant gods.

656
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:56,600
They have been, Eh, Milton is, uh,

657
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:00,470
is narrating or representing the
process by which they are silenced.

658
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:04,590
They're rendered speechless
or dumb, and the poem, uh,

659
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,640
effects this process in order to give
someone else an opportunity to speak.

660
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,960
Milton calls upon a whole range
of, of violence, exciting,

661
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:17,690
militaristic images and
set pieces to describe the,

662
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,190
the triumph of Christ over the
petty gods of paganism. But this,

663
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,970
this routing of the gods
brings with it a certain cost.

664
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:31,190
Something is lost here as
well. Uh, look at line one 81.

665
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:37,550
These are without hands down. These are
the these for me, these are the best,

666
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,720
the best lines in the poem,
the lonely mountains or,

667
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,410
and the resoundingly
shore of Voice of weeping,

668
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:49,280
heard and loud lament from haunted spring.

669
00:43:49,281 --> 00:43:53,210
And Dale edged with poplar peo,
that parting genius.

670
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:58,510
It's with sighing sent with flour and
in woven tresses torn the nymphs in

671
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:06,120
twilight shade of Tangle
thickets. Mourn. It's,

672
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:09,770
it's here in this stands a
field with the resounding, uh,

673
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:13,940
voices of weeping and lament that we
realized that something more is going on

674
00:44:13,941 --> 00:44:15,860
than merely a routing of the pagan gods.

675
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:19,970
Something more even than Milton's pious
triumph over his classical literary

676
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,350
imagination.
Uh,

677
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,820
suddenly the literary genre that Milton
writing is writing in is no longer this

678
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,840
triumphant classical owed.
You have an elegy here,

679
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:34,841
a beautiful and lament for
something or someone lost.

680
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:40,410
And, and, and we have to ask ourselves,
could this be a paradise lost?

681
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,350
We hear a clear morning for,

682
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:47,370
for those pagan beings who are forced to
depart because of the violent onset of

683
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:48,270
Christianity.

684
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:53,340
When Milton writes that the
parting genius is with signs sent,

685
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:56,610
he means the genius Loci or the
the local spirit of the place,

686
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,020
the natural spirit of a place.

687
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:02,340
Those beneficence beings that pay pagans
had believed inhabited certain woods

688
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,174
and streams.

689
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:09,030
But the parting genius is also a
part of Milton's own genius. His,

690
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:10,260
his literary genius,

691
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:15,261
that aspect of his literary career and
his literary expertise that has been

692
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,400
nourished and fed,
um,

693
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,080
lovingly fed by,
by classical literature.

694
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,670
The conflictedness that Milton
is encapsulating here is, uh,

695
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,970
is probably most intense
in the last lines of this,

696
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,530
of this wonderful stanza with flour
and woven tresses torn the nymphs in

697
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:38,910
twilight shade of tangled thickets.
Mourn this,

698
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,850
and I'm almost done here.
The densely tangled thicket of costs,

699
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:46,200
clustered consonants in this, in this
amazing couplet is a signal to us of the,

700
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:50,370
of the weight of the import
of this terrible event.

701
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,090
That these are difficult
lines physically to read.

702
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:57,480
And they may very well be the most
painful lines in the, in the entire poem.

703
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,560
From an emotional perspective,
it's, it's one thing, uh,

704
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,910
for the evil pagan deities
like Mo lock and Payor, uh,

705
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:09,900
to be forced into hell by the
newly newly born Christ, uh,

706
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:14,640
who are they to us? We find it
difficult to be whale their absence,

707
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:16,710
but the Nymphs,

708
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,630
the Nymphs in all of their sensuous
beauty with flour and woven dresses,

709
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,540
they have to experience the same fate.

710
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:30,140
And I think it's impossible not to wince
when we imagine the painful tearing of

711
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,040
the nymphs tresses.

712
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,170
Their hair gets caught on the tangled
thickets of the forest as the abandoned

713
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:41,790
the cloud as they are forced to abandon
the classical corners of Milton's

714
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:45,540
literary imagination.
That the Lhi tone of some of the,

715
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:50,310
of this final section of the poem
should give us some clues to the type of

716
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:54,900
victory over paganism that Christ's
birth is actually heralding here. Um,

717
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,640
how new, uh, will this new
world order actually be?

718
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:03,870
We may imagine that hence forth now that
he has written is Nate naitivity owed.

719
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:09,000
Milton has fully explored
expunged from his literary system,

720
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:13,800
that youthful attachment to the
pagan classics. But of course,

721
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:15,750
no object of our love this,

722
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:20,520
this is true of all of us can ever be
rejected with an absolute finality.

723
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,820
The explosion of Paganism described in
the Nativity Nativity owed is a scene

724
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:30,280
that Milton we'll return to
and return to again and again,

725
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:34,990
and in many ways it will be Christianity's
triumph over paganism and all of the

726
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:39,991
pain that that triumph produces that
will become the hidden subtext of,

727
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,520
of many of Milton's greatest works.
