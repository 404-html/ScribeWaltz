1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,561
Listen,

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:06,240
this is probably the most difficult
poem that we'll be reading all semester.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,280
Um, but as I mentioned briefly in
the, in the last class, the, this,

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,660
the notorious difficulties attending this,

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,280
this poem seem to have very little to
do with Milton's grief over the death of

6
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:24,890
Edward King, which, which may well not
have been all that troubled, uh, or,

7
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,500
or a co or complicated. We
have no, we have no evidence.

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,580
And I mentioned this before,

9
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:34,010
that there was a particularly close
relation between these two young men. Uh,

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,320
the difficulty of the poem
lies to a great degree, I think

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,240
in something that Dr. Johnson had noted
in his attack or in his criticism on

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,720
listen to us that, that I, that I
mentioned on Monday, it's difficult.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,040
It's difficult to lies in Milton's
tendency in this poem to seek out what

14
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:57,510
wonderfully Dr. Johnson
calls remote illusions.

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,120
The,
um,

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,120
this is by far the most learned and the
most demanding lyric poem that Milton

17
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,850
Rights. It's a home deeply invested in
the tradition of, of, of pastoral poetry,

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,350
pastoral poetry from a
theocracy and virginal onward.

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,960
It's a palm deeply invested.
In fact,

20
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:23,150
in the entire Western tradition
of poetry in general. And,

21
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,090
and finally,

22
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:28,710
I think it can be said that it's a poem
who's deepest investment is actually in

23
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:33,711
Milton's mastery over the entire
Western tradition of literature.

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,970
Milton, and this is, this
will be the working assumption
that I bring to this. Uh,

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,530
my,
I bring to my reading of,

26
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,630
of this poem Milton sets out to prove
something enlisted us and the most

27
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:48,780
important thing that he proves his,

28
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:53,460
his control over the learning
that he has accumulated.

29
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,860
Now, I spoke last time of that
familiar sense of, of hesitation,

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:03,660
that apology with which Milton
had opened the elegy. Um, we, we,

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,120
we hear in the 1637 listen to us,

32
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:10,560
those same cries of unrighteousness and
underprepared preparation that we had

33
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:14,490
heard in the, in the 1631
Sonnet, how soon? Half the time,

34
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:15,680
the subtle piece of youth

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,960
when Milton opens listed us with
it. That phrase, yet once more,

36
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:25,410
one of the things that he's telling
the reader is that yet, once more,

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,340
yet once more, he'll be making
the same argument for unreadiness.

38
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,030
The same argument for nervous anticipation
that he's made a number of times

39
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:36,750
before.
And so as a way of understanding the,

40
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,030
what at this point is really the sheer
repetitiveness repetitiveness of this

41
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,360
disclaimer, I want to propose,
I want to propose a metaphor.

42
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,810
I propose that we think of Milton at
the opening of Lucentis as being stuck,

43
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,700
stuck at a particular
point in the imagined,

44
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:01,000
the projected or fantasize
trajectory of his career. And He,

45
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,280
and I'm using the word stuck of course,
because the lady had been stuck. Uh, so,

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,020
so, so famously and so
prominently in Comas. Uh, you,

47
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,150
you may remember that I had suggested
in the lecture on the Nativity, Yo,

48
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,430
that Milton may have thought of his career
as if it were something like a race.

49
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,550
And I think here that the particular
image of a career as a race still still

50
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:29,170
holds, uh, but with a little bit of
a difference. What seems so obvious,

51
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,080
at least to me here in
reading lists of this,

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,930
is that at this point in 1637,

53
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,310
there's a stumbling block or a hurdle
that Milton in his race simply can't get

54
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:47,590
over. No. The, the, the surest
sign of a hurdle is, is,

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,513
uh,

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,070
is one of those pointed literary
illusions that Milton makes enlisted us,

57
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,760
one of those remote illusions that
Johnson had complained about and it's an

58
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:02,020
illusion that has everything to do with
Milton's own sense of his unreadiness

59
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,440
and I'm thinking of that. Oh,
it's just, it's wonderful.

60
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,160
That strange moment that happens
fairly early on in the poem.

61
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:13,780
This is line 76 in the Hughes edition,
it's page 122.

62
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,523
Okay.

63
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,710
It's that moment in which Phoebus
Apollo makes a sudden and unexpected

64
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:26,310
appearance and then now not only does
feed this Apollo make a sudden appearance,

65
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:31,290
but he seems actually to interrupt the
speaker of the poem in order to correct

66
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:35,040
him now. So, so we'll, we'll let, let's
remind ourselves what's been happening.

67
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,940
Milton has just been lamenting the
fact that the laborious days of the,

68
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:43,590
of the poet might not result in a
sudden blaze of fame. What good is it?

69
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,330
You'll remember what good is it?

70
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:49,100
Milton has to tend the high
homely slided shepherds trade.

71
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,420
That's of course the vocation of poetry.

72
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,170
It's that shepherd poet is just going
to be struck down in his prime is Edward

73
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,003
King.
Had been.

74
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,530
And you'll remember that
Milton had complained that
the thin spun life could be

75
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:05,910
so easily slipped. But,
but look at line 76.

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,790
Yeah,

77
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,260
but not the praise.

78
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,090
Phoebus replied and
touched my trembling ears.

79
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,670
Okay. Uh, what, what's
happened? Uh, Vivas Apollo,

80
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,760
the god of the sun and not
unimportantly also the god of poetry.

81
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,950
He was Apollo bursts into the
text and correct the poet.

82
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,500
Correct. The poet's youthful
interest in earthly fame.

83
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,480
Fame is no plant that grows on mortal
soil. True fame exists only in heaven.

84
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,520
The only reputation that matters is the
praise you ultimately receive from God

85
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:49,130
or all judging jove as he
pronounces. Lastly, on each deed,

86
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,080
and as in all of these early
lyrics, jove, uh, conventionally,

87
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:58,280
throughout the renaissance,
um, is, is used as a,

88
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,070
as a name within these
classical fictions, uh, to, to,

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,610
to signify the Christian God.

90
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,000
Now this moment is striking
in part because we had no
idea how could we possibly

91
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,540
have had an idea that FIBA is,

92
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,400
Apollo was actually eaves
dropping on the poet's discourse.

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,080
I think we're taken aback here.
Were taken aback by the, the,

94
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,130
the rude interruption in the otherwise
seamless flow of the poets lament.

95
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,640
But the poet, the, the, the,

96
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,360
this moment is also striking
because Milton has lifted it,

97
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,860
lifted this entire scene of this
interruption from somewhere else.

98
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:41,690
He has taken it from one of the
pastoral poems, a Virgil, the, the,

99
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,930
the image of a poet interrupted and
chided by the god of poetry comes straight

100
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:51,760
out of the opening of Virgil's
six ECT Gluck. And Virgil was,

101
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,190
Virgil had written a poem in the six
that clog that had touched Melton and it

102
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,600
had touched Milton I think because
it begins with Virgil's own brooding

103
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,090
meditation on the course
of his poetic career.

104
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,340
Now we all know what Virgil's poetic
career would go on to look like.

105
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,550
Virtual would go on to
be a great epic poet. Um,

106
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,020
but not until after he had written these
pastoral at blogs. And then after that,

107
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,300
after he had written the Georgic poems,

108
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:24,620
only then does he write finally
the great epic poem, the Aeneid.

109
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,630
Now in Virgil's early
poem, this, this six blog,

110
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:33,170
the speaker explains that the writing
of pastoral poetry is this stuff that,

111
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,580
that young poets do.

112
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,980
Poets begin their careers
with easy pastoral poems, but,

113
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,180
but virtual speaker says that he's
more ambitious. Now he's starting to,

114
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,570
to champ at the bit.

115
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:50,330
He's ready to write an epic poem on much
more important subjects then that then

116
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:54,500
shepherds and shepherdess is he
wants to write about kings and wars.

117
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:59,400
And as soon as he has expressed
this epic ambition, uh,

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,050
virtual explains, as soon as he's
expressed this Phoebus Apollo,

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,060
the god of poetry stepped in
and chided him. So this is, uh,

120
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,771
this is virtual.

121
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:13,970
When I was feigned to sing of
kings and battles the Sinthian God,

122
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:18,860
that's Phoebus Apollo
plucked my ear and warned me.

123
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,330
Apollo warns Virgil that a pastoral poet
simply shouldn't overstep his bounds.

124
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,790
Uh, this is the Virgil,
he should sing thin,

125
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,500
little find spawn maize and he should
be content feeding is fat sheep.

126
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,020
The God told Virgil that he wasn't
ready yet for the manly, the adult,

127
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,610
uh, the public world, the
important world of epic poetry.

128
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,190
And so all of this anxiety, and when
you think of it, all of this shame,

129
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,210
uh, and, and, and as well as
the, the shame of ambition,

130
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:58,510
all of this gets packed into this illusion
to Virgil that Milton brings to this

131
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,040
very disturbing moment enlisted us.

132
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,090
And it's important I think that this
Virgilian scene with Apollo appears so

133
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:07,950
early in Milton's.

134
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,190
Milton's listed has Milton's
of this doesn't end up all
soaked in this unhealthy

135
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:19,311
brew of neurotic brew of anxiety
and shame and naked and ambition.

136
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,620
And I think it's one of our jobs here
to figure out why that's the why that's

137
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:28,560
the case. Why doesn't, this is
one way of putting the question,

138
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,550
why doesn't Apollo harass or bother
Milton at the end of Lucentis in the same

139
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,220
way that he arrests as Milton
at the poems beginning.

140
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,980
Now I,
um,

141
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,450
I think you may be rather happy to
hear that this is the last time.

142
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,080
I'm pretty sure that this is the last
time that we will have to discuss at least

143
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:52,914
at any length.

144
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,890
Milton's worries about his unreadiness
and his and his and preparation. It's,

145
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,160
it's safe to say that,
listen,

146
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,690
this is one of the last poetic works
of Milton's that's really consumed with

147
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:04,291
this problem,

148
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,550
the problem of fruitless anticipation
and in some ways I think that that's

149
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:13,551
because the poem was it us seems in some
ways to solve the problem of Milton's

150
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:20,010
weightings and this problem
that he has a meeting to wait.

151
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,610
And so one of the things that
needs to be explored here is why.

152
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Why this poem is the last poem that
Milton is not prepared to write.

153
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,790
What does Milton do? This is,
this is what I see as our project,

154
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,250
our interpretive project.
As we approached this poem,

155
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,640
what is Milton do to get himself
unstuck from this seat of anxious,

156
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,610
anxious,
anticipation?

157
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,450
That's the project.

158
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,320
So we looked,
we looked last time at the,

159
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:56,770
at the oddity that peculiarity
of Milton's choice of genre here,

160
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:57,760
the pastorals genre.

161
00:10:57,761 --> 00:11:02,080
Milton was the only Cambridge poet
to honor Edward King in that memorial

162
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:07,081
anthology by writing a poem
in the pastoral mode and and,

163
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,680
and a and a pastoral of course
features shepherds and shepherd as, as,

164
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:13,600
as it's most distinguishing
characteristic.

165
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,670
The word pastoral comes from
the Latin Pastore store,

166
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,910
which literally means shepherd and Ulta
knew perfectly well how artificial his

167
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:29,650
use of the pastoral mode of poetry would
seem. And as well as how out of fashion,

168
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:31,300
how completely outdated it would seem.

169
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,970
But one of the motives
for a selection of this,

170
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:38,770
John or the pastoral
genre is the tradition and
institution that goes all the

171
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:43,240
way back to theocracy and Virgil
that associates shepherds with poets,

172
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,070
and this has always been a part of the
pastoral genre to speak of shepherds and

173
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:48,610
shepherding.

174
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,610
And a pastoral poem seems
almost invariably to a
strategy or a way to speak of

175
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:58,450
poets and their craft of poetry.
This is,

176
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,510
this is a kind of literary
self consciousness that, that,

177
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,610
that we're all familiar with.

178
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,900
But there's another meaning
given to shepherds as well.

179
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,350
After the longs way of the awkwardness is,

180
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,220
and Virgil's pastorals of course,
Christianity entered the scene,

181
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,620
a new dispensation and Christianity
began to load this pastoral literary

182
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:24,940
tradition with its own set
of associations. Shepherds
came to resent you.

183
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,230
Separate came to represent not only poets,

184
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,180
they came to stand for ministers.

185
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:35,560
They came to signify allegorically
ministers as well. So priests,

186
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,150
ministers or pastors,
we still call them pastors,

187
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,530
had long been referred to as as shepherds,
they are leaders of their flocks.

188
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,900
And so it seemed a natural move for early
Christian writers to use this existing

189
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,290
pastoral form when they wanted to
speak on the subject of, of, of,

190
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,250
of priests or ministers
or affairs of the church.

191
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,480
So Milton is essentially inheriting
both of these traditions,

192
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,620
both of these sets of associations with
costs, with pastoral poetry, and, and we,

193
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:11,710
when we consider the particular
circumstances that occasioned the poem,

194
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:17,590
listen it. So we can see why
Milton I think chose this
pastoral form. Edward King,

195
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,450
the, uh, the, the young man,

196
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:24,451
the [inaudible] deceased was a minor
poet on his way to begin his career as a

197
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,090
minister. And the, and the
figure of the shepherd,

198
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:33,091
the past store fuses into one person
or into one w one figurative entity.

199
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,030
Both of these callings,

200
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,830
the vocation of the poet and the
vocation of the minister. We've looked,

201
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,400
we've looked before it,
Milton's reason of church government.

202
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:50,401
That's the political treatise written
in 1642 and we've seen Milton's account

203
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:54,760
thereof of how he had attempted
to reconcile on the one hand,

204
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:59,380
his obligation to become a minister and
his desire on the other hand to become a

205
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:04,240
poet. Um, but I, I want to back up
now because I think it's important,

206
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:04,930
uh,

207
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,930
to fill in a little bit of the historical
context behind that long but important

208
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,720
pros. Treatus it's not a, it's not
irrelevant to our understanding of,

209
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,623
of listeners.

210
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,150
The subject of the reason of church
government is the hierarchical Milton's

211
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:26,410
feelings about the hierarchical structure
of the Church of England in the early

212
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,830
years of the English revolution,
one of the hottest flashpoints of,

213
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,510
of political contention was the,

214
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,830
what's the degree of appropriate
state involvement in the church?

215
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,020
And as with almost all of the issues of
contemporary and political struggle in

216
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:45,130
the 17th century, Milton's own views
really fall decidedly to the left,

217
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,290
to the progressive end of the political
spectrum. And so beginning in the late,

218
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,500
late, late 1630s, when at
the, at the moment in which
listed us as being written,

219
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:59,501
Milton is becoming increasingly
radical and we can think of it,

220
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,370
I mean this is an acronystic term,

221
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:05,570
but increasingly leftist and he's becoming
one of those figures that we can now

222
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,020
identify with this label of Puritan.

223
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,780
Yeah.

224
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,830
Puritans at this moment in English
history, replacing more and more emphasis

225
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,460
when thinking about how things should,
uh,

226
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,650
yeah,

227
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,730
work at church more and
more emphasis on the sermon.

228
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,200
The institution of the sermon,

229
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,970
the act of preaching sermons for puritans
was becoming more important actually

230
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:34,170
than following the ceremonial rituals
of the, uh, of the Church of England.

231
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:39,450
So when the years just before 1637, the
English court, uh, under James the first,

232
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:42,800
and then later under Charles the
first, uh, the, the, uh, the,

233
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:47,801
the English crown had been cracking down
on the delivery of puritan sermons in

234
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:53,470
the church. It's 1633, um,

235
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,030
William law had been appointed the,
the Archbishop of Canterbury,

236
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:02,031
and he had been granted an extraordinary
set of arbitrary powers of suppression

237
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,420
actually, uh, by the
monarch. And his mission,

238
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:10,480
Lord took his mission as the head
of the Church of England to be

239
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,610
the squelching have this
puritan opposition. And, and,

240
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:21,611
and the most outrageous action in Lodz
crackdown was his move to ban his attempt

241
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:27,120
to ban preaching, uh, in, in, in churches.

242
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,570
So under archbishop laud
only the official liturgy,

243
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,430
it could be recited in church. As you can
imagine, there's, uh, there's, there's,

244
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,000
this was controversial, uh, a
struggle breaks out in the church.

245
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,530
And Milton naturally takes the puritan
position in favor of preaching.

246
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,500
The church shouldn't be under
the control of the bishops.

247
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:51,440
This is Milton's argument or prelates a
common 17th century word for admissions.

248
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,660
But the church should be led by preachers,

249
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,800
men who were chosen by their
congregations to preach.

250
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:02,280
And eventually this is where we get
the notion of, of congregationalism.

251
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,200
So given all of the controversies
raging around the question of the proper

252
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:10,230
government of the church,
and Milton is deeply invested in these,

253
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,520
in these matters,

254
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,710
Milton Milton feels obliged
to do something. And, and,

255
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,100
and this is the,

256
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,020
this is one of the reasons that he
writes the reason of church government,

257
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:23,130
this intense sense of,

258
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,370
of obligation that he feels he feels duty
bound to participate materially rather

259
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:31,680
than in this, in this, uh,

260
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,030
political and the political controversy
rather than merely remaining in his

261
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:39,840
studious retirement, however pleasant
that is at his father's house.

262
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,440
And were Milton not to, to fight in some
way to defend when he takes to be the,

263
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:48,150
to church. He would simply
not be investing those talents
that God had given him.

264
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:52,980
This is the, this is the miltonic logic
that we're, that we're familiar with.

265
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,350
So this is the situation that Milton finds
himself in as he's riding. Listen us,

266
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,770
he's under the greatest pressure of his
life to do something with his talent.

267
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,640
He wants,
of course,

268
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,450
at least we assume that he's still
want that he wants to be a poet.

269
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,890
But at the same time,
he fears that being a poet means,

270
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,980
and this is a fear that literate young
men and women have have to this very day

271
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,390
to be a poet means in some way not to
be acting responsibly or or politically

272
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,380
soso. Milton explains in the reason
of church government, he tries to,

273
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,580
he tries to mend this breach
and so we argues in the,

274
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:35,610
in this treatise that po poetry has,
and I'm quoting him here,

275
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:40,350
poetry has a power beside
the office of the pulpit.

276
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,240
Milton even claims that poetry is equal
to preaching and its ability to move

277
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:49,680
people, to get them to do
something, to make things
happen in the world. Of course,

278
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:52,500
this is a lot of pressure to put on
poetry and it's especially in a lot of

279
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:57,270
pressure to put on a pastoral log
that's ostensibly about shepherds,

280
00:18:57,271 --> 00:18:59,010
[inaudible],
shepherds and sheep,

281
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,520
but it is the duty of this poem lists
of this to show that poetry can exert a

282
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:07,560
power beside the office of the pulpit,

283
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,480
that it can do the same kind of work
that a preacher is able to accomplish

284
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,310
behind the behind the pulpit.

285
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,050
Milton has to develop a poetic voice
that can actually combine those two

286
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:21,480
vocations that the two offices,

287
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:24,330
the though the office of poetry
and the Office of Ministry.

288
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,950
And if we want to think of it in, in the,
in the more familiar domestic context,

289
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,570
uh,

290
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,570
Milton has to begin a career that can
please both himself and his and his

291
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:37,860
father. Now, last time when I,

292
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:41,580
I mentioned the dramatic
structure of this poem,

293
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,780
you'll remember it
features a succession of,

294
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,720
of four mourners and each of these and
mourners we could think of each of these

295
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,290
mourners providing Milton with an
opportunity to try out a different voice.

296
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:58,170
But one of the voices
utterly mops the floor with,

297
00:19:58,171 --> 00:19:59,870
with, with all of the others. Um,

298
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,990
it stands far outside that certainly it
stands outside the generally pastoral

299
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:07,890
framework of, of the poem.
Uh, the most striking,

300
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:12,720
the most powerful of all of the morning
morning voices here is that of Saint

301
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:12,750
Peter.

302
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,750
This is the figure that Milton refers
to in line 109 as the pilot of the

303
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,730
Galilean Lake.
Now what Saint Peter doing in this poem,

304
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,040
the very mention of Saint
Peter naturally violates the,

305
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:31,260
the classical pastoral fiction
of, of the poem. Up to this point,

306
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:33,630
the Christian God has
been referred to as Joe.

307
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,690
That's how the poem works since
it's within the pagan world,

308
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:42,990
the pagan fictional world of the classical
pastoral that this Christian poem is,

309
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,273
is set,

310
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
but to speak both of Jove and of Christ
is obviously in some ways to mix your

311
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:52,300
metaphors and, and, and,

312
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:56,760
and the effect can only be disorienting
that the character of Peter, uh,

313
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,810
brought directly out of the New Testament.

314
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,870
It's really slicing through the poems
victim veneer and Peter Cutts a figure so

315
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:09,181
daunting and so terrifying that were
almost led to forget that the poem where

316
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:12,730
reading is a pastoral LG at all.

317
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,750
So unbelievable is Peter's discourse.
Okay.

318
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,920
Line 109.

319
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,810
Okay,

320
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,700
last came in.

321
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,710
Last did go the pilot of the
Galilean link to Massey keys.

322
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:30,050
He bore of Metals Twain, the golden
opes. The iron shuts the main,

323
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,390
he shook his mitered blocks
and stern bisque bake.

324
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,750
Now this is important to Milton.

325
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:41,290
This is decidedly the last
of all the funeral mourners.

326
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,030
And Peter Provides Milton's poem
with an important element of,

327
00:21:45,031 --> 00:21:46,870
of finality of have closure.

328
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,040
Peter wields the keys of the Kingdom of
Heaven and can open and shut the doors

329
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:56,041
at personal salvation just as he can
open and shut the doors of the church.

330
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,730
But it's the,
that's his function,

331
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,910
but it's the sentiments that Peter Routers
that I think most powerfully grab us

332
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:09,820
and they grab us because
they are so angry.

333
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,760
They're so violent in their anger
as the head of the true church.

334
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,150
Peter's voicing here his disgust that
the virtuous Edward King soon to become a

335
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:20,320
minister had been lost at sea.

336
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,120
Okay.

337
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,920
Think of the logic of
what Peter is saying here.

338
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:26,950
He would gladly have traded dozens.

339
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,750
He would have traded dozens of corrupt
Anglican ministers for the simple and

340
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,650
honest king.

341
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Look at line one 13 this is where Peter
is addressing Edward King himself.

342
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,590
How well could I have spared for the
young Swain enough of such as for their

343
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:49,090
bellies sake, creep and intrude
and climbing to the fold.

344
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,910
Th the corrupt clergy up today,

345
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:56,080
the under the Mullein influence of the
horrible archbishop laud are interested

346
00:22:56,081 --> 00:23:00,550
only in satisfying their own grief. And,
and in order to fill their own bellies.

347
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,030
So greedy or they, they, they
intruded into the churches,

348
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:07,600
fold and devour for themselves.
This is how the allegory works,

349
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:10,960
devour for themselves the nourishment
that of course they should be sharing with

350
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:11,794
their flock,

351
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,180
but this wish that this wish that other
shepherds had died and not Edward King

352
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,610
is, is so strange. You
can't deny it. And it's,

353
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,940
there is something here of a
kind of in decorous tone of,

354
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,650
of malice that the priests and the
prevalence of the church are so corrupt

355
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,460
according to,
uh,

356
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,680
according to Saint Peter that we're led
to assume almost not that this is the

357
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,030
direct charge, but implicitly I think
this is what Peter is conveying.

358
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:46,330
It's almost as if they're responsible
for Edward King's as if by creeping into

359
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,481
the churches fold,

360
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:52,400
somehow they've managed to
push poor Edward King out
of the fold. Uh, it's, it's,

361
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,360
it's a hint at the malevolent
agency of these priests,

362
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,340
and it should point us to the, the true
outrageousness of this, of this speech.

363
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,590
Maybe it's irrationality. We, we already
know that Edward King, of course,

364
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:09,120
he wasn't killed by the presence
of the Church of England.

365
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,070
He was drowned and the drowning was an
accident. The palm never questions that.

366
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:18,310
And it was ridiculous to lay his death
at the churches at the churches door.

367
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:21,510
But the poem nonetheless harbors this,

368
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,170
this wonderfully primitive and
irrational accusation. And, and,

369
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,920
and there's a lapse in logic here.

370
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,220
And this lab should focus our interest
all the more on the urgency that we feel

371
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:37,860
in Saint Peter's speech. This isn't just
a speech, this is a vitriolic tirade.

372
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,400
This and it gets ugly.
Uh,

373
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,410
Milton needs to get ugly here.
He needs to voice this tirade,

374
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,790
and he needs to write this politically
motivated harangue. And as you,

375
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,750
and as you'll see,

376
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,130
it starts to pick up more and
more enemies as it moves along.

377
00:24:55,131 --> 00:25:00,131
Look at line 119 blind mouths
that's scarce themselves.

378
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:04,910
Know how to hold a sheep hook or have
learned ought else the least that to the

379
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,400
faithful Herdman art belongs.

380
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,290
The faithful Herdman art enlisted as
is, uh, is a double one. It's the,

381
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:15,380
it's the Christian art of
ministering to a religious flock.

382
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,480
It's that of the pastor and it's the
more classical art of, of poetry.

383
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:25,481
And the man against whom Saint Peter's
is really spitting his venom are bad pass

384
00:25:26,131 --> 00:25:29,060
doors in every sense of the word.
They're, they're, they're corrupt,

385
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:33,020
not only as ministers, but they are also
corrupt as poets. They're bad poets.

386
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,910
Look at line 123.

387
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,950
These are such great and when they list,

388
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,740
okay,

389
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,220
and when they list their
lien and flashy songs,

390
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:53,310
great on their scrambled
pipes of rich and straw,

391
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,850
I have to read these lines again. And when
they list their lien and flashy songs,

392
00:25:57,851 --> 00:26:01,810
great on their scrambled
pipes of wretched straw,

393
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,900
it seems to be the case that
Milton's made this word up,

394
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,290
this wonderful word
scramble. The only, uh,

395
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,420
and it seems to mean
something like scrawny.

396
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:12,100
At least that's what the OED tells us.

397
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:14,830
And the only example that they
can find if the word scramble is,

398
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,310
is Milton's solicitous.
Um,

399
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:23,340
this last line that I've read seems
itself to have been graded on a honest

400
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,100
granel pipe.
It's,

401
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:29,860
it's such an unpleasant line and it's
always worth asking yourself what a line

402
00:26:29,861 --> 00:26:32,140
of poetry that is as aggressive,

403
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,550
aggressively unpleasant as this one
is doing in a poem. But this year,

404
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:41,551
cacophony of the clustered consonants in
this line sets off or has the potential

405
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:47,040
to set off a powerful,
a powerful cluster of feelings.

406
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,820
The anger here is directed
against the superficial,

407
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:55,110
the flashy liturgies are read
by the lobby and priests,

408
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,630
but I think it's also
being directed at the,

409
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,280
at the lean and flashy songs that are
being written by Milton's contemporary,

410
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,480
Milton's poetic contemporaries,
his rival poets,

411
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,750
Saint Saint Peter has arrived from heaven
into this poem to express perhaps for

412
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:16,761
the first time that envy and the anger
that Milton seems successfully to have

413
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:22,050
suppressed up to this
point. Um, envy and anger,

414
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:25,110
not only at the state of the,

415
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:29,910
of the Church of England in the late
1630s, but also the state of poetry.

416
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,560
And uh, in England at this
time. So Saint Peters,

417
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,420
St Peter Concludes with a co it goes on
and he concludes with a couple of that

418
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:44,220
is as terrifying and it's threaded.
Finality as it is for me,

419
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,780
utterly baffling in its significance.
Look at the last two lines,

420
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,960
but that two handed engine at the doors
stands ready to smile once and smite no

421
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:57,570
more. Now, we will never know

422
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:03,060
and don't let anyone ever suggest to
you that you will ever know what Milton

423
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:07,920
could possibly mean by this deliberately
perplexing image of the two handed

424
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:10,290
engine at the door.
If you ever want to take a look at the,

425
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,440
and I urge you to the Vario RM commentary
on the poems of John Milton in the CCO

426
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:19,970
collection, you should peruse it.
It's a massive, wonderful, uh,

427
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,600
multivolume work that catalogs all
of the critical commentary on Milton.

428
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:26,130
Shorter poems,
um,

429
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,160
up until some point in the 70s and there
are no less than 20 pages devoted to

430
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,420
the critical debate on these two lines.

431
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,660
What the Hell Saint Peter's two
handed engine is what it looks like,

432
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:44,280
what it tells us,
everything about it.

433
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:50,070
We have no idea what this
menacing contraption actually
is supposed to look like

434
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,390
or what it's actually intended to signify.
But we can now,

435
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:55,830
I think with some certainty

436
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,270
that it's not scramble.

437
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,460
It's size matters here and this,

438
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,490
the two handed engine is big and it
works and it's able to put an apocalyptic

439
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,630
and to all to all corruption.
And in fact,

440
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:19,350
it's able to put something like
an apocalyptic and to all life.

441
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,490
It stands ready to smile
once and smite no more.

442
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:24,931
Now,

443
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:28,590
we began this poem with a sense of the
dreary repetitiveness and that opening

444
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:31,620
phrase, yet once more, yet once more,

445
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,470
but here very close to the poems.

446
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:39,471
And we have a vision of an end to all
those fruitless exercise is a repetition.

447
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,090
Milton corrects.

448
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,120
It's as if he's correcting the sense
of monotony with which he had begun the

449
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:48,440
poem and he corrects that.
Uh,

450
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,710
he corrects that sense of monotony
by rewriting that initial phrase,

451
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:58,420
whatever the two handed engine is,

452
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,540
it will smite once and smite no more.

453
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,150
It's incapable of repeating
itself. Now, I think there's a,

454
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,210
there's a deliberate confusion here about
these lines because they're precise.

455
00:30:10,211 --> 00:30:14,200
Historical significance is, isn't
what's, isn't. What's most significant.

456
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,190
What may be most important here is the,

457
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,340
is the mere fact that Milton
is expressing these political,

458
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,390
these political convictions
at all. The, the,

459
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:28,090
the speech of the speech
of Saint Peter Seems,

460
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:33,091
I think in a lot of ways to be a lot more
like a fire and brimstone sermon than

461
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:37,660
it is a passage,
a passage in a pastoral poem.

462
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,020
And the strangely sermonising tone
that this speech assumes is a,

463
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:47,350
is I think exactly the point Milton
is able in this speech to combine,

464
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,370
I think,

465
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,930
to combine for the first time the two
associations borne by that Latin word

466
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,243
Pastore.

467
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:59,230
So in this guys with the mask of Saint
Peter on his Milton's able to be both

468
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:00,970
poet and minister,

469
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:05,971
he's investing his rhetorical talent in
an art that's actually doing something.

470
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:10,360
It's, it's capable of moving
people to action. Or, so
Milton, uh, may have believed,

471
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,330
it says, if Milton is saying, look
at me, I may be a poet. I May, uh,

472
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,150
I may actually, uh, I, I'm,

473
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:21,280
I'm simply writing a pastoral poem,

474
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,150
but I'm actually doing something in
the world. I'm minister into a flock.

475
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:30,151
I'm preaching just as my father and just
as all of my Cambridge classmates had

476
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:31,300
advised me to do.

477
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,240
This outburst allows Melton to solve
what may have seen up to this point,

478
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,590
an insoluble conflict,
the insoluble conflict between the,

479
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,140
the two meanings of the word vocation that
we've been, that we've been exploring.

480
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,680
So this passage is extreme and Milton's
poem wonderfully is perfectly able to

481
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:56,860
identify it as such. So look, look what
happens next. After the passengers over,

482
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:01,390
Milton addresses Alphaeus a river God,

483
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,650
the God who was noted for plunging the
course of his river underground in order

484
00:32:05,651 --> 00:32:10,600
to change chase, the new era who's, uh,
who had been turned into a fountain,

485
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,880
um, I'll face is also the god
of erotic pastoral poetry.

486
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,043
It turns out,

487
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,290
and this God has literally
gone underground during the
terrifying appearance of

488
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:25,600
Saint Peter and it's here, although
we didn't know that God was there.

489
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,410
This is another familiar and
strange feature of this problem.

490
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:31,840
We didn't know the God was there and
we didn't know he was underground until

491
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:35,380
Milton tells us that he's coming up.
Now it's here.

492
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:40,381
Once that speech is over that Milton
can bid Alphaeus return line 132 return,

493
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:47,261
I'll Fayez the dread voice is
past that shrunk by streams,

494
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:52,580
the dread voice of the
angry Surmont Milton,

495
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,810
the ministerial Milton has passed.

496
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:01,700
It has passed and it is past. It's
part of the, it's part of the past.

497
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,410
And it's at this point, and I think
it's importantly not before this point,

498
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,070
that Milton's able to throw himself
fully into that eroticized conjecture,

499
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,820
that catalog of all the flowers,

500
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:18,170
that that was to be thrown onto the
hearse bearing listed as his body that we

501
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:19,960
looked at last time.
I,

502
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,490
I mentioned in the last lecture that the
theme is flower passage here of course,

503
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:28,440
is this is pure fantasy listed as
his body is nowhere to be found. Uh,

504
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,820
and there's, and there's nothing
of course to throw the flowers on,

505
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,270
but I think we can see now a way in which

506
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:42,210
Milton has permitted himself the
fantasy, the fantasy of this, uh,

507
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:46,370
of a recovered body. Or as
he says, this is line 153,

508
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:50,660
he is allowed it's frail thoughts
to dally with false surmise.

509
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:56,170
Milton can allow himself a literary
indulgence in the rich sensuality of this

510
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:01,130
passage because he has
mastered the dread voice.

511
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,990
He has mastered the fatherly sternness of,
of Saint Peter.

512
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:09,980
It's as if Milton, we can think
of Milton is having paid his dues.

513
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,900
He's accomplished as ministerial duty
as a zealous and a politically oriented

514
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:17,360
poet.
And now he's earned the right.

515
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:19,520
He's earned the right to
dally with false surmise.

516
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:22,880
He's earned the right to treat
himself to this absolutely lovely.

517
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:25,990
What must have been an extraordinary
amount of fun to write the, the,

518
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:30,020
the lovely catalog of flowers.
It's almost as if the, the,

519
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,250
the flower passages,

520
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:35,840
Milton's reward for having
written the Saint Peter Passage.

521
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,030
And I'm trying to suggest that Milton's
composition of this poem is actually

522
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,890
doing something for him. That it gets
him somewhere, that it's functional in a,

523
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:48,870
in a, in a genuine sense. And so, uh,

524
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,950
it's our obligation now to
look at the poems. Conclusion,

525
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,370
where does listen to us leave Milton

526
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,590
look at a lineup. One 83 Milton
imagines listed us in heaven.

527
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:05,030
Now it's a Christian poem
and then it imagines,

528
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:09,880
listen to this a little differently
as the genius Loci the, this, the,

529
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,830
the natural classical spirit of the place,

530
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,720
the genius Loci of the Irish scene.
This is line 183.

531
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,750
Henceforth thou art the genius of the
shore in dye large recompense and shalt be

532
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:29,420
good to all that wander
in that parallel is flood

533
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,483
period,

534
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,390
thus saying the uncouth Swain to the
yolks and reels while the still mourn went

535
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:44,940
out with sandals gray. He
touched the tender stops, uh,

536
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:49,941
various quills with eager thought
warbling his doric lay and now the son had

537
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,250
stretched out all the hills.

538
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:58,251
And now was dropped into the western
Bay at last tea rose and twitched his

539
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:04,041
mantle blue tomorrow to
fresh woods and pastures new.

540
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:06,870
Okay.

541
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,200
Um,

542
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,200
I want to draw your attention to line 186
this is the line that begins the poems

543
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:14,700
final verse paragraph,

544
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:20,150
and it has to be one of the most amazing
moments in all of English literature.

545
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Thus saying these five words,

546
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,910
thus saying the uncouth Swain.

547
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,370
Yeah.

548
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,410
Okay. What are we being
told here? This poem,

549
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,710
this entire poem before this point
hasn't been sung by John Milton at all.

550
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,470
We naturally thought that
it was the poet John Milton,

551
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,550
who was speaking the first
185 lines of the poem.

552
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:50,060
We naturally assume that it was Milton
himself who was describing the his

553
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:52,700
college friendship with
listed as Edward Edward King.

554
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,940
We naturally assume that
the poet was speaking

555
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,680
even with even behind the pastoral
mask because we'd been given no idea

556
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:08,000
whatsoever of any alternative to the poets
responsibility for all of these words

557
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:12,470
being uttered over the course of
this admittedly very long poem,

558
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,550
but with little of do,
this just happens.

559
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:22,470
Milton suddenly and unexpectedly
shatters all of our,

560
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,070
all of our assumptions. He tells us that
everything that we read up to this point

561
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,130
that has been spoken by,
uh,

562
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,090
everything that we read up to this
point has been spoken by a third person.

563
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:37,320
Narrator. We didn't know this has
been spoken by the uncouth Swain,

564
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,340
a rustic shepherd.

565
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,860
Everything that we had thought that
Milton was telling us in the lyric present

566
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,220
telling us directly now suddenly gets
shoved back into the narrative past thus

567
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,880
saying the uncouth Swain,

568
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,710
the past tense is important there and
that this is the first moment right now

569
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,280
they'll sing the uncouth and this is the
first moment that the poet John Melton

570
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,430
is actually speaking in his own voice
and he's speaking directly to us.

571
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:08,640
We don't actually hear John
Nelson until we hear this line,

572
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,380
thus saying the uncooked Swain.

573
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,763
Well,

574
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,380
we should be shocked.
And I think beyond that,

575
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:22,381
we have every right to feel a little
bit betrayed because Milton quite simply

576
00:38:22,811 --> 00:38:24,460
has,
and he's doing this deliberately,

577
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:28,750
he has just violated an
important law concerning,

578
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,980
uh,
we could think of it as the contractual,

579
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:35,890
the contractual relation
that a writer with his,

580
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,100
with his reader when there's a speaker
of a poem who was not to be confused with

581
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:41,200
the poet himself.

582
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,780
There is typically a framing device and
you can easily imagine Milton employing

583
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:50,980
a framing device here. Um, he could
have begun a listed this with this,

584
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:53,320
with something like a description
of the uncouth Swain, Oh,

585
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:55,000
let me tell you about this uncouth Swain.

586
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,050
And then he could tell us the mournful
lay that the uncouth Swain sang.

587
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:04,510
And then he could say, thus saying
the uncouth Swain, uh, there would be,

588
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:07,780
uh, an opening, a framing device,

589
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:12,290
and then of course an end frame device.
But Milton's framing device in, listen,

590
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:16,160
it's only frames the end of the
phone. It's asymmetrical. And,

591
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:19,120
and I think we're fully
entitled to ask why,

592
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,750
why Milton waits for the last eight lines
of his poem to tell us that there's a

593
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:23,261
difference.

594
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:28,150
There's a difference between
the poet and the speaker.

595
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:34,890
Why hadn't Milton pressed on the
this possible distinction earlier?

596
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,820
And the answer to the question,

597
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:43,570
I think gets at the very
heart of the meaning of this,

598
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,830
of this log.

599
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:48,520
And I think the answer may involve the
possibility that at the beginning of the

600
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:49,354
poem,

601
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,100
there simply wasn't a clear distinction
between the poet and this being super

602
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,160
speaker [inaudible].

603
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,750
It's as if the distinction between
John Milton and the speaker of, of,

604
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:03,430
of Lucentis wasn't really operative.
There wasn't an uncouth Swain,

605
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,380
uh, at the beginning. And you'll, you'll,
you'll, you'll remember that I mentioned

606
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:14,830
several minutes ago that Milton
appears literary historians,

607
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,320
I think I've rightly seen the Milton

608
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,740
who had written listed us as a different
figure than the one than the poet

609
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,070
before having written lists of this.

610
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,880
Milton seems to have accomplished
something in writing lists and us as if he

611
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:31,714
almost as if,

612
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:35,800
almost as if he accomplishes that over
the course of this berry poem and one of

613
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,190
the things that he's accomplished,
his,

614
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:41,970
his ability to see himself as someone
who has accomplished something. He,

615
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,510
he's just written this poem and instead
of this continual amp aunt is a patient

616
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:47,980
of writing something great.
Uh,

617
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,510
Milton is able to look back and find
closure in something already written.

618
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,670
And at the very end of the poem,

619
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:59,671
the uncouth Swain rose and twitched his
mantle blue tomorrow to fresh woods and

620
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:07,340
passengers knew. And you get
an image of Milton here. Uh,

621
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,350
twitching is blue mantle his cape over
his shoulder and dusting his hands and

622
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:15,040
letting us know that that's
over. He's finished. He's,

623
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,380
he has completed this lyric poem.
He's,

624
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,290
he's finished with his pastoral,

625
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:25,291
perhaps even he has completed the
youthful phase of his literary career.

626
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,490
Now we began listen to us with an image
of a poet who could only write this poem.

627
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:33,980
This is what we were told
with forced fingers. Rude.

628
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:39,570
This was an act of composing. And
the poet had to be forced to, to,

629
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:44,340
to press this lyric out of himself.
But by the end of the poem, um,

630
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,740
we progressed from the image
of forced fingers rude.

631
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,740
This is an argument that's
been made brilliantly by the,

632
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:56,150
by the critic Peter Sacks, the author
of a book called the English level LNG.

633
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,600
We've PR progressed from
the image of forced fingers,

634
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:04,601
rude to an image of the poet who touched
the tender stops of various quills.

635
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:10,760
The poet's fingers by the end of listed
as aren't, aren't forced or rude.

636
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,020
They're capable of these extraordinarily
delicate feats of dexterity.

637
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:20,170
And that's because the poet has mastered
his touch and this tactile mastery,

638
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:24,110
a tests to something remarkable that's
happened over the course of the poem

639
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:27,830
somewhere below the surface of the poem,
somewhere between the lines,

640
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,480
Milton has mastered his poetic touch,

641
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,740
perhaps because Milton
himself has been touched.

642
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:43,430
Let me remind you of that other
intrusive moment in the poem.

643
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,260
The the moment when a figure whose
presence we hadn't been aware of suddenly

644
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:52,760
made a suddenly asserted himself.
That was of course Vivas Apollo,

645
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,260
the great god of the Sun.

646
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:59,261
And the God of poetry who touched the
trembling ears of the ambitious young

647
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:04,940
Milton much as he had
a century or so before,

648
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,050
a couple of centuries before,
uh,

649
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:13,120
touched the ears of the ambitious young
Virgil Apollo had touched Milton away in

650
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:17,990
a way that I think we can actually
measure. But by the end of this poem,

651
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:21,980
because Milton at the conclusion of
listen to us seems to have assumed the

652
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:23,900
authority of, of, of Apollo.

653
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:29,620
It's as if he's become a Paulo as he
himself takes over the action of touching

654
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,920
that the speaker has internalized
the authority of the god of poetry.

655
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:37,940
First he was touched and now he touches,

656
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:41,150
he touches the,
the stops a various quills.

657
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,430
Look at the final,

658
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,640
look at the final lines and now the son
had stretched out all the hills and now

659
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:53,720
was dropped into the western
Bay at last tea rose and touched

660
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,850
no at last.

661
00:43:56,851 --> 00:44:01,851
T rose and twitched his mantle blue
tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures.

662
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:04,830
Now I,
I'm,

663
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:09,850
I'm interested in this temporal clause
and now Nelson shows us he's fully escape

664
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:14,750
from the repetitiveness of the yet
once more beginning, this code is,

665
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:18,230
suggests something like a victory
over all of those worries of,

666
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:22,680
of unpreparedness as the,
as the worried rhetoric of not yet there.

667
00:44:22,681 --> 00:44:27,681
It gives way to a much more confident
language of present completion than now

668
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:33,630
and now the son had stretched out all
hills and now was dropped into the western

669
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:36,350
bay.
Atlast he rose

670
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,160
last,
he rose.

671
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:47,570
This is it's last d rose that
last who rose who wrote the son,

672
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,640
the son that was just dropped into
the west or the uncouth Swain.

673
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,930
This is my question to you now. We,
we learned of course in the, by the,

674
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,890
by the second half of this line that it
has to be the uncouth Swain who weren't

675
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:04,380
rose and twitched,
his mantle blue.

676
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:09,381
But for a moment the he in line 192 seems
to be able to refer to either the poet

677
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,353
or the sun.

678
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,110
Maybe it could refer to either the poet
or the sun throughout the entire line.

679
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:20,370
If you think of the mantle blue was being
the actual sky that the son is able to

680
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:23,250
twitch over his shoulder, I dunno. Um,

681
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,410
it's at this point of
a possible confusion,

682
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:29,910
at least a momentary provisional
confusion that we know that the poet has

683
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:31,170
identified with the son.

684
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:36,480
He's absorbed the touching authority
of Phoebus Apollo, the god of the Sun.

685
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,660
Milton.
Why is that important?

686
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:44,280
Milton can no longer be chided be
criticized by Phoebus because he's become

687
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:46,660
Phoebus
this,

688
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,800
this momentary switch off between the
sun and the poet is just one of this

689
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:55,920
poem's many,
many substitutions you saw earlier.

690
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,040
See Peter Making a related set of
substitutions and it was crazy.

691
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,240
Peter was lamenting Edward King's death
and he claimed that he would gladly have

692
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:06,510
spared an entire slew of
corrupt Anglican priests.

693
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:10,470
He would gladly have sacrificed them in
order to keep the much more virtuous and

694
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:13,800
pure,
listen us a gruesome proposal,

695
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,050
but it's a group in proposal that suggests
that a primitive desire for a quid

696
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:19,884
pro quo,

697
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:24,810
and it's this seem desire for some kind
of sacrificial substitution that I think

698
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:26,940
is fueling the poem's ending.

699
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:32,640
That dynamic of the entire poem is
one of sacrifice and recompense.

700
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:36,860
Edward King gave his life and he's
recompensed by his new status of the,

701
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:38,190
as the genius of the shore.

702
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,720
But John Milton is also recompensed,
but and,

703
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,980
and by the weird sacrificial logic that
Saint Peter is already sketched out for

704
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:51,540
us, you can see a really disturbing way
in which Milton has benefited as well.

705
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,730
It's as if listened to this has died so
that Milton could live to become a great

706
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:01,710
poet listed as his untimely death
seems to enable Milton to master.

707
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,180
He's owned fears of untimeliness listed.
This is death. This is, remember,

708
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:07,920
this is the poem that
Milton didn't want to ride.

709
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:10,770
He was forced to write it a
mill. Listen, this is death,

710
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:14,310
allows the uncouth Swain
to grow up to move on.

711
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,410
And the last date lines announced
the course of this new poet's life.

712
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:23,100
Um,
the announces the fact that this,

713
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:27,600
this poets course in life is
about to undergo a drastic change.

714
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,930
And in fact, by a graphically,
this is what happens to Milton.

715
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,680
Finally,
John Milton leaves his father's house.

716
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:41,620
He moves out and he goes on. And of
course he's still being supported, uh,

717
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:46,120
quite generously by his
father. Nonetheless, he goes
on an extended tour, um,

718
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,440
through France and Italy,

719
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,580
but he manages to discard that youthful,

720
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:56,080
that uncouth affection for chastity
that had been such a part of his

721
00:47:56,081 --> 00:48:00,430
imagination. And he marries, um,
a young woman named Mary Powell.

722
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:05,290
Now it's still going to be another 25
years before Milton writes the great epic.

723
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,150
But Milton will no longer express the
same degree of anxiety about under

724
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:14,620
preparation to write the great
epic. And in fact, uh, this is,

725
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:17,200
this is an argument that's been made a
number of times and I think there's a lot

726
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:17,861
of sense to it.

727
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:22,861
The last eight lines of listed us are
written in a very specific rhyme form the,

728
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:27,901
the Italian scheme of the Ottava rema
and it's the Ottava Rima in which all of

729
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:32,020
the great Italian romance epics by poets,
uh,

730
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,800
favorite poets of Milton's like
Ariosto and Taso had been written.

731
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:40,801
The appearance of this semi epic rhyme
scheme here at the end of Milton Milton's

732
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:43,480
poem suggests is readiness.

733
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,440
And he's ready only here at the end of
to us to embark on the epic project.

734
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,570
Okay. Quickly, I'm going to ask you to
turn to the very beginning of Lucentis,

735
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,690
page 120 in the Hughes,
so listen,

736
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,090
this was published along as you know
with the along with the other poems about

737
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:09,091
Edward King in 1637 but Milton himself
publishes the poem a second time and his

738
00:49:10,151 --> 00:49:15,151
own volume of poems that he publishes in
1645 and it's for this second printing

739
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,770
that Milton ads,

740
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:22,300
the head note that you see here that
now begins the poem in this Monety,

741
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,210
the author be whales,
a learned friend,

742
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,780
unfortunately drowned in his passage
from Chester on the Irish sees 1637 it's

743
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:37,360
interesting that Milton certainly begins
this headnote with suggesting directly

744
00:49:37,361 --> 00:49:41,890
to us that it's Milton speaking
and not a fictional uncouth Swain,

745
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,630
but that that aside,
let me continue on the,

746
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:51,631
I received 1637 and bio occasion for
tells the ruin of our corrupted clergy.

747
00:49:52,931 --> 00:49:57,070
Then in their height,
eight years after its initial composition,

748
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:58,750
Milton looks back at this allergy,

749
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,340
rereads it and picks out the Saint
Peter Passage on the corrupted clergy.

750
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,420
Is that specific feature of the poem
worth singling out and introducing.

751
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,140
And of course in a lot of ways this is
just good marketing. Since the poems,

752
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,040
initial appearance,

753
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:17,041
the institution of episcopacy or church
hierarchy has been seriously eroded.

754
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:18,601
The, the, the,

755
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:23,290
the first English civil war has already
broken out setting puritans like Milton

756
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:27,950
against the royalists and the supporters
of the state control of the church like

757
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:32,550
the king and like the king's dread
Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud.

758
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,370
Um, when Milton writes this
little head note in 1645,

759
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,050
archbishop laud has been executed.
Um,

760
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:46,280
he's been sacrificed to the puritan cause
and Milton reasonably alerts is reader

761
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:50,060
to the timeliness of a lot of the material
that would be covered in this poem.

762
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,880
But this headnote goes a lot
further simply than that.

763
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:58,180
And Bio quetsion foretells the ruin
of our corrupted clergy Milton was,

764
00:50:58,611 --> 00:51:00,440
is this is outrageous.

765
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,240
He's actually claiming that this poem
had been prophetic [inaudible] listed as

766
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:07,640
foretold the ruin of the clergy.

767
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:09,590
And it's possible that Milton
is actually suggesting,

768
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:14,480
I think that this poem
helped bring that ruin about,

769
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,441
you know,

770
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:18,650
that Milton had been entertaining this
fantasy of becoming a great biblical

771
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:21,710
prophet like Isaiah.
As early as the naitivity out.

772
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:25,040
He'd seen himself as a
Jeremiah or as an Isiah.

773
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,950
And there were all those
early gestures of prophecy,

774
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:32,951
but now he's able to tell us that
he has already become prophetic.

775
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,560
He throws his high per a prophetic
talents into the construction of the Saint

776
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:44,240
Peter Speech. And in 1645 historical
circumstances being what they were,

777
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:49,241
he was able to look back at this passage
and actually claim that it had been a

778
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:54,000
genuinely prophetic utterance.
Um,

779
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,020
he's made good on all of his promises.
Of course,

780
00:51:57,021 --> 00:52:01,940
it's a sleazy move for Milton to have
made to claim that he had actually

781
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:06,500
prophesied, let's say, the execution
of our archbishop laud. Um,

782
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,550
but Milton will capitalize and exploit
any evidence he can possibly find to

783
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:16,230
assure himself that he is on the,

784
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:20,120
the appropriate path to become
the great prophetic poet, um,

785
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,360
that he knows he is entitled to become
and that he has been chosen to become.

786
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,431
Finally,

787
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:33,431
Milton has revised and undone the
anticipatory logic of the great career

788
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:34,820
narrative.
