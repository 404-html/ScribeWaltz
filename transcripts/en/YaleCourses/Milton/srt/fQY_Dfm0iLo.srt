1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,370
In book five of Paradise Lost
Milton's theory of, of, of monism.

2
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:10,020
That's the theory of the one first matter
that we looked at last time. Uh, this,

3
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,130
the theory of Mon ism or of
vitalism or animus materialism.

4
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:18,150
There are a number of, of terms for
it. Um, it arises in the context.

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:22,590
You'll remember, have a discussion about
digestion and I'll, I'll just remind you,

6
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:27,591
Adam's simply asked Raefiel how it was
that human beings good eat how it was

7
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:33,201
that angels could eat human food and
Raefiel responded with his radical claim

8
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:36,080
for the continuum of matter.
Um,

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,600
a continuum of matter and spirit in God's
universe and the process of digestion

10
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:48,171
was no more suggestive or suggestive
or important to the Archangel Raefiel.

11
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,990
Then of course,
it was four for Milton himself.

12
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:56,490
You'll remember that letter to the famous
Dr. Leonard Dolores in which Milton

13
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:57,810
and explained that it was his,

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,760
it was his bad digestion that he
believed was largely responsible for his,

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,270
for his blindness.
And,

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,220
and Milton's digestive theory of blindness
was actually perfectly reasonable

17
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:16,110
medical hypothesis in the, in the
17th century theorists of digestion.

18
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,140
We're continually arguing that,

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,340
that an escaped gasses could easily
rise up in the body. Uh, but,

20
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:27,840
but Milton's own adoption of this
theory served a particular and,

21
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:32,730
and I think an important purpose
nearly every, and actually this is, um,

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,020
this is a point that's made most
brilliantly in a book that I think Matthew

23
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,500
Valdiviez heads of it's by Michael Lee.
Please hold up the book because it's a,

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,980
it's a, it's a great book. It's
called the dialectics of creation.

25
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,680
And thank you for reminding me that I'm
indebted to leave for this point. Um,

26
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,640
nearly every important event and paradise
lost is represented in some way or

27
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:58,330
another as a process of digestion.
Raefiel tells Adam that, uh,

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,160
the Archangel says knowledge is as
food and that Adam is therefore ingest

29
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:09,270
knowledge temperately just to, as he
must, it's his obligation to ingest food.

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,990
Temperately um, and of course in
moderation, but it's not just,

31
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,210
it's not just knowledge. Everything
is digestive and paradise lost. The,

32
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:19,410
the process,
the process that we looked at last time,

33
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:24,270
the transformation of Adam and eve into
angels was going to be, as you remember,

34
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,430
the,
the product of a virtuous digestion.

35
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,150
But so too will the will,

36
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,750
the expulsion of the rebel angels be the,
their expulsion from heaven.

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,910
And when the son of God drives them
out with his chariot of paternal deity,

38
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:41,100
they are essentially eliminated his waste.

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,640
They're purged from the space of Heaven.

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,760
And Milton fills his account of that,
uh,

41
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:52,080
of that explosion with really
all of the scatology that he can,

42
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,160
that he can muster.

43
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,320
And even the last judgment
will be described in terms
of a process of digestion.

44
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:02,350
The saved will be assimilated
into the body of God,

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,030
into the body of the universe. And the
dammed at the end of time we'll be,

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,460
we'll be excreted into hell.

47
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,490
And Milton is transforming.

48
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,600
I think Milton is transforming a lot
of these absolutely central events in

49
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:20,380
Christian history into something
like scenes of digestion, uh,

50
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,360
for a very good reason. By, by turning,

51
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,250
by turning these moments into
little or big digestive episodes.

52
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,110
Milton's able on some level,
although this might sound irrational,

53
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:37,111
Milton's able to rationalize Christian
history that the process of digestion,

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,910
uh, was, uh, was, was an extraordinary
interest in the 17th century. And, and,

55
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:47,380
and scientists were fascinated
in it because digestion
seems like a lot of other

56
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:51,670
processes in the human body seems to
work without our own conscious knowledge

57
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,380
and certainly without our own control.

58
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,890
It's a digestion is a self enclosed
system that seems to obey its own natural

59
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:04,720
laws rather than responding
to an exercise of our,

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,660
of our will and Milton.
Imagine.

61
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,680
So much of the of Christian history has
at scenes of digestion in a way I think

62
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:15,880
because he needs to imagine them
as occurring without the deliberate

63
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,610
manipulation of the heavenly
father or without the,

64
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,960
or in some way beyond the
father's control. And,

65
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,370
and I think Milton is
continually fending off the,

66
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,090
the Calvinist image of an
arbitrary, uh, and punitive deity.

67
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,010
So the fall of the rebel angels, uh,
the fall of man, the last judgment,

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,210
all of these events are
perfectly reasonable,

69
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,210
natural and at least from one,

70
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,960
one important perspective in
the poem, reasonable, natural.

71
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,730
And also organic consequences
of freely willed,

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,380
self-determined human behavior
or creaturely behavior.

73
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,160
There they're not examples
of God's skiddish. And this
is important for Milton.

74
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,150
They're not examples of God's skiddish
and arbitrary punishment of his creatures.

75
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,440
And uh, that, that, that distinction is
a rising everywhere in paradise lost.

76
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,790
Now, book seven is the
book of creation. And,

77
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:15,520
and here more than
anywhere we would expect,

78
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:20,260
I think a representation of the
extraordinary degree of, of,

79
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,580
of power and control that the
heavenly father is able to exercise.

80
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,100
What is the creation after all,

81
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:31,390
if not an arbitrary display
of the fathers, omnipotence.

82
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,100
Uh, but Milton Milton knows that
that's the case, but at the same time,

83
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,750
at the same time that he celebrates that
he's also struggling to represent it

84
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,780
otherwise. And so we charge as even, uh,

85
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,930
the creation itself with this same
cluster of images involving digestion.

86
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,210
Look, for example, this is
the top of page three 52,

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,940
a book seven,
line two 34.

88
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,470
And I think this is one of
the most puzzling and for,

89
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:04,930
for a lot of reserves its readers,

90
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:09,931
it's one of the most physiologically
suggestive of all the natural processes

91
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:12,470
that seems to be described
in Milton's poem.

92
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,190
The Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit
is an interesting entity for Milton.

93
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:20,690
It seems to be something like
Milton's name for the, uh,

94
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,260
principal of energy behind
a lot of natural processes,

95
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,600
a divinely sanctioned principle of energy.

96
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,840
The Holy Spirit inseminate it's chaos.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,490
So this is Milton on the water.
Recall his brooding wings,

98
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:39,491
the spirit of God outspread and vital
virtue infused and vital warmth throughout

99
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,380
the fluid mass.

100
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,710
And Raefiel describes the Holy Spirit's
stunningly and where we're getting used

101
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:53,711
to this stunningly and sexual
behavior in brooding over.

102
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,970
And then of course, inseminating the
fluid mass of the abyss. This is, uh,

103
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,150
this is the process you'll remember that
actually supplies chaos with that vital

104
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:09,180
power of motion. Um, the vital power
of warmth and, and virtue that,

105
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,110
that so consequential for
Milton's theory of modernism. And,

106
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,290
and these are all ideas
that Milton discusses in a
theoretical frame in chapter

107
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,900
seven of, of, of Christian doctrine. Um,

108
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,730
there's seven days in creation and
Milton has a kind of numerological bent.

109
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:28,820
And so it will be in book seven of
Paradise Lost in which the creation has

110
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:32,640
discussed chapter seven of
Christian doctrine in which, uh,

111
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,160
in which the creation has
discussed. It's, it's this step,

112
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,690
this inseminating step in which in
which all of creation is filled with the

113
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:46,070
goodness of God. Um,
eh, that, that that's,

114
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,840
that's really at the end that goes to
the heart of Milton's theodicy because

115
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:55,070
this infusion of divinity, because
of it, everything that God creates,

116
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,340
every natural thing hass must
on some level be naturally good,

117
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,360
necessarily a good,
I think this much makes sense.

118
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,760
But,
uh,

119
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,760
but Raefiel also describes a moment in
the creation that's I think a little more

120
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:17,870
difficult for us to reconcile with what
we know or what we feel that we know of.

121
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:21,890
Milton's momism look how
this same passage continues.

122
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,060
This is line two 37,
but downward.

123
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:30,830
So this is the Holy Spirit is the
subject of the verb. But downward purged.

124
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,810
The black tartare is cold,
infernal dregs adverse to life,

125
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,490
then founded,

126
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,170
then can globe like things to like the
rest to several place discarded and

127
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,930
between spun out the air,

128
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,050
the Holy Spirit, downward purge,
the black tartare us gold,

129
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:53,660
cold infernal dregs adverse to life.

130
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,690
The Holy Spirit doesn't merely infused
chaos with vital virtue in vital warmth.

131
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,600
It purges something from chaos to,
and it's this,

132
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,700
it's this strange
digestive moment, um, in,

133
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:11,040
in Milton's text that has left students
in Milton's theology and students of the

134
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:14,580
poem scratching their heads and
bewilderment. And it's a and f.

135
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,610
And for some reason Milton is usually so
precise and really every word in every

136
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,110
image can almost always be accounted for.

137
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,090
But dregs were, this is the
question. Where did these,

138
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,160
where did these drugs come from?

139
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,550
Why are there any drugs in the
inseminated space of chaos,

140
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,530
um, that actually need to
be purged? God's infusion?

141
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,490
Think of the logic of Milton's creation.

142
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:46,491
God's infusion of vital virtue in vital
warmth should have completely filled the

143
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:51,330
matter of chaos with spirit and life
all matter, at least theoretically.

144
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:53,640
All matters should, uh, should be, uh,

145
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,660
should be steeped with spirit and energy.
And I,

146
00:09:56,661 --> 00:10:00,960
and according to all of Milton's theories
of the this vitalist universe in the,

147
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:03,000
in the Christian doctrine,
there shouldn't be anything

148
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:09,130
in Milton's creation,
technically that's adverse to life.

149
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,650
Um, this really is crucial for Milton's
understanding of how the universe is put

150
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:17,830
together and it's crucial
to for his theodicy. Um,

151
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,060
but these drugs here are simply, this
is, there was no other way to read them.

152
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,260
They are dry, they are dead and they
are in [inaudible] and, and I'm,

153
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,670
I'm going to be applying some,

154
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:33,190
some pressure to these lines because what
we have here is a, is a moment of, of,

155
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,170
of some metaphysical incoherence.

156
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,430
And it's metaphysical incoherence at the
very heart of Milton's account of the

157
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:43,420
creation. And this, this incoherence
is announced with that wonderful word,

158
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:48,260
drags that Milton ways
down. Um, so much he,

159
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,260
he weighs it down with,
well for four contiguous adjectives.

160
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,180
Black Tartare is one, an awkward
line. Black Tartare is cold.

161
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:01,240
Infernal drags.
I've spent a lot,

162
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,150
I spent a lot of time thinking
about these lines and I've,

163
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,170
and I've also written about this problem
and so I'm going to ask you that,

164
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,670
ask you to permit me a little digression.
Um,

165
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,300
not that you really have a
choice, but I'm, I'm, I'm,

166
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,770
I'm just announcing to you this
fact that I will be digressing now.

167
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,380
And so what I'm going to
do is give you my theory.

168
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,420
My pet theory of Milton's
tartare is dregs. Um, okay.

169
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,290
I'm convinced here that
Milton is participating, uh,

170
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:34,910
in a contemporary conversation
involving one of his pet subjects,

171
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,400
one of his favorite subjects.
It's just that of digestion.

172
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,270
And this is a debate and it's certain,
it's not Milton's debate.

173
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,440
This is one that he inherits.

174
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:47,441
It's a debate about those indigestible
elements of food known as dregs in the

175
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:50,990
16th and 17th century,
also known as Tartar.

176
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,510
And I'm going to give you
a bit of information about
the renaissance philosophy

177
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:59,030
of Tartar and if you can believe,
believe that there is such a thing. Uh,

178
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,030
because I think it provides a good example
of just the kind of of seemingly cock

179
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,040
Cockamamie,
uh,

180
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,750
contemporary philosophical world,
um,

181
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,640
that a lot of early modern
intellectuals in habit,

182
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,140
the key figure in the science of dregs
and Tartar is the 16th century German

183
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:20,980
philosopher,

184
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,250
Paracelsus and literally
tartare is dregs there.

185
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,210
There's simply the residue,
the sediment produced by wine and,

186
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,690
and, and vinegar. And we still have a
substance and you're old if you cook,

187
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:36,520
you're familiar with this.
Um,

188
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:41,200
it's a substance made a vinegar sediments
and it's called cream of tartar. Well,

189
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,700
Paris had, Paracelsus had actually
developed an entire philosophy,

190
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,940
uh,
which had as its center,

191
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:53,440
his understanding of these
tartare is drags. So Tartar for,

192
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,450
for Paracelsus was the stuff that hardened
into stones within the gallbladder

193
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:02,950
and within the kidney or the explanation
for gallstones or kidney stones and

194
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:07,951
tartar was also the same material that
formed a hardened yellowish substance

195
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,340
that we still call of course
a tartar of the teeth.

196
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,640
And Milton in the 17th century would
have called it too at the Tartar.

197
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,160
And more commonly it was
known as tooth stone. And,

198
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,460
and for per Paracelsus,

199
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,110
if there's any natural substance on
this planet that can be identified on

200
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,430
equivocally with evil,

201
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:32,020
it is tartar and I need metaphysical evil.

202
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,340
And so given the import of this matter,
um,

203
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,490
Paracelsus was prompted to ask the same
question that we are all pumped to task

204
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:43,300
when were squirming on the dentist's
chair as we're having our teeth clean,

205
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,670
where in the hell does this
stuff come from? And, and,

206
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:50,680
and Paracelsus is answer to this
question was a theological one,

207
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,380
which is why I think Milton
was so interested in it,

208
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,370
although Milton eventually had to
reject it altogether. Now I'm of course,

209
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,410
I'm not suggesting that
the central context,

210
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:02,440
intellectual context for understanding
this part of paradise lost is the,

211
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,770
is the history of, of dentistry or the
history of oral hygiene. But it's, uh,

212
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,400
it's,
it's nonetheless,

213
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:14,401
we have in a moment of Milton's
engagement with a contemporary theory,

214
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:17,830
however, seemingly off the wall,
this is the theory of Tartar, um,

215
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,850
which was easily as theological
and philosophical in the
16th and 17th centuries

216
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,630
as it was dental. Okay. So for Paracelsus,

217
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,960
tartar originates in the food we eat.

218
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,150
And the Tartar that ends up on your
teeth is simply the indigestible

219
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,340
unassimilatable parts of that food.
And, and, and for a lot of Paracelsus,

220
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,540
his contemporaries, this was an
incredibly troubling theory. Um,

221
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,380
and a lot of Milton's contemporary
said so and so they had to reject the

222
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:56,240
parasail shun theory. Um, and you
can, and perhaps you could guess why,

223
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,710
because Paracelsus is theory
implied of course, that Tartar,

224
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,720
that tartar had been created by God.
It's part of the natural world,

225
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:10,721
and that God was somehow responsible
for the origin of evil in his creation.

226
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:16,001
And so you have philosophers
and theologians in the
17th century weighing in on

227
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:19,970
the, on the tartar question, on the
origin of dregs. And of course they,

228
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:21,460
there for the most part,
they're,

229
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:26,461
they're obliged to attack Paracelsus and
the entire tartar controversy and all

230
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,830
the things that this controversy suggests
about the nature of divine justice.

231
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,260
All of this, I think gets compacted into
this run. Truly extraordinary line. Um,

232
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,470
black tartare is cold infernal dregs.

233
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,800
And Milton is using this
incredibly striking,

234
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:47,801
strange and strange sequence of words
at this point in his creation account

235
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,360
because he wants to open up the
question for his contemporary audience.

236
00:15:53,361 --> 00:15:55,040
Its core,
of course lost on us,

237
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,820
open up the question of the nature of
divine justice and Milton I think in, in,

238
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:02,110
in book seven is, is, is,

239
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,890
is relatively torn about the kind of
God that he wants so that he needs to

240
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:10,460
represent in the poem is Milton's
God, the punitive and, and,

241
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,470
and arbitrary God something like an
anthropomorphic deity or a god capable as

242
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:21,761
Paracelsus had suggested capable of
actually creating evil or is he a god that

243
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,160
we can identify with them more from a,

244
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,730
from a slightly later
Deist deistic perspective,

245
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,130
a God that we can identify with,

246
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:36,131
the more rational or the more natural
processes implied in the theory of monism

247
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,730
in which everything in God's creation is
just necessarily infused with divinity,

248
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,190
divinity and therefore good and alive and
for and in some way capable of virtue.

249
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,703
And this is a,

250
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,770
this is a type of question that Milton
is asking throughout throughout books

251
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:54,890
heaven,
a paradise lost.

252
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:59,891
And one of the ways that Milton
stages this problem is by turning for

253
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:06,050
inspiration is by turning to competing
sources of authoritative knowledge.

254
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,070
So Milton has on the one hand the
authority of scripture and you can see,

255
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,630
although scripture tells
us a lot of things,

256
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:15,850
one of the things that it
seems authoritatively to
tell us is that it gives us a

257
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,570
representation of the anthropomorphic
punitive deity, at least in the,

258
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:21,920
at least in the Hebrew Bible.

259
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:28,090
Milton also has to support this view more
or less the authority of a philosopher

260
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:32,900
like Paracelsus, um, who had
an image of a, uh, of a light,

261
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:33,920
a similar,

262
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,630
although differently configured image
of a punitive deity capable of creating

263
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:39,464
evil.

264
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,930
But what kind of authority does Milton
have for representing the other kind of

265
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:45,630
deity,

266
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,620
the force of life for the
energy that might actually
be much more rationally, uh,

267
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,730
recognizable or accessible
to a 17th century scientific
contemporary of Milton's

268
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,510
or we don't have a scientists
in the 17th century.

269
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,310
Technically we have natural
philosophers. Um, what is the form,

270
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,610
the basis of authority for
Contemporary Natural Philosophy?

271
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,410
And the question of authority and
authoritative knowledge is central to the

272
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:14,910
middle books.
Not just books haven't,

273
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,130
but to all the central
books of paradise lost.

274
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,280
Raefiel is presenting Adam and
eve with something like a quick,

275
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,640
a quick education in universal knowledge.

276
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,550
And the basis or the authority
for this knowledge is,

277
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,380
is constantly under
question in these books.

278
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:32,820
Because so much of rap yields
discourse has, has no foundation.

279
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,850
And this makes Milton nervous has no
foundation in scripture whatsoever.

280
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,740
The Bible simply can't be counted on
as an exclusive source of universal

281
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:41,550
knowledge.

282
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,550
And so Milton has no choice but to
turn to other forms of authority.

283
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,790
And one of them will is
science or natural philosophy.

284
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,770
And so Milton at the beginning of book
seven invokes the Muse of science,

285
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,300
the muse of astronomy at the beginning.
So look,

286
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,860
look at the end vocation.
This is page three 45 of the Hughes.

287
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,750
Um,
the opening lines.

288
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,780
It's here in book seven and only here
that Milton names his muse and the muse

289
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:20,270
turns out to be Urania. And she's
without question. Of course. She's a,

290
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,720
she's a feminine presence here.

291
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,470
And in the muses earlier
incarnations in books one and three,

292
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:30,450
there was some uncertainty as to whether
the heavenly spirit was a masculine

293
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:35,070
figure capable of impregnating chaos and
who will now impregnate Milton's mind

294
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,830
or whether the heavenly spirit
was a feminine spirit. Um,

295
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,470
a feminine power that dove likes that
brooding on the vast abyss or similarly

296
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,090
sat brooding on the,
the brooding mind of the poet.

297
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,460
But books seven is all about birth.
It's all about generation creation.

298
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,310
And Milton requires for this book,

299
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,340
I think an unequivocally feminine Muse,

300
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,920
a maternal Muse who was there,

301
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:05,850
who was there when the world was born
and who will serve here now as the,

302
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:10,440
as the nurturing mother of Milton
zone poem. Now Milton, who's, uh,

303
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,260
who's committed of course
to the truth of the Bible.

304
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,400
And similarly, um, committed,

305
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:20,700
at least in part to a lot of the truths
coming out in the world of natural

306
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,534
philosophy.

307
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,550
Milton's on shaky ground as he describes
the creation and is in vocation,

308
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:30,540
is filled with something like that.
And it just seems absolutely authentic.

309
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,160
A fear of religious error.

310
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm look at line 19 Milton conjures
the fear of falling off Pegasus, the,

311
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,300
the Pegasus, the flying
steed of poetry, um,

312
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,910
erroneous there to wander.
And for Lauren and, and,

313
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,560
and book seven this especially this
invocation is the focus for an enormous

314
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:52,780
amount of Milton's poetic anxiety.
And,

315
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:56,290
and you can measure the degree of
Milton's poetic anxiety here by the

316
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:01,291
reappearance of that figure that Milton
has called on throughout his career at

317
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:05,970
moments of intense fear or
intensivist isolation. Uh,

318
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:10,090
and that's the figure of Orpheus.
Orpheus.

319
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,510
His mother was the Muse Calliope,
the Muse of epic poetry.

320
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,110
She had been incapable of saving her
son when he was dismembered by the

321
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,360
followers of Baucus,
the Buckeye,

322
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:28,230
Milton Implores Urania here at the
beginning of book seven to Outdo Calliope,

323
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,590
uh, to spare him the fate of
Orpheus. So look at line 30

324
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,640
still governed now my song uranium
and fit audience find though,

325
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,493
phew,

326
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,720
but drive far off the barbarous
dissonance of Bacchus and his revelers,

327
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,620
the race of that wild route that
tore the Thrace. Ian Born the tour,

328
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:54,131
the Thrace,

329
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:59,131
he and Bard and wrote a PE where woods
and rocks had ears to rapture till the

330
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:03,820
savage clamor drowned both harp and voice.

331
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,370
Okay.

332
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,100
Nor could the news defend her son.

333
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,170
Okay,

334
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,170
so fail not thou who the
employers for Thou art heavenly,

335
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,370
she an empty dream.

336
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,920
Now you're writing a is the traditional
name for the patroness of astronomy.

337
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,960
And if this music is astronomical,

338
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:28,040
wisdom is not truly governing Milton Song.

339
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:31,580
If she is nothing more than the projection
of Milton's most outrageous poetic

340
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:32,420
ambitions,

341
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,770
then Milton will have no
authority backing the poems.

342
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:39,900
Extraordinary claims to knowledge.
Milton Milton is,

343
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,150
I think really going out on a limb
[inaudible] paradise lost as he's claiming

344
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,030
what is essentially the,

345
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:50,031
the status of divine truth for thousands
of lines in this poem that really have

346
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,900
no foundation in holy scripture at all.

347
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,830
Think of what we've just read that I
have that I haven't spoken to at all.

348
00:22:57,831 --> 00:22:58,664
Book six.

349
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,920
The story of the war in heaven is a
story that doesn't in effect appear,

350
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,440
um, in, in, in, in the Bible.

351
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:11,240
And there's a sense in this illusion
to Orpheus that this poetic endeavor of

352
00:23:11,241 --> 00:23:15,890
Milton's is attended by the, by really
the profoundest risks, Milton implores,

353
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:20,720
the muse.
So fail not thou as calliope had failed,

354
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:22,350
of course Orpheus.
And,

355
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:27,351
and behind this cry lurks lurks the fear
that your rainy or to a kind of nagging

356
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:30,320
fear that Urania too may turn
out to be an empty dream.

357
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,520
The fear that Urania just like calliope
will turn out to be nothing more than a

358
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:38,810
conviction then a convenient
fiction dreamt up by, uh,

359
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,030
by a desperately ambitious poet.

360
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,520
Okay.

361
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,610
But there's another reason that
Milton is a, a feminine Muse here.

362
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:51,020
He wants in this next section of the
poem to espouse as to establishing a new

363
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:54,470
perspective for this book
of Universal Knowledge.

364
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,670
And he's relying on a new muse to liberate
him in some way from the strictures

365
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,320
of the Orthodox forms of
knowledge that are sanctioned.

366
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,570
So seeming so unequivocally,
um,

367
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,160
by the Bible and Milton
struggling to balance the,

368
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,800
the dominant theological
discourse with this new discourse,

369
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:16,280
this new language of science
or natural philosophy.

370
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,850
And so what you have in book seven is a,
is a really startling opposition of,

371
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,920
of essentially competing
forms of knowledge and
competing images of authority.

372
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,790
And Milton will invariably, how can they
not? And he does this authentically.

373
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:33,080
He acknowledges the validity
of a scriptural account
of a natural phenomenon,

374
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,070
but he will only do so,
um,

375
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,580
in order to set the scripture aside
at some point and begin to explore an

376
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:42,980
entirely different perspective,

377
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,300
an entirely different account
of the same phenomenon. Let's,

378
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:52,280
let's look at an example of, of, of
this. Um, at the bottom of page three 55,

379
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:56,490
this is book seven, line
three 87. This is what look,

380
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,440
look at what Milton does with
the genesis account of creation.

381
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,990
Here we have the, the fifth
day of creation. This is
when God, the god of genesis,

382
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:11,170
creates fish and fowl and Milton Milton
and begins the account here with a,

383
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,020
with a dutiful and humble
transcription of genesis.

384
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:19,610
And in some cases the word diverse is
actually a word for word transcription of

385
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:23,820
the King James Translation. In some
cases, the Geneva translation. Um,

386
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,780
and you can see the King
James Translation in the,

387
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:29,180
in the footnotes and sometimes not.

388
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Milton will normally fiddle with just a
couple of words to make the genesis text

389
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:39,310
fit into the metrical scheme
of, of his blank. First lie.

390
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,580
Look at line three 87
and God said,

391
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,230
and God said, let the waters
generate reptile with spawn,

392
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:53,231
abundant living soul and let foul fly
above the earth with wings displayed on

393
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:55,400
the open firmament of heaven.

394
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,730
And God created the great whales and so
on and so forth up there all the way up

395
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:05,850
to three 98 and let the foul be
multiplied on the earth. And, and, and,

396
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,410
and these lines half have to be, and
they've certainly been cited as such. Um,

397
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,710
they've been cited as such
since the 18th century.

398
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:17,711
They have to be the flattest the least
interesting lines in the entire poem.

399
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,840
Um, and one of Milton's first
editors, this is on the handout. Um,

400
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,350
Dr. Bentley had actually argued that
these lines were so bad that they just

401
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:29,120
needed to be deleted
from the text altogether.

402
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,120
And Bentley's Bentley's thesis
wasn't a genius one that, uh,

403
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,500
Milton actually isn't responsible
for these lines at all. Um,

404
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,860
according to Dr. Bentley,
sometimes the Emmanuel Ncis,

405
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:43,040
the young man who had act as secretary
and take down the next installment of

406
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,660
lines are 15 lines or whatever,
um,

407
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,310
would you would just start making things
up or didn't hear Milton properly.

408
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,260
And so a lot of the lines that
Bentley's, uh, most disliked, um,

409
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,230
were to be dismissed for just this
reason that they clearly weren't,

410
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,890
had nothing to do with Milton's
Milton's own composition.

411
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,750
And so Bentley asks this question and
it's a, it's a, it's a good question.

412
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,490
Why should wrap the Elb so tied
up to the letter in Genesis,

413
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:12,870
Raphael,

414
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,870
who makes this narrative thousands
of years before genesis was writ not,

415
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,520
uh, not, not a bad question. If Raefiel
came before Moses long before Moses,

416
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,920
why is he quoting Moses,

417
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,870
Dr. Bentley reasonably asks,
and why indeed,

418
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,830
what might be the significance of
Milton's being tied up to the letter in

419
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:35,664
Genesis?

420
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:40,020
Milton begins his account of the
50th creation by paying homage to the

421
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:42,270
scriptural account of,
of,

422
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,170
to the scriptural source for
his own creation account.

423
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,530
But that's of course not
where Milton ends APP.

424
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,710
Look at line three 99 after
builtin has exhausted.

425
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,330
Thank God he's exhausted. His Bald
versification of the King James Bible.

426
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:02,130
He lets loose with an entirely
new representation of creation,

427
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,720
listened to this

428
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,310
forthwith the sounds and sees each creek
and bay with fry in numerable swarm and

429
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:17,571
shows a fish that with their fins and
shining scales glide under the greenwave

430
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,390
in schools that oft bank the mid.

431
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:25,050
See Milton takes the,

432
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,970
the austerity of genesis and amplifies
it with some of the lushest most

433
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:32,910
luxuriant verse in all of Paradise lost.

434
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,090
And I urge you all to read
these lines out loud in the,

435
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,380
in the privacy of your home.

436
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:40,200
So much of this poem has to
be experienced in your mouth.

437
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,720
I'm convinced before it
can fully be appreciated.

438
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,280
And this is in fact how
Milton experienced it. Uh,

439
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,140
he experienced it sonically because he
was blind and wasn't able to read it on

440
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:50,870
the page.
And,

441
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:54,390
and this and this particular description
of the fish and fowl continues for

442
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:57,150
another perfectly amazing 40 lines.

443
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,100
It's an extraordinary tour to
force that the sounds of water, uh,

444
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,420
of which Milton speaks at line 300
here are of course the bodies of water,

445
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,960
uh,
that,

446
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,390
that are suddenly filled with an an
enormous variety of aquatic life forms.

447
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,300
But the sounds that emerged forthwith
in this passage are also the sounds of,

448
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,370
of this amazing burst
of imaginative poetry.

449
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:25,371
The verse here explodes with the kind
of sonic energy that had been entirely

450
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:31,041
repressed or suppressed during Milton's
lifeless adherence to scripture and

451
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:37,950
shows a fish that with their
fins and shining scales,

452
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:42,620
Milton's swimming here, and he's loving
every moment of it. You know it in,

453
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:47,620
in essential alliterative verse that
almost completely drowns out our memory of

454
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:51,280
the bland King James English
of the previous lines.

455
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,720
And this demonstration of poetic strength
coincides with Milton's new sense of

456
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:59,080
the strength or the a new sense
of a force behind creation.

457
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,420
He takes the masculine image of God's
verbal command from Genesis and God said,

458
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,520
and he replaces it with an alternative
feminine conception of creation that

459
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:13,870
places the power of
creation in nature herself.

460
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,540
And in his description of his
description of the first schools of fish,

461
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Milton I think is subscribing or can be
seen to subscribe to a new and daring

462
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,450
school of thought.
So look at line.

463
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,430
Look at the sixth day a
line for 50 Milton begins,

464
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,600
and we've seen him do this before.

465
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:39,310
He scrupulously follows the genesis
text and God, this is genesis.

466
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,031
And God said,

467
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:44,290
let the earth bring forth
the living creature after
his kind cattle and creeping

468
00:30:44,291 --> 00:30:48,370
thing and beast of the earth
after his kind. And it was so,

469
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,810
and Milton reproduces the scriptural
description nearly verbatim,

470
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,180
but he very scrupulously omits
that final clause from genesis.

471
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,040
And it was so because he wonders,
well,

472
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,730
how was it?

473
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:08,730
So the genesis account of creation is
clearly inadequate here because it relies

474
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,550
on some mystical or some
magical fulfillment of the
father's divine command.

475
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,630
And it refuses.

476
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,100
Genesis refuses to provide a rational
or something like a natural explanation

477
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,390
for how the creation of cattle
and creeping thing came to be.

478
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:25,960
So now in the years of
the scientific revolution,

479
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:27,700
the later years of the 17th century,

480
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,020
the genesis account of creation was
coming under a lot of scrutiny. Um,

481
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,290
and the phrase and God said,

482
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,160
was increasingly seen
as this is an adequate,

483
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:43,720
this is an insufficiently be a believable,
a form of natural causation.

484
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:48,490
And there was a pressure felt by a lot
of intellectuals to imagine another form

485
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:53,050
and a more naturalistic force
or power of causation at work.

486
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,210
And this is exactly what
Milton himself does.

487
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,660
He replaces the biblical
phrase and it was so with,

488
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,200
uh,

489
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,200
with a spectacularly naturalistic
drama of what we can think of as self

490
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:10,240
creation. Look, look,
look what Milton does.

491
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,440
The earth obeyed and straight opening
her fertile womb team that a birth in

492
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:20,290
numerous living creatures,

493
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,710
perfect forms limbed and
full grown and invoking a,

494
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:31,060
a mother earth. Of course this mother
earth obeys the heavenly father,

495
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,410
but Milton by invoking her is
performing an operation, uh,

496
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,530
similar to the strategy that he had
performed in a, in the vocation.

497
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:43,770
He's countering the entirely masculine
force behind the genesis creation with a

498
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:47,660
new feminine presence that the female
Earth May just demonstrate her initial

499
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:51,560
obedience, uh, and
subordination to the father.

500
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,590
But after this,
a humbling of herself,

501
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:58,610
she's empowered to produce
and she does this on her own,

502
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,470
all of the numerous living creatures
and in Milton's imagining here a female

503
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:07,850
authority distinct from the authority
of the father who's issuing these verbal

504
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:11,810
commands at any depicts this new source
of creative power by drawing on a

505
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:15,350
literary authority, quite distinct
from the book of Genesis and the,

506
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:20,351
and the image of the earth opening up her
fertile womb actually comes from odds.

507
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,630
Metamorphosis.
Interestingly,

508
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,780
this comes from the section
of the metamorphosis that
describes a life after the

509
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:31,520
flood, the flood, Duke Aliens Flood,

510
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:37,210
seen as by by Christian
readers and Milton's day as
a classical version of the,

511
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,750
of Noah's flood.

512
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,810
So it's a fallen phenomenon that
Milton is placing well before the fall.

513
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,470
But what Milton does after this point
in this passage doesn't even have an

514
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:52,890
authority in all of it. Look at
light. Look at line four 63. Uh,

515
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,870
Milton begins to represent what may
have seemed to less courageous poets as

516
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,940
they're utterly unrepresented.

517
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:05,360
Representable this is the actual birthing
of these living forms. There are Imr,

518
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,500
the emergence of cattle and creeping
things from the fertile room of the living

519
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:12,350
earth.
Line four 63.

520
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,400
Okay,

521
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,110
this,
this gets me

522
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,740
the grassy Claude's now calved

523
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,090
the grassy Claude's now cab,

524
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,120
the grassy clods of earth are actually
opening up and giving birth to calves.

525
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,330
What, what is an amazingly daring
sequence of five, five words. Um,

526
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,380
it's a spectacular image of creation.

527
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:44,381
The grassy Claude's now calved now half
appeared the Tawney Lion Pine to get

528
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:50,321
free his hinder parts then springs as
broke from bonds and rampant shakes.

529
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:52,820
His Brendan Main,

530
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,480
you'll note at the bottom of the
page that Merritt who was tells us,

531
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,100
and I love this about you,

532
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:00,650
is that he gives us this
footnote that the romantic poets,

533
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:03,320
Samuel Taylor Coleridge had
singled out just this image,

534
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:07,730
the image of the tawny lion as
unworthy of Milton's gifts as a poet.

535
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,950
And you can see what offended Coleridge
and presumably also offends merit,

536
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:15,260
Merit Hughes. Uh, there, there's, there,

537
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:19,010
there is more than just a little
breach of decorum in this image of a,

538
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,880
of a lion wiggling his
bottom in order to free his,

539
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:24,050
his hinder parts.

540
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,890
Milton's not only portraying the
lions attempt to give birth to itself,

541
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,880
which is no small feat, um, as it pause
it's way out of the earth swollen.

542
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
He's also depicting something like a
liberation of sexual energy and there's an

543
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:41,430
emblem of the erotic charge that Milton
is giving so much of this non scriptural

544
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:45,150
material in, in, in, in book
seven of of Paradise lost.

545
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,920
And when the the lions
springs as broke from bonds,

546
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,980
there's a sense that Milton is
representing his own springing from the,

547
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:58,190
from the confining bonds of a scriptural
tradition that is insufficiently

548
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,840
literarily inspiring.
And it's also a liberation,

549
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:05,370
fully akin to his poetic escape,
will remember from the tyranny,

550
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,320
the bondage of rhyme.

551
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,520
Now throughout so much of paradise lost
the lines of hierarchical authority seem

552
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:17,960
to be an incredibly clearly drawn.
But in book seven,

553
00:36:17,961 --> 00:36:20,750
Milton begins to experiment
a little more freely with,

554
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,610
with forms of authority and images of
hierarchy that actually counter, uh,

555
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:26,391
more of the,

556
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:29,870
the Orthodox notions that he finds in
the Bible or in fact that he finds in the

557
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:34,790
culture at large. And, and, and, and,
and the book itself is inspired by a,

558
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,730
by a distinctly feminine Muse and,
and its description of creation.

559
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:42,020
There's a significant significant
degree of autonomy granted to this,

560
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,070
this feminine power, the Earth,
this new phenomenon, the earth.

561
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,920
Now book eight would see in the semen
a lot of ways to put an end to this,

562
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:56,090
what would seem to be a provisional or
momentary celebration of Feminine Energy.

563
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,471
And in fact,

564
00:36:57,471 --> 00:37:01,850
book eight seems to reassert
the subordination of
women to man that that had

565
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:06,350
characterized our first glimpse
of Adam and eve and book for,

566
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,680
um, you know, it's, you'll remember
that it's in book eight that,

567
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,310
that Adam or counts for Raefiel the
request that he had made to God for a,

568
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,080
for a partner, some fellow human, and
he specifically ask God for an equal.

569
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:22,400
This is a book eight line
three 82 four among unequals.

570
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:27,380
What society can sort,
what harmony or true delight Adam asks.

571
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,900
But God didn't seem all that interested
in granting Adam's request for an equal

572
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,300
partner.

573
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,510
And refferals continually urging Adam
to remember his superiority to eve.

574
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,640
He mustn't mistake gives beauty for
nobility or wisdom or, or equality.

575
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,830
And of course that has been Adam's
tendency and Rafio famously contracts his

576
00:37:48,831 --> 00:37:53,330
brow when, when, when Adam
shows a tendency to, uh,

577
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,580
to idolize his wife.

578
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,820
And whenever the conversation
turns to Adam's relation to eve,

579
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:03,821
Raefiel expresses a fixed and inflexible
opinion on the matter of sexual

580
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:07,730
hierarchy. One sex clearly
has a priority over the other,

581
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,413
but,

582
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:14,330
but [inaudible] is also concerned
with another kind of hierarchy,

583
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:16,990
the hierarchy of the heavens. Uh, th the,

584
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:22,010
the relations of the heavenly bodies fuel
and Adam also in book eight discuss it

585
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:23,181
considerable length,

586
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:27,410
the relative position in the space of
the sun and the earth and the moon.

587
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:29,750
Does the sun travel around the earth,
uh,

588
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,570
which remains fixed at the
center of their universe as the,

589
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:37,571
as the medieval Ptolemy had argued or
does the earth revolve around the sun as

590
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:42,040
the early modern Copernicus?
And then later Galileo had theorized.

591
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,750
Adam of course, isn't certain though
it's certainly looks to him as if the,

592
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:51,130
as it looks to us as if the sun
moves around the earth. Now,

593
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,200
Adam's uncertainty here
is only reasonable,

594
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:59,220
but the remarkable aspect of this dialogue
is that the Archangel Raefiel isn't

595
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,530
certain either.

596
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,460
Redfield doesn't really know
which way the planets revolve,

597
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:09,080
even though he has spent much
of this very morning, um,

598
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,110
on his flight from heaven to Earth,

599
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:15,340
where presumably he had some opportunity
to observe the workings of the, of the,

600
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:16,540
of the heavenly planets.

601
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:21,570
It appears that God has made it difficult
even for the angels to discern the

602
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,880
hierarchical structure of the cosmos.

603
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:30,220
And there's an illegibility about
hierarchy of built into the system.

604
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,800
And of course by the mid 17th century,

605
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:36,410
the jury was still out as
to whether the universe, uh,

606
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,500
w was heliocentric or geocentric and
Milton wasn't alone in expressing some

607
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,710
uncertainty. And you know, you could say,

608
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:48,430
and it has been said that it was wise
of him to hedge his bets. But there's,

609
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,190
there's a lot more going on in
the discussions of astronomy than,

610
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:56,370
than just a serious desire to get to
the bottom of a difficult contemporary

611
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,210
scientific question there.

612
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,100
There's way too much made of raffles
confusion here and his uncertainty about

613
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,120
cosmic hierarchy,

614
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,770
that the sun and the earth
or the sun and the moon are,

615
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,930
are deliberately gendered.

616
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:16,150
Here Milton uses the traditional gender
assignments of these heavenly bodies

617
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:16,381
that,

618
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:21,381
that he inherits from the Latin language
and he holds to them scrupulously

619
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,820
throughout the poem.
This,

620
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:26,950
so the sun is always masculine and the
earth and the moon are always feminine.

621
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,841
And,
and the,

622
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:33,070
and the controversy about the priority
of the heavenly bodies is in some way

623
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,570
Milton's reformulation of the controversy
about the priority of the sexes.

624
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,520
That the field of astronomy provides.

625
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:44,410
Milton with a something like a
scientific discourse about the sex is an

626
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:48,310
alternative source of knowledge that
permits him to counteract the more

627
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:52,560
traditional,
the more theological account of the sexes,

628
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,830
uh, assimilable from his culture,
but also from, from, from the Bible.

629
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,150
Look at page three 66 in the Hughes.

630
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:06,660
Raphael's a certainty about
sexual hierarchy in the
human sphere seems to give

631
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:10,090
way to nothing but doubts and uncertainty.

632
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,830
As soon as that hierarchy is extended to
the cosmic sphere and science provides

633
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:18,610
a different kind of space, this is a
discursive space for a more liberated,

634
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,260
a more open ended discussion of,
of sexual politics.

635
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,880
And it provides Milton with an opposing
source for the knowledge about the

636
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:30,220
sexes, um, uh,

637
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:35,221
knowledge that seemed so complete and
so sewn up from the theological point of

638
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:40,520
view. Implicit in the genesis account.
So on page three 66, this is book eight,

639
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:44,010
line one 48. Raefiel, uh,

640
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:46,490
is beginning to grow
exceedingly speculative here.

641
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:51,350
And he dares to conjecture that there
may exist out there in the cosmos,

642
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,870
other sons and other moons,

643
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,090
other sons,
perhaps with their attendant moons,

644
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:03,590
thou wilt describe communicating
male and female light,

645
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:09,130
which two great sexes animate the world
stored in each or perhaps with some that

646
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:15,980
live the two great sexist here,
communicate that, communicate their light.

647
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:16,700
Um,

648
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:21,260
do so with an equal brilliance that the
greatness of one isn't emphasized here,

649
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:23,210
at least in these lines at
the expense of the other.

650
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:26,900
And you'll remember with Adam and eve and
our first description of them in there,

651
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:27,830
Naked Majesty,

652
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:32,120
they were lords of all and
presumably equally lords of all.

653
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,560
And when Raefiel conjectures that some
creatures might actually live on these

654
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,280
infinitely distant other
sons and other moons,

655
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:44,090
he's pointing to an alternative conceptual
world in which the relation of the

656
00:42:44,091 --> 00:42:48,200
two great sexes might, might be
configured, um, altogether differently.

657
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,220
Um,
Rafio concludes the discussion at,

658
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:55,580
at line one 59 and he
suggested essentially to Adam
bet it's not Adam's place.

659
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:56,600
Adam should just cool it.

660
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:01,220
It's not his place to pursue these grand
questions of heavenly organization.

661
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,470
So this is Raefiel. But whether
thus these things or whether or not,

662
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:12,310
whether the sun predominant in heaven
rise on the earth or earth rise on the

663
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:16,100
sun, it's a IRAP fields just telling
us that simply doesn't matter.

664
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,720
And he suggests a decisive
if such a thing makes sense.

665
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:25,280
So the decisive uncertainty about whether
the predominant sunrises on the earth

666
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:28,660
or whether their predominant
earth rises on the sun and,

667
00:43:28,661 --> 00:43:32,300
and one Milton critic John Guillory has,
has been absolutely right.

668
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,060
I think he's the best reader of this.

669
00:43:34,061 --> 00:43:38,420
A whole problem in suggesting that
we can hear behind these lines.

670
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,770
The brooding question of sexual hierarchy,
is the,

671
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:45,940
is the man on top or is the woman on top?
Is the,

672
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:48,390
is the masculine sex predominant or,

673
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,550
or could it be that the
feminine predominates and
when speaking about the sex is

674
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:58,520
in the language of human
relations, Rapheal is utterly
definitive about who, uh,

675
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:03,410
about who predominates over whom. But when
he's speaking the language of science,

676
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,960
he seems baffled and is,
it's lovable.

677
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:10,180
His confusion in the scientific
realm can be seen to,

678
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:15,300
to force us to reconsider his certainty
about relations in the human realm and

679
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:18,200
the ethical realm.
Now,

680
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:21,230
none of this is to say
that the Milton is a,

681
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,100
is a feminist or,
or,

682
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,530
or even that Milton is a protofeminist
that the question of what,

683
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,220
what Milton actually believes
about the priority of the sexes is,

684
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,240
is really I think too difficult
to discover or extract
simply from a reading of

685
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,590
the text. Um, this,

686
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,520
this poem is far too filled
with contradictions to give
us anything like a clear

687
00:44:44,521 --> 00:44:48,090
roadmap, uh, to Milton's own beliefs.

688
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,830
If it could even be said that he or
any of us actually have firm and fixed

689
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:57,000
beliefs about such huge and consequential
matters as the relation between the

690
00:44:57,001 --> 00:44:59,910
sexes. But I, but it is,

691
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:04,911
I think it is possible to see that Milton
is struggling to hold in solution to

692
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:09,981
keep in some way to keep in suspension
the competing sources of knowledge that

693
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:14,700
address this crucial question in paradise
lost the question of the relation

694
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:17,400
between the sexes and,
and Milton's poem is,

695
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,770
I mean we can't deny this.

696
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:23,670
This is a far more theological
poem then it is a scientific one,

697
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,690
but Milton will nonetheless use
the language of natural philosophy,

698
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,370
the language of science,

699
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:35,030
to open up some of the pressing questions
that his theology seems to have closed

700
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:36,744
down.

701
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,140
And you can see Milton Milton willingly
placing himself in the role of Rafiel at

702
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,270
just those moments when the
archangel is discussing astronomy,

703
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,910
it's as if Milton just
like that affable angel.

704
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:52,830
And don't you love it that Milton lets
us know that without Raefiel is the

705
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:56,640
affable angel quite quite unlike the
Michael that we moment in the last two

706
00:45:56,641 --> 00:45:59,610
books.
It's as if Milton just like Raefiel,

707
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,090
we're throwing his hands
affably up in the air.

708
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:08,250
I'm in complete uncertainty and
telling us the readers, I dunno,

709
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,590
I don't know the answer to these
big questions. You decide, okay.
