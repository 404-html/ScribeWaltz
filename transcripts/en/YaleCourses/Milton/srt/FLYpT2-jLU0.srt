1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,020
I'm actually going to continue here.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,240
One of the discussions that I
had begun in the last lecture,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,480
which,
uh,

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,480
which involved the matter
of the relationship of this
poem paradise regained to

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,630
the earlier epic, uh, which we,

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,680
we have to acknowledge is on so many ways
the more ambitious poem paradise lost.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,800
And so I want to look at the way
in which Milton uses this new poem,

8
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,130
Paradise regained to explore the larger,

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,740
the larger problem of identity.
Um,

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,220
and a lot of ways the identity of
Milton himself, Milton's identity as a,

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,660
an obedient son of God. Uh,
Milton's identity as a, as a poet.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,550
Um, and, and all, all of this gets
worked out over the course of the,

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,290
over the course of the,
of the poem,

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,310
each of the characters in paradise
regained Satan and the sun,

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,890
each of them is involved
in an elaborate process.

16
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:02,450
And it's really a process that
spans the entire poem, um,

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,330
of trying to figure out
who the other one is.

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,920
And on top of that,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,890
each of them is trying to figure
out who he himself is or who he,

20
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,210
uh, or who he himself has
been in the son's case.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,650
Um, there's that, uh,

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,910
turn, I don't know what
page this is on book one,

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,240
lines three 55 and 56.

24
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,490
This is the sun speaking
to Satan. And, uh,

25
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,230
I think it's an extraordinary thing
for the son to say, um, book one,

26
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,910
line three 55,
the son says to Satan,

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,260
why dust thou then suggest to me distrust,

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,940
knowing who I am as I know who thou art.

29
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,760
Why does style then
suggest to me distrust,

30
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,060
knowing who I am as I know who thou art.

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,690
And of course we are, how can we not? Um,

32
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,490
we are inclined to assume that
because this is the son of God.

33
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:15,850
After all that this is,
that there's,

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,290
that there's something more meaningful
about this statement then actually is the

35
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,850
case. What does the sun
know? The Sun does know, uh,

36
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,970
that Satan is his enemy and that Satan
is of that to be identified with that

37
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:36,940
serpent from the pro Evangelian.
The prophecy back in Genesis, um,

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,460
who it will be the son's job to destroy.
The son knows that,

39
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,920
um,
and Satan knows

40
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,410
that the son is his enemy and that it
will be the son's job as the Messiah to g

41
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,040
to destroy him.

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,970
But this is still just a partial knowledge
and it's remarkable the extent to

43
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,810
which Milton doesn't let on just
how partial this knowledge is.

44
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,130
We don't know it until the end,

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,400
how little the sun and Satan actually
understand about themselves and about each

46
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,590
other.
And so I think the sun is actually wrong

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,080
in some way at this early point in the
poem to claim that he knows who Satan is

48
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,770
because his is of course just a partial
knowledge and Satan doesn't know fully

49
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,970
who the son is. Um, and the, and
the sun doesn't know fully who,

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,520
whose who Satan is.
And each of them,

51
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,690
each of them on some level knows
who the other is. But each,

52
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,160
but neither of them knows who
the other had been. If that,

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm hoping that will make more sense
by the time we get to the end of the,

54
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,470
the end of our period here. Okay.
So what, what little action,

55
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,090
uh, what little drama this, this poem
of affords us and it is, you know,

56
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:59,560
we have to confess it is, it is relatively
little, um, involves justice struggle,

57
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:03,700
this intellectual struggle
to understand one's identity.

58
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,690
And I think that that the search for
identity represented and the poem in a lot

59
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:12,691
of ways is a reflection of or something
like a narrative version of Milton's own

60
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,600
attempts. And we've been, we've been
tracking this for a long time now.

61
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,380
Milton's own attempts to identify himself.

62
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:25,710
So one of the questions I think at
stake here is who is John Milton?

63
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,690
Who is this man?

64
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,880
Who is this man who dared to rewrite
scripture in his 12th book epic poem.

65
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,040
Paradise lost this,
this,

66
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:41,041
I think this poem is everywhere trying
to answer that question and it begins

67
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,870
answering it at the,
at the very opening look,

68
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,830
look at the beginning of
paradise regained. This is
page four 83 in the Hughes

69
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,250
I,
and obviously this is a Milton,

70
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:57,090
the narrator talking to us,
I whoever,

71
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,100
while the happy garden song by one man's
disobedience lost now seeing recovered

72
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:08,140
paradise to all mankind by
one man's from obedience,

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,520
fully tried.
And,

74
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:16,060
and obviously Milton is drawing our
attention to, to the earlier achievement,

75
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,690
the epic that had begun with
that prepositional phrase, uh,

76
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,050
of man's first disobedience.

77
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,390
And so the poet very carefully rings a
variation on that phrase in the forest

78
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:30,430
line of the new poem and the new,

79
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,200
the new phrases by one
man's from obedience.

80
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,460
And this little modulation reflects,
of course, the change of, of,

81
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,840
of subject matter. Uh, but, but look
at the way in which Milton has, it's,

82
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,910
this is unbelievable to me.

83
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,270
Look at how he has characterized
his authorship of the earlier poem.

84
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,310
I who air while the Happy Garden Song?
No,

85
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,010
just just,

86
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,010
just pause for a moment and think about
what kind of way that is to refer to

87
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,210
the, the, the magnificent
epic achievement that is,

88
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,740
that is paradise lost.
Milton's diluting and these [inaudible],

89
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,480
he hasn't made up this convention.

90
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:18,200
He's alluding and these lines to the
opening of Virgil's epic, the Aeneid,

91
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,710
and also to the beginning
of Spencer's romance epic,

92
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,420
the Fairy Queen and Spencer of course,

93
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:28,070
was himself alluding to Virgil and Virgil
and Spencer had begun their vast and

94
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:32,870
ambitious literary projects by
identifying themselves to the readers. Um,

95
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,810
and so each of them in his way,
uh,

96
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,690
began their huge poems like,

97
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,650
like this I the poet who
had sung of happy gardens,

98
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,590
who had been content
writing pastoral poems,

99
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,590
diminutive little pastoral lyrics.

100
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,550
I'm now embarking on an epic and an epic.
As you all know,

101
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:57,290
from having read homer is a poem
that treats of heroism and of war.

102
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,160
I have graduated to epic ambition.

103
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,980
That's how Spencer began the fairy queen.

104
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,310
And that's how a virtual before
him had begun the Aeneid.

105
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,620
And by the time we get to the renaissance,

106
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:13,250
this is really the standard way
of introducing your epic poem.

107
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,380
Okay,
that's fine.

108
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,980
But what sense one sentence is there
to Milton's beginning paradise regained

109
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,570
this way, this, he should have done this.

110
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,250
He should have done this
before in paradise lost.

111
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:32,720
What sense does it make from Milton to
begin this poem with that conventional

112
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,760
epic opening?

113
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,930
Milton had already written his epic and
not only had Milton already written as

114
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:41,961
epic,

115
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,220
but he had written his diminutive little
pastoral lyrics long before that I'd

116
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:50,000
say maybe 30 years, uh, before
the publication of Paradise,

117
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,340
a paradise regained. Listen
to us, uh, comas led,

118
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,920
grow and heal pencil aroso.
Those were Milton's pastoral poems.

119
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:01,160
Those were the poems in which he,
he's saying the happy garden,

120
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,090
but to identify paradise lost as a,

121
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:10,091
as a simple pastoral about a happy garden
is obviously on some level to get it

122
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:12,140
wrong.
And,

123
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,210
and I think there's everything riding on
the fact that Milton has misidentified

124
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,040
the nature of his paradise lost. And, and,

125
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,920
and so this is going to be the working
assumption of the rest of this lecture

126
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,630
that Milton,
on some level,

127
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,210
and I know this sounds farfetched,

128
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,260
that Milton has repressed the
epic content of his epic poem.

129
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,910
Now you'll remember that last time we
saw how Satan and paradise regained,

130
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,830
had repressed the fact that it was in
fact the son of God who had brought him to

131
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,260
the brink of destruction
during the war in heaven.

132
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,010
He had repressed a crucial
fact about that war,

133
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,710
the most crucial fact about that
more. Well, and on some level,

134
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,060
the speaker of the poem, Milton's
narrator, we can call him Milton,

135
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,070
um,
joins Satan in this act of repression.

136
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,190
And the speaker of this poem has ref
repressed the fact of the war in heaven as

137
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:13,651
well.

138
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:18,651
It's as if he had forgotten that paradise
lost was an epic something more than a

139
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:21,790
poem merely about a happy
garden because in epic, um,

140
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,830
necessarily features that
the epic subject of, of war,

141
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,220
um,
paradise lost,

142
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,640
can't be identified
merely with book for the,

143
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:37,290
our introduction to the garden of
Eden. Needless to say, um, it's not,

144
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,700
it's not just the paradise
lost featured, uh, that lush,

145
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,350
a extraordinarily beautiful style of
poetry that Milton fields in some way,

146
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,120
he has to resist in paradise regained.

147
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,010
It's not just the lure of
the rich classical style.

148
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,990
That was so tempting there.
It's,

149
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,930
it's also the fact that paradise lost
represented, gave us an image of,

150
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:03,570
of heroic actions and the heroic
actions of its characters.

151
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,220
It's characters actually
did something, uh, uh,

152
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,470
fact that we didn't know we were supposed
to appreciate so much when we were

153
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:14,070
actually reading the thing. But now that
we're reading paradise regained, um,

154
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,340
the fact that the characters
actually act and do in paradise lost,

155
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,300
um,
takes on a new meaning.

156
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,890
And the very fact of all of that action
that had been represented in paradise

157
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:30,270
lost has become something of a problem
by the time we get to paradise regained.

158
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,460
Now we remember that, uh, that,

159
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,400
that when Milton in those early poems
was considering his problems of,

160
00:10:37,401 --> 00:10:39,120
of career and a vocation,

161
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,790
he was consistently imagining a tension
between those two parables. Uh, it, the,

162
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,830
the, those two parables in the
gospel of Matthew that posed,

163
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,740
that posed the question of action,

164
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,140
the question of work and the
parable of the talents. This
is, you know, this, this,

165
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:55,974
this,
this,

166
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,400
this lecture in some way will be
something like a review session for the,

167
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,610
for the whole,
for the whole semester up to this point,

168
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,600
the parable of the talents suggested
that hard work and initiative were

169
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,940
absolutely essential for
the father's approval.

170
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,270
While the parable of the workers in
the vineyard gave us a different,

171
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,490
gave it to a different understanding,

172
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:18,030
suggested in some way that the father
approves of the individual who's willing

173
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,570
merely to wait to be called to work.

174
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,500
And the conflicting or what seemed to
be the conflicting implications of those

175
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:28,980
two parables were worked
over and dozens of,

176
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,990
of earlier poems and in prose treatises
and their reworked here in paradise,

177
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:38,610
regain again much later
in Milton's career. Um,

178
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:39,990
and there, there, there, there,

179
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,410
there reworked and the three temptations
that the son of God undergoes at the

180
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,830
hand of Satan and in paradise regained.

181
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,570
So this for me is one of the most amazing
and most surprising aspects of Satan's

182
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:57,560
temptation of the son of God.
In this poem in Paradise,

183
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,810
Paradise lost.

184
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,280
Satan had tempted eve to be disobedient.

185
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,210
And it was clear to everyone that
this was a kind of temptation to evil.

186
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,560
But this, this is the situation
in a paradise regained.

187
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,070
This is a much more complicated poem
and uh, it's infinitely more complex.

188
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,250
The nature of these temptations of Satan
in this poem is tempting the Sun not to

189
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,480
act disobediently,

190
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:27,481
but on some level actually to act
virtuously or what strikes us as,

191
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:32,680
as a virtuous behavior.
Now the cardinal and the cardinal virtues,

192
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,510
um, you'll remember from an earlier
discussion of comas are faith,

193
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,490
hope and charity and, and in
Milton's account, and it's ingenious,

194
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:45,520
I'm Satan tempts the
sun with those virtues,

195
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,130
but he does it in precisely
the reverse order.

196
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,290
He temps to son to an act of charity and
then to an act of hope and then an act

197
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,210
of faith.
Now just,

198
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,920
just think of what Milton does
to the original story in Luke.

199
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,680
Okay.
So the sun is,

200
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,070
is hungry after 40 days
fasting in the wilderness.

201
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,680
Now in the account from
the gospel of Luke,

202
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Satan responds to the sun's hunger by
tempting him to turn this stone into

203
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:14,884
bread.

204
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,900
He's tempting him to provide
himself with something to eat.

205
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,160
Well. Uh, Milton, uh,

206
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,270
it goes way beyond that and in paradise
regained Satan doesn't merely tempt the

207
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:32,890
son of God to eat something himself that
would be far too easy for the sun to

208
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:33,490
resist.

209
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,690
He asks us under turn the stone into
bread so he can perform the virtuous,

210
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,580
that charitable act of feeding the hungry.
And if feeding the poor,

211
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,560
we're starving here.
Satan tells a disguise.

212
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,540
Satan tells us,
tells the Sun.

213
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,690
And in a magnificent line that strikes
me as as perfectly prophetic of the Vegan

214
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:58,780
movement of the late 20th
century, Satan says, uh,

215
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,070
sublimely we hear live
on tough roots and stubs.

216
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,460
We hear live on tough roots and stubs.
This is the kind of,

217
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,330
I don't know if you get those emails
that I get from a woman named Anastasia

218
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:14,560
curly from the sustainable food
project, but I think of her, um,

219
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,380
with those updates from what's happening
at the farm. Um, when I read this line,

220
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:24,770
we hear live on tough brutes and Stubbs
and we're asking for your help. Uh,

221
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,730
that's, that's what Satan
says. And it's this temptation,

222
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:32,290
the temptation to virtuous action
that the sun has to resist.

223
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,203
It's not a simple,

224
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,990
simple temptation to gluttony in any
way as it seems to be in the Gospel.

225
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:42,991
Original Satan is tempting the son
what to exhibit a little humanity to,

226
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,550
you know, just to do the right thing. Uh,

227
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,580
milk Milton's father John Milton senior
had pressed the young Milton to s to

228
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:57,650
stop reading at home and to begin
doing something. Uh, he was,

229
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,610
his father was pressuring
Milton to perform. The Virtue
is action of a clergyman.

230
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,530
Um, and it was just this form of
virtuous action that Milton, of course,

231
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,670
as we remember this,

232
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,140
was continually resisting and he insisted
repeatedly that he wasn't ready yet.

233
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,320
He wasn't ready to start acting.
It's too soon.

234
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,100
We found him a continually protesting.
I'm not ripe yet.

235
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,990
And it was at, and he was
constantly explaining to that, uh,

236
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,630
to that paternal authority that he had
in some way internalized. Um, the, the,

237
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,470
the fact of his unrighteousness.

238
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,270
And of course it seems to be something
just like the voice of Milton's father

239
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,950
and in Milton,

240
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,910
which is nothing less than or nothing
other than Milton's own conscience that

241
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:43,460
constitutes the essence
of the next temptation.

242
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,920
And that's the attempt [inaudible] to
accept the worldly kingdoms from Satan as

243
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:51,290
Satan's gift.
And it's the second temptation,

244
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:55,070
which really takes up the bulk of the
poem, um, and the Milton and takes this,

245
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:00,490
this verse from the Gospel of Luke and
explodes it and to hundreds and hundreds

246
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:04,850
of lines. And it stretches from the middle
of book, two to the middle of book for,

247
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,560
and it's here that Milton most
really most powerfully distorts his,

248
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:12,250
his scriptural source. He takes, you know,

249
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,850
what you could think
of as a kind of brief,

250
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,310
throwaway temptation
from the gospel of Luke.

251
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:21,300
And he expands it into a set
of several sub temptations and,

252
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,640
and they're genuine temptations. And
in a lot of ways he's imported. Um,

253
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,661
the,
the,

254
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:30,200
the notion of these temptations from his
favorite can't to of the fairy queen,

255
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,390
the Cave of Mammon Canto from book two.

256
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,510
So Milton takes its cue from Spencer and
transforms this tech second temptation

257
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,630
into,
into a catalog of all of those activities,

258
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,820
all of those seemingly virtuous
activities that he had himself,

259
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,660
that he had himself
devoted his life to that.

260
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,660
And so this massive and endlessly
seemingly endlessly elaborated second

261
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,550
temptation,
weeds,

262
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,110
something like Milton's autobiography.
Um,

263
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:07,760
he explores with what I take to
be an almost painful precision.

264
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,750
The central drives and the impulses of,
of his very,

265
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,930
of his very being of Satan tempts
the son of God with wealth. Uh,

266
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,170
W he tends to the son of God with,
with revolutionary political commitment,

267
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,540
with the promise of military success.

268
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,660
He offers Jesus the entire Parthian army
to help him regain the throne of David.

269
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,211
Because of course,

270
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:33,680
everybody knows Jesus will eventually
regain the throne of David. Um, he sent,

271
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,190
he tempts the sun with empire.
He offers to give him a,

272
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,130
the empire of Rome since the current
Emperor Tiberius is so old and corrupt

273
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:44,320
anyway.
And,

274
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:49,420
and he tempts him finally with all of
the beauty and all of the wisdom and all

275
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:56,460
of the fame associated with classical,
classical Athens.

276
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,140
In short,
um,

277
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Satan tempts the sun with just about
everything that was ever important to,

278
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,790
to two hour John Milton.

279
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,600
And it's almost as if Milton
had deliberately structured
the second temptation

280
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:18,300
is something like a review
session for the Milton exam.

281
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:22,470
You have an entire career,
Neri career narrated here.

282
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,210
So in the temptation to wealth,

283
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,680
and I've given you a sense of the dates,
but it's also on your handout. Um,

284
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:34,170
and the temptation to wealth. You have
the protestations of action and, and,

285
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,110
and of merit that guilty
defensiveness that you,

286
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,640
that you saw on the lyrics of the 1630s.
And in that Latin poem,

287
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:45,600
I'd pop time that Milton had written
to his father in the temptation to

288
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:50,030
political commitment, um, or the
temptation to intervene politically. Um,

289
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,040
you have Milton's new commitment,
the commitment of the 1640,

290
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,410
the decade of his prose to apply
his literary energies, uh, to,

291
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,250
to do the goal of the puritan revolution,

292
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:03,780
the desire to reform the corruption
of church, Church and state,

293
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,460
and the temptation in the temptation
to Parthian military glory.

294
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,580
You can hear Milton's con conviction
and the regicide treatises of 1649 and

295
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:18,180
there abouts his conviction in the,
the importance of destroying,

296
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,240
destroying with force by actual
military power, the unlawful tear,

297
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:28,700
any of Charles the first.
And in the temptation of the
Roman Empire, you have the,

298
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,820
the reflected the faith that Milton
seemed to hold and the early 1650s,

299
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,840
at least in the almost unlimited utopian
potential of the Puritan Commonwealth,

300
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:44,520
the hope, and it was, it turned out to
be a crazy and perfectly irrational hope,

301
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,050
but the hope that an empire governed
by the virtuous puritan saints might

302
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:53,670
actually be able to precipitate the
millennium or the apocalypse at the end of

303
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:57,060
time.
And in the last,

304
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,390
in the last part of
Satan's second temptation,

305
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,110
Satan's absolutely delicious
and completely irresistible
offer of literary fame

306
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,170
and classical wisdom,
uh,

307
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,290
in the form of classical Athens.
Uh,

308
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,580
clearly this last addition to the
separate second temptation that was the,

309
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,820
the, is the, is the thing
that persists throughout,
throughout Milton's career. It,

310
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,970
it, it, it obviously
spans his entire life.

311
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,370
So Milton alludes to and recycles
in the elaborated second temptation.

312
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:41,700
All of the virtuous commitments and all
of the discipline decisions that he had

313
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:45,120
been making himself over the
course of the last 40 years.

314
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,480
And he presents them in. This is what's
so brilliant. He presents them in the form

315
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,420
that the hero has to
resist the temptations,

316
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,810
that the hero has to resist the
voices in his head that had been, uh,

317
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,060
that had come to him and through the,

318
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,740
through the mechanism of conscience
or God or John Milton senior or some,

319
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,010
someone authoritative,
um,

320
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,870
all of those authoritative voices are
now crystallized in the person and the

321
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:15,640
shape of, of, of Satan.

322
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,120
And Satan is tempting to son of God
with a version of essentially all of the

323
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:23,050
virtuous behavior that Milton's
father had pressured Milton width.

324
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,140
Now it's usually clear that the sate,
that Satanic version,

325
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,220
and this is almost always clear that the
satanic version is of the temptation is

326
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:37,210
an evil or at least a
questionable rendition of the
virtuous action that Milton

327
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:40,960
himself had over the course of
those years felt obliged to perform.

328
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,880
But it's not always perfectly
clear to me as, as a, as a reader,

329
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,430
um, why it is that all of
Satan's arguments are faulty or,

330
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:54,610
or why it is we have to dismiss
them necessarily as, as evil.

331
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:59,850
And it often seems that the son of God
is rejecting modes of action and types of

332
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,030
virtuous commitment that,

333
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,650
that Milton himself actively
embraced. And, and, and,

334
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,820
and there's nothing which,
which is just a way of saying there's,

335
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,740
there's nothing that mill Milton is
not willing to question, um, in this,

336
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,670
in this poem. Um, he's,

337
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,210
he's struggling to reinterpret in some
way his entire career as if to purify it.

338
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,310
Um, have anything like a
self interested motive.

339
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,740
It's as if he's systematically reviewing,

340
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,940
scrutinizing every move,

341
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,740
every type of action that he had been gay,

342
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:40,741
engaged in over the years in order to
purify his own past by differentiating it

343
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:45,820
in some way from, from it's satanic
double from a dark version of, uh,

344
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:48,490
of, of his own virtue. Okay,

345
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,050
let's turn to page 510 in the Hughes.

346
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,690
This is book three,
line two 24.

347
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,350
And this is a good example of the way
in which Milton will cast as a satanic

348
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:03,280
temptation,

349
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,500
the voice of virtuous conscience that
had plagued him as a younger man. So, uh,

350
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,940
so Satan asks, if you have such hopes
to be the savior of your nation,

351
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,300
of course you do. Why don't you hurry
up and act, come on, do something.

352
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,400
Look at line two 24.
Uh,

353
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,330
why move by feet so slow to what is best?

354
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,520
And I'll skip a couple of lines here.

355
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,590
Perhaps they'll linguist in deep
thoughts detained of the enterprise.

356
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:33,910
So hazardous in high.

357
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:39,390
No wonder for though in the United would
have perfect cannon man be found or

358
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:41,500
human nature can receive.

359
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,730
Consider thy life have yet been private.
It's a,

360
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:48,480
it's a quite a jab.
You're not, you're not,

361
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:50,600
you're not really fit
for public action at all.

362
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,760
Consider the life have yet been private.

363
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,940
Most part spent at home scarce
viewed the Galilean towns and,

364
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:02,600
and once a year Jerusalem. Oh, I,

365
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,830
it's saint and saying, Oh, I know why
you're hesitant to act. You're too busy.

366
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,500
Lingering in all of your deep thoughts.

367
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:13,520
You've spent all of your life at
home and you've never ventured out.

368
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:16,820
You've never sallied forth
to do something in the world.

369
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,300
And Milton has incorporated
into Satan's temptation,

370
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,530
a piercing critique of his own tendency,

371
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:29,330
that early tendency to wait to
anticipate rather than to act.

372
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,900
And Satan tempts the sun with the wisdom
of John Milton's senior. Um, you're,

373
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,800
you've spent most of your life in private,

374
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,390
at home reading why in God's name,

375
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:44,600
don't you do something?
Now,

376
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:49,601
let's jump ahead to the final
moment of the second temptation,

377
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,940
which is another of Milton's
additions, uh, to the,

378
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:57,530
to the story that has absolutely
no basis in scripture whatsoever.

379
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,120
And, and of course its
absence from Milton's biblical
source should only draw our

380
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,950
attention all the more to its importance.

381
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,170
And this is the temptation to the
intellectual fame represented by classical

382
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:12,410
Athens. In book four, uh, turn to

383
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,910
book four line two 40

384
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,900
Satan displays before the sun, all of
the cultural wealth of ancient Athens.

385
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,410
And at line two 40 heat,
he invokes Athens,

386
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,690
the eye of Greece,
mother of Arts and eloquence.

387
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,460
And this Athens,

388
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:38,540
the mother of arts seems to possess within
it all of the classical learning that

389
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:42,770
Milton himself had been
addicted to a as a young man,

390
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,540
as he spent those years after
college in studious retirement,

391
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:51,590
as at his family's house, I
looked, looked down at line two 81,

392
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:53,510
uh,

393
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:58,490
the Satan urges the son to read
all of these great classical texts.

394
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,200
This is just getting so close to home.
A Satan says to the son,

395
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:04,670
these here revolve,

396
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,840
or as thou likes at home,
it's,

397
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,260
this is amazing.
He says,

398
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:15,150
if Satan and we're imagining
something like a lending library, um,

399
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,000
and nothing could be more attempting
to Milton the Sun could actually think

400
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:24,440
about read and ponder these works
in the privacy of his own home.

401
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,460
This, this line here convinces
me that Milton himself,

402
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,310
uh, had an enormous book collection. The
books were his, he read them at home. Um,

403
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,890
he, after, after he was in college, um,

404
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:42,010
he wasn't merely a reading them in an
old woman's house or a friend's copy or,

405
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,850
or in a, or in some
version of a library. Um,

406
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,170
Milton must have read at home
till tie these here revolve.

407
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:56,370
Or as they'll like stay at home till time,
maturity to a kingdoms weight.

408
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,820
These rules will render the king complete
within myself much more with empire

409
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:05,360
joined and, and, and, and,

410
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:09,150
and this temptation to immerse himself
in Pagan literature at home of course,

411
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:12,300
is the temptation that
in paradise or again,

412
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,590
that has to be most difficult
for Milton to imagine resisting.

413
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,430
Um, and, and, and, and of course it's,

414
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:25,220
I think it's the most difficult
temptation for us as readers to, to,

415
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,870
to encounter. Um, it's impossible in fact,

416
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:32,460
to read the son's response to Satan's
temptation here without wincing,

417
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,151
uh,

418
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:38,151
without wincing at the pain that had to
have accompanied Milton's writing of it.

419
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,450
This is the son who becomes unbelievably
puritanical at this point in a

420
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:46,290
stereotypical sense.

421
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,940
This is the top of page five
23 line three 22 of book for

422
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,150
the son says to Satan,

423
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,450
who reads incessantly and to his reading
brings not a spirit and judgment equal

424
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:03,900
or superior and what he brings,

425
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,030
what need he elsewhere seek,

426
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,120
uncertain and unsettled still remains
deep versed in books and shallow and

427
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:17,121
himself crude or intoxicate collecting
toys and trifles for choice matters worth

428
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:21,240
a sponge.

429
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,660
A sponge is an eraser as as try collecting
toys and trifles for choice matters

430
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:34,521
worth a sponge as children
gathering pebbles on the shore,

431
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,210
the sun dismisses dismisses literature.

432
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,210
He dismisses all of secular learning as
mirror toys fit for for children and you

433
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:47,340
can hear them and then you
can hear something like the
voice of Milton's father

434
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:50,070
here accusing Milton of childishness.

435
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,490
And you can also see here the important
association of literature with the

436
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:55,980
domestic sphere,
the space of the home,

437
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:59,520
the sphere of experience that's
governed not by the child's father,

438
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:03,510
but by the child's mother.
And it's important,

439
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:08,570
I think that Athens is very carefully
figured by Milton as the mother of arts

440
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,710
because this kind of learning is presented
and represented in Milton's poem is a

441
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:18,711
maternal inheritance and it's just this
maternal inheritance that the sun has to

442
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:23,460
resist because what's his, what's his
purpose here in this poem? It's perfect.

443
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,790
Uh,
s a sole obedience to the father.

444
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,280
The Sun's rejection of classical
learning really paralyzed, uh,

445
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,360
parallels Milton's Milton's own as he
writes this very poem on some level he's

446
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,720
describing for us what
he himself is doing.

447
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:43,690
He's obviously resisting
classical literature,

448
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:48,570
at least that illusion to
classical literature throughout
paradise regained. Um,

449
00:29:48,571 --> 00:29:52,930
this poem is almost,
and of course I can only say almost,

450
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,320
it's almost scoured of,

451
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,110
of any classical references whatsoever.

452
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,481
Well,

453
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:06,481
the exquisitely abstemious son of God
resists this most tempting of temptations

454
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:12,040
just as he's resistant all the
others. And you know, this is the,

455
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:17,041
this is the big gun that Satan has just
pulled out and Satan understandably is

456
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,770
beside himself with frustration.

457
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,840
Look at line three 66 top of page five,
24

458
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Satan quite at a loss for
all his darts were spent.

459
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,440
Satan has nothing else to ask.

460
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,880
But this astonishing
question at line three 72

461
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,590
look at Satan's question at line three 72

462
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,780
what dust dow in this world,

463
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,960
what does though in this world you have
rejected every form of action and I

464
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:58,900
can't imagine that you're actually willing
to do anything. This is ridiculous.

465
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:02,860
Can you do anything but say no?
The Satan asks the Sun.

466
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,880
But what of course Satan
doesn't understand yet is
that this poem isn't about

467
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:10,600
action. It's not about doing,
but on some important level.

468
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,130
It's about knowledge and particularly
it's about self, self knowledge.

469
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:20,290
And it's the problem of knowledge that
really comes to the fore at the third and

470
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:23,890
final temptation
which goes like this.

471
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,780
If you are, as you claim the
real son of God, then prove it.

472
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,070
Satan challenges the sun.
And so the,

473
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:37,010
the third temptation is essentially
a paternity test. Um, it's a,

474
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:40,210
it's a test in his faith
and who his father is.

475
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:44,800
And Satan's coming to the point where
he has to learn once and for all exactly

476
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:46,800
who this sun is.
And,

477
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:49,390
and it's here that Satan takes
us under the top of the pinnacle,

478
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,530
the father's house, the uh, uh,

479
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,730
that the top of the temple to prove that
he is in fact a son of God and Satan is

480
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,031
going back.

481
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:05,230
He's returning once again
to that proclamation that
the father had made it the

482
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:06,064
baptism.

483
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,960
This is my beloved son and
he has to figure out once
and for all what that meant.

484
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,340
So look at line five 27 no,

485
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,820
a look at page five 27. This
is book four, Line Five,

486
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:21,340
15 Satan to the sun.

487
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,450
I want to learn in what degree or
meaning thou art called the Son of God,

488
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,190
which bears no single sense.
The son of God.

489
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,580
I also am or was.

490
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,400
And if I was,
I am

491
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:41,770
okay.

492
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,130
Relation stands,
the son of God.

493
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:48,430
I also am or was.
And if I was,

494
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,050
I am relations stands the
relation of past and present.

495
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:56,740
The relation of,
of who I was to who I am is,

496
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,590
is finally presented here explicitly.

497
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:03,430
This is the big question and it's here
that the extent of what we can think of

498
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,080
is Satan's repression,
uh,

499
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,090
becomes almost unbearable
for me to witness.

500
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,230
He,
uh,

501
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:15,790
Satan insists that the son of God is a
term that can be used indiscriminately to

502
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:19,570
describe all of God's human and,
and angelic creatures.

503
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,130
And you know, he's right. Uh,

504
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:26,550
it was used pretty much indiscriminately,
um, throughout a lot of,

505
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:27,730
of paradise lost.

506
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,750
And Satan is incapable here
of acknowledging to himself
the identity of this son

507
00:33:35,591 --> 00:33:39,490
of God, this opponent with that
son of God, the son of God.

508
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:44,630
That's so the so called only be gotten
the first big gotten in heaven way back

509
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:46,480
when that son of God,

510
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:50,440
whose favor in the eyes of the father
had of course motivated Satan's fall from

511
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:53,590
heaven. And the first place
had motivated the rebellion.

512
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,030
Satan brings the sun to the top of
the temple and he asks the sun to cast

513
00:33:58,031 --> 00:33:59,770
himself down.
And it's,

514
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:04,750
it's incredible the degree to which this
climactic moment in this poem reworks,

515
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:09,790
that climactic moment in the
other poem from the war in Heaven,

516
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,340
in, in, in, in, in paradise lost.

517
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:17,341
It's as if unconsciously Satan is
trying to restage that fall from heaven.

518
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Perhaps I am some sort of fantasy way
perhaps to have it have a different

519
00:34:25,301 --> 00:34:25,691
outcome,

520
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:30,130
that terrible moment at which the sun
had successfully maneuvered Satan and the

521
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:34,960
other rebel angels into casting
themselves down from down from heaven.

522
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,410
Uh, it's a, it's a,

523
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:42,970
it's as if this were a desperate
attempt to Redo a traumatic moment.

524
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,940
Um, in the, in the familial past.

525
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,690
Satan tempts the son to call
upon the father to lift him up.

526
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:54,430
Since it is written in scripture that
angels will rush to the aid of the son of

527
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,880
the son of God.
So in essence,

528
00:34:57,881 --> 00:35:02,140
if you are in fact the son of God prove
it, call upon the father to help you.

529
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:08,290
And it's at this point in Milton's text
that absolutely everything that we've

530
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:12,460
been discussing comes to a head.
It's a remarkable convergence.

531
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,670
Look at line five 60 on page five,
28

532
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,740
to whom thus Jesus also,

533
00:35:23,741 --> 00:35:27,520
it is written tempt the Lord thy God.

534
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,740
He said and stood,

535
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,770
but Satan smitten with amazement,
fell.

536
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,980
The son of God performs no action
here other than quoting a verse,

537
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,370
a verse from the book of Deuteronomy,
and then stands,

538
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,620
or maybe actually just remains standing.
He refuses to honor Satan's request.

539
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,810
And, and he exhibits his complete
and total obedience to the father by,

540
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,310
by quoting the father's word, by quoting
scripture temp, not the Lord thy God.

541
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,480
And it's at this point,
and it is not before this point,

542
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,550
that the truth of the son's identity
becomes evident to Satan, I think.

543
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,360
Um,

544
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,360
and I think this is also the moment at
which the truth of the son's identity

545
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:23,790
becomes a parent also to the sun on.
On one level,

546
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:28,590
Jesus is merely, merely means,
don't tempt the Lord to, you know,

547
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,580
don't tempt the Lord thy God.

548
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:31,770
Don't tempt the Lord to help you
if you don't really need his help,

549
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,180
if you can do it on your own.

550
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,020
But at the very moment that the
sun quotes the father's scripture,

551
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:41,910
it's almost as if the meaning of this
scriptural verse, uh, Changes, uh,

552
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:44,610
before her very eyes temp,

553
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:49,611
not the Lord thy God comes also to mean
maybe by the time he's gotten to the

554
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:51,930
God.
Uh,

555
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,200
it comes also to mean perhaps don't tempt
me because I am in some way the Lord

556
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:04,050
thy God. And at this, and at this
very moment of absolute obedience,

557
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:06,480
the sun is rewarded with
the knowledge that he has,

558
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:09,300
not only the savior or the Messiah,

559
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:12,210
he's known that he's
rewarded with the knowledge,

560
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,160
that in some sense he is God's.
He has got himself.

561
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,790
It's an, it's an incredible moment
and it's at this moment that it's,

562
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,190
it's as if the repression,

563
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,120
this poem's repression of Paradise
lost the earlier poem has been lifted.

564
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,930
The repression that is obscured,

565
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:36,980
the identity of this son of
God with that son of God,

566
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,510
the son of God who was actually
responsible for driving
out Satan from heaven in

567
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:43,970
the first place.
The repression evaporates,

568
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,810
and as soon as the reality of the
situation asserts itself, once again,

569
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:52,160
it's amazing.
Satan falls headlong to his.
