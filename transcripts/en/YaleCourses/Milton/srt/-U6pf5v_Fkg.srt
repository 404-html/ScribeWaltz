1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,480
I want to revisit just,
just for a moment, uh,

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,450
the opening of the invocation
to holy light, uh, which
is of course, as you know,

3
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:12,360
is it the beginning of book
three of paradise lost.

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,580
So this is page two 57 of the Hughes

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,490
and this is how Milton begins the
vocation as you remember, hail,

6
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,680
holy light offspring of heaven,

7
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:26,050
first born or of the
eternal coeternal being.

8
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,960
May I express the and blamed,

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,380
and you'll remember the last week we,
uh,

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,600
we looked at Milton's desire to imagine
himself on blamed or in some way,

11
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:41,601
unbelievable for the condition of his
blindness Milton had for Milton had for

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:47,541
years gone out of his way to justify
himself before his nation and before his

13
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,530
God.
But that,

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,810
that was only one way to read this line.
May I ask this question?

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,840
May I express the on blamed and blamed
can just as easily modify it seems to me

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,790
it can just as easily modify the holy
light being addressed by the poet.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,110
It can correspond to the D as
well as the eye in that question.

18
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:15,111
And so it's this alternative syntactical
possibility that I want to explore in

19
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:17,100
this lecture.
Uh,

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,120
well I'll be focusing on the status of
this poem as an attempt to exculpate not

21
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,500
only this poet, but, but this poets,

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,680
this poet's God to render God blameless
for the range of losses that this epic

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,710
so eloquently.
Enumerates.

24
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,370
So a look at the sentence that
I've written on the board from,

25
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,220
from doctor Johnson's life of Milton.

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,590
His purpose was the most useful and the
most arduous to vindicate the ways of

27
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:51,150
God to man. And I'll continue.
Uh, it continues, uh,

28
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:56,340
uh, I'll finish the sentence to show
the reasonableness of religion and the

29
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:59,460
necessity of obedience to the divine law.
I'll read it one more time.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,380
His purpose was the most useful and the
most arduous to vindicate the ways of

31
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,280
God to man,

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,210
to show the reasonableness of religion
and the necessity of obedience to the

33
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:11,820
divine law. And, and, and,

34
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:16,821
and Johnson here is clearly thinking
of Milton's ambition of producing a

35
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,650
theodicy and attempt to justify
the ways of God to men. And he's,

36
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,670
I think he's right to identify Milton's
theodicy is really one of the central

37
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:29,400
tasks of the,
of the poem.

38
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:34,401
Milton's seems genuinely
sincere in wanting to provide
a rational and reasonable

39
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,710
account of the ways of God.
But you've,

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,740
you've probably noticed that
Johnson Johnson's gotten
his quotation wrong and he

41
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:46,290
may have gotten his
quotation wrong. I, uh,

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,810
because he's not thinking
directly of the Milton,

43
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,170
but he's thinking of Alexander Pope's
earlier thinking of the Milton from at

44
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:59,000
Pope's. Great Poem. The Essay on man,
um, pope gets it wrong as well. Uh,

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,070
Milton,
of course,

46
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,420
it doesn't end the opening in vocation
to book one of Paradise lost with the

47
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:09,421
claim that he will assert a providence
and vindicate the ways of God to men.

48
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,470
Milton says that he will
justify the ways of God to man.

49
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:17,410
And I think there's a slight,
but nonetheless,

50
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,990
there's a difference between these
two words and I think there's instruct

51
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,370
something instructive here about Johnson
slip and perhaps something instructive

52
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,870
to about Alexander Pope's
slip, uh, a few decades before.

53
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,500
Now when Milton says that
he'll justify God's ways.

54
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:37,450
I think we mean he means simply that he
will account for the justice of God's

55
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,470
ways. He will demonstrate
their justify ability but to,

56
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,140
but to vindicate God's ways.

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,040
Vindicate is a slightly different words,

58
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,440
although they could certainly be seen
as synonyms to vindicate God's ways.

59
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:56,441
This I would imagine to presuppose
at the outset that God is under some

60
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:57,760
suspicion of guilt,

61
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,110
that he's assumed to have done
something wrong and that it's our job to

62
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:05,260
vindicate him or to get him off
the hook. Milton, of course,

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,400
can't himself and doesn't. Right,
and they use the word vindicated.

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,720
It's too prejudicial.

65
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,400
It seems on some level to criminalize
God's behavior in advance,

66
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,390
and this is of course exactly
what he does not want to do.

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,320
That said,
it's on some level,

68
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:28,321
it's impossible for us to read paradise
lost and not assume that this God

69
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:29,620
requires vindication.

70
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,650
God seems in so many ways
to be responsible for the
fall and it might even be

71
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:39,120
impossible to read the story of
the fall in, in genesis and and,

72
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,430
and not attribute some of the guilt
to the yard way. Who, who put,

73
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,870
who placed the forbidden fruit
in the garden in the first place.

74
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:51,871
Dr. Johnson inadvertently here reveals
something about Milton's poem that Milton

75
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,260
himself perhaps isn't,
isn't willing,

76
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,410
willing or able to admit that.

77
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:04,411
And that's the God appears to be guilty
and it's up to Milton to clear him of

78
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,160
any suspicion of guilt.

79
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,110
So look at the head note that Milton
attaches to the beginning of book three.

80
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,780
This is page two 57 in the Hughes.
And when,

81
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:20,170
when paradise lost initially appeared
when its original appearance in 1667,

82
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,060
um, these arguments, these
head notes were weren't there,

83
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,080
he added them to a later printing,
presumably at the request of,

84
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,260
of a printer who thought that the
readers needed a little help with a poem.

85
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,230
And you actually may want to think
about, it's a, this is an interesting,

86
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,750
it's an interesting phenomenon
and very little written about the,

87
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,890
the general relation between
these summarized arguments.

88
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:45,970
They're essentially plot
summaries, um, to the actual story,

89
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:48,100
the actual narrative that
follows in each book.

90
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,660
But the beginning of this argument strikes
me as an especially interesting one.

91
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,870
So this is Milton's
argument for book three.

92
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:59,600
God sitting on his Throne Sees
Satan flying towards this world.

93
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,140
Then newly created shows him to the son
who Saturdays right hand foretells the

94
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:11,141
success of Satan and perverting mankind
clears his own justice and wisdom from

95
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:16,451
all imputation having created man free
and able enough to have withstood the

96
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,450
tempter.
I'm just going to focus on,

97
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:25,340
on on a couple of those clauses foretells
the say the success of Satan and

98
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,600
perverting mankind.

99
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Then we get Milton's semi-colon clears
his own justice and wisdom from all

100
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,300
imputation. You, you, you, you,

101
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:37,700
you kind of get the feeling here at
least I get the feeling here that this

102
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:42,701
semi-colon is working as hard as it
possibly can to yoke these can seemingly

103
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,560
conflicting principles
together. And I'm not, I,

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,230
I'm not sure it's the case that any
semi-colon is, is up to such an enormous,

105
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,070
uh, theological task.
Uh, in this formulation,

106
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:59,420
Milton seems to own up on some level
to Johnson's characterization of the

107
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,910
theodicy of paradise
lost as a vindication.

108
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,030
God needs to clear his own justice.

109
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,970
He needs to clear his name in essence,

110
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,640
because that name has been
clouded over with some kind of,

111
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:13,870
with some kind of suspicion. Now, and I,

112
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,900
I take this absolutely seriously,
that, uh, I think it's,

113
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,890
it's with, it has to be seen
as authentic and sincere.

114
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,250
Milton's desire to justify God.

115
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,750
He needs to imagine a god who can't be
held responsible for the fall because

116
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:34,400
only a blameless God could be worthy of
Milton's praise or even more worthy of

117
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:38,150
Milton's interest. And I
think, I mean, frankly,

118
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,780
I think that Milton does a
pretty decent job of, uh,

119
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,830
of representing a god who cannot be seen
as some kind of guilty coconspirator in

120
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:50,720
the fall of man. He does a pretty
decent job vindicating God.

121
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,450
But then when we think about it,

122
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:58,451
there are few poets more adept at the
art of vindication than John Milton.

123
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,950
Milton had been practicing the art of
indication that the art of defense,

124
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,570
something like the art of criminal
defense all of his life. Uh,

125
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,870
we looked last time at the lengths to
which Milton went in is on Monday the

126
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:17,760
lakes too, when she went in
his poetry. And His prose to,

127
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,460
to vindicate himself with regard
to his blindness. But long before,

128
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,020
even long before that,

129
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,640
before Milton site had been cut off a
long before his Tinder or observe vision

130
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,870
had been quenched to use
his, uh, his, his poetry, uh,

131
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,960
Milton had been exercising his talents
in the rhetorical art of self defense in

132
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:42,170
Sonnet seven. And actually throughout
the earlier, throughout the early works,

133
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,270
Milton was defending
himself against that fear.

134
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:49,271
You remember that fear that God would
punish him for waiting so long to begin

135
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:52,220
his career that God was angry with Milton.

136
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,860
Milton was already 23 years old and
he had so little to show himself.

137
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,920
And later Milton devoted a good
deal of energy to other kinds,

138
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,530
other kinds of defense.

139
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:05,700
He labored to vindicate the Radical
Puritan Left in England when it was held

140
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,670
that they had committed a
crime in killing the king,

141
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,680
raising a hand against God's
anointed monarch and Europe.

142
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,510
Europe was aghast at the barbaric
behavior of the English revolutionaries.

143
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:23,040
And so Milton wrote in
Latin for the benefit of the
entire European intellectual

144
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,874
community,

145
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,250
two defenses of the crime of the regicide.
Um,

146
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:33,150
so he wrote a first defense of the
English people and then a work entitled a

147
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:35,850
second defense of the English people.
And there is no,

148
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,960
there's no question that he would have
been capable had there been time or had

149
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:43,010
there been an interest of writing a
third defense and a and a and a fourth

150
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,490
defense.
The Labor of defense,

151
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:49,050
the work of vindication was something
that Milton was getting very good at and

152
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:53,100
it really goes to the,
the core of his intellectual temperament.

153
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,550
Now, melting lays the groundwork for
his sweeping vindication of God in the

154
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:01,320
discussion in book three,
uh,

155
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,220
between the heavenly father and his son.

156
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,510
And this is essentially the same theology
that Milton will establish in the

157
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,310
theological treatise that he's riding.

158
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:13,940
At the same time that he's writing
paradise lost, um, on Christian doctrine,

159
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:16,820
parts of which were assigned,
uh, for today's class.

160
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,850
Now it's important for Milton
to establish something like,

161
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,360
and this is what he gets to do in the,

162
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,880
in the venue of the prose treatise
as opposed to the poem. He,

163
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,420
he has the opportunity to establish
a theoretical basis for a lot of his

164
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:36,590
beliefs. And so a theoretical
basis for his vindication of God.

165
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,890
He needs to prove theologically,

166
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,380
not just poetically or narratively,

167
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,980
that God did not place Adam and eve in
the garden with the intent or with the,

168
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,550
the purpose in mind of punishing them
for eating the fruit he needs to convince

169
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,590
himself in.
It needs to convince his reader.

170
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,620
Milton does that the fact of God's fore
knowledge of the fall doesn't in any way

171
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,560
cause the fall. And this is a huge
worry not just for Milton but,

172
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,030
but for all philosophically minded,

173
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,170
philosophically minded Christians that,

174
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,240
that the faculty have freewill
is that as a genuine faculty,

175
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:17,570
this is something that in Milton really
needs to believe and that it's not just

176
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:22,571
some paper McShea con concept pasted
together by a cynical and manipulative

177
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,530
deity or by a cynical
and manipulative poet.

178
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,223
Okay.

179
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,570
And in order to assert this belief in a
genuinely meaningful faculty of freewill

180
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,580
mean Milton has to tackle head on
the theology of his fellow puritans.

181
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:42,910
The prevailing theology
of his, of his, uh,

182
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,500
of his fellow puritans Milton has to
dismantle. And this is no easy task,

183
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,540
dismantle the Calvinist doctrine
of, of, of divine predestination.

184
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,310
Now,
the most prevalent,

185
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,390
the most prevalent belief among Milton's
contemporary puritans was the belief,

186
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,980
this belief in divine
predestination and nearly all,

187
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,850
all the men and women that we can identify
comfortably as puritans embrace the

188
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,800
faith in God's omnipotence outlined
in the works of John Calvin, uh,

189
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,710
Calvin being the 16th
century Swiss theologian,

190
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,290
actually French theologian
living in Geneva,

191
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:22,450
who insisted that every one's salvation
could be traced back ultimately to the

192
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:26,560
predestined will of God.
And so for Calvin,

193
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,230
God is not only known since the
beginning of time, what we will do,

194
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,810
but God actually causes us in
some sense to do what we do.

195
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,510
There's very little
space for a meaningful,

196
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,530
a range of free will in a,
in a strict Calvinist system.

197
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,450
And it's God then who is,

198
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:50,470
who has for Calvin elected in advance,

199
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,510
who will be saved and who will be damned
and, and Calvin was, was, was justified,

200
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:58,840
or at least he felt he was justified
and many of his followers felt he was

201
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:01,870
justified in this assertion
of God's control. Um,

202
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,030
when he read the passage from
Saint Paul's epistle to the Romans,

203
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,070
and this is the, this is the
passage for whom I'll, uh,

204
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,120
let me read the whole thing.

205
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,500
This is Romans eight 29
for whom he did for no,

206
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,690
he also did predestinate to be conformed
to the image of his son. Moreover,

207
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:27,190
whom he did predestinate them.
He also called and whom he called them.

208
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,610
He also justified and whom he
justified them. He also glorified

209
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,180
for whom he did for no, he also did
predestinate. It's a devastating,

210
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,130
it's a perfectly devastating Bible
buffers for anyone committed to a strong

211
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,920
stance as Milton wise on the,
in the doctrine of free. Well.

212
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,660
So on some level,
at least in this passage from Saint Paul,

213
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Romans eight 29 scriptures seemed to
provide in controvertible evidence for the

214
00:13:56,321 --> 00:14:00,760
fact that God had already
predestined the elect.

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Those Christians who had arbitrarily at
the very foundation of time been elected

216
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,150
for our salvation.
And that by extension God had also,

217
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:14,380
and this is another important component
of the Calvinists theological system,

218
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,760
that God had also arbitrarily marked
another group of men and women for

219
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:23,761
punishment and eternal damnation
seems in controvertible.

220
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,640
But we're, we're, this is,
this course is about Milton.

221
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:30,550
And of course nothing is in
controvertible for Milton.

222
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,340
And you see him tangled
with just this passage,

223
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,810
this passage from the book of
Romans for two solid pages in,

224
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,320
in on Christian doctrine.
And,

225
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:43,510
and you just have a sense that Milton is
saying this can't possibly mean what it

226
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:45,140
seems to me.
And there's a,

227
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,940
there's a genuine and powerful
urgency charging Milton's,

228
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,590
it's like a wrestling match almost with a,
with a,

229
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,180
with a biblical passage like this.

230
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,430
And so one of the important conclusions
that Milton comes to in his wrestling

231
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:03,431
match trust scripture is that the term
elect as Saint Paul uses it in the Bible,

232
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:09,230
doesn't refer to God's absolute
predestination. And actually,

233
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:13,760
let me, um, let me ask you to
turn to page in your Hughes.

234
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:17,240
This is page nine, 21, uh,
uh, of the Christian doctrine.

235
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,790
Knowlton writes that

236
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,470
I infer I conclude that believers are
the same as the elect and that the terms

237
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:30,530
are used indiscriminately.
I'm going to read that again.

238
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,820
I conclude that believers are the same
as the elect and that the terms are used

239
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:39,170
indiscriminately.
Believers are the elect.

240
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,500
And because of course we
get to choose on some level,

241
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:46,790
we get to choose whether or not we
believe. We therefore get to choose.

242
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,990
We have some agency in whether or not
we are going to be one of God's elect.

243
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,800
This is wonder,

244
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
one of Milton's most compelling and
really wonderful perversions of,

245
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,250
of mainstream Calvinist theology.
Uh,

246
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:06,251
Calvin had insisted on predestination
to assert God's absolute control over or

247
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,090
over his creation and God's absolute
control over that set final separation.

248
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:16,091
At the end of time between the saved
and the damned Calvin felt that that,

249
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,830
that the, his theology was
the least we could, uh,

250
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,140
there's the least we owed to the gray,

251
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,510
the grand juror and
the omnipotence of God.

252
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,830
But from Milton to say that believers
are the same as the elect is essentially,

253
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:35,060
I think on some level to
strip god of that control.

254
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
If this is Milton,

255
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,370
we're defending something like a
usurpation of Gods of God's authority,

256
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:44,960
and it's the same strategy that you will
see Milton employing a time and again,

257
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:48,350
he's able to,
and it's the damnedest thing.

258
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,560
He's able to take the most depressingly
constrictive biblical doctrine and he

259
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:55,340
turns it into a proof.

260
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,420
He turns it into a proof for his own
faith and man's absolutely freewill.

261
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,370
And Milton's philosophy of he's
not the only person doing this,

262
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,190
but he does it with more ingenuity
perhaps than just about any of his

263
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,024
contemporaries.

264
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,210
Milton's philosophy of freewill is often
called Arminianism and a Arminianism is

265
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:18,260
named after the 16th century
Dutch theologian James.

266
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,593
Our mini as,
I don't,

267
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,710
I can't remember the Dutch name off the
top of my head had Jacobus Arminius is

268
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,670
the, is the Latin name that
he published under. Now,

269
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:31,370
I've been speaking of the theology
of freewill as if it were,

270
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,620
if I as if it were simply a matter of,

271
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,300
of religious doctrine or exclusively
a matter of religious doctrine.

272
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,540
And of course, probably more
importantly than any than any other way,

273
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,480
it is a matter of religious doctrine,
but religion,

274
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,810
and I think this can be
said not just for Milton,

275
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:50,220
it surely it can be said for all of us.

276
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,840
Religion serves a whole
range of cultural functions.

277
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,400
We saw last time some of the deeply
personal uses to which Milton was able to

278
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:02,550
put his theology just as he needs to,

279
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,970
just as he needs to prove that God's
omniscience and omnipotence is not a sign

280
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,750
of, of his responsibility for the fall.
Milton needed to prove that his blindness,

281
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,370
his blindness wasn't a sign of
God's punishment of, of Milton.

282
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,610
That was a personal motivation for some
of the theological energies of Milton's

283
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:27,720
poem. But I think more
central to Milton's theology,

284
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,550
uh, than anything like a personal
motivation is Milton's politics.

285
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:34,710
Although the political sphere is,

286
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,690
is intimately intertwined with anything
that we would want to think of is as

287
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,110
personal theology and,
and political philosophy.

288
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,110
These obviously seem to us such
radically distinct spheres of thought.

289
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,440
Um, but they're incredibly closely
intertwined in the 17th century.

290
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:57,441
And I think there are all sorts of all
sorts of political and social motivations

291
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,370
for Milton's theology.

292
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,050
There are political and social reasons
for the fact that some of the periods

293
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:09,051
radical intellectuals like Milton are
beginning to assert radically to assert

294
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:14,670
the importance of man's freewill and
beginning at the same time to diminish the

295
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:18,990
authority that had traditionally in the
Calvinist system been accorded to God.

296
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,990
And I think there's a
political significance to the,

297
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,230
the periods renewed renewed attachment
to and investment in the philosophy or

298
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:33,610
the theology of Arminius who,
as you can see,

299
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:37,170
he had died at the very beginning
of the 17th century. Um,

300
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,730
Arminianism has a new way,
maybe it's third wave by the later,

301
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,640
the later part of the, of the 17th
century. Now, as we know from the, the,

302
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:51,641
the treatise area politica and from
Milton's regicide a writings as well,

303
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,000
Milton was establishing himself in the
middle part of the century as one of

304
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:58,320
England's foremost,

305
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,410
one of the England's most articulate
spokesman for a phenomenon that we can

306
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,760
call. Although it's an [inaudible],
it's an anachronistic term liberalism.

307
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,710
And so obviously the word liberalism
hasn't, hasn't emerged yet,

308
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,590
but you have something like
a theory of liberalism,

309
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,560
or at least a theory of libertarianism,

310
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,370
a beginning to assert itself in
the middle of the 17th century.

311
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:25,710
You have a serious formulation of,

312
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,480
of liberalism later in the 17th century,
shortly after Milton dies,

313
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,280
um, with the philosopher John Locke,
who was a great reader of Milton.

314
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,890
I'm traditional renaissance
political thought was before lock.

315
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,640
And I think you can say before Milton
was more or less authoritarian,

316
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,300
it placed a monarch at the top of the
society at the top of the polity and

317
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,550
traditional renaissance political
thought needed to imagine that monarchs

318
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:55,710
control.
Um,

319
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,960
his ultimate governance over the
behavior and the actions of all of the

320
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,390
individuals in that society,

321
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,140
that this political philosophy
in variably asserted the,

322
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:11,290
the importance of a radical
image of centralization of power.

323
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,510
And it's really not until the middle
of the 17th century that Europeans,

324
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:21,511
and it's not just not just Englishman
or beginning to articulate any serious

325
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:25,940
alternative to the authoritarian,
the centralized model of,

326
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,270
of political organization. There are
people on the, on the radical left and,

327
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,600
and Milton is one of them,
um,

328
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,680
who begin to posit the idea that the
dispersed individuals throughout our

329
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:41,470
society can be reasonably depended on,

330
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,790
to govern themselves with, with
sufficient self control. Of course,

331
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,860
such a theory assumes a lot of things.

332
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,240
It assumes a sufficient degree of self
control that every individual would have.

333
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,343
Um,

334
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,680
with this self controlled rational
individuals could organize themselves with

335
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:00,970
that without a king,
without the top down.

336
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,390
A hierarchical structure of,

337
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:07,900
of a monarchy and the, and the, the, this,

338
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,950
this position most is most
often associated in England,

339
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:16,480
at least in the middle of the
century with the levelers. Um,

340
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,030
the levelers are the intellectual,

341
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,010
the highminded intellectual
component of the,

342
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:29,120
of the army of during the English
revolution during the middle of the 17th

343
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:33,240
century. Um, and uh, the, the,

344
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:37,460
the level or theory of sovereignty is
something like an intellect and elected

345
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:39,320
sovereignty.
If there's a sovereign,

346
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:44,270
that sovereign will be elected or
chosen by the people and it won't be the

347
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:47,570
sovereign not going to be
imposed upon the people. Um,

348
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:51,470
and so it'll election in a lot of ways.
It's not simply a theological Turnitin,

349
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,570
obviously to, to this day it has
political resonances as well.

350
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,240
So this brand new liberal,

351
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,410
what I'm calling a liberal theology
is not only political in nature,

352
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,690
however, it's also, it's also economic.

353
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,650
It's at precisely the same period,
the mid 17th century when something like,

354
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,390
yeah,

355
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,661
again,

356
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:18,890
I'll use the term anachronistically when
something like a liberal market theory

357
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:23,390
of economic exchange as being theorized.
So up until, so I'll give you a little,

358
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,340
a brief history of, of the,
the, the of economic thought.

359
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,470
In the early modern period.
Up until this point,

360
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:35,471
it was assumed that the only efficient
way to organize the economic life of a

361
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:38,900
nation was to have the monarch,
the sovereign,

362
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:43,490
the authoritarian center of the
government, fixed prices and a to and to,

363
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:47,240
to determine the value
of currency in general,

364
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,860
to oversee the dynamics of just
about all economic exchange.

365
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,421
But suddenly,

366
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:57,770
and this really is happening in the 1650
and it's happening first in England,

367
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,600
suddenly a liberal economic theory
is coming into view and it was being

368
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,130
conjectured that individuals,

369
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,670
meaning individual merchants could freely
set prices and values according to the

370
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:14,700
law of supply and demand rather than
according to the law of the authority,

371
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,520
the authoritarian will of the king.

372
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,550
And there's a wonderful book on
this subject by Joyce Appleby.

373
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:23,270
If any of you are interested, um, it's,

374
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,120
I can't remember what it's called,
but you'll figure it out from orbis.

375
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,720
Which of joy's Apple Bee's
wonderful books. This is a,

376
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,650
but the argument is essentially that a
free market philosophy had simply been

377
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:37,130
unthinkable. The free market
philosophy that we just take as a,

378
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:41,510
as a given almost was unthinkable before
the middle years of the 17th century.

379
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,230
And so you have these two enormous shifts
in the way that English intellectuals

380
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:51,410
were thinking about their political
and also about their economic lives.

381
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,960
And it seems to me that it only stands
to reason that there's going to be a

382
00:24:56,961 --> 00:25:01,790
corresponding shift or some site sort of
related shift on the level of religious

383
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:06,560
thought. If individuals are going to be
liberated from their earthly monarch,

384
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,410
if merchants are going to be liberated
from the centralizing power of the,

385
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,630
of the sovereign in charge of the economy,

386
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,420
then individual souls are going to have
to be liberated at least to some extent

387
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,780
from the predestined very stronghold
of the heavenly monarch as well as if,

388
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,873
um,

389
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,300
intellectual life could operate in these
huge analogous in these with these huge

390
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:36,950
analogous forms.

391
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,980
And I think that that's one of the
functions of Milton's insistence on the,

392
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:45,170
his liberal,
his liberal theology of freewill.

393
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:48,740
It's as if he needs to bring
his religion in line with his,

394
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,510
with his liberal politics.

395
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,460
So now let's look at the
dialog and heaven. Um,

396
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,443
okay,

397
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,530
turn to page

398
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:07,290
260 in the Hughes. This
is book three, line 93.

399
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,261
Uh,
it's,

400
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:13,740
it's hearing the dialogue
and having between the father
and the son were so many

401
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:18,741
of the tensions between Calvin is
predestination and miltonic freewill get,

402
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:22,310
get worked out. Um, but let,

403
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:24,960
let me digress for a moment before
we actually look at the dialogue.

404
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:26,820
I think it's important to ask why it is.

405
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,210
And I think people have been asking this
question since people have been reading

406
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:32,520
paradise lost.
Why it is that God,

407
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:36,420
the father and God the son needed to
be holding a dialogue at all? What,

408
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:40,080
what is it that they need
to say to one another? Um,

409
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,730
I think we can reasonably ask,

410
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:46,050
ask for Orthodox Christians
in Milton's time.

411
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,500
And I think for a lot of Orthodox
Christians in, in our time,

412
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,700
the father and the son,
or members of what's known as the trinity,

413
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,531
the father,

414
00:26:55,531 --> 00:27:00,240
the son and the Holy
Spirit are paradoxically
according to most trinitarian

415
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:03,360
thinking,
are paradoxically three separate entities.

416
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,200
But they are also most importantly,
one unified entity.

417
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:11,700
And because they are all
one and all equally one,

418
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,120
it borders almost on blast for me to
imagine the father and the son needing to

419
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:21,120
discuss anything. But,
but Milton realized that,

420
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
and this is uh, this was, uh,

421
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,680
an extraordinary and bold
move on his part. Milton, uh,

422
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,690
argued that there was no basis in
scripture for a belief in the trinity.

423
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:36,540
And people had always known that the
word trinity actually appears nowhere in

424
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:40,860
the scripture. And you can see
Milton in the Christian doctrine,

425
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,860
uh,
supplying mountains,

426
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,720
literally mountains of
evidence of scriptural evidence
to disprove the doctrine

427
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:50,730
of the Christian,
the Christian doctrine of the trinity.

428
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,940
So Milton took very seriously the
biblical metaphors of father and son.

429
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,290
The father and the son are, are not mere,
they're not aspects of the same deity.

430
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,100
They are literally for Milton,
a father and a son.

431
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:08,400
And when the God refers in Scripture
to my only begotten Son or to my first

432
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:12,060
begotten son, he really means
it. According to Milton,

433
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:15,280
the father generates the son.
Uh,

434
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:20,280
he gives birth to him at a
specific moment in, in, uh, in,

435
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,200
in pre creation history.

436
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,140
And Milton is therefore we can call him
or he has been called a subordination

437
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:31,650
hissed. He subordinates the son to the
father because the sun will never be,

438
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,390
or at least not until the very end of
time, will never be the fathers equal.

439
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:37,990
Okay.

440
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,940
And, and so the sun can
in no way be imagined, um,

441
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,590
okay.

442
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,670
Identical or equal to the father
and the father can, when he chooses,

443
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,320
and this happens in paradise lost,

444
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,270
he can grant a certain measure
of power to the sun, but the sun,

445
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:55,810
no in no way,
possesses a this,

446
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,840
the same in any kind of power that
hasn't been granted to him at God's,

447
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,720
at God's pleasure or, or the, the, the,

448
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,750
he and the sun has nothing like the
fore knowledge or omnipotence that the

449
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:11,600
father has.
Now we see this undoing things,

450
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:16,640
performing actions in paradise lost,
for example,

451
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:21,230
he's responsible for having created or
serving as the vehicle for the creation

452
00:29:21,231 --> 00:29:25,700
of the entire known universe.
Not, not negligible perhaps,

453
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,990
but he, he can only perform
these godlike feats. And he goes,

454
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,720
can they only be called God?
Like not actually God,

455
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,230
when the father permits
him to perform such feats,

456
00:29:36,231 --> 00:29:39,650
he needs his father's permission.
And like Adam and eve,

457
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,920
it's beholden upon the to obey the father.
This is,

458
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:47,620
this is crucial to Milton's theology.
So look at how all these,

459
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,483
this,

460
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,690
these domestic essentially domestic
relations get theologized in the dialogue

461
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,050
and heaven,
um,

462
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,740
line 93 of book three
and the father of course,

463
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,750
and it just drives me crazy.

464
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:06,751
The father speaks in the future tense of
absolute for knowledge because he can,

465
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,600
and, and, and, and you're right to think,

466
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,430
I hope you've thought
that there's something,

467
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:17,250
a little chilling about the fathers
discursive manner here. Um, the,

468
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:21,970
the way in which he can shift so easily
between the past tense and the future

469
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:24,760
tense.
So the line 93,

470
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:29,761
this is the Father Furman will hearken
to Satan's closing lies and easily

471
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:34,900
transgressed the sole command
sold pledge of his obedience.

472
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,630
So we'll fall. He and his
faithfulness progeny, whose fault,

473
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,710
whose but his own
in great.

474
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,560
Ouch.
Whose fault,

475
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,570
whose but his own in great.
He had of me all he could have.

476
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,130
I made him Justin,

477
00:30:57,131 --> 00:31:02,131
right sufficient to have stood though
free to fall such I created all the,

478
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:04,090
the ethereal powers and spirits,

479
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,770
both them who stood and them
who failed freely. They stood,

480
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:11,500
who stood and fell,
who fell.

481
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:16,240
Now I'm going to set aside here
because I can't deal with it. Um, this,

482
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:20,920
this little outbursts that
seems so incredibly in
decorous and inappropriate in

483
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:24,390
great. Um, and uh, I'm,

484
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,740
I'm going to discuss instead the
last line that I just read, uh,

485
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,590
which is indicates,

486
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:34,330
indicates I think one of the central
rhetorical strategies of the father's

487
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:37,120
speech. Now look at line 99. First.

488
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:40,420
There's something literally liberating
about the father's credo here.

489
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:45,250
I created man, sufficient to
have stood though free to fall.

490
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,080
This is, this is kind of rousing
and as rousing as this is,

491
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,610
the father doesn't leave it there.

492
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,930
He broaches the subject of
the fallen angels and he
repeats the same formulation,

493
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,520
but he repeats it with the difference.
Look at line 101

494
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,711
he has just,

495
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:07,711
he's just discussed both of them who
stood and them who failed freely.

496
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:12,520
They stood, who stood and fell, who
fell freely. They still do stood, fell,

497
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:17,320
who fell. The father recasts that,
that original statement within a,

498
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,370
within a repetitive rhetoric,
it's essentially a repetitive
rhetoric of totology.

499
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,600
And in so doing,

500
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:27,210
I think he exposes something of
the highly schematic nature of,

501
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,470
of his sense of justice. And, and,

502
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,740
and this last line is often
cited and Milton criticism as a,

503
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,360
as a positive example of Milton's
commitment to the doctrine of free will.

504
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,810
But I don't,
I don't really buy it though.

505
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,260
I'm not convinced by the fathers,
the fathers statement,

506
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:49,520
this line may begin with that
exuberant an adverb freely,

507
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,950
but the rest of it,
at least to me,

508
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,150
the rest of it smacks of something
like predestination and it's a little

509
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:59,450
depressing. They stood who
stood and fell, who fell?

510
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:03,250
Is it a stretch to
extrapolate from that? Um, uh,

511
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,460
a paraphrase like this,

512
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:08,990
the type of person who was created to
stand didn't stand and the type of person

513
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,360
who was created to fall did fall.

514
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:15,260
There's something disconcertingly
programmatic about the father's repetition

515
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:19,970
here. The repetitiveness
of his explanation and the
tautological force of this

516
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:23,960
formulation seems to rob the
opening word in the line,

517
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:28,820
freely robs it of some of
its liberatory energy. Okay.

518
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:33,490
That was the father speech
wonderfully.

519
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:36,370
The Sun seems almost to recoil from the,

520
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:39,610
from the rigidity of the father's
position and in fact he seems actually to

521
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:43,780
soften the father a little. He asked
the father to show mercy toward man,

522
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,750
since man like the son himself is,

523
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:52,000
is a son of God and it's at this point
you get the the fathers and you want to,

524
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,140
you want to throttle him.

525
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,350
The father's condescending claim that
of course he knew all along that the sun

526
00:33:56,351 --> 00:34:00,970
would be asking for mercy and Milton is
obliged to make the father omission of

527
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:02,620
course,
because the father is omniscient.

528
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:08,010
Although the entire drama of this
dialogue is structured as any drama or any

529
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:13,300
dialogue has to be structured to suggest
that there are two individuals who are

530
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:18,070
reacting genuinely to one another speeches
because they don't know in advance

531
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:22,450
what the other is going to
say. That's what a dialogue,
that's what a dialogue is.

532
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,730
But there's clearly a powerful
asymmetry here in this dialogue.

533
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,030
Um, and that the asymmetry
threatens, I think too,

534
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:35,480
to cast this entire scene
into some something like, uh,

535
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,110
uh,
a potentially ridiculous light,

536
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,110
but the sun does seem,

537
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:45,730
at least he does seem to have made a kind
of impact on the father and the father

538
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,430
seems to relent and,

539
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:51,370
and the father agrees to accept
the repentance of Adam and eve.

540
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:54,190
So look at line one 94.

541
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,130
This is at the top of page two 63.

542
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,870
The father promises to show mercy and he
promises to permit Adam and eve a safe

543
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:06,010
journey back into his good graces.

544
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,150
So line one 94 and I will place them,

545
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,410
I will place within them as a guide my
umpire conscience whom if they will hear

546
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,860
light after light, well
used, they shall attain.

547
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,120
And to the end persisting safe arrive.

548
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,920
It's as if the father has
been cajoled by the sun,

549
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:35,780
cajoled out of his repetitive cyclicality
and nudge towards something like a

550
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:40,781
more linear and to my tastes
are more palatable form of,

551
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,110
of human progress.

552
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,310
And I think we sigh with relief at
the knowledge that all will be well.

553
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:52,290
All will be well. Again, after the fall
we have all of the earmarks here of a,

554
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:56,040
of a narrative.
I'm moving from a,

555
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,660
from a a beginning through a middle,
toward an end.

556
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,630
Then we sigh with relief at
the knowledge that all that,

557
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,590
that everything is going to be okay. But
of course this relief is only momentary.

558
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,500
As soon as the father has
agreed to this concession,

559
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,290
as soon as he's promised
they're safe journey

560
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,390
back to God,
he adds a condition.

561
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,150
And this condition appears at line 203.

562
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,580
This is near the top of page two 63.
Um,

563
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,980
he returns to that rhetoric of repetition
and equivalents that had marked his

564
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,000
earlier speech,

565
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,130
but yet all is not done.
What had led us to

566
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,150
well used, they shall attain unto the
end, persisting, safe, safe arrive.

567
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:45,750
It did seem that pretty
much all was all was done,

568
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,550
but there's some backtracking here, but
yet all is not done. Man. Disobeying,

569
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:55,290
disloyal breaks his field team and sins
against the high supremacy of heaven

570
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,760
effecting godhead.

571
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,060
And so losing all to expiate his treason
hath not left but to destruction,

572
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:07,260
sacred and devote he with
his whole posterity must die,

573
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,220
die.
He or justice must

574
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,900
unless for him some other able and as
willing paid the rigid satisfaction,

575
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,980
death for death,

576
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,700
but yet all is not done.

577
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,890
You can almost hear Milton in
this line catching himself and,

578
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,020
and realizing that man,

579
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:33,021
of course wasn't redeemed simply because
Adam and eve were repentance simply

580
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:34,530
because they said they were sorry.

581
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,600
It has the scene force is that incredibly
startling moment in the naitivity owed

582
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:44,460
when Milton tells us. But why is this?
Fate says no, this must not yet be. So,

583
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,690
uh,
Milton just can't get away.

584
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,670
Although he certainly gives it a shot.

585
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,940
He can't get away from the unhappy fact
that man was not redeemed simply because

586
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:59,700
Adam and Eve said they were sorry man
was redeemed through the much more

587
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:00,960
troubling for Milton,

588
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,550
the troubling mechanism of the
father's sacrifice of the son.

589
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:10,590
And Milton has successfully avoided
finishing his poem about the crucifixion,

590
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:15,000
The Passion, the poem called the
passion when he was a young man,

591
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,310
it just went unfinished.

592
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,690
And as you read the dialogue in
Heaven in Book Three of Paradise lost,

593
00:38:21,691 --> 00:38:25,500
it seems for a while at least it seems
that Milton is going to be able to evade

594
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:29,710
the entire question of the
sacrifice one more time. But, but,

595
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,630
but he catches himself,
but yet all is not done.

596
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:39,070
And he forces consideration of,
of the atonement of the crucifixion.

597
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:44,140
And it's crucial to understanding
exactly how it is that Milton here is

598
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:48,970
imagining the dynamics of the redemption.
So Milton,

599
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:49,760
first of all,

600
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,610
it has to reject the
Orthodox understanding of the
Christian redemption. Um,

601
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,370
I'll, I'll, uh, I'll,

602
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,630
I'll remind you what that looks like
in the New Testament and for a lot of

603
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:02,770
Christian theologians,

604
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,970
the redemption seems to work along
the lines of something like a revenge

605
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:11,971
sacrifice and Q and as cultural
anthropologists have taught us,

606
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:15,690
there's something like a primitive logic,
uh,

607
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,410
an intensely primitive logic at work
behind the notion of the Christian notion

608
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:25,420
of the crucifixion. One of the
Fathers Sons Adam, has died.

609
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,230
And so the father will avenge that
death by murdering someone else.

610
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,480
And of course that means
murdering another son.

611
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,320
And Th th this model of redemption is
based on the repetition or a repetition of

612
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,910
the initial crime.

613
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,860
And this logic of repetition I think is
largely responsible for that rhetoric of

614
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:48,490
repetitiveness that, that we hear
so often in the father's speech.

615
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,320
And so according to this,

616
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:55,410
we can think of it as a sacrifice theory
of redemption or of the atonement God

617
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:58,300
chooses to sacrifice his son.

618
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:01,570
Since someone is going to have
to be punished for Adam's sin.

619
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:03,370
That's the logic demands that,

620
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:09,750
but Milton I think can imagine
no aspect of his religion,

621
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:13,060
no aspect of Christianity,

622
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:18,061
more barbaric than the image of the
father's willing sacrifice of his son.

623
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,510
Th th this would be a god truly
unworthy of Milton's justification.

624
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:26,890
And Milton struggling here,

625
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,210
and there are a few of his contemporaries
are doing the same thing in the 17th

626
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:36,100
century, he struggling to
bring Christianity in line
with certain standards of

627
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,790
rationality. And as Dr. Johnson
had said in the, in the,

628
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:42,730
in the rest of the sentence
that I wrote on the board,

629
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,110
Milton wants to show the
reasonableness of religion.

630
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:52,420
And so Milton replaces the sacrifice model
of the redemption with something like

631
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:55,510
a satisfaction model of redemption.

632
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,430
According to this, according to
this way of thinking in Adam's sin,

633
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,460
a debt has been incurred and this debt
can be satisfied by someone else's

634
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,920
payment. So revenge is no
longer the motive. It's,

635
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:14,500
it's something like an economic desire
simply to balance the books. It,

636
00:41:14,501 --> 00:41:18,520
there's something impersonal about this
new way of imagining the atonement.

637
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,180
And it's here that Milton gives the
notion of the Christian redemption. It's,

638
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,240
it's particular miltonic twist.

639
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:30,130
Milton's father does not
willingly sacrifice the son. He,

640
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,700
it's, it's magnificent. He
simply asks for a volunteer and,

641
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,940
and the son out of his
goodness volunteers,

642
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:42,090
he chooses to make
himself mortal. And, and,

643
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,420
and it's a perfect example.
Have I have a foul?

644
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:49,220
Milton has shifted the emphasis away
from Christian Orthodoxy and, and,

645
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,240
and forcing the authoritarian image of
God's sacrifice to yield to Milton's

646
00:41:55,131 --> 00:42:00,131
liberal image of a kind of volunteerism
or libertarian image of volunteerism.

647
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:06,970
The son chooses to humiliate himself and
subsequently God chooses to compensate

648
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,020
that humiliation with the
Sun Supreme Exaltation.

649
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,280
And you see the extent of
this compensation at line
three 11 and book three,

650
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,560
page two 65, uh, near the bottom
of the page, God says to the son,

651
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,000
because in the Love Hath
abounded more than glory abounds.

652
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,800
Therefore the humiliation shall exalt
with the dye manhood also to this throne.

653
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,710
Here shelt sit here shalt,
I'll sit incarnate here.

654
00:42:37,711 --> 00:42:42,620
Shelt rain. Both God and Man,
son, both of God and man anointed,

655
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:46,520
universal king, all power. I give the

656
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,940
reign forever and assume
the merits under the,

657
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:55,640
as head supreme Thrones.
Princeton's powers dominions,

658
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,940
I reduce to reward the son for having
sacrificed himself for having sacrificed

659
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:06,060
himself. The father is going
to give the son all power and,

660
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,190
and this complete,

661
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:12,230
it seems like it's going to come be
a complete transference of power and,

662
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,130
and it's a transfer that will
hold until at the end of time.

663
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,760
There will no longer even be a difference
presumably between the father and the

664
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:24,761
son because as the father says at
line three 41 God shall be all in all,

665
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,990
there will be no power differential
whatsoever between the father and the son.

666
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,850
And presumably they'll note be no power
differential between or among any of us.

667
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:36,210
Um,

668
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,210
we're will all be joined at the
end of time and one massive liberal

669
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,960
nonhierarchical state of heart harmony.
And the image of the all in all is, is,

670
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,620
is Milton's most exuberant
visionary endpoint.

671
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,020
And it satisfies,

672
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:57,750
I think a lot of Milton's most liberal
impulses and even the authoritarian

673
00:43:57,751 --> 00:43:59,390
instruction structure of heaven.

674
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:04,391
And of course Milton's heaven
is as a is as authoritarian as,

675
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,420
as any heaven has ever been conceived.
Um,

676
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,310
even it will be transformed into
something like a fantasy of,

677
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,790
of egalitarianism,
a fantasy of absolute equality.

678
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:23,310
And this ecstatic redistribution of power
and glory at the end of time can only

679
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:27,050
come about because the sun has
so willingly humiliated himself.

680
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:31,680
He subjects himself to the
father's wrath. No, and I think we,

681
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:34,170
I think we recognize this gesture,

682
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:39,060
this image of the noble and voluntary
self sacrifice. This is the matter.

683
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:39,781
This is the,

684
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:44,280
this is the image that
Milton had established in his
defenses of his blindness.

685
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:47,460
Milton had written in the Sonnet
that we looked down on Monday,

686
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:49,380
meant to Mr Syriac Skinner.

687
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,340
And he had also written in the second
defense of the English people that he had

688
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:58,020
willingly sacrificed his site for
the good of his fellow Englishman.

689
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:02,520
He lost his eyes over,
applied in Liberty's defense,

690
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:05,820
my noble task Milton had
written in that sonnet.

691
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,100
And in the second defense,

692
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:12,120
Milton explains that he continued to
write his regicide treatises despite the

693
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:15,810
advice of his doctors who insisted
that he would go blind if he continued.

694
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:21,060
That's how important the project
was for Milton and the sacrifice.

695
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,780
And you'll begin to see a way in which
the two dominant features of book three,

696
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:25,320
uh,

697
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,090
Milton's invocation to light and the
discussion of blindness they're in and the

698
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:32,760
dialogue between the father and
the son, that, that they're,

699
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:35,430
they're speaking to one another and
they're, they're functioning in, in a,

700
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,050
in a kind of parallel fashion.

701
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,400
So just as the sun's voluntary sacrifice
will rewarded with his inheritance on

702
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:45,580
some level,
the,

703
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,280
the heavenly plot of Paradise lost is
essentially an inheritance narrative.

704
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:55,110
Um, the sun's voluntary sacrifice will be
rewarded with his inheritance of all of

705
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:56,930
God's power,
um,

706
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,070
presumably to Milton sacrificed.
We'll also be rewarded by God.

707
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:07,071
It's as if Milton wants the
same compensation of paternal
power that the son had

708
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:10,530
been granted for undergoing his sacrifice.

709
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,090
Look, look at, let me see.

710
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,910
What do I have time for
the,

711
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,050
the transfusion of divine power.

712
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:30,230
That Milton imagines the transfer
of power from father to the son if

713
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,310
extrapolated to the situation
of the poet and his God would,

714
00:46:35,311 --> 00:46:38,670
would guarantee the inspired
success of the poem.

715
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:40,470
And what would that mean?

716
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,520
It would guarantee essentially
the status of paradise lost.

717
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,120
As as scripture itself as
something divinely authorized
or perhaps even divinely

718
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:51,564
authored.

719
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,580
That at least is is its relation to
Milton's personal concern with his own

720
00:46:56,581 --> 00:47:00,600
composition of, of paradise
lost. But, but this,

721
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,910
this image of a kind of divine,

722
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:08,330
divine transfusion of power
and an ultimate transference
of power also I think

723
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:12,690
speaks to the political component
of Milton's theology. You,

724
00:47:12,691 --> 00:47:17,100
you having this passage,
an image of a transfer of power from a,

725
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,810
from a centralized authority,

726
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,830
the creator of the entire universe
to the humble individual, the,

727
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,320
the image supplies,

728
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:30,350
essentially the conceptual
foundation for Milton's liberalism,

729
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,590
that form of social organization whereby
power has been shifted away from the

730
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:38,500
center, away from the monarch
and toward the subject.

731
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,840
And you will find images of,
of inheritance and of transference.

732
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,460
And if transfusion abounding in,
in paradise lost and they,

733
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:52,450
and they crop up in all sorts of venues,
often having nothing whatsoever to do,

734
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:57,160
um, with the, with the interact,
the domestic interactions
of the, of the godhead.

735
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,610
And these images prepare us for that
beautiful but truly outrageous endpoint of

736
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:07,320
Christian history that Milton foresees
the point at which God, the, the,

737
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:11,830
the one that God had foretold in his
speech to the sun. There will be a point,

738
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:17,200
there will come a point in time
in which God shall be all in all.

739
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:22,960
And that's an idea that works on
the level of theology to satisfy,

740
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,480
uh, nearly every desire to satisfy, uh,

741
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,570
the personal,

742
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,660
the social and the political
desires of what we can,

743
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,320
I think,
not entirely wrongly.

744
00:48:38,321 --> 00:48:42,280
Think of as Milton's idea
of the liberal Christian.

745
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,780
Okay, I'm going to end there. And uh,

746
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:51,040
we will all read very closely book for,
for Wednesday's class.
