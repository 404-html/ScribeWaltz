1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,090
The best way I think to
introduce the central issues of,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,740
of this wonderful poem was it us is,

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,760
is to return to, to Milton's
Comus. So yet, once more,

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,160
and I promise this will be one of the
last times that we look back at Milton's

5
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:25,350
mask, but once yet, once more,
let's look at a comas now.

6
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:29,940
You will remember that the Mass Komas was
everywhere concerned with questions of

7
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:31,620
the power of will.

8
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:35,580
The strangely intertwined questions of
the power of chastity on the one hand in

9
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:39,310
the power of poetry on the other,
the two brothers in the, in the,

10
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:44,311
in the mask engaged in that philosophical
debate about the force or the strength

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,020
of,
of virginity.

12
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,840
And the second brother you'll remember
had taken what I take to be the perfectly

13
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:53,180
reasonable position, the cautious
position that the ladies endangers,

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,350
that she's a sitting duck.
In fact,

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,480
out there in the dangerous forest.
And uh,

16
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,180
it was, uh, it was, uh,
according to the second brother,

17
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:08,181
it's virtually impossible for a single
helpless maiden to pass uninjured in this

18
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:12,780
wild surrounding waste.
Now, the elder brother,

19
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,290
we remember hastily dismissed
his brother's pessimism.

20
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:19,980
And any insisted that the ladies virginity
was fully capable of protecting her

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,150
from any such physical attack.
Now did the extent that this, uh,

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,580
this discussion discussion is
actually about the virginity of,

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,480
of the younger brother and the
elder brother, sister. It, it,

24
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,350
it seems, I think to to border
on the, on the ridiculous,

25
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,040
but the debate I think we
have to take seriously.

26
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,670
It's an important one for Milton and it's
important because it touches on a lot

27
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,650
of them. Uh, more consequential questions.

28
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,710
And I'm thinking of
the general problem of,

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,420
of the abstraction of virtue,
the,

30
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:56,890
an abstract notion of virtue and,

31
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,420
and think of all the questions that
all of us at some point or other I

32
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,990
tend to associate with virtue is,

33
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,390
is virtuous behavior repaid
with some kind of ultimate good?

34
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,390
Are we rewarded for our virtue
and for our virtuous deeds? Are,

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,400
are we recompensed in some way for all
of those sacrifices that we make in the

36
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,920
name of virtue,

37
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,110
these are questions that Milton will
never stop asking and that he will never

38
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,290
stop attempting to answer.
And the position that Milton,

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,040
this is how I like to read it,
this the,

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,110
the position that Milton would like
to be able to take on this question of

41
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:40,780
virtues. Reward is formulated by
the elder brother in Comas and I'm,

42
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,550
I'm thinking of the passage near the
bottom of page 103 in the Hughes.

43
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,630
This is comas line 588 the elder brother,

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,920
so the brother says virtue may
be a sailed but never hurt.

45
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,150
Surprised by unjust force
but not in throat. Yeah.

46
00:02:57,151 --> 00:03:02,151
Even that which mischief meant most shell
in the happy trial proved most glory

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,080
but evil on itself.

48
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,830
Shell back recoil and mix
no more with goodness.

49
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,550
When it last gathered like
scum and settled to itself,

50
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,080
it shall be in eternal restless change,

51
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,110
self fed and self consumed.

52
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,640
Okay.

53
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,870
If this fail,

54
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,110
the pillared firmament is rottenness
and earth space built on stubble.

55
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,890
Okay.

56
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,020
Virtue invariably protects itself.

57
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:37,880
Virtue is in variably rewarded
with glory and evil a,

58
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:41,570
and this is the, this is the flip side
of the coin. Evil is always punished.

59
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,540
It's gathered like in this,
this amazing image.

60
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,670
It's gathered like scum in some eternal
cess pool where itself fed and self

61
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:52,070
consumed a problem solved.

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,940
And the elder brother
continues though if this fail

63
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,760
okay.

64
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,760
By which he means if virtue does not in
every single instance trial a triumph

65
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:06,250
over evil,
then this is a world whose heaven,

66
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,660
who's pillared firmament is rotten to
the core and whose base or who's found

67
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:13,180
who's very foundation
is nothing but stumble.

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,350
If virtue fails to triumph
over evil than what, uh,

69
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,930
then this simply isn't a war,
a world worth living in. Uh,

70
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,090
that's, that's what I take the,
the, the elder brother to mean here.

71
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,900
These are unquestionably strong words and
I think it's impossible for us to over

72
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:37,431
mate over estimate the weight of these
words that the speech is more than just a

73
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,430
pious bit of optimism.

74
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,380
Like a lot of the speeches in fact that
the elder brother has given us. Um,

75
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:47,440
and we have to confess, I'm,
it's, it's more than that.
This speech is a challenge.

76
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,100
The elder brother is challenging God to
see to it that some kind of justice is

77
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,470
actually effected on this,
on this earth.

78
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,880
And so I'm going to be
placing a particular amount
of pressure on this passage

79
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:05,881
because this is the first
expense expression and
Milton have a very particular

80
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:10,600
kind of argument of a religious argument.
And it,

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,080
it's one that becomes central
to all of paradise lost. Uh,

82
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:19,081
the speech of the elder brothers is a
theodicy and theodicy is the term coined

83
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:23,380
by the 18th century
philosopher live minutes, uh,

84
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,560
which he had any applied
this term theodicy to just
that kind of philosophical

85
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:29,854
sentiment that's,

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,940
that's implied by its etymology that the
Odyssey is an account of the justice,

87
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:37,810
the decay of God a Theo or theos.

88
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,130
And so do you use the words with which
Milton would begin? Paradise lost.

89
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,510
A theodicy is an attempt to
justify the ways of God to men

90
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,640
know for a lot of Orthodox
Christians in Milton's time.

91
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,390
And I think we can say the same for a lot
of Orthodox Christians in our own time

92
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,890
to embark upon anything like a,

93
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,910
at all can be considered a heretical,

94
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:06,450
or at the very least Hetero
docs. A theodicy can be, uh,

95
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,210
can be seen as heretical
or even blasphemous for the
simple reason that it is.

96
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,230
Think of what it is zooms.

97
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:17,231
It assumes that the ways of
God are in fact justifiable.

98
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:22,421
A theodicy assumes that God's justice
can be witnessed and that it can be

99
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:25,430
accounted for here on,
on earth.

100
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:30,140
A theodicy assumes that the things that
things on earth actually makes sense and

101
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:34,010
that God's ways are ultimately
rationally accessible,

102
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,330
that they are comprehensible by human
beings and that God can in some way.

103
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,320
And this is, I think the, the central
implication of the elder brother here,

104
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:47,321
that God can in some way
be held accountable for his
actions to justify the ways

105
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:53,300
of God to men is essentially to put
God on trial for the actions that he

106
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:56,210
performs. And in the, of course,
in the central test case,

107
00:06:56,211 --> 00:07:01,211
this is what we all care about for the
unfortunate events that befall virtuous

108
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:06,190
people.
The next major poem that,

109
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:09,100
that Milton Rights after comas is
listed as you'll remember that, uh,

110
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,070
Milton published comas and 1637 and uh,

111
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:18,071
and it's 1637 later that same year that
Milton rights listeners and enlisted as

112
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:23,741
Milton looks back at the elder brothers
theodicy and it's almost as if he's a

113
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,140
attempting to test its validity. Uh, you,

114
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,050
you can think of Milton asking in this
poem, listeners asking if it's true,

115
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,320
is it true with the elder brother said
that virtue is all raise were awarded and

116
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:40,460
evil punished.
Now listen to us.

117
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,450
[inaudible] this is
undeniable is a stencil oddly,

118
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,500
and maybe more than ostensibly it's an LG.
It's a poem about a depth.

119
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,350
It mourns the loss of a friend of, of,
of Milton's from, from Cambridge. Uh,

120
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:59,030
the young man was named Edward King and
he drowned in a shipwreck and the Irish

121
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:04,031
sea shortly before he took up orders as
a minister for the Church of England.

122
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,860
And like so many,
and I mentioned this before,

123
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,470
like so many of the young men
studying with Milton and Cambridge,

124
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,210
a king was being prepared to
pursue a career in the church.

125
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,530
Now, and I don't think this
is unimportant, king was also,

126
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,080
it would seem he was also a minor poet,
an amateur poet.

127
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:27,530
I'm like Milton he wrote versus uh,
there there's,

128
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,600
there's nothing like a shred of evidence
that to suggest that a Edward King had

129
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,540
any talent whatsoever. Nonetheless, the
fact that he attempted to be a poet, um,

130
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,930
I think is important here.

131
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,640
Edward King in fact seems to have been
sufficiently well liked or admired that,

132
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:47,570
that when news of his death hit Cambridge,

133
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,240
a group has been as friends
organize something like an
anthology of poems in his

134
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,250
honor. And this is on the handout. The,

135
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,560
the title of the book is
a juice dot Eduardo King.

136
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Now Fraga obsequies on Edward
King lost at sea or drowned.

137
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,570
And now we have no evidence that king
was a particularly close friend of

138
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:14,430
Milton's. But nonetheless,
Milton was as an ambitious, uh,

139
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,090
literary figure in college.
Uh,

140
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,250
he was asked to contribute some verses
to the anthology and listened to us is

141
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:25,140
the product of that request.

142
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,890
And we shouldn't be surprised that
Milton has to be compelled to write this

143
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,190
poem. He's still in that awkward phase
of unreadiness and under preparation.

144
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,500
Now, readers have always seemed to have
agreed that that Melton's listened.

145
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:43,530
This is an enormously admirable poem,

146
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,080
but for a few hundred years now,

147
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:51,040
there has been a controversy over
how admirable Milton's listen,

148
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,000
this is specifically as an elegy, that
the poem is obviously magisterial. It's,

149
00:09:56,001 --> 00:10:00,270
it's, it's moving. And, uh, just about
everyone concedes that at many junctures,

150
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:04,090
it's a, it's, it's, it's,
it's extraordinarily, uh,

151
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,790
it's extraordinarily learned.
It's obviously learn it,
but it's also very moving.

152
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,640
This is the question now,
is it properly elegiac is listed as a,

153
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,850
an appropriate expression of grief over
the death of Edward King and does it

154
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,881
furthermore,

155
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:25,590
does it console others for their
grief over Edward King's death?

156
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,233
Now this is a,

157
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,080
this is a debate that fits into the same
category as far as I'm concerned as the

158
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,750
one between the elder and the
second brother. Uh, this is,

159
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,490
this is a debate that will
forever and forever be fruitless,

160
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,090
uh, because it's
unanswerable. Um, nonetheless,

161
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:47,091
I still think there's something about
this controversy surrounding this poem.

162
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,800
The poem as analogy that, that, that we
need to take is instructive because if,

163
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,000
if Milton's,
listen,

164
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:59,001
this isn't an expression of grief over
the death of King Edward King than just

165
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:02,070
what this is what we have to ask.

166
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:05,100
Then just what is it an expression of?

167
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,840
So
let us,

168
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,050
let us begin our exam examination
of this question with a,

169
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,800
with a consideration of the poems form.
Now,

170
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,170
the most distinguishing feature of,
of Milton's allergies,

171
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:22,500
the fact that it's a pastoral LNG,

172
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:27,240
it engages the ancient art of
pastoral poetry, uh, initiated,

173
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,990
made, made famous by the, the
great Greek poet theocracy,

174
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,030
which was later into imitated by Moscow.

175
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,160
And then finally by the Roman poet Virgil
in his celebrated pastoral EKG logs.

176
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,880
And you can see on the handout of those
poems by those classical authors that,

177
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,730
that Milton's listened to us is,
is most indebted to

178
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,071
the pastoral.

179
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:55,071
Lg is clearly one of the most stylized
and most self consciously artificial of

180
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,860
all of the poetic genres.
The,

181
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:01,861
the poet of a pastoral log usually
represents himself as a shepherd,

182
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,580
a shepherd mourning the
death of a fellow shepherd.

183
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:08,130
And he often explains that the
death of these shepard friend is,

184
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,460
is exerting a magical effect
on the entire natural world.

185
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,430
This is called the pathetic
fallacy. The trees, the rocks,

186
00:12:15,431 --> 00:12:19,810
the streams are all weeping for
the loss of the shepherd speakers,

187
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,530
a beloved companion. And it's at
this point in the pastoral allergy,

188
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,750
the conventional stereotypical pastoral
allergy that the poet Shepard sings a

189
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:29,740
mournful song.

190
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,290
He sings this song and Itchy in which
he recalls all those happy days that he

191
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:39,220
had spent with his shepherd
friend in the countryside.

192
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,770
So we have, uh, we have in the
pastoral LLG a generic form that's,

193
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:49,000
that's highly predictable
and it has not only,

194
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,021
not only now,

195
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:55,021
but I think on some level it has
always struck some of its readers as,

196
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:59,130
as ludicrous and, and we're not being
merely churlish. I think, um, if,

197
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:01,240
if we want to ask why,

198
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,260
why someone would want to write a
poem in such a form. Um, it, it, it,

199
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,020
as you can imagine,

200
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:13,021
it had long been out of fashion in
Milton zone day that the pastoral genre,

201
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:16,950
in fact, even for theocracies,
it's inventor, uh,

202
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,680
was always highly artificial.
A theocracy,

203
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,740
new know more about shepherds or sheep
or shepherd ases or Nymphs and seders

204
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,320
than you are. I know. And later urban
poets and [inaudible] was an urban poet.

205
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:37,321
Later urban poets like Virgil or Milton
Milton Hour Londoner knew even less than

206
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,820
theocracies.
We have to assume it's all,

207
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:44,821
it's almost as if the entire point of
a pastoral is that it is set in a world

208
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,670
that neither the urbane poet nor the
urbane reader has actually any real

209
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,420
experience with,
uh,

210
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,940
another way into this problem.

211
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:02,380
Let's look at the comments
that Dr. Johnson made about
Milton's listed as in the

212
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:03,530
18th century.
Um,

213
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,200
this is reading from the packet assigned
for today and I'm going to ask you, uh,

214
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:13,201
to do what you can to get through the
biography of Milton in the packet as well

215
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:19,510
as the notes on Milton's poetry that
we have from Dr. Samuel Johnson.

216
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,610
Uh, make sure you will have done
that by the midterm. Okay. Uh,

217
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:29,020
famously Dr. Johnson
couldn't bear this poem.

218
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,590
Listen us. Um, Dr. Johnson, the, the,

219
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,380
the greatest of all literary
critics of the 18th century.

220
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:39,700
And because Milton's poem is probably
considered to be the most important leg

221
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:44,530
written in any language by any poet
Johnson's assessment of it has become

222
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:46,120
famous, uh, for,

223
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,750
for being one of the most wrongheaded
evaluations ever made of a work of

224
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:52,100
literature by a great literary critic,

225
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,060
but inspired wrong headedness,

226
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,920
which is what I take a, which is what
I take Dr. Johnson to be guilty of,

227
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,590
is invaluable.
And so I want to quote Dr. Johnson here.

228
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:04,640
And this is on the handout.

229
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Listen to us is not to be considered as
the effusion of real passion for passion

230
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:16,940
runs not after remote
illusions and obscure opinions.

231
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,260
Passion plucks,

232
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:23,261
no berries from the myrtle and Ivy
Norcos upon Erath who's and [inaudible]

233
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Nortel's of rough seders and Fonz with
cloven heal where there is leisure for

234
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,570
fiction,
there is little grief,

235
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,750
it's form the form of the pastoral.

236
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,830
Lg is that the form of lists
of this is that of a pastoral,

237
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,970
easy,
vulgar and therefore disgusting.

238
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,861
Now I have to say,

239
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,250
although the last word is obviously
incredibly powerful and sort of wonderful,

240
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,990
it doesn't have quite
the punch that it does.

241
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,530
It didn't have quite the punch 'em in
the 18th century that it has for us now.

242
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:58,430
Disgusting really means literally
for Johnson merely distasteful.

243
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,470
It's still,

244
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,220
these are still strong words and there
has to be something more here than merely

245
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,210
Johnson's massive blunder.
As a literary critic.

246
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,680
Johnson tells us that,
listen,

247
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:14,681
this is not to be considered as the fusion
of real passion for passion runs not

248
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,700
after remote illusions
and obscure opinions.

249
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,650
And it's difficult to imagine
that an expression of,

250
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:26,480
of genuine grief over the death
of a genuinely close friend would,

251
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,080
would take the form of a poem
of a poem so learned, uh,

252
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,450
so filled with remote literary
allusions and obscure, obscure opinions.

253
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,430
Johnson obviously has a as a point here,

254
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,920
but we have to remember that king himself
was a poet or thought of himself as a

255
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:46,850
poet. He was a poet who died
before he could take up his career.

256
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,450
And it's not unlikely
that he wasn't married,

257
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:53,330
that he was also a poet who died
while he was still a virgin.

258
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,200
King's death provides Milton with an
occasion on which Milton is able to write

259
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:02,950
the most personal poem,
uh,

260
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,810
that he has yet written and
perhaps that he will ever right.

261
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,250
He gets to ask all of those questions
that are most pressing to him.

262
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,370
John Milton.
Uh,

263
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,170
what if the virgin of Milton were to
die before he was able to take up his

264
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:18,660
career? What if he died before he
was able to fulfill his promises?

265
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:23,661
The poet before he could
publish or make public his,

266
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,980
his talent.

267
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,880
The very structure in fact of Milton's
poem here is what Dr. Johnson would be

268
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,030
obliged to call a remote an illusion.

269
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,350
The poem is based most closely
on Virgil's 10th o'clock.

270
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,400
This is the poem in which the speaker
grieves over a death by imagining a

271
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:48,040
procession of mourners after the funeral.
And this really provides the,

272
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,510
the central rhetorical based for Milton's.
Listen,

273
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,580
US and the speaker of the poem mourns
the death of the shepherd poet listed us

274
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,840
and describes this parade,

275
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:02,160
this procession of mourners who
make their tribute to the deceased.

276
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,090
So look at line. Uh, I'll just, I'll,

277
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,690
I'll run through some of the
central sections here. Um,

278
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:11,160
line 76 to 84 we have the god of poetry.

279
00:18:11,161 --> 00:18:16,161
Fiba Sapelo himself who
makes an appearance in he
chides Milton for being so

280
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:20,910
concerned with earthly fame.
Uh, more on that later, uh,

281
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,890
line 88, the next section
Triton the herald of the sea,

282
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,960
he tries, he tries to make sense of listed
as his death. He asked the gods what,

283
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,970
what has happened to listen to us and,

284
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,970
and who exactly was
responsible for the sinking of,

285
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,840
of listed as his ship at [inaudible]. Then
in the next line, the next four lines,

286
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,460
we have Caymus, uh, the god
of the River Cam appears.

287
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,270
He Rem presents Cambridge
University, the Alma Mater, uh,

288
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,430
where Edward King and John Milton
had been students. And finally, uh,

289
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,820
at line lines 108 through 131,

290
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,780
we have Saint Peter,
he of the pearly gates,

291
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,620
Peter bursts onto the scene
and we have without question,

292
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:08,790
he's the most terrifying of all of the
mourners and in, and he gives an angry,

293
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,960
powerful vitriolic speech about
the terrible state of England,

294
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,890
the terrible state of
the Church of England.

295
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,330
And as a consequence of the
terrible state of England in 1637.

296
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,100
So the structure of this poem is
on an unquestionably Virgilian,

297
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:31,080
but the sentiments that are voiced and
this poem are unquestionably miltonic and

298
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:35,010
we will recognize them.
Um, who went Milton,

299
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,320
uh, could speak the poems.
Famous opening lines

300
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,260
turned to the beginning of looseness,

301
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,590
yet once more OEE laurels and once
more you Myrtle's brown with Ivy,

302
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:49,590
never see her.

303
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,200
I come to pluck your berries harsh
and crude and with forced fingers,

304
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:58,440
rude, shatter your leaves
before the mellowing year.

305
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:04,260
Bitter Constraint and sad occasion,
dear compels me to disturb your season.

306
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:08,100
Do for listeners is dead,
dead air.

307
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:13,101
His Prime Milton is lamenting once again
that Milton has been compelled to begin

308
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:17,251
writing.
Okay.

309
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:21,780
So Edward King had died and the editor
of the Edward King memorial anthology has

310
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:26,010
pressed Milton and to service what,
what could the young poet do?

311
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:31,320
Bitter constraint and sad occasion
are forcing, forcing him to write,

312
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,240
even though of course he is not yet ready.

313
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,180
The laurels and the hurdles
that he had that he addresses.

314
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:41,110
Here are of course the traditional
plants classically associated with,

315
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:45,960
with great poets, but for Milton and
his passage. Importantly, these plants.

316
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,890
Okay. These plants simply
aren't ripe yet. They're,

317
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:55,870
their berries are still harsh and crude
and they haven't yet had time to develop.

318
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,400
And Milton is telling us
that he is himself in the
process still in the process

319
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
of maturing. He's not yet up to
the task of a great poem yet.

320
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,070
And the only fingers with which you'll
be able to hold his pen and write this

321
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:12,370
poem are his forced fingers.
Rude.

322
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,060
Now you're right, you're right.
If you had the feeling that,

323
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,860
that you've heard a lot
of these same ideas before
Milton's, nearly 29 years old,

324
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,530
when he writes lists at us, uh, he,

325
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,300
he's making exactly the same disclaimer
that he had made in sonnet seven, uh,

326
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,990
or member sonnet seven. How
soon halftime, the song,

327
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,280
the Sonnet that he had written on the
sad occasion of his 23rd birthday,

328
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,950
uh,
that Milton had claimed there,

329
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:43,600
that he seemed to have all the outward
appearances of an adult male of a man,

330
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,340
but an inward ripeness
death, much less appear. His,

331
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:52,180
his poetic talent,
his poetic promise is poetic ripeness.

332
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:57,130
It hasn't yet burgeoned are
made itself manifest. Well,

333
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,910
this is six years later, six years
later when Milton rights solicitous.

334
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,030
He's is he,
he's employing this scene,

335
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:09,031
fiction of unreadiness and with filled
with all have the same anxiety of under

336
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:13,810
preparedness as insulin at seven
Milton rights. The first verse,

337
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:17,780
paragraph of this, of this
great poem. Uh, listen to us,

338
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,620
the first 14 lines in the
form of a Sonnet, essentially
the form of a sonnet and,

339
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,690
and the lines have a distinctly
a sonnet rhyme scheme, but,

340
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,401
but look closely,

341
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:32,080
it's not a perfect sonnet in quite the
same way that sign at number seven was a

342
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,580
look at line number four, which is
so clearly simply by looking at this,

343
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:40,990
you can tell it's deficient in the number
of syllables and there were only six

344
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:45,490
syllables heal rather than rather
than the, the, the conventional 10.

345
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,990
And it's this line and with
forced fingers rude, it's,

346
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:54,550
this is called a broken line or a half
line. And this broken line has, has been,

347
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:55,091
has been read,

348
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:58,960
I think rightly as Milton's indication
to his reader that he's not even up to

349
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,110
the task of writing a
Sonnet at this point.

350
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Anything he writes is going to be forced
compelled and with his forced fingers

351
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:12,970
rude.
He violates the formal presiding,

352
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,640
the metrical scheme of his
leg at it's very opening,

353
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,050
just like Edward King who
died before his prime.

354
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:23,980
Milton has to write this poem
before his own poetic prime.

355
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,670
And so it is with this deeply apologetic,

356
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,300
intensely hesitant beginning the John
Milton opens what many considered to be

357
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,490
the greatest poem in the English language.

358
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,650
The fact that the death here enlisted us
is the death of a young virgin poet at

359
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,830
the very outset of his career,
as you can imagine,

360
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,080
resonates in a lot of powerful ways.

361
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:55,610
The very idea that if figures so virtuous
could have been dealt such a tragic

362
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:59,150
and early death strikes, strikes
Milton or Melton speaker here as the,

363
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:03,950
as the rankest injustice. And it's
this sense of injustice that keeps, uh,

364
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,540
keeps pushing this log in the direction
of a theodicy and attempt to justify the

365
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:09,374
ways of God.

366
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Milton has to justify or
at least understand this
seemingly incomprehensible and

367
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,820
unjustifiable event.

368
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,190
And it's this drive to theodicy
that accounts for the poems.

369
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:25,210
Most painful moments.
Look at line 15,

370
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,790
this is where Milton asks the ocean nims,

371
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,850
the ocean nims where they were when
Edward King's boat was lost while crossing

372
00:24:34,521 --> 00:24:37,670
the Irish sea. Why, why
didn't you do anything?

373
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,510
We're worrying hymns when the
remorseless deep closed door,

374
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:43,610
the head of your loved listen to us,

375
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,650
if you loved listed as so much, how
could you, how could you let him die?

376
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,280
And no sooner has the, the speaker
asked this question and, and,

377
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,500
and you see this rhythm, this dynamic, uh,

378
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:58,880
a peer continually
throughout restlessness.

379
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,960
He asks the question and then immediately
he acknowledges the inadequacy of the

380
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:07,520
question. Look at line
55. I me, I fondly dream.

381
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,300
Had you been there for four?
What could that have done?

382
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,780
The nymphs of course are powerless and
we're seeing that the Nymphs as we know,

383
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:22,580
and of course as John Milton new are
merely fictions. This is all made up.

384
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:26,870
It's folly to think that we have about
us protective spirits who might actually

385
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:31,250
keep us from harm. And, and,
and, and Milton continues.

386
00:25:31,251 --> 00:25:36,251
What could the news herself that Orpheus
bore the Muse herself for her and

387
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:37,161
chanting son,

388
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:42,161
whom universal nature did lament when
by the route that made the hideous roar,

389
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,770
his glory visage down the stream was sent
down the swift Hebrews to the lesbian

390
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:53,150
shore. Why, why after all,

391
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:57,080
should we expect the Nymphs to have
helped poreless at us? Not even the news.

392
00:25:57,081 --> 00:26:02,081
Calliope the abused at that big poetry
was in a position to avert a human

393
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:05,890
tragedy like this.
Calliope hadn't even been able to,

394
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:10,910
to save her son the poet Orpheus when
the terrifying Bach I had torn his body

395
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,260
limb from limb when the terrifying
Buckeye had sent his head rolling down the

396
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:23,390
heat Reese river all the
way to the isle of Lesbos.

397
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,100
If, uh, if you've read a load
leg Ronelle Pencil Rosso, you,

398
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,340
you know that the image of
the great methodological poet,

399
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:34,970
Orpheus is always a
loaded one from Milton.

400
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:39,971
This is a myth that has and
will continue to haunt Milton.

401
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,010
I'm all the way up through
paradise lost. Um, let, let, let,

402
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,520
let's have a little review of the
career of the great poet Orpheus. Um,

403
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,930
as, as we get it certainly in a low
light grow and you'll pencil Rosso.

404
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Orpheus was the poet who had attempted
to bring his wife your receipt back from

405
00:26:57,511 --> 00:27:00,510
the underworld. And he did that
by charming Pluto with his song.

406
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,460
The attempt failed and saddened by your
[inaudible] death or Orpheus spent the

407
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:08,430
rest of his life avoiding
the company of women.

408
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,580
He kept himself solitary and chased.

409
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,970
He devoted himself to poetry.

410
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:19,530
He sang songs of such beauty that the
entire natural world w would move and

411
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:20,970
dance in response.

412
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:24,540
This is the story of Orpheus that we have
received up to this point in Milton's

413
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:25,374
poetry.

414
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,970
This is the story of the empowerment of
the poet is his empowerment through his

415
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:31,680
experience of a terrible loss.

416
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,040
And clearly this is a myth that Milton
is identifying with a very strongly here,

417
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,750
but the subject of, listen, this isn't
about, isn't the empowerment of the poet.

418
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,830
It's about the untimely death of a poet.

419
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:50,140
And so when the figure of
Orpheus appears in this poem,

420
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:55,141
it's the second half of the Orpheus
story that Milton is forced to tell,

421
00:27:56,531 --> 00:27:59,680
or if he is devotes himself to his
beautiful poetry and he keeps himself

422
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:03,640
sexually abstinent. He rejects all
of the advances of the, of the,

423
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,450
of the women who are attracted to him,
but the Pecan contest,

424
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:11,290
the the female followers of the God
Bacchus or enraged by what they take to be

425
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:13,690
his coyness,
they drown out.

426
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,620
Or if he has his music with the hideous
roar of their housings and their

427
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:20,830
screenings and they
tear him limb from limb,

428
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,080
the chaste poet

429
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,020
was unable to pass on injured
in that wild surrounding waste.

430
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:32,440
This violence was so terrible
that not even his mother,

431
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:37,150
the Muse calliope could
save him or if you said,

432
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:41,590
provided Milton with a paradigm of
the poet, the poet who's disciplined,

433
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:45,580
who's abstinence, nourished and
strengthened his poetry and, and,

434
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:48,310
or if he isn't a lot of ways seemed
like the perfect model of a poet

435
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,470
because he had the power to
do something with his poetry.

436
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:57,940
His verse actually had a physical impact
on the world. The rocks, the woods. Uh,

437
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,810
the trees danced in
response to Orpheus is music

438
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,930
in comas. Uh, the,

439
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:08,800
the lady had identified with Orpheus that
she described to comas what her speech,

440
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,420
what her speech about virginity would do.
Um,

441
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,070
if she were actually to deliver it,
if she,

442
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,220
she would bring all of comas is
magic structures down his head,

443
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:23,020
down around his head.
It's just this orphaned power that Milton,

444
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:25,900
like the lady was,
was always anticipating for himself.

445
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:30,250
He's been waiting and waiting
for his season, do so,

446
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:34,270
so that he can ripen into
a powerful or thick poet.

447
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,200
How then can we justify
the ways of God to man?

448
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:44,110
How can we justify the fact
that the abstinent or fee,

449
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,430
the virtuous Orpheus was so brutally
assaulted and without it any aid from the

450
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:49,420
higher powers,

451
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,790
it would seem that the elder brother and
his sister were way too optimistic in

452
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:58,510
their assessment of the protected
status of the virtue of the,

453
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,250
of the virtuous poet, the protected status
of the Virgin, the favored role of the,

454
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,870
uh, of the poet. Virginity does
nothing. Virtue does nothing.

455
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,250
Poetry does nothing.
All of the self discipline.

456
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,400
And all of the self denial
in the world can do nothing.

457
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,320
This seems to be one of the implications
of this poem can do nothing to protect

458
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,900
the poet from an untimely death.

459
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,500
It's at this moment that the poem reaches
a remarkable climax and I have to say

460
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:34,450
that this is actually only one of the
poems. Remarkable climax is there. This,

461
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:37,600
this, this, this poem has amazing
ebbs and flows throughout,

462
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,000
throughout its entirety,
but without question.

463
00:30:40,001 --> 00:30:43,990
This is one of the intensivist
personal moments in the elegy.

464
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Look at line 64 here we have Milton
asking himself all of those questions,

465
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,580
all of those vocational
questions that this fact,

466
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:58,060
the fact of Edward King's
death seems to open up for him.

467
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,413
Alas.

468
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:04,760
What boots it

469
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,280
with incessant care to tend the homely
slided shepherds trained and strictly

470
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:11,114
meditate.

471
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:16,510
The thankless Muse were it not better
done as others use to sport with Amaryllis

472
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:22,680
in the shade or with the tangles
of Nina Ira's hair. The the,

473
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:27,050
the, I think these lines at this
point, I'm going to read them again.

474
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,430
They're too important simply
to have been read once a last,

475
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:35,900
what boots it with incessant care to
tend the homely slided shepherds trained

476
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:41,380
and strictly meditate.
The thankless muse were it not butter,

477
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,040
better done as others use to sport
with Amaryllis in the shade or with the

478
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:50,540
tangles of knee IRA's hair at this
point in our reading of Milton,

479
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:54,290
I think these lines have
an amazing impact. We, we,

480
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,490
we've spent a couple of weeks now
reading Milton's declarations of the

481
00:31:58,491 --> 00:32:00,890
importance of the shepherds trade.
This is the,

482
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,540
the vocation of poetry
in this pastoral lexicon.

483
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,640
Nielsen's just written, uh, your, your,

484
00:32:07,641 --> 00:32:10,610
you remember he's written his father
and odd pod trim that the trade,

485
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,320
the vocation of poetry. It may be
homely and slided in his father's eyes,

486
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:17,510
but it was of course worth
all of Milton's time.

487
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,750
All of Milton's unsettlement care and
investment and now Milton's in the

488
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:28,480
position of asking what for. Look,

489
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,390
look, what's this all about? Look
what happened to Edward King.

490
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,270
What's the point of all of this study?
All of this work, all of this scent,

491
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,860
self-denial. If I could just wind up,
it's a, it's a, this is a good question.

492
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:43,660
If I could just wind up dead tomorrow and,
and now that I'm in,

493
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,520
now that I'm thinking of it,
why deny myself sexually?

494
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Wha why deny myself physical gratification
if I could just instead a sport with

495
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:55,430
Amaryllis in the shade or with
the tangles of knee, IRA's,

496
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,740
hair and Milton's asking in these lines,

497
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,340
not simply about actual
erotic entanglements,

498
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:05,180
but although I think that's there
a relation with women, but it's a,

499
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:07,400
it's a question about
erotic poetry as well.

500
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,820
Why can't he write love poetry,

501
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:14,210
secular poetry instead of
this much more discipline,

502
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:19,211
much more difficult mode of sacred and
prophetic poetry that he seems already to

503
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:20,900
have weathered himself too.

504
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,400
What's the point of making
life so hard for himself?

505
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,080
Look, now, and this is on the,
this is on the handout at the,

506
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:33,860
at the letter that Milton had
written to his friend Charles Dod,

507
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,590
this letter was written at nearly the
same time that Milton was writing lists at

508
00:33:38,591 --> 00:33:42,830
us. Um, he wrote a, and this too
is in the packet. Um, he wrote,

509
00:33:42,831 --> 00:33:47,420
listen to your body,
but in secret less dye blush.

510
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,930
And let me talk to you
grandiloquently for awhile.

511
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,390
You ask what I am thinking,

512
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,620
so help me God and immortality of fame

513
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,960
and we would we read. Can you
imagine getting such a letter? Uh,

514
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,030
Milton may well blush at this
extraordinary confession.

515
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:13,150
He is courting poetic fame
more shamelessly at this
point in his career than he

516
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:15,950
has before and perhaps that he will after.
But,

517
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:20,580
but the death of Edward King is really
forcing him to question the point of,

518
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,720
of his pursuit of, of
greatness, a poetic fame.

519
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,440
All of his ambition and the
poem continues at line 70.

520
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit
death rays that last infirmity of noble

521
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:39,860
mind to scorn,
delights and live laborious days.

522
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,700
But the fair Gerden when we hope to find
and think to burst out into a sudden

523
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:50,711
blaze comes the blind fury with the m
Horridge sheers and slits the thin spawn

524
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:57,890
life. It's the, it's the pursuit of fame,

525
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,370
the noble pursuit of fame
that spurs us to scorn,

526
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:04,000
delights and to live laborious days.
Uh,

527
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:09,170
as theme spurs us to pursue
the abstinent life of the poet,

528
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,300
it's the, it's the garden, the reward,

529
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,140
the prize of fame that we're continually
anticipating will burst out someday in

530
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:20,660
the, in a sudden blaze of glory. But
as soon as we hope to find that garden,

531
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,030
the golden ring comes the blind
fury with the imported sheers,

532
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,920
ouch.
And slits the thin spawn life.

533
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,440
The blind fury here is
the mythological figure,

534
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:38,441
a trope os this is the fate that cuts
the slender thread by which our lives

535
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:44,520
dangle and Milton Lens especial horror,
I think, to this image of a blind fury.

536
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:47,550
And I, I, I hope you will agree with
those critics. I didn't make this up.

537
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,170
Who find embedded in these lines
something like a figurative intimation of,

538
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,380
of castration,
like the furious Buckeye,

539
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:03,830
the furious eight [inaudible] emasculates
the man who dares to aspire to poetic

540
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:06,460
greatness with the Aborad sheers.

541
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,510
She cruelly punishes the virgin poet for
his failure to use the a and the one on

542
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:16,390
the one hand to use the sexual body
that God has endowed him with. Um,

543
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,750
but you also have the image
here of the poets death.

544
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,460
You have the image of the cutting
off the castration of the power of

545
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:26,790
generativity, all poetic potency, all,

546
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,800
all power to assert oneself
in the world can be severed,

547
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,680
uh, and, and, and the, and that's it.

548
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,410
And I don't think that the critics whose
who see here an image of castration or

549
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:44,700
just imagining it because there is
such a weird and just such a persistent

550
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,590
interest in the, in the human body and
especially in the poet's body throughout,

551
00:36:49,591 --> 00:36:52,560
throughout this poem,
Milton's focus on the body,

552
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,100
on the entire realm of the corporeal.
Um,

553
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,960
I'm hoping that it feels a little
strange to you. It, and it seems strange,

554
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:04,800
I think when you consider
what is obviously here,

555
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:07,860
the Christian context, uh, of, of,

556
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,690
of Milton Solicitous Orthodox Christianity
teaches us to put aside our concerns

557
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,970
for the body when we consider our death.
The Old Testament Prophet had said,

558
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:22,971
all flesh is grass and
important verse for the new,

559
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,770
uh,
the new dispensation of Christianity.

560
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:28,730
And the only thing that matters is
the salvation of the incorporeal.

561
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:30,870
Pauriol the body lists soul.

562
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,250
But Milton is so unorthodox,

563
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:39,870
or at least Hetero docs in his insistence
on the importance of the, of the body.

564
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,040
In this poem, look at the first
paragraph that begins at line one 32.

565
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,900
This passage, uh, Milton
asks the Sicilian Muse.

566
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,060
This is the muse of pastoral poetry,

567
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,650
asks the Muse to help him
strew the flowers, um,

568
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,210
over the hearse to strew with flowers.

569
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,600
The casket in which
listed as his body lies,

570
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,710
that the body of listed as even in death
is of an unusual interest to our poet

571
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:17,040
and the speaker employees.
This is an amazingly physical,

572
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:22,070
and I think it's even essential language
as he catalogs the flowers that he

573
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:24,810
imagines we'll cover,

574
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,080
listened to says body line one 35.

575
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,560
You valley's low,

576
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:37,310
where the mild whispers use of shades
and wanton wins and gushing Brooks on is

577
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,120
fresh lap.

578
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,350
The Swartz star sparely
looks throw hither.

579
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:50,130
All your quaint enameled dies that on
the green turf suck the honeyed showers.

580
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,770
Okay. Maybe the, maybe the elder
brother and comments was wrong.

581
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,760
The virgin his body.

582
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:03,710
Can't you remember that
amazing counterfactual
fantasy the virgins body can't

583
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,980
make perhaps worse. We're,
we're, we're acknowledging here,

584
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:10,880
can't be transmuted into spirit or soul,
but we can still tend,

585
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,190
we can nurse the dead body.

586
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:18,191
We can love lovingly care for it and
ornamented here and are very corporeal way

587
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:19,100
on earth.

588
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:24,100
It's an intensely erotic
passage decorating this image
of decorating king's tomb

589
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,770
with flowers and it's at the height of
this vision of our floral decoration of

590
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,340
listed as is her birth

591
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,370
that the speaker is suddenly
caught up short. Look,

592
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:41,790
look at line one 54 w we read
line one 54 and we realize we've,

593
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:46,150
we have been had, we'd have
just, we've been sucked in.

594
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:50,950
We have just participated in one of the
biggest cheats that poetry can offer.

595
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:55,480
I me,
the speaker cries in one 54 I me,

596
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:57,820
he says as he realizes,

597
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:01,900
of course there will be no flowers.
There's not going to be a hearse.

598
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,630
Why not? There's no body. There's
no body to decorate. What have,

599
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:10,150
what have you been thinking
listed us was drowned.

600
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,190
His remains are unrecoverable.

601
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:17,191
This is a terrible moment of realization
on the part of the speaker whilst the,

602
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:22,450
the shores and sounding sees wash
far away where I, I bones are hurled,

603
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:28,290
whether it be on the stormy Hebrides
where thou perhaps under the overwhelming

604
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:32,380
tide visits the bottom
of the monstrous world.

605
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,020
Milton's confronting here the, the awful
fact that lizard is his bones. They,

606
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,090
they'd been hurled to
the four corners of the,

607
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:42,190
of the sounding sees
they could be anywhere.

608
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,430
And as if that weren't terrible enough,

609
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:50,431
a realization he goes on to vision and
even more grotesque and four listed as

610
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,530
his body. He conjures surely
this is in decorous. This is, uh,

611
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,770
this is wildly inappropriate,
I think in,

612
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,240
in such a pious poem,

613
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,990
the in decorist image of the dead listed
as under the whelming tied visiting the

614
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:11,020
bottom of the monsters seats.
That word visit that gets me,

615
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,980
that gets me every time.

616
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:16,981
It's so inappropriate and ghoulish I
think in in this already sufficiently

617
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:19,420
ghoulish context, it's,
well, first of all,

618
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:24,100
it's like a parody of the epic journey
to the underworld that we have in so many

619
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:25,480
great classical texts.

620
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,400
And it forces us to think at least
for a moment here of listed us as some

621
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,470
ghastly underwater visitor,

622
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,050
a skeletal monstrous version of,

623
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:40,010
of Jacques Cousteau peering
into the unknowable, monstrous,

624
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,500
mysterious depths of
the bottom of the world.

625
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,150
This intensely intimate focus on the
human body is out of place and a Christian

626
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:53,300
analogy and it's,
and this of course Milton nose,

627
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,670
and it's because the investment
in the bodily world is,

628
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:01,310
is so great here that Milton ultimately
turns to the Christian vision,

629
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,690
the more familiar Christian
vision of a body Euless afterlife.

630
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,840
And this is how this logic goes.
We are all familiar with this.

631
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:13,841
Our body remains to molder in the
earth or welter in the ocean where air,

632
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,390
but our incorporeal spirit rises to heaven
where it can enjoy and a theorial of

633
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:24,620
body lists world of
eternity. And so Milton, uh,

634
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:28,430
concludes listed us with this standard
vision of Christian constellation.

635
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,860
This is on some level.

636
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,480
This is textbook Protestant
or Catholic Christianity weep.

637
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:38,920
No more willful shepherds
weep no more for listened to.

638
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:43,921
See your sorrow is not dead sunk
though he be beneath the watery floor,

639
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:49,510
so sinks the day star in the ocean bed
and yet a non repairs is drooping head.

640
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,870
This image of the afterlife
is is founded on the Orthodox,

641
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,060
a figure of for eternity.

642
00:42:59,061 --> 00:43:04,061
The body stays to the earth while the
soul like the daystar rises to the sky.

643
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,840
But when you, when you look a little
more closely at this conclusion,

644
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:14,590
I think you realized that Milton's
heaven is almost as invested in the human

645
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:17,540
body as Milton's earth had been
that they haven't imagined.

646
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:22,460
Here is is able actually to supply us in
fact with a better body than the one we

647
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:23,151
had down here.

648
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:27,230
When the speaker writes that the daystar
star yet a non repairs is drooping head.

649
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,740
We reminded of Orpheus.

650
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,840
We have an image here of a reconstituted
the repaired body of Orpheus who's

651
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:36,650
gory.

652
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:41,210
Severed head had been sent down the
swift Hebrews to the lesbian shore.

653
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,750
It's as if Milton can't let go of this
most unchristian attachment to the human

654
00:43:46,821 --> 00:43:47,181
body.

655
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:52,181
And I think it's fair to say that Milton
can't really imagine or fully invest

656
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:57,941
himself in the Christian heaven until
he can fully corporealize it and imagine

657
00:43:57,951 --> 00:44:01,550
it modeling. And this is exactly of
course what he will do in paradise.

658
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:05,660
Lost everyone in Milton's haven't
has a body. Even God himself,

659
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:09,830
the God himself in paradise
lost says nothing but body.

660
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:13,550
His body is the universe itself.
Listen,

661
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:17,300
listen to the physicality of the rest
of the description of Milton's haven't

662
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,820
enlisted us.
This is line one 72.

663
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,240
So listen to this sunk glow,

664
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,160
but mounted high through the deer might
have him that walked the waves where

665
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:33,161
other groves and other streams
along with nectar pure is Uzi locks.

666
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:39,110
He leaves and here's the unexpressed have
nuptial song in the blessed kingdoms,

667
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:43,740
meek of the joy and love their,

668
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,890
entertain him all the saints above and
solemn troops and sweet societies that

669
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:54,231
sing and singing in their glory move and
wipe the tears forever from his eyes.

670
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:02,460
Clearly the other groves in the
other streams are, are different. Um,

671
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,890
in, in heaven, uh, there, there, there,

672
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:07,770
there are different from the groves
and streams we have down here,

673
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,810
but they don't seem necessarily to defer.

674
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,470
I submit in their degree of physicality.
Listen,

675
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:17,280
this is going to shampoo his hair and
heaven much as he shampooed his hair on

676
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,130
earth except in heaven, there's
always a difference. Um,

677
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:25,150
it will be a nectar pure with
which he leaves his Uzi locks.

678
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,950
And even more important, uh, listed us.

679
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:31,920
We'll continue to sing in heaven
just as he had sung on earth,

680
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:37,140
except now he can hear the unexpressed
live that means inexpressible nuptial

681
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:40,530
song. We, we remember this song,

682
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,360
this is the song mentioned in revelation
14 that Milton is continually alluding

683
00:45:45,361 --> 00:45:49,940
to. And we saw him allude to just
this passage ad pod trim. Uh,

684
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,010
John The divine had
written in revelation 14.

685
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,330
You know this and they sung as it were,
a new song before the throne.

686
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,830
And no man could learn that song,
but the hundred and 40 and 4,000,

687
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,280
which were redeemed from the earth,
these are they,

688
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,080
which were not defiled with women,
for they are virgins

689
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,440
and it's virgin. Who, who,

690
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,890
who get to sing the nuptial song at
the wedding of the lamb that John also

691
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,160
envisions Milton can't allow himself
to embrace the wonderful fiction that

692
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:25,020
beautiful fiction that had been
espoused by the elder brother.

693
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,260
The fantasy that virgin is don't even die.

694
00:46:28,261 --> 00:46:31,890
That their bodies are simply
reconstituted somehow as angelic spirits.

695
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,180
That that was, that was, that
went too far. It was to pagan, uh,

696
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,070
way to unorthodox.

697
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,880
But Milton does permit himself the closest
scriptural version of that fiction.

698
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,940
And that's John's image in revelation
14 of the special heavenly rewards for

699
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:53,130
virgin poets.
Now,

700
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:55,710
you also looked at for today,

701
00:46:55,711 --> 00:47:00,420
the Latin poem that Milton wrote
not long after licit us. Um,

702
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,460
that's the poem.
Damon's epitaph,

703
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,080
the Epitaph Iom Day Mona's written on
the very sad occasion of the death of

704
00:47:07,081 --> 00:47:11,250
Milton's friend, best friend Charles
Dia Dadi who died the next year,

705
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,850
1638 that you remember,
this is the,

706
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:17,220
this is the young fellow that
Milton had confessed his,

707
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:21,540
his desire for a mortal fame to
look at the end of that poem.

708
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:23,370
This is page one 39 in the Hughes.

709
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:28,371
This is where Milton imagines
you have to turn to this.

710
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,390
He imagines dod just as he had imagined,

711
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:35,470
Edward King enjoying at last,
his heavenly reward.

712
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,950
And this is the English translation
because the poem is in Latin

713
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,460
because you loved the blush of
modesty and to stainless youth.

714
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,260
And because you did not taste the
delight of the marriage bed low,

715
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,680
the rewards of virginity
are reserved for you.

716
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:59,530
Your glorious head shall be bound with a
shining crown and with shadowing fronds

717
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:01,330
of joy as poems in your hand,

718
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,630
you enact your part eternally in the
immortal marriage where song and the sound

719
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:08,404
of the liar.

720
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,880
Can you even believe
what I'm about to say?

721
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,710
Where song in the sound of the liar are
mingled and ecstasy with blessed dances

722
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,570
and where the festal orgies
range under the heavenly thesis.

723
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,380
We, we, we know, we recognize
the song. This is the,

724
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:29,980
this is the song from revelation of the
virgin who could learn and seeing the

725
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:32,470
new song before the throne,
the throne of the Lord.

726
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,100
But Milton has obviously taken John's
image here and exploded the implications

727
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:41,790
of, of its erotic potential. Um, it's,

728
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,310
it's not just that virgin
virgin virgins are entitled, uh,

729
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:48,970
to sing a heavenly song.
As Milton is saying,

730
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:53,230
Dia Dadi is the heavenly reward in this
poem involves all of the sensuality,

731
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:57,730
all of the central experience that
was denied and repressed on earth.

732
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,450
This,

733
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:03,420
this Damon's epitaph ends
with a virtual orgasm of,

734
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,880
of Christian constellation as Milton
gives his best friend the most,

735
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,800
the most unbelievable send off that
is possible to give the heaven in.

736
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,760
This poem is so far from
being the Incor Pauriol,

737
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,150
the spiritual heaven of a,
of Orthodox Christianity,

738
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,400
that you have an image of an actual orgy,

739
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:24,220
the festal orgy raging under the thesis.

740
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:29,170
That's the Phallic Wand who's holding
this one? Presumably none other than the,

741
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:31,600
than the orgiastic leader God himself.

742
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:35,440
There's no other way to interpret
these lines, which as you can imagine,

743
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:40,310
critic simply, uh, pretend
don't exist because who, who,

744
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,130
who can,
who can figure out what to say?

745
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,720
Lou enlisted as Milton doesn't
let him himself, thank God,

746
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,340
go quite so far as he does in the,
this amazing ending to the,

747
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:54,070
to Damon's epitaph. And in fact, nowhere,

748
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:59,500
nowhere else do we see Milton
literally bursting out at the scenes,

749
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,770
um, as, uh, as, as he seems
to in this poem. But the,

750
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:06,940
but the unmistakable physicality of the
heaven imagined in the poem about Dhea.

751
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:08,890
Dadi gives us some idea,

752
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:13,060
I think of how to read by the end of
listed as the corporeal city of Damon's

753
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,890
epitaph illuminates.
We can see the,

754
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,990
the unorthodox direction in which
meals Milton's Melissa is tending.

755
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:22,420
So let me conclude,
let me conclude here.

756
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:27,070
Milton has wrenched this poem
away from Christianity and,

757
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,630
and he's forced it into a
direction that we could,

758
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,640
that we could loosely call paganism.

759
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:35,570
And it has been a slippage from Christian
spirituality into something like a

760
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:39,800
pagan naturalism. And it's a world
in which all things are physical.

761
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:43,640
All spirits,
like the genius Loci are physical,

762
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,540
palpable presences in the natural
world that the human body,

763
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,480
the world of flesh and blood that we all
inhabit have having some way at the end

764
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:59,030
of this poem reasserted themselves.
And in this final assertion of the body,

765
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,080
Milton,
I think is able to recover his,

766
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:07,730
his theodicy, his attempt to justify
the ways of God here on earth. Milton's,

767
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,170
Milton's listened. This is body
is still in some way a physical,

768
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:16,100
a physical one. And to the extent that
listed as his body has been recovered,

769
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,930
that it's been redeemed, Milton
is able, perhaps successfully,

770
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:23,420
Milton is able to justify
the ways of God to man.

771
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:28,160
He's able to justify the ways of
God to men here on the physical,

772
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,040
on this intimately bodily earth

773
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,570
listed as this is the last
thing I will tell you, as, as,

774
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:37,400
as you have no doubt experience,

775
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:41,930
this is a dense and difficult poem.
So please reread it,

776
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:46,880
um, in numerable times for the, for
the, for, for Wednesday's class.

777
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,360
And in addition to that, do the
other readings assigned. Okay.
