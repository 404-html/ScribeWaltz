1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,580
Traditionally in Renaissance Literature,
the muses,

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,680
and this will be familiar to many of you,

3
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,410
the muses are thought to
be the daughters of memory.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,550
And the the nine muses up on Mt.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,650
Helicon that's where the musicians
are believed to have lived,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,680
are the offspring of the
goddess of memory. Um,

7
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:24,430
who's name in the Greek is [inaudible]
and [inaudible], whose name is, is, uh,

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,270
is spelled with some difficulty,
is spelled on the,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,830
on the lower part of your handout.
Now there's an, there's an important,

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,600
there's an important
reason for this genealogy.

11
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,560
The idea that the muses or the
daughter of [inaudible] Mazda knee,

12
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:40,260
the goddess of memory in the,
in the renaissance,

13
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:42,570
the most important source of,

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,610
of poetic inspiration was often believed
to be the poets, the poet's own memory,

15
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:52,260
the degree to which the poet could
call up or just out of sheer recall,

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,470
literary toe point or
commonplaces literary commonplaces
stored in his or her a

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,680
memory from a lifetime, from a lifetime
of reading and, and Milton himself.

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,320
And this,
this seems to be true,

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,590
is said to have had one
of the most capacious,

20
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:15,060
one of the largest memories and English
letters he seems to have, or this is the,

21
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:19,830
the, the effect that we get, I think
for meeting reading, Milton, um,

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,550
is this notion that he seems
to have had one of the largest,

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,800
he's largest memories a imaginable
and that he's remembered just about

24
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,820
everything he's ever read.

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:35,130
Now we know that Milton was
blind by the time probably,

26
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:38,940
well before that time he
began writing paradise lost.

27
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:42,420
And therefore of course
he was an unable to read.

28
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,420
And even though there were
people, mostly young men, uh,

29
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,850
willing and able to read to him,

30
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,770
it's clear that the vast quantity
of learning that gets poured,

31
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:55,980
the all that air you addition that gets
poured into the pages of paradise lost.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,010
It's clear that this is
not a product of Milton's.

33
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,270
Last minute review of the classics,
uh,

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,850
this learning springs from the
recesses of, of Milton's memory.

35
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,240
I take this to be an undeniable
fact. Uh, but this is easy for us.

36
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:15,720
It's easy for us to say. It's easy for
us to say that it's Milton's memory,

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,580
which is the fount of so much of
the poems Aryeh edition. It's easy.

38
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,860
It's easy for us to say that it was
Milton's memory that fast facilitated, uh,

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,300
his grasp of the Christian
and the classical traditions.

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,350
But,
but I,

41
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,350
but I think Milton would probably feel
a little uncomfortable with our easy

42
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:41,070
attribution of so much of the
poems learning to, to his memory.

43
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,540
And that's because to suggest,

44
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,530
just think of it to suggest that Milton
is relying on his memory as he composes.

45
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,530
So elusively and so dependently
in a lot of ways. So,

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,330
so much of paradise lost to say that
is simply to say that the poem has just

47
00:02:56,331 --> 00:03:00,010
been generated by Milton and,
and not by God.

48
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,480
Milton has expended,

49
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,540
we know a considerable amount of energy
in establishing what he wants us to.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,060
I'm assuming what he wants
us to believe is the,

51
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,270
is the divine authority behind the poem.
This poem,

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,520
Milton tells us again and again has
been authorized by that same holy spirit

53
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,580
who, who had inspired Moses to
write the book of Genesis and so to,

54
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,020
in order to make a claim for such a,

55
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,350
an extraordinary claim
for divine authorization.

56
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,550
Milton has to defend against this notion
that I just began this lecture with the

57
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:38,180
idea that memory is on some
level really at the source of,

58
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,250
of Milton's poetic inspiration because
to rely on memory as simply to admit in

59
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,990
in some sense is to admit that
this is just one more epic.

60
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:52,710
It's to admit that this is in fact a late
epic and that it derives from a close

61
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,530
studious student like imitation of
the great epics of homer and Virgil.

62
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,820
Now you'll remember from our discussion
of the opening of vocation to paradise

63
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:11,170
lost that insistent bid
that Milton was making,

64
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,920
uh, the, the bid to be first.

65
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,810
His adventure is song is one that with
no middle flight intends to soar above

66
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:24,811
the Yoni and mount while it pursues
things on attempted yet in prose or rhyme.

67
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,270
And so Milton and it was so with such
pride that he declared that this poem was

68
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,710
going to soar above all of its classical
predecessors. But the, but the,

69
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,580
but the category pros or rhyme is a,

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,240
it's a large one covers just about
everything I, I would have to say. And,

71
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,180
and the, the, the literary spectrum from
pros to rhyme of course would have to,

72
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,430
would have to include the Bible as well.

73
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,320
And there's even the suggestion here that
that Milton will be pursuing things on

74
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:59,740
attempted yet even in,
even in holy scripture.

75
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,020
And that is an extraordinary
claim for the poems, originality.

76
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,430
But it's a difficult claim
because even as Milton,

77
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,140
even as Milton makes this claim, he's,
he, he, he manages to undermine its force.

78
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,850
Um, and, and, and Mirror Hughes
a usefully notes this in a,

79
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,530
one of the notes at the bottom of the
page that Milton in that line, uh,

80
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,650
things and attempted yet in proser rhyme,

81
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,360
Milton is actually alluding
to the opening of another, uh,

82
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,220
another romance epic. This is
the Orlando Furioso by, by,

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,430
by the great 16th century Italian poet.
Ariosto.

84
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,823
What does that mean?

85
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,080
That Milton has borrowed this claim
for an absolute originality for he's,

86
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,380
he's taken it from somebody else.
And in doing so, I think he's,

87
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:51,400
he's doing this deliberately and he's
exposing some of the darker ironies

88
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,810
behind his own literary ambition.
Oh by, and, and it's, it's a,

89
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,500
it's good sort of questions that gets
raised in such a problematic illusion.

90
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,790
How do you set out to write an original
poem within such a conventional genre

91
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,790
like the epic? What
does it mean to, to, to,

92
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,080
to be inspired to write by the
Christian Holy Spirit when,

93
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,260
when you're at epic in fact just
imitates a whole array of classical pagan

94
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:21,830
conventions and how can you write an
original poem when you're literary

95
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:26,630
consciousness is essentially made up of
the memory of all the things that you've

96
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:30,890
read before. So this is what I'll be
proposing over the course of this lecture.

97
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:35,891
That memory is a problem that paradise
lost is continually confronting a,

98
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:41,151
so much of the pathos of Satan's fallen
condition involves his painful memory of

99
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:47,760
that blissful state in heaven from
which he had he had fallen. And,

100
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,050
and, and the problem of memory is just
as important to the psychological damage

101
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,890
dynamics of the, of the fall
of Adam and eve. But as,

102
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,060
as we will see when we look at book
four but surely it's the problem of the

103
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,820
poets memory,
uh,

104
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,040
that that's the most troubling in in
paradise lost Milton's own faculty of

105
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,630
memory. This is, this is the,

106
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:10,510
this is the idea that I'm
going to be a floating here.

107
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,490
Milton's own memory seems to provide
something like or pose a stumbling block,

108
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,500
an obstacle for his attempt to write
an original divinely inspired poem.

109
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,390
And so I want to suggest in this lecture
is something that will initially sound,

110
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,050
I assume like a peculiar formulation.

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,080
There's a strange way in which Milton
has to imagine himself losing his memory,

112
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,300
losing his memory if he's actually
going to open himself up to the muses

113
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,970
inspiration, the inspiration of
the Christian. They haven't news.

114
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,960
And there's a sense in which Milton we'll
have to forget everything he's learned

115
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,900
up up to this point. And there's
some important signs, I think,

116
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:55,850
especially in the first two books of
paradise lost of what we can think of as

117
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,570
Milton's.
It's a literary fantasy,

118
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:00,920
a literary fantasy of forgetfulness.

119
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,660
Okay.

120
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,160
So you as a, as, as, as, as you may
well have gleaned from your reading,

121
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:11,300
the first books of the poem are
particularly absorbed with the idea of

122
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:14,900
forgetting because more than
any other part of paradise lost,

123
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,520
they display.

124
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,530
So ostentatiously the remarkable scope
of Milton's Milton's own memory of these

125
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,170
books are, are without, without question,

126
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,420
more heavily as elusive that
than any other books in the epic.

127
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:34,421
They are steeped in the entire literary
tradition of the underworld journey

128
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,150
that,

129
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:40,010
that stretches from the Odyssey of homer
up through a Virgil's Aeneid and of

130
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:42,890
course up through all of the
renaissance romance epics.

131
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,780
And it's, it's, it's important to
remember that that Milton will,

132
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,370
this is probably an invariable
truth, but I will, um,

133
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,940
I'll qualify it nonetheless that
Milton volt imitate his predecessors,

134
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,130
uh, only with a difference.
He usually will.

135
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,060
He usually takes pains, for example, in,

136
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:08,780
in his great depiction of
hell in books one and two. Um,

137
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,660
he takes pains to avoid the standard
epic scenes of the torture of the dam,

138
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:15,540
for example, with which
we're familiar. Um,

139
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,950
if we've read homer or virtual or,
or of course, uh, Dante much later,

140
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,091
but there are,

141
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,990
there are nonetheless a few details from
the classical underworld that he seems

142
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,070
to have lifted more or less,
more or less wholesale.

143
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,480
And one of them,
look this,

144
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:34,410
I'm going to ask you to look
at page two 46 in the Hughes.

145
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,060
This is line five 82 of book to

146
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,010
one of these little details that
Milton has has lifted rather,

147
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,870
um, rather directly is the, is the,

148
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,130
is that of the river leafy,

149
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:57,360
the river of oblivion that was believed
to run a flow in the underworld.

150
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,690
And it's a river that I think that
all classical writers and a lot of

151
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,620
renaissance writers, uh, are very
comfortable placing in the underworld.

152
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,990
So this is book two line
five 82, uh, Milton far,

153
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,570
far off from these slow
and silence stream leafy,

154
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,380
the river of oblivion rolls her watery
labyrinth where of who drink forthwith.

155
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,030
His former state and being forgets,
forgets both joy and grief,

156
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,990
pleasure and pain.
So in this context,

157
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:32,580
the river of oblivion serves an
obvious purpose in, in, in this,

158
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,150
in the context we have here in book two
to drink from this river would allow the

159
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:39,810
fallen angels to forget their,
their fallen state,

160
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,230
to forget the fact of their
fallenness from there.

161
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:45,180
More blissful former condition.

162
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,180
And on some level it would
forgetfulness would just ease, uh,

163
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,970
the grievous newness of this miserable
new psychological dynamic, um,

164
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:55,230
with which they are tormented.

165
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,220
But there's also I think a deeper sense
in which Milton in which Milton himself

166
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,510
might want to drink from
this slow and silence stream.

167
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,770
If Milton could silence,
see what you think of this.

168
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,100
If melted can silence all
of his literary memories,

169
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,530
perhaps he could better guarantee
his fresh intake of inspiration from,

170
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,850
from the Christian heavenly muse.
A, it's a, it's a fantasy of course,

171
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,060
because no such Bryant brainwashing
is going to be possible. Um,

172
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,140
just as the fallen angels,
if you look at line six oh seven,

173
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,030
just as the fallen angels will be barred
from drinking, their fill of the river.

174
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:40,500
Leafy forgetfulness is impossible.
The fallen angels,

175
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,650
they wish and struggle as they pass to
reach the tempting stream with one small

176
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:48,630
drop to lose in sweet forgetfulness,

177
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:53,631
all pain and whoa all in one
moment and so near the brink.

178
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,760
But fate with stands and to oppose the
attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror

179
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,240
guards,
the Ford and of itself,

180
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:09,510
the water flies all taste of living white
as once it fled the lip of Tantalus.

181
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,130
Yes, it's an amazing passage because in
a lot of ways I think Milton is actually

182
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,670
enacting,
directly enacting for us the reader,

183
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,540
the the impossibility of
such sweet forgetfulness.

184
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,160
As soon as he describes the impossibility
of forgetting a flood of classical

185
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:31,030
figures, pores, pores into his
own narration, and they, and they,

186
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:34,060
and they pour it with such a force.
I think that Milton permits,

187
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,990
I think this is a significant rift that
that fishers are fractures the otherwise

188
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:43,900
seamless text that, that we, that
we have in book two. There's,

189
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,850
I'm convinced that there's
something very strange going on.

190
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,060
Standing in the leafy of Milton's hell
is none other than the classical figure

191
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:57,040
that figure from classical mythology,
Medusa, uh, you, you know, Medusa,

192
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,390
she has the power with her snaky locks
to turn men into stone. And so she,

193
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,220
and so this seems to be unique.
Milton, Milton, I don't,

194
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,370
I don't know of any predecessor
that Milton had for this. Um,

195
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,860
Medusa having been placed
by Milton in the river,

196
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:16,060
leafy in the Christian underworld,
uh, can prevent, of course,

197
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,960
the fallen angels from drinking the
waters of oblivion, such as her power.

198
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,560
But we have every right
to ask what Medusa.

199
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:27,730
This is a figure from Greek mythology,
what Medusa is doing in a Christian,

200
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,250
in a Christian hell.
There are of course,

201
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:35,251
dozens of figures taken from the texts
of classic classical mythology who are

202
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,160
alluded to throughout the first two books.

203
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,730
But invariably they appear just as
Tantalus does in this very passage.

204
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,170
They appear within the
context of a simile.

205
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,630
They're not actually present in the
real world of, of Milton's hell.

206
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,060
Um, or if it's a, if it's a pagan God
who's mentioned, Milton will tell us that,

207
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:00,910
that,
that the Pagan God was just a later,

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,640
an earthly manifestation of one of
the fallen angels. But, but, but,

209
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,690
but at least within the context
of the present narration,

210
00:14:07,691 --> 00:14:09,400
the figures mentioned in Milton's hell,

211
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,700
all are all former inhabitants of the
Christian heaven and the fallen angels

212
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:19,360
themselves. Satan lock,
Bilio, mammon and BLS above.

213
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:23,830
These are all demons who are drawn from
the Judeo Christian tradition of demon

214
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:24,790
Knology.
Uh,

215
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,620
they've clearly been hurled into
hell by a Judeo Christian deity.

216
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,020
So this little moment, that's a little
bit, this Medusa moment we can call it is,

217
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,480
it's,
it's really quite strange within the,

218
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:41,080
in the midst of all of the
Judeo Christian realism,

219
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,740
we have standing here, a decidedly
pagan, and I think this is, uh,

220
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,770
not uninteresting, a decidedly
female presence. And,

221
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,880
and you'll correct me
if I'm wrong, but I, I,

222
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,180
I think I'm right to insist that
this is a unique phenomenon in,

223
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,900
in these books. Uh, I,

224
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,240
and I think there's actually a
reason for this, for this aberration.

225
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,050
Medusa can turn men into stone.
She subjects to them,

226
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:13,700
to that posture of absolute paralysis
that we've seen represented in a number of

227
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:17,620
the early poems. Uh, the lady,
the lady in Milton's mask was,

228
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:22,550
was stuck to her seat in the presence
of the Shakespearian magician comas and

229
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:26,480
Milton himself had claimed in the poem
on Shakespeare that Shakespeare dust make

230
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,120
us marble with too much.
Conceiving.

231
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,390
Shakespeare can turn us
to marble because he can,

232
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,620
because he can fill our imaginations
and leave us and capable of thinking for

233
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,700
ourselves, um, and capable of,

234
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,080
of maneuvering around maneuver
moving around on our own.

235
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,130
And I think it's possible to see Medusa
here as an emblem or some sort of figure

236
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,750
for a similarly paralyzing power.

237
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,890
You could think of Medusa as
Milton's counter muse, if, if, if,

238
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,440
if Milton's true muse or so he or so he
hopes there. So he wants us to believe,

239
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,510
um, has a, has a Christian origin.

240
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,860
Then this counter music is
unquestionably classical. She,

241
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:11,420
she's a daughter of no Mazany the
goddess of memory and she represents,

242
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,780
she represents that force that prevents
Milton from forgetting all of the Pagan.

243
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:20,240
And all of the classical literature that
of course he had spent so much of his

244
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:24,410
life reading.
Now I asked you to read for today,

245
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,330
uh, and I'm hoping you remember
some of the reading. Uh,

246
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,730
the Canto from Spencer's fairy queen,
that features that came of mammon. Uh,

247
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,480
the Cape of Mammon is the,
is the home of, of Mammon,

248
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:38,510
the money God who stores in his cave,

249
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:42,210
all of the wealth and all of
the honor that human beings, uh,

250
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,560
spend so much energy striving for now
Spencer's hero in book two of the Fairy

251
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:52,820
Queen is Sir guy and Sir guy
and descends and demands cave a,

252
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,580
it says Spencerian underworld and a,

253
00:16:55,581 --> 00:17:00,170
and it's in Mammon's cave that he
is tempted by the money God himself.

254
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,790
So this little bit of this,

255
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:05,810
a little bit of the fairy
queen is important for
Milton and all sorts of ways.

256
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,930
It's first of all,
a depiction of an underworld.

257
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,320
And so it provides Milton within important
Christian representation of a hell.

258
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,760
And so in that,
in that respect,

259
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:21,260
it has a kind of priority over the hills
or the underworlds of, of, of homer.

260
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,094
And Virgil,

261
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,510
it also provides Melton with the figure
of Mammon who will as you as you will

262
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:30,290
see over the course of this semester who
will become well here in paradise lost.

263
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,300
He's one of the the key fallen
angels in in Milton's hell.

264
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,790
Mammon actually seems to represent the
miltonic position or that position in the

265
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:44,390
debate in hell. That seems to
resemble most closely Milton zone,

266
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,330
Milton zone moral temperament we could
say and you'll see at the end of the

267
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:49,920
semester that's Cape of mammon.

268
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,720
Coke Canto is even more central to
Milton's sequel to Paradise lost,

269
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,130
Paradise regained,
which in many ways is a uh,

270
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,960
more or less close re rewriting
of Spenser's story with,

271
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,930
with Satan playing the role of Mammon and,

272
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:11,950
and Christ in the role of
[inaudible] the hero. Now you,

273
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,880
you also may remember
that we have already run,

274
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,150
we've already run into a Spencer's
mammon before this point,

275
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:23,610
before paradise lost,
a mammon had surfaced.

276
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,310
I'm testing your memories here.

277
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,170
Mammon had surfaced in the text of
[inaudible] and because this is one of the

278
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:34,170
most famous passages in the treatise,
and it's not one that we actually

279
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,280
looked at for mammon himself,

280
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:41,530
I'm going to ask you to turn
to turn to area up agenda.

281
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:45,450
This is page 728 in the Hughes,

282
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,980
the right hand column.

283
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,110
This is where Milton began to consider
the problem of temptation that of course

284
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:55,320
will become so important to paradise lost.
Here's a,

285
00:18:55,321 --> 00:18:59,600
Milton is talking about the temptation
of reading classical literature. Um,

286
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,730
Rita and, and this is, this is an
argument that we've examined before.

287
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:03,960
Read everything you can.

288
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,580
Milton insists because only then can
you overcome that what he thinks of and

289
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,370
characterizes as the
temptation of reading.

290
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,700
So on the right hand column of Seven 28,

291
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,930
I cannot praise a fugitive and
cloistered virtue on exercised and,

292
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:25,170
and breathed that never Sally's
out and sees her adversary,

293
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,700
but slinks out of the race where that
immortal garland has to be run for not

294
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,330
without Dustin heat.
I'm going to skip a couple lines here,

295
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,130
which was the reason why our why
our sage and Siri is Spencer,

296
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,360
who my dare be known to think a better
teacher than Scotus or Aquinas go to

297
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:45,840
center and Aquinas or
medieval philosophers.

298
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:51,950
Spencer describing to true temperance
under the person of Gyan brings him in

299
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,730
with his poem or through the Cave of
mammon and the bower of earthly bliss that

300
00:19:56,731 --> 00:20:00,240
he might see and know and yet abstain.

301
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,120
Spencer's Cave of Mammon is,

302
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:08,270
is central to Milton's to
Milton's understanding of
the Christians resistance of

303
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:12,240
temptation, the temptation posed
in aerial politica bye bye, bye.

304
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:17,160
Scandalous and seemingly non virtuous
books and Spencer Milton argues here,

305
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,030
knows the importance of reading
everything, the miltonic position,

306
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,710
however evil those books are
in and of themselves. Um,

307
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,620
we have to read them so that we
might see and know and yet abstain.

308
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,550
Now, this passage is famous
for for a lot of reasons,

309
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,370
not least of which is it's wonderful.

310
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:40,020
It's juicy evidence that it provides
for Milton's intense fondness for,

311
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:44,250
we might even think of it as a
passion for this earlier English poet,

312
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,390
but the passage is also famous because
in it Milton does something that he

313
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:53,650
almost never does. Uh,
Milton has made a mistake.

314
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,970
John Milton has made a mistake. He's
made a literary mistake. And as a,

315
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:01,600
as I think all editors note,
Spencer does not,

316
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,110
Edmund Spencer in the fairy queen does
not bring Sir guy in with his Palmer

317
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,330
through the cave of Mammon,

318
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,740
Gyan descends into the cave of Mammon
by himself that the Palmer has been

319
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,760
guidance guide up to this point.

320
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,080
His teacher and he and the Palmer
accompanies him on all of his adventures.

321
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:24,020
But this one and Spencer and
stands up to have this canto.

322
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,730
It makes it a big deal deal,

323
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:30,520
deal with the fact that that guy in is
descending into the cave of Mammon by

324
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:34,570
himself. He's been separated
from his guide. His teacher,

325
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:36,740
the Palmer milk.

326
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,780
Milton seems absolutely actually
to have forgotten something is,

327
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,120
uh, his memory has failed him. And, and
given the general importance that I'm, uh,

328
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,290
that I'm attributing to problems
of remembering and forgetting,

329
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,620
I think it's safe to assume that
something important is going on here.

330
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,280
The temptations that
mammon offers Gyan are,

331
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,480
are literally within the story itself,
temptations of wealth.

332
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,860
But they're also temptations, uh,
to the wealth of classical learning,

333
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:08,550
the wealth of the entire
classical heritage. Uh, you,

334
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,460
you'll remember that mammon has a special
place within his cave that's called

335
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:15,430
the garden of persona and
the gardener per syrup.

336
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,620
And it has within it all of the, the, the,

337
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:22,621
the central symbols of Pagan wisdom
and a beautiful epic literature.

338
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,780
Um, and, and you'll, you'll,

339
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,350
you'll perhaps you'll remember too
that Tantalus is present in the cave of

340
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:31,270
Mammon,
temptation,

341
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,370
literary temptation being as important
as all other temptations in this Canto

342
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:37,420
of,
of Spencer's,

343
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,120
that the temptations of
classical literature are so
genuinely tempting to Milton

344
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:47,350
that he finds it impossible to imagine
that guy and could have seen and known

345
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,490
and yet Epstein from them without
the aid of his teacher, the polymer.

346
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,753
And,
and,

347
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,620
and you'll note in this passage from
areopagite politica that Milton himself

348
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:59,440
calls Spencer a teacher.

349
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,530
Now he's a better teacher
than Scotus or Aquinas.

350
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,980
And the tech seems almost suggest that
Milton can't do without his own teacher

351
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,660
Edmund Spenser. Uh, Milton
Need Spencer, this is a,

352
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:16,360
an argument that's been amplified at some,

353
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:21,010
at some length and really
quite brilliantly by John
Guillory in the Book Poetic

354
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,310
Authority.

355
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:26,310
Milton Needs Spencer to
serve as the Christian poet
who can help Milton to fight

356
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:30,790
off the temptations of, of pagan
pagan poets like homer and Virgil,

357
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,420
or perhaps Spencer Spencer is a poet
who can help Milton fight off the

358
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:43,180
temptations of even as a
secular contemporary like,
like William Shakespeare,

359
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,490
the, the, the, it's,

360
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,120
it's almost as if the story of
Mammon's temptations of Gyan has,

361
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,570
uh, have, have hit a raw nerve in Milton.

362
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,600
Milton's lifelong
susceptibility to this story.

363
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,200
And that will without question
proved to be the case, speaks to a,

364
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,210
a truly profound ambivalence about the
pleasure to be derived from a reading of

365
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:07,700
secular literature.

366
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,380
Milton seems genuinely
ambivalent about the,

367
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,280
about all of the time and all of this
study that he has invested in his own

368
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:18,560
education to become an epic poet.

369
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:21,770
And I think that the metaphors
of investment here and, uh,

370
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,420
and of profit are especially applicable
since it's the figure of mammon.

371
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,410
It's the figure of Mammon who provides
Milton Milton with the literary version

372
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:34,580
of his economic account of Poetic
Investment and poetic profit.

373
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:41,260
So let's look at the first appearance
of Mammon in paradise lost.

374
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,160
This is page two 28 of the Hughes Book,
one line six 78.

375
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,590
Milton's describing the
landscape of hell and,

376
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,140
and hell here it turns out,

377
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,490
seems to resemble Milton's heaven
and that it contains deep within it.

378
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:02,930
And we would never have expected
this. It contains deep within it, uh,

379
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,660
uh,
soil that is hiding precious metals.

380
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,750
And so this is an underworld of course,

381
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,950
but there seems to be another
underworld resting just beneath it.

382
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,790
It's an underworld filled with gold that
a brigade of fallen angels begins to

383
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:23,380
extract with spades and pick axes.
Uh,

384
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,880
so this is what Milton
tells us at line six 78.

385
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,810
Mammon led them on this angelic brigade.

386
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,210
Mammon led them on Mammon, the least
directed spirit that fell from heaven.

387
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,730
And even in heaven, we're told mammon
was always looking down. It's a,

388
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:41,810
it's a kind of a cute scene.

389
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:45,770
Mammon was always looking down at
heavens golden pavement rather than

390
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:49,850
contemplating the more elevated figure,
uh, presumably of the heavenly father.

391
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,620
And inline six 84,

392
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,170
we were told this of Mammon
by him first men also.

393
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,860
And by his suggestion tot ransack
the center and with MBS hands,

394
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:08,210
rifled the bowels of their mother earth
for treasures better hid soon had his

395
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:10,070
crew opened into the hill,

396
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,180
a spacious wound and
digged out ribs of gold.

397
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,270
When we considered the degree of Milton's
anxieties about his own attachment to

398
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:23,560
classical learning,
I think we can see the significance of,

399
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,570
of mammon's actions here
that the image of men,

400
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,370
and it's a grotesque image of men rifling
the bowels of their mother earth for

401
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:33,580
treasures better hid it.
This is a group,

402
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,540
a disgusting and terrifying image of,

403
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,520
of a lot of things. But one of the things
I think that it's an image of is the,

404
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:46,521
is the practice of excavation to ransack
the intellectual treasures hidden away

405
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,860
in the landscape of, of literary
history is enact on some level of,

406
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,950
of a kind of violent desecration.
And Milton,

407
00:26:55,951 --> 00:27:00,120
I think would need to defend
himself from the implications of,

408
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,290
of this act of violence. And so Milton
calls on none other than his teacher.

409
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:09,291
Spencer Milton seems to have dug around
rather carefully in his copy of the

410
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:13,440
fairy queen and he's,
and he's come up with this illusion.

411
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:17,040
And so you can you actually see this,
uh, near the top of your handout,

412
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,040
the illusion, uh, from the fairy queen.

413
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,130
It's the passage from Spencer's Cave of
Mammon Canto that describes this same

414
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:28,650
scene of violation,
the violation of mother earth.

415
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,780
The first discovery of gold for
Spencer took place when a Curson hand,

416
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:38,810
the quiet womb of his great
grandmother with steel to wound and,

417
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,450
and Spencer just like Milton after him,

418
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:46,980
seems to be associating the digging
of gold with the pursuit of a buried

419
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:50,610
literary past there.
They're on the same wavelength here.

420
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:52,591
Now,

421
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:57,591
it's not entirely clear that Milton's
Milton has been successful in sufficiently

422
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:01,260
vilifying mammon's project of
the excavation of Richards.

423
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,790
And I think in a lot of ways,

424
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,050
and this could probably be set of Spencer
as well and a lot of ways Milton as

425
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:11,370
attracted to the excavation project.
Look,

426
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,700
look again at the sentence that I just,

427
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,870
that I just read the last lines soon
had his crew opened into the hill a

428
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:26,231
spacious wound and digged out ribs
of gold that the fallen angels maybe,

429
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,800
okay, they may be violating mother
earth. Not so great, but, but look,

430
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:37,490
look what this violation produces out
of the wound are Doug ribs of gold.

431
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,490
The, the, the what? The image
that seems initially, uh,

432
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,430
negative begins to resemble, begins
to resemble something I think quite,

433
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:50,580
quite important and quite
beautiful. And, and I'm,

434
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,300
and I'm thinking here of the creation
of eve and Adam will tell us later,

435
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:58,110
this is in book eight, when Adam
recounts for us the creation of Eve,

436
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:03,530
that God opened up my left side and took
from vents or rib wide was the wound,

437
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,680
but the rib he formed and
fashioned with his hand.

438
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,820
And when we remember that God will,
will,

439
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,470
will dig a rib out of Adam's wound
in order to create the beautiful,

440
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:20,130
the Golden, the Golden Eve.
We realize how complicated,

441
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:24,820
how complex and how ambivalent Milton's
Milton's little images here in,

442
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,220
at the beginning of the poem,

443
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:30,090
Milton is loading every rift
of this passage with aura.

444
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:34,260
And there seems to be something, at least
provisionally, at least for a moment,

445
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:37,230
there seems to be something
potentially redemptive,

446
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,400
potentially generative about the, uh, the,

447
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,110
about the active activity of excavation
that Milton is describing otherwise.

448
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:49,630
So negatively here that he's
condemning here. Mammon.

449
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,370
Mammon uses this extracted gold to
create that magnificent structure,

450
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:59,110
pandemonium and, and, and the function of
this structure is implicit in its name.

451
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,920
Pandemonium comes from
Pan, diamond, pan, demon.

452
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:07,210
It's the place where all of the demons,
all of the fallen angels will congregate.

453
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,660
This is their political capital.
This is where they will,

454
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,680
they will debate their future
and established an established,

455
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:17,260
a new political institution.
This structure,

456
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,900
and this is something that's
important for Milton to convey to us.

457
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,110
This structure is genuinely beautiful
and it's not entirely clear that Milton

458
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:30,040
wants us to think of pandemonium
as unambiguously evil,

459
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:33,280
clearly. Um, it's, it's
evil in all sorts of ways.

460
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:37,780
This is the fallen institution
established by the fallen angels,

461
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,520
but it's more complicated than that.

462
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,480
Look at Milton's description of
the architect of pandemonium. Um,

463
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,670
this is the man who appears is the
fallen angels enter the building at line

464
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:53,380
seven 32. So the architect
of pandemonium is Mulsa bar

465
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,180
and his hand was known in heaven
by many a towered structured hi,

466
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,130
we're sceptred angels,
held their residents and sat as Princess

467
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,610
[inaudible] was famous in heaven for
building beautiful palaces there.

468
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,620
And Milton lets us know that there isn't
actually that much of a difference at

469
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:19,310
least in terms of architectural or
aesthetic quality between the palaces of

470
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,110
Heaven and the palaces of hell.

471
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,400
It's almost for a moment at least it's
almost as if there were a strange moral

472
00:31:25,401 --> 00:31:30,401
equivalence between the palace is up
there in the palace is down here and a lot

473
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:31,550
of the rigid,

474
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,850
rigid moral distinctions that the poem
is actually been working rather hard to

475
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:39,851
establish are beginning to blur the line
between good and evil is beginning to

476
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:42,350
blur. Ah, look, look, look good.

477
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,560
Milton's account of what happened
to [inaudible] later on earth.

478
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,150
This is line seven 39

479
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,070
nor was his name unheard or unadorned
in ancient Greece and then I'll Sonian

480
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:59,850
land men called him bolsover
and how he fell from heaven.

481
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:04,851
The fabled thrown by angry jove sheer or
the crystal battlements from morning to

482
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:07,621
noon,

483
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:12,621
he fell from noon to do
we eve a summer's day

484
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:20,030
and with the setting sun dropped from the
zenith like a falling star on lem nos.

485
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,320
The Aegean aisle.

486
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:23,970
Yeah.

487
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,800
Milton tells us that the story of
[inaudible] in ancient Greece in,

488
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,730
uh, in, in Homer's account of the
Iliad, he tells us this story. Um,

489
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,470
and it's actually the Homeric version of
the story of most of her that you have

490
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,930
reproduced for you.
On the handout,

491
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:44,650
Milton is reminding us with this illusion
of the punishment of most supper and,

492
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,300
and the punishment,
uh,

493
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,670
and the punishment by implication
of all of the fallen angels by,

494
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,850
by an angry God.

495
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,660
But at the very moment that he's
telling us if multiple his punishment,

496
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,000
he's allowing himself to dilate,

497
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:04,001
to augment or to expand this beautiful
little nugget that's been excavated from

498
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:09,890
the pages of homer, and he allows
himself to linger over its beauty.

499
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,570
Just look at those lines again
from morning to noon.

500
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:19,571
He fell from noon to
do eve a summer's day.

501
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,580
If for a moment I proposed for a moment,

502
00:33:26,581 --> 00:33:29,520
we almost forget what, what's actually
being described in the passage.

503
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:33,330
It's as if the, the story of
[inaudible] the punishment has,

504
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,220
has come to a standstill. And,
and, and it's, of course, it's a,

505
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,260
with no smell help from Milton's
incredibly elastic blank verse here of the

506
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:47,280
Headlong Rush of multiverse fall has,
has been drawn to a,

507
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,180
to a provisional stop and it's,
it's been drawn out in spatialized.

508
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,660
It's as if it's been spatialized into
a scene of a beautiful summer's day and

509
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,950
we're left contemplating
not the punishment of evil,
but I dunno, we're left.

510
00:34:01,951 --> 00:34:05,430
One of the things were left contemplating
is the sheer beauty of Homeric poetry.

511
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,620
Milton has dug up a gem from
the pages of, uh, of the Elliot.

512
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:15,510
And this gym has something like a Medusa
effect on the poem or perhaps on us as,

513
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:15,781
as,

514
00:34:15,781 --> 00:34:20,781
as readers time almost seems to stop
when we begin appreciating this image,

515
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:26,040
uh, solely on aesthetic
grounds. But Milton of course,

516
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:30,750
Melton's a Christian poem poet and he
will not allow time just to stop forever.

517
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,650
For,
as,

518
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:36,150
for as soon as he explains that most
of birth fell like a star on Lemnos the

519
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,490
Aegean aisle.
He adds this,

520
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,120
okay.

521
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,120
Thus they relate whoring for he with this
rebellious route fell long before this

522
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:48,820
is so mean.

523
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:54,040
Thus they relate earning four.
He with this rebellious route,

524
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:58,780
fell along before just just as we were
beginning to appreciate the loveliness of

525
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:01,720
the classical tradition.
Milton reminds us once again,

526
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:05,050
he reestablishes the moral polls of,
of good and evil.

527
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,030
Thus they relate burring who cares,
who cares about homer says,

528
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,240
what did homer or any of Homer's
contemporaries know about?

529
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,280
[inaudible] fell long before homer because
Melissa fell long before the creation

530
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:23,440
of the earth and it's Milton and it's no
other poet before Melton who's finally

531
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:25,720
able to sec to set the record straight.

532
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,320
So Milton's insisting here that
all of the Pagan Deities, um,

533
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,920
had originally been fallen angels.

534
00:35:32,921 --> 00:35:37,090
He's providing us with something of a
prehistory of, of classical mythology,

535
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,310
a prehistory of classical mythology that
had of course been completely unknown

536
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,170
to homer and Virgil naturally,
uh,

537
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,360
because they didn't have the benefit of
the Christian story of the fall of the,

538
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,750
of the fall of the rebel angels.
Now without doubt,

539
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,490
this is a doobie theory of
classical anthropology and
Milton probably knows that,

540
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,211
but it's a,

541
00:35:57,211 --> 00:36:02,211
it's a theory that serves an
obviously useful function for Milton.

542
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,900
It allows the poet to appropriate all of
the classical literature that he wants

543
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:11,490
to because he will be able, in the end,
he'll be able to correct that literature.

544
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,050
He can compare the myths of homer,
the earliest myths we have.

545
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,130
He can compare them directly to the time
scheme of Christian history and prove

546
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:23,430
beyond a shadow of a doubt
that his own version,

547
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,360
that Milton's own version
of the story comes first.

548
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,730
So Milton may be writing after homer,

549
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,060
but the story he's telling comes first.

550
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:36,330
And this is one of the primary
strategies that Milton develops,

551
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:38,670
especially in the first two
books of paradise lost as a,

552
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,880
as a kind of defense against his
dependence on classical literature.

553
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,640
Now,
Milton may not be able to forget homer,

554
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,570
but he is able to correct
homer or to preempt homer.

555
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,610
Uh, let's look at an at a
later manifestation of mammon.

556
00:36:56,611 --> 00:36:59,730
This is in book to a line to 49.

557
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:04,650
This is page two 38 of the Hughes Book,
two line two 49.

558
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,130
This is a mammon speech during
the great consult in hell,

559
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,320
that the subject of the debate has
been the nature of the fallen angels

560
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,950
political future, where essentially the
question is, where do we go from here?

561
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,280
A molecule, remember, is the, is the,

562
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:25,281
is the military general general who will
risk absolutely anything for revenge?

563
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,470
Bilio is the,
is the lovely intellectual,

564
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:32,940
the intellectual seeking peace and who
prizes above all things is intellectual

565
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,910
freedom.
Our thoughts as Bilio puts it,

566
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:40,830
our thoughts that wander
through eternity and mammon.

567
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,720
Mammon is the profit tier.

568
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:47,721
Mammon is the Gold Smith's son who
wants to invest his talents within,

569
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:48,960
uh,

570
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,960
to invest his talents with labor and
with hard work in order to show a profit.

571
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,580
Mammon's advice is thus not
to seek revenge on heaven
or to give up as Bilio is

572
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:04,290
counseling to give up in despair,
despair,

573
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:09,291
but to cultivate all of the rich
resources that we have down here and hell.

574
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,580
Um, so line two 49 a book
to let us, this is ma'am,

575
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,900
and let us not then pursue by force.
Impossible.

576
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,500
By leave obtained.
Unacceptable though in heaven,

577
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:21,690
our state of splendid vassalage,

578
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:27,410
but rather seek our own
good from ourselves though
in this vaster assess free

579
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,120
and to none accountable,

580
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:35,510
preferring hard liberty before the easy
yoke of survival pump and a and a few

581
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,481
lines down and tells us that we will
work ease out of pain through labor and

582
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:44,950
endurance.

583
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,720
He's offering us essentially an economic
model that I think we as readers of

584
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:51,220
Milton recognize.
This is the,

585
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,460
the model of investment and profit that
had characterized Jesus's parable of the

586
00:38:57,041 --> 00:39:00,820
talents. And it's the model of investment
in profit that characterized so many of

587
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:04,270
Milton's zone Milton zone, early
writings, including that promise.

588
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:08,410
You'll remember to his fellow Englishman
that he would one day produce a work of

589
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:12,040
literature that is that his countryman
would not willingly let die.

590
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,750
Now it's,
it's Bilio for my money.

591
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,940
It's Bilio who gives us the most beautiful
in the most seductive contribution to

592
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:26,350
the debate in hell.
But it has got to be mammon who most,

593
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,630
who most resembles Milton himself.
It's,

594
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,150
it's mammon that comes
closest to Milton's own, uh,

595
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,490
this pure [inaudible] of a diff
does diff discipline, liberty,

596
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,700
hard work, and this kind of absolute
self sufficiency in, in, in, in,

597
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:42,401
in so many ways.

598
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:46,420
It seems that Mammon is actually echoing
a lot of the political pros that Milton

599
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:48,460
had written a decade before.

600
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,390
It's almost as if in
the character of Mammon,

601
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:57,391
we have Milton's parody of himself and
that cry let us seek our own good from

602
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:00,430
ourselves. It's a, it's
a perfect miltonic tag.

603
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,540
Four for the first two books for the
first two books of paradise lost,

604
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:09,541
Milton is always seeking a good from
himself that is morally superior to the

605
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:12,400
good of his classical predecessors.

606
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:17,401
Milton refuses the state of splendid
vassalage to a kingly poet like homer,

607
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,180
and he's continually seeking a good firm
with his own religious and from within

608
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:26,710
his own literary literary sensibility.
Now,

609
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:29,920
when these two books
we've seen Milton dig up,

610
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,910
dig up and discard just about the entire,
uh,

611
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,860
the entire tradition of epic poetry.

612
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,890
And it's at the end of book two that
Milton seems to complete this process,

613
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,380
this process of,
uh,

614
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:47,290
trashing of his literary predecessors.

615
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,420
And so it's here at the end of the second
book that Milton is finally ready to

616
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:56,140
embrace the poetics of his better teacher,
Edmund Spenser.

617
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,540
And out of nowhere,

618
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:03,570
and I know that all first time readers
of paradise lost are surprised by this.

619
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,350
Out of nowhere,

620
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:09,670
we have Milton engaging the
fine art of Spencerian allegory.

621
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,540
So let me remind you what's happening.
St and flies out of hell.

622
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,840
He journeys heroically through chaos
in order to find that new planet that,

623
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:22,000
that he's heard about, that he
had heard about, and heaven.

624
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:27,550
And he stopped by a figure who holds the
keys to Hellgate and who can determine

625
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:31,750
who will, um, who was able to, to, to,
to leave and who was able to enter.

626
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,950
Now it, it goes without saying that Milton
has not been up to this point, writing,

627
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,080
uh,
writing an allegorical poem.

628
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,470
The creatures moving and speaking have
been actual creations of the deity and

629
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,400
with a strange exception
of, of, of Medusa. And,

630
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:52,700
and they have a substantial reality
within the fictional context.

631
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:57,410
The mimetic context of this, of
this epic, the, these are angels.

632
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:01,730
They are individual creatures who seem
really to be in hell just as they seem

633
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:04,780
really to have been in heaven,
but the figures of sin and death,

634
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:07,970
this is an entirely different, they
are entirely different animals, uh,

635
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,570
are mere personifications
of abstract ideas.

636
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:16,570
And it's not at all clear that sin enters
son death exist as individual entities

637
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:22,280
in the same way or on the same plane that
Satan does, for example, or Beelzebub.

638
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:28,160
And it's reasonable, I think to invoke
dot. Dr. Johnson here, Samuel Johnson,

639
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:31,700
who writes in his life of Milton
that Milton's, I love this.

640
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,710
Milton's unskillful allegory appears
to be one of the greatest faults of the

641
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:40,190
poem whenever Johnson as being

642
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,310
arrogant and and mean about paradise lost.
And variably he's onto something.

643
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,470
And he's telling us that
Milton has gone too far.

644
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,630
He's taken his allegory too far.

645
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,840
He permits a real character like Satan
to interact with the merely allegorical

646
00:42:56,421 --> 00:43:00,860
or symbolic character like,
like sin and the effect for Johnson.

647
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,650
And who can say that
this is Johnson is wrong.

648
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,040
The effect involves an awkward collision
of different artistic modes and

649
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:12,230
entirely distinct planes of reality.
It's a,

650
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,240
I don't know if you've ever seen a movie.

651
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,920
Well there are lots of
movies that do this.

652
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:19,160
One of the first movies that did
this was the who killed Roger Rabbit.

653
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:24,020
If that's something you're familiar with
in which the interaction of real people

654
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:27,860
with what are called tunes
in that film is part of the,

655
00:43:27,861 --> 00:43:32,180
as part of the film's pleasure that the
boundary between different levels of

656
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:33,540
reality, uh, is,

657
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:38,590
is crossed and Milton's doing performing
a similar boundary crossing aesthetic

658
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:39,524
gesture here.

659
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,520
Now it might be morally useful to talk
about the forces of sin and death as if

660
00:43:45,981 --> 00:43:50,650
they were actual moral
agents. Uh, but, but it,

661
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,620
but it makes no sense within the mimetic
narrative that Milton has created for

662
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:56,210
us here in this realistic poem.

663
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,480
And I think that Milton is acutely self
conscious of the uncertain status that

664
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:06,200
these allegorical characters
that he has invented a have.

665
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:10,160
And so I'm going to propose this.
The idea that Milton's own allegory is

666
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,560
while it is a serious
allegory and it's uh,

667
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,200
and it's performing all sorts of work
that I don't have time to talk about it,

668
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:22,250
is at the same time a
critique of allegory,

669
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,470
a look at the description of sin.

670
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,880
This is a line six 48 on page two
47 of the Hughes before the gates.

671
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:35,580
They're sat on either side,
a formidable shape.

672
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,190
The ones seemed woman to the waist and
fair but ended foul and many escape the

673
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:46,080
fold voluminous and vast a
serpent armed with mortal sting.

674
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,700
Now those of you who've taken English one
25 or any course that has asked you to

675
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:54,450
read, Spencer will recognize almost
instantly I think, I hope, uh,

676
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,890
Milton's literary debt at the very
moment that Milton is beginning his own

677
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:00,810
attempt at allegory.

678
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:05,760
He alludes to the most famous allegorical
character by England's most famous

679
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:10,500
allegorical poet. This is
error, the filthy dragon us, um,

680
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,530
who charms us or doesn't charm us in
the first canto of the first book of the

681
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:21,150
Fairy Queen Like Milton sin,
Spencer's error is half woman,

682
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:21,990
half serpent.

683
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,980
And in a lot of ways she embodies
the very problem of religious error.

684
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,810
Dr. Johnson is his right to,

685
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:34,400
to suggest that Milton's use of Spin
Spencerian allegory only invites a,

686
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,110
a confusion of,
of what should,

687
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,950
what are essentially disparate
and irreconcilable categories.

688
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,810
But what Johnson doesn't
seem to understand is that
the confusion is precisely

689
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:46,680
Milton's point.

690
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,090
It doesn't make sense to speak of sin
and death as if they were living entities

691
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:56,050
capable of action and actual
influence, um, in the,

692
00:45:56,051 --> 00:45:59,950
in the, as if they were
living entities. Um,

693
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:04,260
moving about as agents in the world.
But,

694
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,240
and why is that for Milton's from within
the perspective of Milton's freewill

695
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:13,650
theology,
sin can't exist as an external reality.

696
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,550
It can't exist as a force that can
seize the human individual from,

697
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:22,080
from the outside without that
individuals consent. Because we are all,

698
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,090
we all freely sin. No one can be compelled
to do anything within the miltonic.

699
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:32,450
A theology of freewill sin can only exist
as the product of individual choices

700
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:37,650
that freely willing people like Adam
and eve or like Satan before his fall,

701
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,650
uh,
make.

702
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,140
And for Milton to purse the world and to
rigidly determined categories like good

703
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:49,860
and evil or sin and virtue
is simply to be guilty of,

704
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:54,060
of intellectual error.
This isn't how the world works in,

705
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,260
this isn't the miltonic universe.
So Milton is alluding,

706
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:02,190
so unashamedly here to Spencer's error
because I think on some level he wants to

707
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:06,900
brand Spencerian allegory as
an erroneous literary practice.

708
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,050
Now we've, we've seen Milton
do this before. He's, he uses,

709
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,340
and I'm thinking of uses
in a pejorative way.

710
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:22,340
He uses a poet like homer to extract
what beauty he can from deep within the

711
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,210
Homeric mines.

712
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,010
And then he does that only to turn
on homer with that devastating.

713
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,080
Thus they were late earning.
He doesn't even get homer.

714
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:37,060
The credit of being singular
and having composed the Elliot,

715
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,450
they whose day he can't even
bring himself to say us,

716
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:44,800
he relates earning so powerful.
Is this defense against homer?

717
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,740
Homer was in error. Milton told
us, and Milton cold on the voice,

718
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:54,220
the moral voice of Spencer to help him
make that moral judgment against homer.

719
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:00,810
But one of Milton's projects in paradise
lost is to affect his forgetting of all

720
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:04,180
of his literary precursors.

721
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,580
And that means that he has
to expel from his system,

722
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:11,380
not just home or not just Virgil and
Dante, but also his better teacher,

723
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:12,791
Edmund Spenser.

724
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:17,791
And it's almost as if we can hear Milton
say after he's given us his own really

725
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:22,150
quite elaborate display of
allegorical poetry. Thus,

726
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,680
Spencer relates burring.
Now,

727
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:30,640
Milton may have forgotten in 1644 when
he wrote the area Politica Milton may

728
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:35,641
have forgotten that Spencer's guy in did
in fact descend into hell without the

729
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:39,700
help of his teacher,
the polymer for Milton.

730
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:44,020
Then at least at that point in his career,
his literary career,

731
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:48,130
such a trip without a guide,
may well have seemed unthinkable.

732
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,290
The temptations of the,

733
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:53,200
of the wealth of classical
literature represented by Mammon.

734
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,550
Perhaps we're too powerful,
uh, to, to resist alone.

735
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:58,841
But now,

736
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:03,841
now in the 1660s I think it's possible
to see a way in which Milton finally gets

737
00:49:05,741 --> 00:49:09,220
the story right.
He realizes now that it is possible.

738
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,630
Perhaps it is possible for the Christian
poet to descend into the literary

739
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:18,631
underworld alone just as it was possible
for Sir Gyan in the actual fairy queen

740
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:23,250
to descend into the cave of mammon alone.
Milton surveys,

741
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,010
the wealth of literary tradition
before I'm any resists.

742
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,630
It's allure without the help of any,
without the help of any human guide,

743
00:49:31,631 --> 00:49:35,200
he can reject the beauty of homer.
He can reject the beauty of Virgil,

744
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:38,860
but he can also reject and this has
got to be an even greater challenge.

745
00:49:38,861 --> 00:49:43,450
Perhaps he can also reject the
help of his Christian teacher,

746
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:44,320
Edmund Spenser.

747
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,120
And so I'm going to leave you here at
the end of this lecture less with the

748
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:50,860
conclusion then with a paradox.

749
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:56,740
I think that Milton in paradise lost
finally remembers what actually happened,

750
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,490
what actually happened in
Spencer Spencer's cave of Mammon,

751
00:50:00,491 --> 00:50:02,440
how the hero triumphed alone.

752
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,460
But Milton remembers this particular
Spencerian story only once he has

753
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:14,971
successfully forgotten Spencer only
once he has set aside fully his,

754
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:20,600
his teacher's style of
poetry. Okay, that's a,

755
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,230
that's it for today.
Next time,

756
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,690
reread for the third time.

757
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,100
You will be repaid by your
dedication. Uh, books one and two.

758
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,140
This time focusing on the similes.
And also,

759
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:33,760
as I mentioned at the beginning of class,

760
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,430
read the essays by Stanley
Fish and Jeffrey Hartman.
