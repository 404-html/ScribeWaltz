1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,860
Paradise regained, um, except well

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,130
as anyone who's read and maybe there's
someone here in this room who has read

3
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,100
the continuation of the novel,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,460
Gone With the wind as anyone
who has read that knows,

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,140
or is anyone who's seen let's say the
bride of Chucky or fast and furious part

6
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:23,940
three nos.
Um,

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,620
sequels are rarely greater
than the original works,

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,500
whose stories they,
whose stories they continue.

9
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:36,501
And it's almost as if the diminished
appeal where something like an inevitable

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,900
and necessary fact of the sequel.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,330
It just comes attached to the notion
of the SQL. And I think that the,

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,550
that the disappointment aroused by SQL
SQL of any kind is a phenomenon about

13
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:55,090
which Milton John Milton as he wrote
paradise regained, must've been, um,

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,770
extremely aware. So, so
it's Thomas Elwood, um,

15
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,410
that was one of the young men who
acted as a secretary for Milton.

16
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:05,970
Um,

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,970
it was Thomas Elwood who claimed a years
after the poet's death that he had been

18
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:16,041
responsible for Milton's having
written the sequel to paradise lost.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,040
He recorded having told Milton,
um, after he had read it,

20
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:24,330
an early manuscript copy of paradise lost.
This is before paradise lost was even,

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,880
uh, in print. He, he, he,

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,570
he reports to us having told Milton,

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,600
thou hast said much here of paradise lost,

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,140
but what has thou to
say of Paradise found?

25
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,420
And then Elwood continues and it's,
it's a wonderful little bit of a,

26
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,370
it's a wonderful little
bit of information.

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,150
Milton made no answer to me but
sat sometime and amuse and I,

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,260
I like a lot of,
like a lot of critics of Milton.

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,460
I have a hard time believing that it
was Elwood squirmy little Elwood who

30
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,980
planted the idea of a
sequel to paradise lost in,

31
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,900
in Milton's head.

32
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:07,740
But I think it's nonetheless interesting
that this story has been so widely

33
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:11,620
circulated and it's almost
invariably cited by scholars of,

34
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:14,260
of paradise regained because
I think in some way, uh,

35
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,460
readers are looking for some excuse
really for Milton's having written it.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,350
Paradise lost seems in itself,
so absolutely complete and so magnificent.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,240
The idea that it requires this
equal, um, is, is one that is,

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,950
uh, it seems suspicious or questionable
too. A lot of Milton's readers now,

39
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,490
Milton's, oh nephew, Edward Phillips
described the way in which readers,

40
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:43,460
even in Milton's lifetime judge
the sequel to be the, the, the,

41
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,840
the inferior,
the lesser of the two works.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,330
And so Philip tells us in his biography,

43
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:52,310
and this is actually usefully included
in the back of the the Hughes Edition,

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,270
a Phillips tells us,
um,

45
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,220
that paradise regained is generally in
censured to be much inferior to the other.

46
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,050
The Milton could not hear with patients
any such thing when related to him.

47
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,100
And I love this image of the old man
impatient with any comment that might be a

48
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:15,190
little, the accomplishment of the, of the
sequel sequel. And I think it's a, it's a,

49
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:18,810
it's a moving, it's a moving
image and if Milton's nephew is,

50
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:20,920
is right here as I suspect he is,

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,670
then I think it's worth pursuing the
reason for which Milton might have

52
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,690
considered paradise,

53
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:30,280
regained the sequel to be the greater
work or a work in some way more

54
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:34,960
sophisticated and more
advanced than paradise lost.

55
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,220
And I think in a lot of ways
it is, it is exactly that. Now,

56
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,650
surely one of the first things
that we noticed when we,

57
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,990
when we read the sequel
to paradise lost is,

58
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,320
is really the radical radical
difference of its style.

59
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:51,430
The literary style or what we can
think of as the verbal texture of,

60
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,630
of paradise regained really constitutes
one of its greatest departures and

61
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:59,070
obviously one of its most deliberate
departures from the first step.

62
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,591
And all those,

63
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:04,591
most readers of regained find it's
less stylistically pleasing them.

64
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,970
Lost. Uh, Milton has, has embraced this
style, I think for an important reason.

65
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,150
He has very consciously imposed a set
of constraints on his verbal style,

66
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,940
a set of constraints on his
entire poetic imagination and our,

67
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,440
our appreciation of the beauty and
the meaning of this poem is actually,

68
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:30,990
I think inextricable for our
understanding of this poem. Um,

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,130
understanding of the, the, the, the,

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,760
the severity of the lesson that
this poem has to teach us. Um,

71
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,110
this poet, and we know this because we've
spent a lot of time with John Milton.

72
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:48,260
Now, this poet was instinctively
given to verbal excess, uh,

73
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,280
to an almost unimaginable degree and he
clearly had to struggle hard to reign in

74
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,750
a lot of his most powerful
literary impulses in order
to produce a work such as

75
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,751
paradise regained to work of such
seemingly charmless severity.

76
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,890
Um,
this poem has been scrubbed clean of,

77
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,860
of verbal and images stick extravagance.

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,240
I'm scrubbed cleaner even than the last
two books of paradise lost, which were,

79
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,120
which were themselves,
um, radical departures.

80
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:20,950
And I think in a lot of
ways paradise regained,

81
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:25,210
resembles a stylistically in
terms of it's verbal texture.

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,920
The last books of paradise lost.

83
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,150
Now Milton has purge this poem as
well of the Grammatical Obscurity,

84
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,300
the syntactical obscurity that
we found in paradise lost.

85
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,690
And you remember all of those ambiguities
syntactical ambiguity's that we're

86
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:43,690
always opening up far more signifying
possibilities that we could even begin to

87
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:44,524
deal with.

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Milton has clipped so many of those long
and wandering sentences into short and

89
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,810
unequivocal declarations and
he's replaced the lushness of,

90
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:59,780
of so many of those similes and literary
ornaments with what we can think of is

91
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:01,820
the puritan austerity of,

92
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,300
of simple argument and
simple statement of fact.

93
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,840
And this poem has been written
and what is often described,

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,500
um, now as the periods plain style, uh,

95
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,410
something like the conversational
style of unambiguous,

96
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,250
straightforward language
that was supposedly favored
by the Puritan clergy in

97
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:27,200
the, in the 17th century.
And I think that makes sense.

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,980
This poem has been written in what
we can think of as the plain style,

99
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,440
but if that's the case,

100
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,910
how strange and how
surprising that this poem,

101
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:42,440
which is written in a poetic language
as plain and unambiguous as anything

102
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,760
Milton ever put on paper,

103
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,300
how unbelievably odd it is that this poem
paints for us a world in which so few

104
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:55,550
statements can actually be understood.
Um, all of the, all of the,

105
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:58,700
all of the characters in paradise
regained. And I'm including,

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,410
there aren't that many of them, but I'm
including of course the son of God. Um,

107
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,010
all of the characters fail at sometime
or another to understand even the

108
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,970
clearest,
even the most perspicuous language,

109
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,300
a much like Adam in books 11 and 12 of
paradise lost the characters in Paris,

110
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,910
right? Gained or on some level
profoundly, uh, clueless.

111
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,240
And, and their cognitive incapacity,
which, which actually comes in a,

112
00:07:24,241 --> 00:07:27,590
in a variety of shapes depending
where you are in the poem there.

113
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,330
Cognitive incapacity usually involves
their inability to, to interpret fully,

114
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,760
um,
and to interpret accurately,

115
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,820
accurately a statement or a text statement
or a text that in our estimation,

116
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,330
um, seems to be just about as clear and
unambiguous as it could possibly be.

117
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:45,681
Now,

118
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:49,580
one of the texts that proves so puzzling
to the characters of paradise regained

119
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:54,080
is also a puzzle to Adam in paradise lost.

120
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:57,110
And so I want to look back at the ending
of paradise lost in order to see a way

121
00:07:57,111 --> 00:08:01,940
in which that poem had been
preparing us all along for,

122
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:02,774
for the sequel.

123
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,920
I,
um,

124
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,820
I think you'll remember our are
mentioning in class that odd and sometimes

125
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:15,020
irritating way in which,

126
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,830
which Adam was always jumping the
gun in his interpretation of, of,

127
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,750
of future Christian history.
The,

128
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,050
in the lesson that that Micah was
presenting him and one of the central

129
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:31,121
historical documents that Adam seemed
particularly predisposed to misinterpret

130
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,000
was what is known as the Prodo Evangelian
and that's been spelled for you.

131
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,740
Piaroti oh, eva. N. G. E. L. I. U. M.

132
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,200
That's been spelled for you on your
handout. So you don't need my um,

133
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,060
orthography right now. And, and, and,

134
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,940
and the protege evangelism,

135
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:54,941
which is the Greek for first gospel or
the first good news is one of the ways in

136
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:59,100
which Christians refer
to genesis 14 and 15.

137
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,530
It's the prophecy from the book of Genesis
that God delivers to the serpent God

138
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:07,380
prophesies that the serpents
eventual punishment.

139
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,690
And this is on the
handout that the serpent,

140
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:14,370
eventually we will be punished and I will
put enmity between thee and the woman.

141
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,460
And between thy seed and her seed,

142
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,490
it shall bruise thy head and
thou shalt bruise his heel.

143
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,410
Now, this is the anticipation of the end
as, as presented, as imagined in genesis.

144
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:32,540
And it's, it's this text that
the new testament uses, um,

145
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,550
to forge a connection
between the story of Christ,

146
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:39,180
which is obviously the new
testament story and the, the, the,

147
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:42,760
the first initial texts in the tradition,
which is the,

148
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,280
the story of Adam and eve. And so
for Christians, Christ of course,

149
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,020
is the woman's seed, the
great, great, great, great,
great, great grandson of, uh,

150
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:53,070
of Adam and eve.

151
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,840
And he will one day bruise the head
of the serpent who is interpreted by

152
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:02,100
Christians to be Satan, um,
even as Satan will be dogging,

153
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,100
um, his steps. Now,

154
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:08,940
the text of this prophecy
is reproduced and reworked,

155
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,310
I think almost to a compulsive
degree in paradise. Lost, um, uh,

156
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,590
allusions to the prophecy
in genesis agenda,

157
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,580
the pro to Evangelian appear foe in five
separate places in the last books of

158
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:22,860
Milton's, APEC and a, and an a,

159
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,090
an actually in far more places
than that in paradise regained.

160
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,020
This prophecy is a text that
has to be read and interpreted.

161
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,430
It's mold over and reinterpreted and
it's Michael's task in the last books of

162
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:39,000
paradise lost to teach
Adam how to read it.

163
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,070
Adam has to figure out,

164
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,810
and this actually and
itself requires a lot of,

165
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,910
of toodle edge on Michael's part.

166
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,540
Adam has to figure out that
the serpent is actually Satan.

167
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,660
That's nothing that comes
instinctively or intuitively to Adam.

168
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,960
And that of course the seed is the Messiah
who Adam will eventually interpret to

169
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:00,930
be the son of God.

170
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,280
And so let's look at the end of paradise
lost here because Michael is not only

171
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:08,750
teaching Adam how to, how to
understand the Proto Proto Evangelian,

172
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,140
but he's teaching us also,

173
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:14,100
I think preparing us to
read paradise regained.

174
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,510
So this is, um, page
four 63 and the Hughes,

175
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,500
it's book 10 of actually,
I'll be, um, I'll,

176
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:25,630
I'm going to be skipping around the,

177
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,390
the first passage that we'll be looking
at his book. 10 line one 79, um,

178
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,550
that's when the sun delivers
the prophecy to the serpent. Um,

179
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,420
and then at line 500 of book 10,

180
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,200
we see Satan trying to figure out what
the Sun could possibly have meant.

181
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,030
Book 11, line one 15 if you can
flip through pages fast enough. Um,

182
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,700
God himself explains to Michael in
heaven about the prophecy of the seed.

183
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,940
And then Michael due to flee relays this
message to Adam himself in book 12 line

184
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:02,080
one 50. Now, there's obviously an
excessive proliferation here of,

185
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:05,110
of prophetic statements so excessive
that you probably weren't able to flip

186
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:06,990
through your books nearly quickly enough.
And,

187
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,860
and it's no wonder that Adam is really
beside himself with such an eager desire

188
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,250
to get to get to the end.
I'm so obsessive.

189
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,770
Lee Is this prophecy of the end.
Uh,

190
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,370
presented it at the end of paradise lost.

191
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,410
Adam has learned about the birth of Jesus.

192
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,240
He's learned about the Messiah who
will actually be born of a woman, uh,

193
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,220
called the woman's seed
in the book of Genesis.

194
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,700
And he thinks he has this prophecy
of the seed completely figured out.

195
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,430
He thinks he understands now how the story
of Christian history is going to end.

196
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,080
So this is, um, lined
three 75 of, of book 12,

197
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,830
line three, 75 of book 12.
Um, at the top of page four,

198
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:55,750
63 Oh, profit of glad tidings, Adam says,

199
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,890
finisher of utmost hope.
Now clear.

200
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:02,350
I understand what oft
my steady his thoughts.

201
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:07,351
I've searched in vain why our great
expectation should be called the seed of

202
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,700
woman. And of course, and we,

203
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,890
and we're used to this because we read
the last two books of paradise lost.

204
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,140
Adam is wrong to think that he has a
clear understanding of what his Greg, uh,

205
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,070
of the great expectations of the end.

206
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,610
And he imagines once again with a kind
of singularly dull witted literalism just

207
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:32,500
how this prophecy of the seed is going
to play out. So at line three 83,

208
00:13:32,501 --> 00:13:35,380
Adam says, needs, must the serpent.

209
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:40,381
Now his capital brews expect with
mortal pain and a capital bruises,

210
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,290
literally a bruise to the head
say where and when their fight,

211
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:50,530
what stroke shall bruise the
victors heal. And Adam, of course,

212
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:55,531
has utterly imagined or imagine
precisely the wrong kind of ending.

213
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,510
This isn't going to be a physical fight,

214
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,020
who's victory can be pinned down to some
specific time and specific place, uh, uh,

215
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,050
kind of a terrifying event for which
tickets can be purchased. And, and,

216
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:09,740
and, and, and, and,

217
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,560
and Michael recognizes Adams
interpretation as a misinterpretation.

218
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,730
And so he, he corrects it.
And at line three 86, uh,

219
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:23,731
Michael Tells Adam this dream not of
their fight as of a duel or the local

220
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,890
wounds of head,
or he'll,

221
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:30,760
we're not supposed to imagine some
gunslinger show down at the end of time

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,010
between the Messiah and the serpent.
And remember that Milton Milton,

223
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:37,630
Adam is still imagining the
serpent being a serpent.

224
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:40,510
He hasn't yet figured out
that the serpent is Satan.

225
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,560
We're not going to have an actual war
capable of producing actual wounds.

226
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,020
And Adam of course,
in his defense,

227
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,280
and I think he does need a little
defending here, um, has in mind the story,

228
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,090
the war in heaven, the story of an
actual fight full of local wounds,

229
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,150
um, that, that all to local wounds,

230
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:04,151
they were healed instantly that Raefiel
had conveyed to him of course in book

231
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:08,510
six and which David Carrell had
a wonderfully explicated, um,

232
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:09,410
for our benefit.

233
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,250
But the battle that will turn out to
reconfigure all of Christian history isn't

234
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:21,041
going to proceed along the
vulgarly literal line set
forth in the war in heaven.

235
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,040
Um,

236
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,040
it's as if Michael is trying to tell
Adam to forget to forget everything that

237
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:27,381
it,

238
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:32,381
Raphael told him to forget
that monumental a war that,

239
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,200
that Raphael had had relayed because
that kind of thing simply isn't going to

240
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,034
happen anymore.

241
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,160
The fight between the fight between
Satan and the seed of the serpent and the

242
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:45,620
seed is going to be a much
subtler one. And, and,

243
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:49,940
and the Messiah will begin his destruction
of the serpent by becoming a man

244
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:54,650
himself. Uh, just just like Adam had,

245
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,940
had become a man at his, at his birth.
That seems to be pretty much the gist of,

246
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,170
of Michael's theology and paradise lost.
Well,

247
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,470
so Milton finishes paradise lost.

248
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,580
Evidently he begins Paradise regained
even before paradise lost has,

249
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,510
has found its way into print and paradise
regained his published four years

250
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:19,511
later in 1671 and paradise paradise
regained his published four years later.

251
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,140
And it's all about that redemption,

252
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:29,141
that regaining of paradise that Michael
had prophesied at the end of paradise

253
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:32,000
lost. And as you can tell
from the title of the Sequel,

254
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,920
Paradise regained is all about
returning and, and, and, and repetition.

255
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,960
And we shouldn't think that the same.

256
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,730
The SQL here is simply repeating
and elaborating on the ideal,

257
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,550
on the ideas with which the
original poem had concluded. Um,

258
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,590
now what's true,

259
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,590
the paradise regained does repeat the
Prodo Evangelian that prophecy that the

260
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,550
sun,

261
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,870
the sun's destruction of the serpent
that we finally figured out is actually

262
00:16:59,871 --> 00:17:04,580
Satan and approves just as obsessively
interested in that bizarre prophecy as

263
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:05,900
paradise lost was.

264
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,370
But this new poem repeats that
prophecy with a difference.

265
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,540
And I think there are all sorts of
ways in which the, the, the poem is,

266
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,640
is exploring and we exploring a lot
of the implications and a lot of the

267
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,730
consequences of the
very idea of repetition,

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
implicit or compacted in that
prefix re of paradise regained.

269
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,210
Um,

270
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,210
this is a work devoted to how the lost
paradise will eventually become the

271
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:40,700
regained paradise. And, and obviously for,

272
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:44,780
for Christians or Orthodox
Christians have almost, almost any,

273
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,830
any stripe,
um,

274
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,720
that regaining that redemption
will hinge on the atonement on the,

275
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:57,830
on the moment of the
crucifixion. Well, um,

276
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,230
that's pretty much out of
the question for Milton.

277
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:03,610
So we have to ask the question.
Um,

278
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,610
how does Milton account for that pivotal
moment in Christian history that the

279
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:12,720
turning point from the old covenant
with God to the new covenant,

280
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,030
how does Milton Imagine the shift from
Paradise lost to paradise regained and

281
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,640
the, and the answer as we have come, uh,

282
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,370
as we have come to recognize,

283
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,580
because if these are the kinds of the
answers that we get when we ask questions

284
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:28,980
about Milton,
the answer is as shocking one.

285
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,280
Milton quite simply doesn't mention,

286
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,430
and this is unspeakably sublime,

287
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,880
he just doesn't bother to mention
the crucifixion in paradise regained.

288
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,380
Um,
and and of,

289
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,320
of course we already know that the subject
of the crucifixion is one that Milton

290
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:49,300
has long had an awkward relation to.
Um,

291
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,200
he wasn't able to finish that early
poem with a passion, um, uh, that,

292
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,800
that he had written as a young man.
And in this new poem,

293
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,580
a paradise regained the story ends.
Uh,

294
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,790
the story ends before the crucifixion and
even takes place because for Milton in

295
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:07,200
this absolutely remarkable poem,

296
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,250
the crowning moment of Christian history
and the point at which lost paradise is

297
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,910
actually regained something that
we are of course all ourselves,

298
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:19,290
the beneficiaries of it has nothing
whatsoever to do with the sacrifice the

299
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,910
father sacrifice of the son.

300
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,470
And it has nothing to do
with a magnificent battle
for that matter between Satan

301
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:26,880
and the,
and the Messiah.

302
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,750
It's a moment mentioned rather briefly
in a couple of gospel accounts of the

303
00:19:33,061 --> 00:19:34,110
life of Jesus.

304
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,730
The Gospel of Matthew and the gospel
of Luke narrate the story of Jesus's

305
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,210
fasting. This all happens
in a, in a, in a, in a few,

306
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,820
in a few verses in the New Testament,

307
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,330
the story of Jesus fasting for 40
days in the wilderness and the three

308
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:54,300
temptations to which Satan subjected,
uh,

309
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,980
Jesus of during that time.
Now in the gospel of the loop loop,

310
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:01,710
which is the version that
Milton follows most closely,

311
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,220
Satan tempts the sun three times.

312
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,290
He asked this under turn stones
into bread in order to free himself.

313
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,580
He asked this, uh, and of
course the son refuses.

314
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,440
He asks the Sun to accept all the
kingdoms of the world as Satan Zone gift.

315
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,340
The son refuses and he asks us under
prove his divinity by casting himself off

316
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:29,040
the pinnacle of the temple
and the son refuses.

317
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,220
And that pretty much is it three
temptations and three acts of resistance.

318
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,990
And it is this simple, but of course,
never, nothing is ever that simple,

319
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:43,000
but it's this more or less simple,
um,

320
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,320
resistance of temptation in paradise
regained that constitutes the very center

321
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:54,280
of Christian history. This is, uh,
this is an extraordinary and for me,

322
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:58,780
unbelievable way of,
of rethinking and reimagining,

323
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,710
um, Christian theology
and the story of, uh,

324
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,850
and the story of Christian history itself.

325
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,860
The very premise of this poem is
I think a transgressive one. It

326
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,640
utterly, uh, changing all of the emphases
in traditional Christian doctrine.

327
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,080
The focal point, of course in Milton's
poem isn't, isn't really theological.

328
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:23,740
It's not mystical or sacramental.
It's ethical.

329
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,110
It's not the magic or the mysticism of
the crucifixion or the resurrection that

330
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,270
that has anything to do with
the regaining of paradise.

331
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:34,390
Here it is a simple and entirely,

332
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,400
I think an miraculous action
of behaving ethically.

333
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,500
It's something that any of us could do.
And as I mentioned a minute ago,

334
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:47,860
this poem is all about returning and,
and repetition.

335
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,060
And the pro do evangelism is a text
to which the characters are themselves

336
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,160
continually returning.

337
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,310
But there's another text that is
repeated if you can believe it,

338
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:04,600
even more obsessive. Lee, uh,
then that in paradise regained,

339
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:09,070
and that's the scene in which Jesus
is baptized by John The baptist.

340
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,040
The scene of the baptism is
narrated. First. It happens
right at the beginning. Um,

341
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,030
line 29 of the first book.
This is page four,

342
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:20,730
83 in the Hughes and we have
to look at this passage. Um,

343
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,080
it's narrated first in book one,
line 29 and following,

344
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,350
and then it's repeated and referred to
and worried about at least four times

345
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,830
over the after that. Over the course
of, over the course of the poem,

346
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,880
this is what we first learned on him,

347
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:44,320
baptized heaven opened
and in likeness of a dove,

348
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,800
the spirit descended while the father's
voice from heaven pronounced him his

349
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:54,460
beloved son.
Now we of course read these,

350
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,980
what I take to be these relatively
simple and unimaginative lines.

351
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,750
And if anything,

352
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,010
I think we should be overwhelmed by
their exceptional straightforwardness.

353
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,120
It's almost impossible to understand
what it is about this baptismal

354
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:14,950
pronouncement that could
prove so troublesome and so
difficult, um, in the poem,

355
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:19,240
but no one in the poem. And
that includes, of course,

356
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:20,440
the son of God himself.

357
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,720
No one in the poem has anything even
close to a clear idea about what these

358
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:26,890
lines actually mean.

359
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,110
And this radical uncertainty at the
very heart of the poem involves the fact

360
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,890
that these incredibly important revelation
is the product merely of the father's

361
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,810
voice,
the father's voice.

362
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,250
We're no longer in the world of paradise
lost where man can commune directly

363
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,130
with angels.

364
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,720
And even with the son of God and with
some frequency and with w with a degree of

365
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:55,310
relative ease,
nowhere in paradise regained his divinity.

366
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,780
Actually present.
Dad Isn't palpable.

367
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:03,380
It's not indisputably there
in the world of this poem.

368
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:07,190
And all we have is the father's voice,
his pronouncements or in other words,

369
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:11,960
all we have is a text,
just like the text of scripture

370
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,350
or in fact it is the text of scripture.

371
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:20,210
And the father has left us with a
little tay, a trail of his precedence.

372
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,040
Um, uh, in the form of the
words of the Hebrew Bible.

373
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:30,370
And everyone in the poem is desperately
scrambling to interpret this verbal

374
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:35,330
trail. These words and all of
this is a way of saying that the,

375
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,490
that the universe of paradise
regained is essentially to my mind,

376
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,730
a secular one. Uh, the world.

377
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,020
And this is essentially the world that
Milton had introduced us to at the end of

378
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:50,450
paradise lost. And in this
secular world, all con,

379
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,480
all one can really do is read the text
and try to figure out what it means.

380
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,500
And this is all the Satan and the sun
are in a position to do in paradise

381
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:04,250
regained.
And I think this is what gives this poem.

382
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,850
It's powerfully modernist feel.
Um,

383
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:12,851
it says skeptical and uncertain as it
is possible for such a profoundly and

384
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:19,100
piously religious poem to be. If I'm,
if that oxymoronic statement makes,

385
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,110
makes any sense. Um, look,

386
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,530
look at how Satan reacts
to the pronouncement of God
at the baptism that we just

387
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:30,350
looked at the pronouncement,
that this is my beloved son.

388
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,840
Lines line 33

389
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,570
that heard the adversary,

390
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,760
who roving still about the world at
that assembly famed would not be last.

391
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,270
And with the voice divine
nine thunderstruck,

392
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,840
the exalted man to whom such high a test
was given a while surveyed with wonder.

393
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,570
Satan rushes to the congregation of
angels assembled at the River Jordan. Um,

394
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,270
because he wants to hear
as the other angels do,

395
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,100
to hear the highest test that God is
bestowing upon this man from Nazareth.

396
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,760
This nobody who was the
son of Joseph deemed.

397
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,400
And it says it's at his hearing
of this divine voice that Satan is

398
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:20,990
thunderstruck. Now fender struck is, this
is, this is a striking word here. It, it,

399
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,000
it bursts out of this passage as
a little metaphor. And you know,

400
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,440
we're taking whatever we can get here.

401
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:31,520
We take note of it because Milton has
given us so little by way of Poetic

402
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:32,570
Metaphor,
um,

403
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,370
in this severely restrained
literary world of Paradise regained.

404
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:41,930
We're grateful. And, and, and the word
thunder struck is in fact, so striking.

405
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:46,560
And so that Milton has used
it only one other time in,

406
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,850
in all of his poetry and it,

407
00:26:47,851 --> 00:26:52,620
and it's clear here that Milton is
asking us to remember that earlier

408
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,690
occurrence.
So I'm going to ask you,

409
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,070
does anyone here remember where
else in Milton extra credit here?

410
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,380
Um, where else in Milton we have, we
have encountered the word thunderstruck.

411
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,373
Yeah.

412
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,300
Okay.
Uh,

413
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,140
you're no one in paradise regained
seems to have remembered the parent,

414
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:23,710
the appearance of the word either.
Um, and so you're in good company.

415
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,870
If we can't imagine the inhabitants of
the world of paradise regained having

416
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:31,090
been in a position to read paradise lost,

417
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,940
which is something I think that
Milton sometimes asks us to imagine,

418
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,640
although of course it's
preposterous. Um, uh, it's,

419
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,790
it's clear. I think that Milton is asking
us to remember that earlier occurrence.

420
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,490
Um, so I'm going to ask
you to turn to page three.

421
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:48,850
43 of paradise lost the Hughes Edition.

422
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,980
This is the climactic moment.
Oh, and actually I have, uh,

423
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,100
I've included this
handily on your handout.

424
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,960
This is the climactic moment in the
war in heaven at which the son of God

425
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,230
assumes the chariot of paternal deity,
you know,

426
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:10,231
gets in dad's car and proceeds to put
a decisive end to the battle with the

427
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:14,830
rebel angels.
This is what I'm Rapheal tells Adam,

428
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,980
the overthrown he raised and as a herd
of goats are timorous flock together.

429
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,840
Thronged drove them before him.

430
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,190
Thunderstruck pursued with terrors
and with theories to the bound.

431
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:28,450
And Crystal Wall of Heaven.

432
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:33,880
And it's at this terrible moment of being
thunderstruck by the awesome power of

433
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:38,881
the sun that the rebel angels
throw themselves headlong
down from the verge of,

434
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,800
uh,
down from the verge of heaven.

435
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,650
This is obviously an unbelievably
consequential moment.

436
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,210
This is the moment of the, of
Satan's fall. And I think there's,

437
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,240
there's got to be a point to Milton's
recycling repeating of this word,

438
00:28:55,571 --> 00:29:00,460
this striking word from paradise
lost. Um, in the new poem,

439
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:01,360
Paradise regained.

440
00:29:01,361 --> 00:29:05,620
I think he's signaling signaling some
kind of connection between the horrifying

441
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:09,550
moment of the sun's Vick from Satan's
perspective of the son's victory over the

442
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:14,050
fallen of the rebel angels in the
earlier poem and the Son's new victory,

443
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:19,180
or what's about to be his new victory
over Satan that begins at this moment,

444
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:22,270
century later,
centuries later at the son's baptism,

445
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,860
Milton alludes to that climactic moment
in paradise lost, but on some level,

446
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:29,830
this is an illusion that the
later poem paradise regained,

447
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,660
doesn't know what to do with.

448
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,870
And in fact never really does
anything explicit with Satan.

449
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:39,160
Is Thunder struck at the
baptism just as he was,

450
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:43,390
some thunder struck at the war in heaven,
but Satan himself is incapable.

451
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,990
And this is just in, in,
in genius on Milton's part.

452
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,820
He's incapable of understanding how
these two moments might be in any way

453
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,080
related.
Um,

454
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,350
I don't know what kind of television,
if, if any, you all watch.

455
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,650
Uh, but I do know that not
when I was an undergraduate,

456
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:06,430
but because we got such
terrible, um, reception in the,

457
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:07,690
in the days before cable.

458
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,870
But when I was a graduate student
and living off campus and I had cable

459
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:11,650
television,

460
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,650
I spent an inordinate amount of time
watching a soap opera is during the day.

461
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,760
It was a way not to write
my dissertation. And, um,

462
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:25,260
if you've spent as much time as I have
a watching thousands of hours of soap

463
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:30,130
operas, um, you know what it
means to be thunderstruck,

464
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:33,670
which is something I take it to be closely
related to being struck by lightning.

465
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,220
Um, there is, uh, at least
in the 70s and in the 80s,

466
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:40,450
there's a point in almost every soap
opera at least once every two or three

467
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:45,451
years in which someone is struck by
lightning and the consequences in variably

468
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:47,021
the same.

469
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:51,670
It's the condition of Amnesia and soap
operas obviously couldn't survive without

470
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:54,040
some recourse to the,
the Amnesia plot,

471
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,530
the lightening striking plot because it's
a way to keep all of the actors intact

472
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,530
but reconfigure the reconfigure and,

473
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,410
and spice up a lot of the plots because
the same actor gets to be someone

474
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:06,810
completely new,
uh,

475
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,850
because he has to develop an entirely new
life and new relationships with all of

476
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:16,840
the preexisting, uh, actors
and cast members. Um,

477
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:21,870
I think it's something very close to
Amnesia that Satan is struck with at this,

478
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,790
at this moment in paradise regained.

479
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
And it's as if Satan has at this very
moment repressed any memory of his first

480
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,710
having been thunder struck.

481
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,850
He has completely forgotten about the
son's role in the war in heaven. And I,

482
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:39,730
and I actually have to be
more specific than that. Um,

483
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,650
Satan is incapable of applying
to the current situation,

484
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,920
any memory of who it was,

485
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,830
who had beat him in the war in heaven.

486
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:53,410
He has repressed the
presence significance,

487
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,370
this significant for the presence
present moment of the sons,

488
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,390
the son of God's victory. And it's the
nature of this repression, I think,

489
00:32:01,391 --> 00:32:04,810
which is at the very center of Paradise,
regained

490
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,020
the central advanced that this poem has
made over a paradise lost is its refusal

491
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,220
to represent traditional epic action.
There's, there's no big battle here.

492
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,600
There's no war, there's no a huge
fight in which the woman's seed,

493
00:32:19,601 --> 00:32:21,610
Christ bruises Satan's head.

494
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:24,760
There's really actually
no overt action at all.

495
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,710
The hero quite simply does nothing.
And he just keeps saying no.

496
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,660
And, and, and whatever action this,

497
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,590
this text presents to us
is clearly psychological.

498
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,160
And the psychological problem that
I think overwhelms all of the,

499
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,490
all of the characters in paradise regained
is the simple fact that they cannot

500
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:46,430
manage for the life of
them to relate the cur,

501
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,110
the current story that they're inhabiting
to the events of Paradise lost.

502
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,920
They have forgotten paradise lost.

503
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,300
No. So let me, let me ask you
to think about the dramatic,

504
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,210
the dramatic situation of this poem.

505
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:07,130
Satan knows perfectly well that God has
prophesied that one of his sons will

506
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:10,330
rise up one day and destroy him,
and he's very,

507
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,990
he knows that this is going to
happen and he's very clear about the,

508
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,080
the certainty of the prophecy from Genesis
Three 15 and Satan even knows that it

509
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,820
is this man named Jesus
who's being baptized now,

510
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,290
who will one day destroy him and who
will one day would be responsible for

511
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,130
bruising his head.

512
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,480
But Satan seems for some reason to have
no way of knowing that the son of God

513
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:37,550
who will at some point in the
future be responsible for his doom,

514
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,070
is the same son of God who had devastated
all of the rebel angels and Satan

515
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:44,600
himself. Of course, in the war in heaven,

516
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,740
Satan has no way of knowing that the
prophesied messiah that he's dealing with

517
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:52,760
now will turn out to be the son of God.
The first forgotten.

518
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,410
He has no way of knowing that the
Messiah will be that same absolutely

519
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:00,470
insufferable angel whom the
heavenly father had promoted so,

520
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,660
so arbitrarily.

521
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:06,500
And so Austin spaciously above all of
the other angels in Book Five of Paradise

522
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:07,600
lost that,

523
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,110
the traumatic scene of that
exultation on this day,

524
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:16,460
I have bee got my only son to
him. I'll need shall bow. Um, all,

525
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,640
all him who disobeys me.

526
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,840
Disobeys you remember all of those
thundering words of the, of the father.

527
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,990
Satan is incapable of relating that
traumatic scene to this traumatic scene,

528
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:33,170
the tractor to traumatic scene that he's
witnessing now. This is my beloved son.

529
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,070
Um, at the baptism,
look at what Satan says.

530
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,350
It's excruciating and it makes us squirm.

531
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:43,430
I think I'm at the top of page four 85.
This is book one,

532
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,520
line 89 seems trying.

533
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Satan is trying to figure out what God
meant by his strange utterance at the

534
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:56,570
baptism. And you can see state and coming
so close to an understanding, but he's,

535
00:34:56,571 --> 00:35:00,170
he can't seem to make the final logical
leap. And it's a leap of course,

536
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:04,790
that I think we all feel confident that
we would have made or been able to make.

537
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,880
[inaudible] 89 this is Satan.

538
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,890
His first big we know and sore have
felt he's remembering the war in heaven.

539
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,950
When his fierce thunder drove us to
the deep who this is we must learn.

540
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,050
So he's able to remember that sensation
of being thunderstruck and paradise lost,

541
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,200
but he can't connect
it with the thunderous,

542
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:31,540
properly proclamation of the sun at
the baptism. If there's a, it's a,

543
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,960
it's as if we have a failure of,
of the synaptic nerves and Satan's brain.

544
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,470
Um, and, and he, he can't
make what seems to be,

545
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,090
it's to us the obvious
cognitive link. Um, and,

546
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:46,950
and I think his inability to
make that link is, is surprising.

547
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,330
But we have to understand that Satan has
been traumatized and it says if the war

548
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:54,870
in heaven had produced in St and something
like a post dramatic stress disorder,

549
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,470
and the nature of this disorder is his,
well,

550
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:00,870
I think it's perfectly understandable.

551
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:05,220
And just in a simple psychological terms,

552
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,480
you'll remember that the original
motive for Satan's fall was the father's

553
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,700
exaltation of,
of his beloved son,

554
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,300
his now beloved son above
all of the other angels,

555
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,110
and that the resulting sibling rivalry,
uh,

556
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,800
was the spur for all of Satan's
later actions. The dilemma of,

557
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:25,890
of sibling rivalry is at the heart of,

558
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:28,860
of paradise regained as well.
But,

559
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:33,450
but sibling rivalry in this poem exists
solely as a phenomenon that has to be

560
00:36:33,451 --> 00:36:34,284
repressed.

561
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,660
Satan simply cannot and will not make
the cognitive connection between the

562
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:44,661
rivalry he feels now to this
messiah character and the
one that he had felt that

563
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:50,820
primal originary rivalry that had
proven so devastating and paradise lost.

564
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,920
Now we may feel that we can understand
on psychological grounds there the reason

565
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:59,070
for Satan's inability to read the full
meaning of God's pronouncement at the

566
00:36:59,071 --> 00:36:59,904
baptism.

567
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,970
But I think the true genius of Milton's
poem is the fact that the sun is just as

568
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:10,920
clueless as Satan.

569
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,390
The Sun has even less memory.
In fact,

570
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:19,110
then Satan about his former
activities in heaven,

571
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,950
the sun can't even begin to reconstruct
what had happened in paradise lost

572
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,070
because in assuming his earthly mantle,

573
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:31,071
he seems to have suffered
an a much greater and much
severe case of Amnesia than

574
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:33,270
the,
than Satan had.

575
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,520
And I think it's this image of Amnesia
or some kind of repression or have some

576
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:42,300
sort of pathological for getting that
may provide the most useful way of

577
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,810
thinking about the relation of
paradise regained to the earlier poem.

578
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:49,350
Paradise lost. Now let's think
about it from another perspective.

579
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,020
In writing paradise regained.

580
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:57,021
Milton has clearly had to repress
everything that had been spilled on

581
00:37:57,781 --> 00:38:01,050
everything, but pretty much everything
that had been so liberating,

582
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:05,430
so revolutionary,
and so remarkable about paradise lost.

583
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,310
Now what might be,
it might be tempting to argue,

584
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,600
and it of course has been argued that
Milton is just getting old and he's

585
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:16,280
getting tired. He's not up
to all those similes now. Um,

586
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,080
but Milton has severed from his verse,

587
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,310
all of that luxuriant ornamentation
for a deliberate and I think a very

588
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:27,300
important reason he's
purging is verse of its care.

589
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Of what we now take to be
its characteristic beauty
because he too like the

590
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:38,091
Satan and like the son is
struggling to forget paradise lost.

591
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,020
And I think there's an important sense
in which Milton is thinking of the

592
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:46,021
beautiful verse style of Paradise Lost
as something like a temptation in this

593
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,970
poem. And it's a temptation
that he, that he has to resist.

594
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,630
Look at the scene of the second
temptation in paradise regained.

595
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,490
This is a page 500 of the Hughes.
This is book two, line two 89.

596
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,203
Um,

597
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,650
the sun is beginning to get hungry
understandably after his 40 days in the

598
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:07,450
wilderness. And He, uh,

599
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,050
he enters a pleasant grove
where he encounters Satan

600
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,310
only in a bottom.
This is line two 89,

601
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:19,870
a book to only in a bottom saw a pleasant
grove with chant of tune. Full birds,

602
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:23,230
resounding loud vid there he bent his way,

603
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,620
determined there to rest at noon
and entered some and entered soon.

604
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:29,771
The shade,

605
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:34,771
high roofed and walks beneath and alleys
brown that opened in the midst of woody

606
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:37,660
seen nature's own work.

607
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:42,661
It seemed nature taught art
and to a superstitious I
the haunt of would gods and

608
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:49,390
would nymphs. I think this pretty
little landscape that we have here is,

609
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:52,630
is rather jarring in the
context of the reserved,

610
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,220
the sparing pleasures typically afforded
us in paradise regained and it's

611
00:39:57,221 --> 00:40:01,480
drawing because this pleasant
grove remember, reminds us,

612
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:06,280
I think of in so many ways of the
garden of Eden from paradise lost.

613
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:11,170
Milton's description here is in fact
a tissue of Echos from book four of

614
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:14,590
Paradise lost where we're eating
opens onto a woody theater.

615
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,350
Just as this grove opens onto
a woody scene and, and, and,

616
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,530
and this grove appears,
seems to appear to possess,

617
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,240
would gods and would mimic as much as
diverse a paradise lost was filled with

618
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:32,350
the illusions to all of those classical
presences that Milton had cold from his,

619
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,690
his lifetime of reading
classical literature.

620
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,750
But here are the deities, a pagan
literature are branded as superstition.

621
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,800
Thus they relate earning
and all of those elements,

622
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,310
those aesthetic elements
that had made paradise lost,

623
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:51,520
so lovable,
so engaging.

624
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,790
And so when Tyson are now
branded as a temptation,

625
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,200
and it's as if the sun were being tempted
with something like the literature of

626
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:05,800
Paradise lost when he's presented
with this opportunity that he takes,

627
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:08,770
by the way, uh, to enter this
grove. And it's important,

628
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:13,370
it's important that the
son willingly enters a,

629
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:17,350
this pleasant grove that has been so
carefully fashioned of course, uh,

630
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:22,210
but by Satan and readers of this poem
rightly are always shocked. But by this,

631
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,630
by this moment, because this is
the son of God here after all.

632
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:30,010
And he's the very poor picture of virtue
and have perfect reason and he's made

633
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:31,510
this unbelievably stupid mistake.

634
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:35,090
This is like the mistake that red night
makes in the first Canto of the fairy

635
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:37,790
queen entering the would have error.
Um,

636
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,550
the beauty of paradise and by extension,

637
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:43,580
the beauty of paradise
lost is so tempting.

638
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,500
We could say that even the son
of God feels it's overwhelming.

639
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:50,360
Magnet magnet magnetic pole.

640
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,980
Milton I think is still though working
consciously here to renounce all of that

641
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:01,640
extraordinary poetic license
that he had taken in paradise.

642
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,410
Paradise lost.

643
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,540
And and this new poem explorers in more
depth and with more insight this the

644
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:10,843
merit,

645
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,060
the beauty of poetic renunciation
than any other poem ever has.

646
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:17,300
I'm convinced of that.

647
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,450
This is a poem all about denial and
repression and and its deepest and most

648
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:27,530
powerful meanings emerge. Not through our
sense I think of what the poem offers,

649
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,830
but our sense of what it's not offering
or what it won't permit itself to offer.

650
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,390
Now there's an obvious and explicit way
in which paradise regained is about this

651
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:42,410
kind of of negation or this
renunciation of paradise lost.

652
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:47,240
Paradise lost was about man's first
disobedience and the new poem Paradise

653
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,074
regained,

654
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:53,140
reverses that situation and treats another
man's unswerving obedience to God and

655
00:42:54,501 --> 00:42:57,250
obedience so severe that at
times I think it strikes,

656
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:59,960
this is on on thinking or unreflective.

657
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,700
That's just the obvious way in which
paradise regained works to to negate or

658
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:08,180
undo the effects of paradise lost.
But there's another,

659
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:12,800
there's a more significant way in which
Milton's later poem attempts to forge

660
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,290
some kind of connection
with the earlier one.

661
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,780
Ma Milton and the new poem is acutely
aware of his already having written the

662
00:43:24,141 --> 00:43:26,960
great epic paradise lost.
And in this,

663
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,570
in with this intense self consciousness,

664
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:32,660
it's an entirely new
neurotic burden for Milton.

665
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:34,911
Paradise regained,

666
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:39,560
takes up the problem that had proven
so difficult and so troubling to the,

667
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:42,710
to the younger Milton he needed,
takes it up once again.

668
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:43,940
But of course with a twist.

669
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:47,870
And this is the problem of
the poets career and it's
as if Milton can stand back

670
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:51,770
now and review the autobiographical
narrative he had written for himself as a

671
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:55,280
young man and take stock
in what he's accomplished.

672
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,150
So think of the basic situation that the
son of God finds himself in in paradise

673
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:02,270
regained even before they're remarkable
moment of God's pronouncement.

674
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,530
At the baptism,

675
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,300
Jesus had grown up with the knowledge
of his future role as the Messiah.

676
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,450
His mother had told him, his mom, Mary
had told him when he was a young boy, uh,

677
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,610
of what was to become what he was to be.

678
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,590
He had a very early age,

679
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:22,490
his sense of the important work that he
would perform at some future point in

680
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:27,080
time, but he didn't know exactly what
that work was going to look like.

681
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:32,081
And he didn't have a clue as to when he
was actually supposed to begin his work

682
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:37,551
and short the son of God before hand
before him a narrative of his career long

683
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:43,170
before he was able to imagine just how
that narrative was going to be fleshed

684
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:44,320
out.
Um,

685
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,410
and if this problem sounds
a little familiar to you,

686
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,990
that's of course because it is familiar.
This,

687
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,430
this is precisely the position that
the young Milton had found himself in.

688
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:59,670
He had declared at a very
early age that he was,

689
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,330
that he was chosen by God to write
a poem that his countryman would not

690
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:07,890
willingly let die. He was going to
be, um, England's literary messiah.

691
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:09,301
But,
but,

692
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:14,070
but that was years before he knew what
he was supposed to be writing about or

693
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:18,180
even when he was supposed to begin
writing. And as he says in paradise lost,

694
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:21,090
he was long and choosing
and beginning late.

695
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,440
And this is exactly the position that
the son of God finds himself in in

696
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:26,340
paradise regained.

697
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:31,440
Look at the top of page four 87 a book,

698
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:32,850
one line one 83.

699
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,560
This is the son of God,
trying to figure out what the father,

700
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,880
what the father must have
meant at the baptism.

701
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,910
Meanwhile,
the son of God,

702
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:53,150
who yet some days lodged in Bethesda
row where John Baptized musing and much

703
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:55,560
revolving in his breast,

704
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:00,180
how best the mighty work he
might begin of savior to mankind.

705
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,710
And which way first publish his God.
Like office.

706
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,190
Now mature. Now, if we
read this passage with,

707
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:13,330
with any sense at all,
any knowledge of its author,

708
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,280
I think that this moment in the life,

709
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,810
at this moment as a scene
from the life of Christ,

710
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:23,110
I dunno, it's, it's completely
absurd. This would, this is a,

711
00:46:23,111 --> 00:46:27,020
it's a ridiculous situation.
You have Jesus thinking, hmm,

712
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:31,300
I'm supposed to be the savior of mankind.
Let me think. What should I do first?

713
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:34,190
I'm, I, I'm, I'm really
confused here. It's,

714
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,810
it's no one else has ever and would ever,
uh,

715
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:42,280
imagine such a scene of a,
of the kind of career anxiety,

716
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:47,720
um, in, in some sort of narrative
involving the son of God. It's,

717
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,520
it's laughable to think of the son of
God is undergoing something like a,

718
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:53,320
a career panic attack.

719
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,210
But this passage is very
different and it's an assumes,

720
00:46:58,211 --> 00:47:02,530
I think an extraordinary
degree of significance when
it's placed in the context

721
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:06,610
of Milton's own ongoing
ruminations about his own career.

722
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,330
The son is asking himself
how he should publish,

723
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:15,660
how he should make public the God like
office into which he has now matured.

724
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,000
And I think it's impossible
not to hear in these lines.

725
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:24,030
The analogous concern that Milton had
himself revolved in his breast when he was

726
00:47:26,981 --> 00:47:31,981
pondering when he should publish or bring
into print the fruits of what he knew

727
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:35,170
was his god like poetic talent.

728
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,410
So I want to conclude
with this suggestion.

729
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,250
The suggestion that Milton
has transposed the narrative.

730
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:46,240
This is only one of the myriad things
that he's doing in paradise regained.

731
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,680
He's transposed the narrative of his
own poetic of development onto the new

732
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:54,580
narrative of the sons,
the development of the sun,

733
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,000
sense of his own identity.
And, and by saying this,

734
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:02,020
I don't want to suggest that all paradise
regained his is an autobiographical

735
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,250
poem. I'm convinced of course, that
it is an autobiographical poem,

736
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,780
but it is first and foremost,

737
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:12,010
I think a meditation on the
problem of autobiography.

738
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:17,350
Milton is in the amazingly
peculiar position of having,

739
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:22,470
of having written his autobiography long
before he'd actually lived the bulk of

740
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:26,750
his life. That's what all those
career narratives were doing, um,

741
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,350
that he had penned in the,
in the early 1640s.

742
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,140
How do you actually live a life,

743
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:37,570
the end of which you already know.
What's the relation of, uh, of the, uh,

744
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:42,190
what's the relation of the anticipated
life narrative to the actual experience

745
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:43,750
of living?
These are of course,

746
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:48,751
the questions that play Gaddam and eve
in the last books of paradise lost as

747
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:53,380
they, as they learned the, the
future history of their descendants,

748
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,410
but still have to go about the
business of, of living their lives.

749
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:00,940
And these are clearly questions that get
to the very heart of Milton's relation

750
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:04,480
to the prophecy of his own poetic talent.

751
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:09,340
And they're questions that we will
begin to, that we'll begin to approach

752
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,800
that we will continue,
um,

753
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:18,700
throughout this week as we approached
the problem that Milton Confronts when he

754
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:22,780
writes paradise regained.
Um, and that's this question.

755
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:23,890
What does it mean?

756
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:29,610
What does it mean after all to write a
sequel to the poem that after times will

757
00:49:30,371 --> 00:49:34,180
not willingly let die? Okay. Um,

758
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:37,540
I'm going to end there. I'm
going to ask you to, uh,

759
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,580
make sure you will have read all of
paradise regained, um, for Wednesday.

760
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:43,390
Okay.
