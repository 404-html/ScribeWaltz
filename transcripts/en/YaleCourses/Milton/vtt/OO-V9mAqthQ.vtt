1
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.840
In book four of Paradise lost.

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:08.060
Milton had sketched the origins of human freedom.
And,

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.150
and you remember this Eve's first memory her,
her,

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.600
her reflection on her reflection in the pool had established the importance of,

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.210
of freedom and also the importance of,
of,
of independence for,

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.960
for not only her relation with Adam,
but essentially all of human relations.

7
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.790
So Milton's concerned in book four was to establish something like the viability

8
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:37.590
of a freedom that was able in some way to coexist with what we discussed was a

9
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:40.800
hierarchical set of,
of power relations.

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.870
And this coexistence of freedom on the one hand and,

11
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:49.720
and social hierarchy on the other is something that this poem,
uh,

12
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.900
continues to assert.
Um,
and I,

13
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:56.130
I would also add that it's something that this poem continues to worry about.

14
00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:00.750
It's a,
it's an extraordinarily problematic but crucial element of,

15
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.070
of paradise lost.
Now,
let,
let,
uh,
I'll just,
uh,

16
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:07.800
I want to review a couple of moments and in book four,
um,

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.160
think back to what eve had told Adam after,

18
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.460
after she had been compelled by him and also by the warning voice after she had

19
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:21.180
been compelled to channel all of her erotic energies away from the beautiful,

20
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.350
sympathetic,
responsive,
a watery image toward Adam.

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.640
And Eve had said,
thy gentle hand seized mine.

22
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.750
I yielded,
they gentle hand seized mine.

23
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.290
I yielded.

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.830
And theirs is a continual dance of,
of seizing and yielding.

25
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.570
You have his assertion of power and her gracious resignation.
And,

26
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.130
and,
and,
and through,
although it's a gentle,
uh,
use of power on the one hand,

27
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.370
and it's a,

28
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.730
an independent and consensual resignation on the other.
And,

29
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.900
and through this dance,
Milton,

30
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.880
I think was trying to establish a model of human interaction really distinct

31
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.990
from,
from simple coercion are completely distinct from simple coercion.

32
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.990
It's distinct from the simple exercise of brute force that I think we often

33
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.020
associate with life in a hierarchically organized,
deciding

34
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.710
and human interaction in this poem is founded on a principle of,
of consent.

35
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.640
In the miltonic Commonwealth of Eden and we can think of it as a commonwealth.

36
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.670
Uh,
no one can be forced to act.
Um,

37
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.700
Eve has to choose to act.
She,
she has to consent to act.
She yields,

38
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.650
which is for Milton,
not actually a resignation.
It's a positive,

39
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.700
deliberative,
deliberate action.
And she has the,

40
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.080
she has the right of consent because she,
she,

41
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.840
she possesses for Milton and,

42
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.550
and inalienable capacity for free will and free choice.

43
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.510
So this account of,
of,
of Eve's first exercise of free will,

44
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.380
the one that I've just given you,
her yielding to Adam when he seizes her hand,

45
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.740
that's at least I think the official one that the poem urges us to accept a

46
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.600
according to the poems,
w what I'm thinking of the,

47
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:18.310
as the poems official philosophy because it seems to be a guaranteed or in some

48
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:20.020
way sub tended by the,
by the,

49
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.650
by the narrator and authoritative forces in the poem.

50
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.560
According to this philosophy,

51
00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:29.980
eve yields to Adam freely and willingly because she comes to recognize his

52
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.730
superior is superior nature.
And the poem presses on us,
uh,

53
00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:39.731
a philosophy whereby Eve's freedom is entirely compatible with the fact of,

54
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.400
or what we're asked to take as the fact of her inferiority to Adam.

55
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.850
And Satan himself explains perfectly,
uh,

56
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.400
th this philosophy and I think he gives us,
ironically,

57
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:55.450
it's Satan who gives us the best formulation of this coexistence of freedom and

58
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.670
hierarchy.
Um,
in,
in,
in the,

59
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.690
in the poem that freedom and hierarchy are absolutely compatible.
Um,

60
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:06.070
Satan will tell,
uh,
ab deal and book five,

61
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.420
four orders and degrees jar,
not with liberty,
but well consist.

62
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.350
We can in reason or in right assume monarchy or who can in reason or in right as

63
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:21.730
soon monarchy over such as live by,
right,
his equals if in power and splendor,

64
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.040
less in freedom equal,

65
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.830
but Milton's poetry,
uh,
well think how it is.
First of all,

66
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:34.360
that it's Satan who's giving us something like the only,
uh,

67
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.940
carefully articulated authoritative position on this,
uh,
to say the least.

68
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.010
This controversial matter,
um,

69
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.070
say Milton's poetry is invariably more sophisticated than what we can think of

70
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:51.280
as the official dogma or the authoritative line of the poem.

71
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.530
Perhaps that that fact is revealed or exposed to us by the fact that it's Satan

72
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:01.360
who's giving us,
in this instance,
the authoritative line.
It's important to keep,

73
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.900
uh,

74
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.760
this distinction in mind because this poem simply cannot be reduced.

75
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.490
Sometimes it tries to be reduced,

76
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:14.491
but it cannot be reduced to those ringing declarations of what sound like the

77
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:16.540
official positions of the poem.

78
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:21.541
So think how complicated it is with Eve eve account of that beautiful pool side,

79
00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:26.860
reverie was so filled with,
with pathos and,
and longing,

80
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.470
uh,
that it's impossible.

81
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:33.160
I think not to feel at least a little bit of disappointment when she consents

82
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.850
finally to her union with Adam.
It's,
it's almost,
I don't know,

83
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:40.040
there's kind of a sense in which she's sold out as a,

84
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:44.670
of course we're happy that she has a mate who's another person and not merely

85
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.930
merely a smooth watery image.
Nonetheless,

86
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:50.800
there's a sense of disappointment that attends that choice that she makes.

87
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.200
And initially for Eve,

88
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.060
I'm at least convinced there seemed to be nothing like freedom at all.

89
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.810
She remembers having gazed at that pleasing image in the reflective pool.

90
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.220
And she recalls being pulled away from that smiling and sympathetic image by

91
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.840
that mysterious voice that had guided her to Adam.
And,
and,
and,

92
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.330
and I think this is one of the most moving lines in the entire poem.
Um,

93
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.550
when eve recalls the feeling of helplessness that she experienced when she heard

94
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.790
that voice.
And this is,
this is,

95
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.770
this is how she explains it later to Adam,

96
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.660
what could I do but follow straight invisibly,
thus led,

97
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.820
what could I do and not a bad question.
What could she do?

98
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.120
Uh,
the,
the subordination of woman to man in,

99
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:43.121
in Heterosexual Union and Paradise lost seemed entirely couples compulsory at

100
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:45.920
that moment.
And Eve,

101
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:50.921
it seemed on some level had to be coerced to unite herself with this less

102
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:55.280
pleasing Adam and Milton for,
for a moment at least,

103
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:56.990
Milton seem to be on the brink of a,

104
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.190
of something like a powerful critique of the so called naturalness of,

105
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:04.100
of normative,
uh,
of normative sexual behavior.

106
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.780
Because there's at least some suggestion here that Eve's attraction to to Adam

107
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.580
was not freely chosen at all.
It was chosen for her,
it was assigned to her,

108
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.450
and all of this is a way of saying that Milton is doing something

109
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.960
extraordinarily complicated in,
in paradise lost.

110
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:23.240
He's juxtaposing and he does this consistently.

111
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.410
He juxtaposes the rhetoric of rational consent on the one hand with the

112
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:31.880
competing rhetoric of,
of coercion,
and maybe that word's a little strong,

113
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.570
but a con competing rhetoric of something like a gentle compulsion,

114
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.280
if that oxymoron makes any sense.
There's a way in which the this entire scene,

115
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.410
which is intended to assert the politics of rational consent provides it the

116
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:50.000
very same moment.
Something like a critique of the politics of rational consent.

117
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:55.001
We know that that Eve's freely willed act of yielding,

118
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.940
followed,
followed in time.
Adam's exertion of force,

119
00:07:58.941 --> 00:08:03.290
and so however gentle Adam is digestible hand seized mind,

120
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.760
he's still seized.

121
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.440
He still sees deve and Milton's I think remarkably honest.

122
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.590
So this is why I'm always pushing you to a agree with me and compelling you to

123
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:18.680
agree with me.
The,
that Milton deserves a little bit of credit here.
Um,

124
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.960
and it's,
it's amazingly honest.

125
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:25.220
His account of Eve's first exercise of her free will and I think we can think of

126
00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:29.150
this as her,
this is her first free act.
And of course it is a,

127
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.430
an unduly circumscribed act of freedom and,

128
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.100
and ultimate's poetry and a lot of ways is constantly questioning the legitimacy

129
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:42.101
of a doctrine of freewill in a world that has been arranged and uh,

130
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.580
conjugated like the one that,
that,
that Eden has banned.

131
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.380
It's along a principle of hierarchy.

132
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.830
So book for had,

133
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.250
had explored in extraordinary detail the complexities of hierarchy and freedom

134
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:59.220
with respect to the relation between the sexes.

135
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.560
And book five is also interested in the relation,
this,
uh,

136
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.320
this uneasy but important relation between hierarchy,
hierarchy and freedom.

137
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:12.300
It's almost as if book for hadn't sufficiently put to rest the,
the,

138
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.590
the logical problem that on some level is constantly eating away at the center

139
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:18.360
of the poem.
And so and so book.

140
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.000
And so book five takes up this problem once again,

141
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.050
but it takes it up as we of course should have been led to expect.

142
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:27.210
It takes it up from an entirely different perspective.

143
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.780
So as I just said in book for the hierarchical principle of superiority and of

144
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:38.460
excellence,
um,
was the superiority of man to woman.
In book five,

145
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.210
the central hierarchical axis is a little different or a lot different in an

146
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:47.211
evolves the superiority of angels over over human beings and this new

147
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:53.160
hierarchical opposition if it's performing a lot of work.

148
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.850
But one of the things that is certainly doing is forcing us to rethink the

149
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:59.820
hierarchical opposition that Milton had established in book four.

150
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:05.580
And that's because hierarchy is no longer gendered.
In,
in book,

151
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.690
in book five,
Milton's not concerned here,
uh,
with sex,

152
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:14.691
he's concerned rather with decree degrees of materiality among all of God's

153
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:18.710
creatures,
angels are less material,
less core,

154
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:21.330
poorly burdened creatures than Adam and Eve.

155
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.740
And therefore within this system,
therefore they're superior.

156
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.350
And in this larger vision of a kind of cosmic principle of hierarchy in which

157
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.320
lighter,
more ethereal things are superior to heavier,

158
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:37.320
denser grocer material things.

159
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.920
We can see a way in which the gender distinction simply drops out of the

160
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:45.660
equation because Milton gives us no reason to think that Adam and eve or

161
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:50.640
anything but equal in terms of the degrees of their corporate reality.

162
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.060
Uh,

163
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.060
sexual inequality simply seems insignificant here from this New Perspective in

164
00:10:56.401 --> 00:11:00.540
book five.
So Raphael descends into Eden.

165
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:05.541
They Archangel Rafiel in book five in order to warn Adam and eve not to eat the

166
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:09.030
forbidden fruit.
And in doing so,

167
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:12.210
he provides an elaborate account of one of the most,

168
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.470
and I've already discussed this,

169
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:17.400
but I have to discuss it again because if for me it's so outrageous and so

170
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:20.520
daring and such an absolutely loving,
lovable,

171
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.200
a religious hair heterodoxy maybe it's even a heresy that the,
the,

172
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:27.370
the heterodoxy of modernism.
And,

173
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.210
and I'll remind you briefly of what Mona Ism is.

174
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:34.440
It's the philosophy whereby there can be no such thing as a firm and absolute

175
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:37.530
distinction between body and spirit.

176
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.810
The world can't be divided into,

177
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:45.050
into soul and matter as it could be divided with absolute clarity for Milton's

178
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:46.560
contemporary Descartes,

179
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:52.010
the entire Cosmos for Milton is made of one huge blob of matter.

180
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:55.930
And this matter is nothing other ultimately than the body of God.

181
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.280
And this is what this is what Raefiel explains to Adam at line 469 of book five.

182
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.130
So this is page 313 in the Hughes edition.

183
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.180
So this is wrath yield to Adam Oh Adam,

184
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:19.020
one almighty is that's God from whom all things proceed and up to him return if

185
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:24.160
not deprived from good,
created all such to perfection.

186
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.570
One first matter all in dude with various forms,

187
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:33.520
various degrees of substance and in things that live of life.

188
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.820
One first matter,
all,
all things derive from the one first matter,

189
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:44.340
which is of course God.
And this is the x Dayo,
uh,

190
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.460
theory of creation,

191
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:49.390
cray audio x Dayo as opposed to the orthodox theory of creation,

192
00:12:49.391 --> 00:12:51.250
which is cray audio exnayed.
Hello.

193
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.610
The notion that God created the universe out of nothing.

194
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.890
Milton has god creating the universe out of God himself from the body of God.

195
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.440
And in this x day Oh creation scenario,

196
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:09.040
that there is no qualitative difference,
uh,

197
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.610
between the substance comprising men in the substance comprising angels.
Uh,

198
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.400
the difference is simply one of degree.

199
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:18.220
This has been a brilliantly argued by the critic William Kerrigan.

200
00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:23.221
It's a difference of degree rather than a difference of kind of angels are

201
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.090
simply lighter.
Uh,

202
00:13:26.091 --> 00:13:29.380
the corporeal substance that makes up their bodies is more attenuated.

203
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:34.270
It's more rarefied than that in human beings.
And,
and we are,

204
00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:38.710
we are all a more condensed.
We're grocer creatures to use Milton's,

205
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.730
uh,
one of Milton's favorite words here.
Um,

206
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.880
our gross or bodies are more compacted.
Uh,
there are,
uh,

207
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.990
a denser,

208
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.700
a consistency then the light and airy bodies of heavenly angels.

209
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.111
And so,

210
00:13:53.111 --> 00:13:57.760
except for this differentiation of degree by subsidy by a of the degree of

211
00:13:57.761 --> 00:14:02.560
substantiality human beings and angels are qualitatively identical,

212
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.180
uh,
that were made of the same stuff.
It's just how closely pack this stuff is.

213
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.800
And Milton even treats us to a scene of Adam and eve because it's thinkable in

214
00:14:11.801 --> 00:14:13.270
such a mechanistic universe,

215
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.720
although it's wild of Adam and eve actually eating with the Archangel Raefiel.

216
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.150
And,
and,
and this is a,

217
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.670
I think this must've blown Milton's contemporaries away because from any

218
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:29.140
orthodox perspective,
this asked this attribution of,
uh,

219
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.840
what Milton would call a gross activity,

220
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:36.280
like eating to one of one of God's heavenly minions,
one of the angels.
Um,

221
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:41.010
what would have to be seen if it's not blasphemous,
it's,

222
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.420
it's certainly in decorous,
but this is,

223
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:48.130
this is of course a poem that's centered around an illicit act of,
of eating.

224
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:49.290
And so Milton,
we'll,
we'll,

225
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:54.260
we'll turn the entire activity eating into the premise of an entire philosophy

226
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:57.620
of their relation of human creatures to their God.

227
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.170
So in that all of God creek,

228
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.870
all of God's creatures need to eat angels and men can't seem,

229
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:10.550
can be seen to be equals.
And this is essentially Raphael's logic.

230
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.600
Look at line 411 of book five around fuel tells Adam,

231
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.270
this is page three 12 that the angels are a lot like human beings.
They hear,

232
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.320
see,
smell,
touch,
taste,

233
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.730
tasting,
concoct,
digest,
assimilate.

234
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.380
And we're soon,
uh,
we're,

235
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.040
we're starting to learn that angels also have sex because as we know,

236
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:38.810
Sarah spirits can either sex as soon or both,
but,

237
00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:40.940
but we're,
we're about to find out here something.

238
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:44.970
I think it's a little more shocking even than that,

239
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.030
than the fact of angelic eroticism.

240
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.190
Angels have digestive tracts in Milton's heaven and like human beings,

241
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:57.191
they have within their bodies some kind of mechanism for the elimination of,

242
00:15:57.201 --> 00:15:59.220
of ingested substances.
Um,

243
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.780
the elimination of substances that cannot be assimilated into the body.

244
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:08.090
So Milton's angels actually excrete this is,
uh,
this is,

245
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.130
uh,
this is the remarkable,

246
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.800
a remarkable feat of literary daring to be sure,
but it's also a,

247
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.320
a magnificent feat of the human imagination on Hilton's part.

248
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.030
And so this is what the narrator is,

249
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.600
seems to be referring to when he discusses Raphael's hunger.

250
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.160
This is line for 37

251
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.840
what redounds transpires through spirits with ease.

252
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:36.851
It's so easy to miss what rubdowns transpires through series spirits with ease.

253
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.610
What stays,
uh,
what,
what can't be assimilated into the body,
um,

254
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:49.610
gets,
uh,
gets expelled easily.
Uh,
Milton is so eager here.

255
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.810
Now we have to ask ourselves,
why is Milton doing this?
He's so eager.

256
00:16:53.811 --> 00:16:55.550
I'm convinced to demonstrate the,

257
00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.200
the essential metaphysical equivalents of human beings and angels that he is

258
00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:05.201
quite prepared to ask us to imagine the unimaginable angels are exceedingly

259
00:17:05.781 --> 00:17:06.614
regular.

260
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:12.010
Milton is telling us what redounds that that food which remains in excess in the

261
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:17.420
angel's body transpires through spirits with these.
And of course,

262
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:19.820
as we know,
Milton was acutely interested in his own,

263
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:21.920
in his own gastrointestinal tract,

264
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:24.380
having blamed his blindness on a digestive problem.

265
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.280
But there's a lot more here than merely a personal,
a personal interest.

266
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:32.660
Eating is so central to this poem,
but it's actually a,

267
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.860
something like a digestive process of assimilation and excretion that would have

268
00:17:36.861 --> 00:17:41.861
enabled the unfollow and Adam and eve to become angels eventually themselves.

269
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:47.810
Uh,
turn to line four 93.
This is page three,
13.

270
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.910
It was to
be Adam and Eve's good fortune,

271
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.530
<v 1>okay</v>

272
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.750
<v 0>to watch their own gross.</v>

273
00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.610
Corporeal body's slowly,
gradually shed.

274
00:18:00.611 --> 00:18:05.230
They're dense matter as they assume the ery lightness of angels.

275
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.650
And,
and,
and how will they attain this extraordinary achievement,

276
00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.810
this wafting up to heaven.
They'll do it by eating.
Look at line four 93.

277
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.820
Oh Ralph was explaining that as things are now angels are,
you know,
in a pinch,

278
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.150
angels are capable of a nutritional kind of condescension.

279
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.410
They can eat the same food that human beings eat when,
when they have,

280
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.930
when they don't have a choice.
And,
and right now,

281
00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:33.931
Adam and eve probably couldn't survive on angelic nectar if that's all they had

282
00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:35.740
to live on probably.

283
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:41.040
But Raefiel adds time may come when angels may put time,

284
00:18:43.511 --> 00:18:48.511
may come when men with angels may participate and find no inconvenient diet nor

285
00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:53.740
to light fair and from these corporal nutriments,

286
00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:57.040
perhaps your body's May it last turn all to spirit,

287
00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:02.390
improved by tract of time and wind.
Uh,
send the theory,

288
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.400
oh as we or May at choice here or in heavenly paradises dwell.

289
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.160
And this is obviously the kicker,
if you be found obedient,

290
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.590
<v 1>okay.</v>

291
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.340
<v 0>Milton is going out of his way to provide Adam and eve with a motive for</v>

292
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:22.020
remaining obedient by a simple process of eating a virtuous eating,

293
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:26.090
virtuous digestion,
and the sublime and the cons,
uh,

294
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:30.230
consequent activity of the virtuous,
a blinding.

295
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:34.950
That's Milton's term of gross matter into spirit.
Adam and Eve will eventually,

296
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.120
gradually begin to ascend to the wind,

297
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.950
the state of Angel Hood.

298
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.060
They will metabolize themselves into angels.

299
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:48.720
It's one of the most extreme visions and one of the most beautiful fishes.

300
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:49.554
However,

301
00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.030
however cockamamie beautiful visions of human progress ever depicted.

302
00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.540
I think so,
Ralph Fields account of the superior,

303
00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:01.260
the superiority of spiritual matter over gross matter is without question,

304
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:06.210
another one of the poems,
hierarchical,
hierarchical visions,

305
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.900
but the,
the,
the,
the,
the amazing process of the,

306
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.310
what we can think of as the angel.

307
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.800
What would have been the angel lization of men and women doesn't.
Okay.

308
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.250
Does something really quite alarming,

309
00:20:21.251 --> 00:20:24.280
I think to the principle of hierarchy as it's been presented so far.

310
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.790
The metaphysical hierarchy of the degree of material density,

311
00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:30.910
which is the concern of book five isn't fixed.

312
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:36.070
It's not static in,
in Milton's universe.
And Raphael is,
this is,
uh,

313
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.150
this is a mobile society that Raefiel is imagining the hierarchy.

314
00:20:40.151 --> 00:20:41.890
Heroes is flexible.

315
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:46.800
It's much more flexible than the gendered hierarchy was among human beings in,

316
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:51.400
in four.
And if an Adam and eve managed not to fall,
they will arrive.

317
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.960
We have to assume equally at a state of angelic perfection,

318
00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:00.580
a state and winch in the state in which gender differences simply don't obtain.

319
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:05.470
Because angels as we know,
can either sex assume or both.
There were,

320
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:10.420
um,
there were a few other radical thinkers in the 17th century who embraced,

321
00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.290
uh,
this,
this,
this vision of a moment instick vision of the universe,

322
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:17.890
light like Milton's.
And almost invariably,
uh,

323
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.600
this Montez is and had a kind of leftist progressive and in some cases actually

324
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:27.060
a communist,
um,
energy to energy to it.
I've written the name of,
um,
uh,

325
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.890
one of Milton's contemporaries,
Gerard Winstanley,
um,

326
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:36.310
who was England's first,
maybe not England's first communist,

327
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:39.760
but England's first important communist writing 15 or so years before,

328
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.200
before paradise lost.
The bodies of all men and women are,
are four.

329
00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.940
Winstanley as leader for Milton are equally infused with heavenly spirit and

330
00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:49.960
heavenly soul.

331
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.790
And this for Winston Lee Nelson wouldn't permit himself to go quite this far.

332
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.300
Um,

333
00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:00.300
this physiological equality seemed to guarantee their political equality.

334
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.470
And in adopting this doctrine of modernism that had been developed or worked out

335
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:09.970
by much more radical thinkers like that,
like,
like Gerard Winstanley,

336
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.050
Milton is really on some level consciously adopting a philosophy of body and

337
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:17.290
spirit that works to,
to undo.

338
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.800
Maybe it works to undermine that Patriarchal insistence on Adam superior

339
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:28.330
superiority over eve on some level.
Um,
some of the philosophy in book five,

340
00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:31.780
I think is working on a subterranean,
uh,

341
00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:36.781
at some subterranean stage to undermine or dismantle the Edenic paradise whole

342
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:42.640
hierarchy.
So Adam and eve before the fall,
or given the,

343
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.450
given the opportunity to reach their heavenly destinations on their own.

344
00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.700
Now just think,

345
00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.020
think how radical that is when you compare it to any mainstream notion of,

346
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:57.670
of the way Christianity works.
Adam and eve,
had they never fallen,

347
00:22:57.671 --> 00:22:58.720
had they never sinned,

348
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:04.050
would never have needed to rely on a god or a Messiah to intervene and external

349
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:10.201
redeemer tip to move in and save them or even to reward them for their virtue.

350
00:23:11.801 --> 00:23:16.300
There.
Virtuous behavior would have been itself a reward.
They're there.

351
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.750
We can think of them as having been in a position almost to save themselves.

352
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.550
And Melton is arriving at,
uh,
it's,
it's,

353
00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:29.560
it's a wild and really daring alternative to the Orthodox Christian vision of

354
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:32.500
redemption and salvation.
Um,
and it's,
uh,
it's,

355
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:36.580
I think it's this orthodox notion of Christianity that Milton always felt so

356
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:39.100
uncomfortable with.
And were it not for the fall?

357
00:23:39.101 --> 00:23:43.450
There would have been no need for the heavenly father to sacrifice the son in

358
00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:46.960
order to save fallen humanity.
Human beings would have been able to just,

359
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.180
just waft up to the pearly gates,

360
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.320
a Wah Wah like helium balloons,
lighter,
lighter,
even than air.
Um,

361
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.370
no need,
no need for an external redeemer.

362
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.610
In some ways Milton is,
is flirting with something like,

363
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:07.460
and I think the,
the,
the children's or the young adult book writer,

364
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:11.330
Philip Pullman Ex,
uh,
absolutely has put his finger on something important.

365
00:24:11.331 --> 00:24:14.750
And Milton,
um,
he's a great reader and fan of Milton's,
um,

366
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:18.140
is flirting with something that we would recognize as science fiction.

367
00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.480
It's a secular image of salvation certainly,

368
00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:24.440
but it's a prodo scientific image of,
of salvation and fallen.

369
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:28.490
Salvation is something like a scientific process.

370
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.320
It's the logical and inevitable result of a,

371
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.290
just a particular type of virtuous natural behavior.
And Milton arrives,

372
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.360
arrives at a theology that does something that a theology has never supposed to

373
00:24:41.361 --> 00:24:44.350
do.
It's a,

374
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:49.280
it's a radical theology of bodily transformation that essentially does away with

375
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:53.330
God or does away with God as we know him.
Um,

376
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:58.070
who needs God.
Um,
Adam and eve,
we'll continue to eat.
They'll eat virtuously,

377
00:24:58.071 --> 00:24:59.900
there'll be good people,
they'll become angels.

378
00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:03.950
And eventually they will be up subsumed into that universal ball of,

379
00:25:03.951 --> 00:25:05.420
of spiritual matter.

380
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.370
At that later point when God becomes all and all it,

381
00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.410
that's that distant point in time where there were,
were,

382
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:16.190
there will simply be no ontological difference between man and woman,

383
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.880
between Angel and man or between us and God.

384
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.210
So Ralph fuels,
fuels philosophy of,
of,
of Moana.

385
00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:29.060
ISM offers a truly radical vision of,

386
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.640
of an exaltation.
This possible.

387
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.350
Th th this pre-labs area notion of an exaltation of Adam and Eve up to heaven.

388
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:37.490
They,
they,
they,

389
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.270
they could have exalted themselves and presumably we all could have exalted

390
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:45.320
ourselves simply by being good,
but by doing it ourself.

391
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.960
But this,
this,
this vision,

392
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.860
this daring vision of a radical self determination couldn't possibly be more

393
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:58.901
violently opposed to the version of exultation that RAF Raefiel explains to Adam

394
00:25:59.781 --> 00:26:04.070
and Eve elsewhere in book five.
This scene,

395
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:08.120
I know you remember,
um,
upon Adam's prompting because it's so,

396
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.480
it's so upsetting and so unforgettable on Adam's prompting.

397
00:26:11.481 --> 00:26:14.420
Raefiel goes onto describe the exaltation,

398
00:26:14.421 --> 00:26:17.120
the anointing of the son of God.

399
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.140
It's an event that comes as close to anything as explaining the very first

400
00:26:21.141 --> 00:26:25.550
mystery of the poem,
which is the or the central mystery of the poem.

401
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.060
That being the cause and the origin of Satan's fall.

402
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.300
Now the origin and you have,
um,
you can,

403
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.960
you can refer to your handy little chronology,
uh,

404
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.830
written by Allister Fowler of events in,

405
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.640
in paradise lost.
The,
the origin of Satan's fall is without question,

406
00:26:44.641 --> 00:26:48.960
one of the most crucial problems that we have when we confront this,
this poem,

407
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.940
God's ways on some level,

408
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:55.941
God's ways can't be justified until the origin of man's fall can be explained or

409
00:26:56.131 --> 00:27:00.900
understood and man's fall can't be understood or explained or justified until

410
00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:05.040
Satan's fall is explained.
And so to account for Satan's fall,

411
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:08.940
Milton realize he,
he makes all this happen.
It's magnificent.

412
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.150
He's relying here on the text of the Second Psalm,

413
00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.980
a chapter of the Bible that he had himself translated into English and 1653.

414
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.230
Now the second psalm imagines the Messiah speaking.
Uh,
this is the,

415
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.900
this is that first the Lord to me has said,

416
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:29.850
thou art the Son speaking the Lord to me,
had said,
thou art my Son,

417
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.520
I have begotten thee this day

418
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.440
and no one has ever known what to do with that passage from the second songs,

419
00:27:39.441 --> 00:27:43.580
the idea that the Messiah could actually remember the day that God had big

420
00:27:43.581 --> 00:27:47.360
gotten him,
had,
had for centuries,
Millennia,

421
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:51.440
provided biblical commentators with a paradox that really bordered on the
absurd.

422
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.560
What could God has meant when he said,

423
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.770
I have be gotten the this day and Milton worries and worries this problem of,

424
00:28:01.071 --> 00:28:02.340
of this beginning.
And He'd,

425
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.270
and he does this throughout paradise lost and he does it in a number of ways.

426
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:06.860
He transforms this,

427
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:12.220
this mysterious declaration that he is lifted from the second song into the,

428
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:18.170
he's turned it into what is essentially the originary event of the entire poem.

429
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:19.430
And so as you can see from the,

430
00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.630
from the chronology of the poem that Fowler gives us,
uh,

431
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:29.350
the Exaltation of the Son of God.
And,
and Fowler unfortunately calls him Christ.

432
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.840
Milton's son of God doesn't really function as a Christ.
He's not,
he,

433
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.580
he Milton would never in a million years,

434
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.970
certainly in paradise lost call this fellow Christ.

435
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.720
He doesn't call him Jesus either because the son of God is in Jesus,

436
00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:47.740
yet he is preexistent but he's not a Christ.
Um,

437
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:51.160
I think in part because Milton doesn't want us to,
to confuse,

438
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.280
confuse or to construe this son of God with anything that we've learned from any

439
00:28:57.311 --> 00:29:01.540
of our Sunday school classes or any exposure to traditional orthodox,

440
00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:05.940
mainstream Christian,
Protestant or Catholic thinking.
Um,

441
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.080
this is the event.

442
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:19.040
You'll remember how important first events are in paradise lost.

443
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.770
This is the event that seems to have happened first.
W what,
what occurred,

444
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:27.860
what occurred in heaven before this moment.
The poem gives us no,

445
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.300
no definitive clue.

446
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.110
Although Satan knows there is something important that happened before this

447
00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:36.230
moment and it makes it an important conjecture about it.
Um,
prior to this.

448
00:29:36.231 --> 00:29:41.180
And we don't have time to look at this today.
Um,
but you,
you,
you,
uh,

449
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:46.480
you may want to study for yourself.
Satan's own a theory of a first creation,

450
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:49.600
and that's the creation of the angels.
So God,

451
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:53.770
the father a assembles all of the angels.
This is page 316 in the Hughes.

452
00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.730
Um,
book five line 600

453
00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:02.080
and God delivers at line 600 a pronouncement.

454
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:05.410
That is by any standards absolutely shocking.
I'm Satan,

455
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:07.990
like the other angels was a son of God,

456
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.070
but unlike the other son of God,
this other sons of God,

457
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:15.940
Satan had been one of the first arc angels in heaven.

458
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.870
And the narrator suggests this is coming from the new radar that fits.

459
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:24.490
Satan may have been the first Archangel and heaven first,

460
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:29.610
both in God's favor and also in his general preeminence over the other angels

461
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.470
because God liked him most liked him best.

462
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.890
And also because he was simply better than all of the other angels.

463
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.510
And Milton continues his,
his meditation on the multiple meetings here of,

464
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.373
of first.

465
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.150
Now I'm going to read this passage to you and you tell me,

466
00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:48.520
you tell me if you think I'm Satan.

467
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:53.521
Might have just to TNC a bit of a reason to be miffed at God's exaltation of

468
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:59.251
another one of his sons or what we have to assume is another one of his sons.

469
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:04.210
Uh,
this is God at Leiden 600 here.
All the angels,

470
00:31:04.211 --> 00:31:08.080
progeny of light,
Thrones,
dominations,

471
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.990
Princeton's virtues powers here my decree,

472
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:15.991
which unreal Volk shall stand this day I have Bichotte whom I declare my only

473
00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:23.221
son and on this holy hill him have anointed whom you now behold at my right hand

474
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.100
your head,

475
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:32.490
I him a point and by myself have sworn to him shall bow all knees in heaven and

476
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:38.440
shall confess him.
Lord under his great Vice Jarrett Reign,

477
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:43.800
abide United as one individual soul forever happy.

478
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.470
What's the tone of voice?
I'm going to interrupt myself for a moment.
How do we,

479
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.920
how are we to imagine God pronouncing that word happy after what he's just told

480
00:31:57.191 --> 00:31:59.710
us under his great Vice Jarrett Reign,

481
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:04.711
abide United as one individual soul forever happy him who disobeys me.

482
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.750
Disobeys Breaks Union and that day cast out from God and blessed it.

483
00:32:09.751 --> 00:32:14.740
Vision falls into utter darkness.
This,

484
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:15.071
of course,

485
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:19.390
it's a vision of an exaltation almost diet diametrically opposed to the

486
00:32:19.391 --> 00:32:24.150
exaltation of the,
of the and fallen Adam and eve there wafting up the son,

487
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:24.941
the son of God.

488
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:28.930
The Messiah doesn't seem to have exalted himself along what has already been

489
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:33.490
established as the is a recognizable pattern of a kind of natural physiological

490
00:32:33.491 --> 00:32:37.010
ascent.
And you can imagine,
you can imagine Miltona he could,

491
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.950
he could have pulled that off.
It's possible to imagine us cause he could,

492
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.050
he could pull off anything.

493
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:47.530
It's possible to imagine a scenario whereby the son had on some level eaten his

494
00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:50.190
way into God's favor and,

495
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.780
and achieve the status of Messiah through an Adam and Eve,

496
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:58.781
like virtuous metabolism and floating up to the very top of God's throne before

497
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:02.210
any of the other angels.
That's how damn good he was.

498
00:33:02.211 --> 00:33:05.540
But that's not the story that we get according to the narrative we have.
God,

499
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:10.541
the Father Sims seems quite simply to have decided to have decided arbitrarily

500
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:17.180
to a point,
one of the angels over all of the others.
Why has he done this?

501
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.290
God does mention something about the sun's merit.
Well,

502
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:25.040
he will mention something about the sun's merit later in another scene of

503
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:27.620
exaltation,
but it's one that's already been narrated.

504
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.300
And that's the scene that we've already read in book three,
um,

505
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:33.980
ads for this moment right now.

506
00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:38.450
The motives for this declaration seem perfectly and explicable absolutely

507
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:42.500
inscrutable.
And it also seems clear that this inscrutability,
uh,

508
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:47.200
is this is the point of gods of the father's declaration.
And as a,

509
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.840
as William Thompson writes,
um,
convincingly and,
and brilliantly,

510
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:53.690
although mischievously in his wonderful book called Milton's God,

511
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.780
the father's declaration sounds like a challenge.

512
00:33:56.781 --> 00:34:00.620
Like it's intended to be taken as a challenge by saying on this day,

513
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:04.670
I have B got the messiah.
God seems almost to be suggesting that.

514
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.970
I don't know that he's just created this guy out of,
uh,

515
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:11.840
out of whole cloth for this very occasion,
just,
just,

516
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:16.250
just made him and raised the raise this nobody to the rank of favorite.

517
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:23.290
It's possible that God has just bequeathed all of his power to someone who

518
00:34:23.931 --> 00:34:28.310
hasn't even been around someone who hasn't spent it,
turned it,

519
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.470
paying his dues.
Uh,

520
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.370
wha wha what could God have been thinking that the father,

521
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:39.290
the father knows this is a,
this is an extraordinary thing to be declaring.

522
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.300
And so he tries to soften the blow.
I guess this blow of this,
uh,

523
00:34:44.301 --> 00:34:49.301
this show of favoritism by inviting the angels to the other angels to abide

524
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.190
under his Great Vice Jarrett rain,
United as one individual soul,

525
00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:00.140
forever happy,
and by individual,
uh,
the,

526
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:05.150
the father means indivisible.
Here I,
I'm convinced that the word individual,

527
00:35:05.151 --> 00:35:08.360
which only appears twice in paradise lost is one of the poems,

528
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:12.770
most important words.
Um,
but it has its original meaning.

529
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:17.870
Uh,
it's etymological meaning,
which simply means can't be.
It can't be divided.

530
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.710
Uh,
and this is on some level,

531
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.700
the father seems to be making a stab at Milton's own modernistic vision of

532
00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:26.720
egalitarianism.

533
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.950
The angels will all be United as one individual soul,

534
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.820
but the father will only invoke this harmonious,

535
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.880
indivisible union when after he's placed the son of God at the head of the

536
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:42.270
other,
at the head of the other angels.

537
00:35:42.271 --> 00:35:46.700
And we're left to wonder just how we're supposed to reconcile this image of any

538
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.720
of the indivisible egalitarianism with the competing image of an unyielding,

539
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.070
rigorously enforced angelic hierarchy.

540
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:01.740
And you can recognize in this scene that the opposition of irreconcilables that

541
00:36:01.741 --> 00:36:02.790
we've already encountered,

542
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.680
they're the ones that had characterized the power relations in Milton's Eden.

543
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:12.180
Milton charges this scene in heaven with,
with its power,

544
00:36:12.181 --> 00:36:16.650
I think by juxtaposing just those two forces that he was continued continually

545
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:19.650
attempting to unite in,
in book four,

546
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:24.050
he yokes together the principles of freedom and equality,

547
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.570
freedom and equality on the,
on the one hand and the opposing principle of,

548
00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.720
of hierarchical order on,
on the other hand.

549
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.410
So think how the politics,

550
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.560
the politics and heaven here parallel the,

551
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:44.210
the political dynamic that we've already been exposed to,
uh,

552
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:48.850
that we've already seen operative on,
on earth.
Um,

553
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.550
in book four at that beautiful originary moment at the pool side,

554
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.130
eve had I think quite like Satan.

555
00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:01.380
Eve had imagined herself great in favor and preeminence.
Uh,

556
00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:03.680
she's,
she's shaken from this assumption of,

557
00:37:03.681 --> 00:37:06.510
of power and of absolute self sufficiency.

558
00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:09.930
When she suddenly told that there's another creature,
Adam,

559
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.970
who has been appointed her head,
and just as God does with Satan,
Adam,

560
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:20.070
Adam tries to soften the blow of this arbitrary declaration of hierarchical sub

561
00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:22.920
supremacy.
Am Adam softens the blow by blow,

562
00:37:22.921 --> 00:37:27.330
by claiming to be United indivisibly to eve.

563
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.040
So Adam declares to eve,

564
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:33.270
he sees as her hand she yields and he declares to her that he will have her by

565
00:37:33.271 --> 00:37:37.230
his side,
hence forth and individual solace.

566
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:42.230
Deer and Milton is clearly doing something here in these two scenes with these,

567
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.400
with these noisy protestations of of indivisibility,

568
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:52.200
he invokes the beautiful notion of the interconnectedness of all of God's

569
00:37:52.201 --> 00:37:57.100
creatures.
That's implicit in this monistic vision of,
of the first matter.
But,

570
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.480
but he only employs this beautiful image of a moment,

571
00:37:59.481 --> 00:38:04.380
mystic unity when he's placing an absolute divide between the superior creature

572
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:09.530
and an inferior one between a greater and a lesser being and and on,

573
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.860
on some level.
And it's very troubling.
Mona,

574
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:18.050
Mona mystic indivisibility is always invoked at the most divisive moments in

575
00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:25.200
the,
in the poem.
We can think of these as the crisis moments in paradise.

576
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:28.640
Lost and at these critical moments of the arbitrary subjection of one party or

577
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:29.490
the over the other,

578
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:34.170
whether it's Adam over eve or the son of God over Satan and the other angels,

579
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.500
you can the emergence of another meaning the modern meaning of that word,

580
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:42.600
individual dick.

581
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.390
The individual is a noun rather than individual as an adjective.

582
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.920
Dictionaries and historians of the English language claimed that the modern

583
00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:52.420
meaning of the word individual,

584
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.160
a noun referring to a person who is self sufficient,
autonomous,

585
00:38:57.161 --> 00:39:01.000
independent,
uh,
being,
um,
that this,

586
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:05.620
this now doesn't appear in,
in,
in England until later in the,
in the 17th century.

587
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.863
<v 1>MMM.</v>

588
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
<v 0>But I think that it's precisely at these crisis moments in paradise lost that</v>

589
00:39:13.071 --> 00:39:15.350
Milton uses the original,

590
00:39:15.351 --> 00:39:20.351
the traditional sense of individual and adjective meaning and divisible only to

591
00:39:20.601 --> 00:39:23.510
begin pushing that word.
Um,
and,

592
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.520
and forcing it into something like its modern sense of individual,
the modern,

593
00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.060
essentially liberal idea of a person,
um,

594
00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:37.420
as a of a human being as an absolutely isolat self-determining fundamentally

595
00:39:39.051 --> 00:39:40.660
unaffiliated person

596
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.710
here at the,
at the,
the scene of the Sun's exaltation.
Milton,

597
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:52.230
I don't know for a lot for a lot of readers,
this is really a repellent scene.
Um,

598
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:57.010
it's a,
it's a,
it's a scene of a tyrannical and arbitrary ordering of a society.

599
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.060
And,
and Milton does this only to,
to display a little window,

600
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.540
I think onto a totally different kind of society.

601
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:09.120
You can see in this word individual,
a glimpse into the world of,

602
00:40:09.121 --> 00:40:12.880
of what we can think of is modernity.
Paradise lost is,

603
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.840
is just on the cusp of,
of a liberal worldview.
And,

604
00:40:16.841 --> 00:40:21.841
and the poem provides us a glimpse of the liberal world of equal individuals,

605
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:27.810
a world of rational self determination and self exaltation rather than the

606
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.040
arbitrary subjection of one class of creatures or over another class.

607
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:34.991
So it's,

608
00:40:34.991 --> 00:40:39.760
it's one thing for Satan to witness this seemingly arbitrary exaltation of the

609
00:40:39.761 --> 00:40:43.530
Sun.
This arouses in him,
as you can imagine,
uh,

610
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.080
feelings of injustice that of course famously lead him to coax a third of all of

611
00:40:49.841 --> 00:40:52.870
the other angels in a rebellion against God.

612
00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:55.790
That was bad enough,

613
00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.190
but it's an entirely different matter I think when Satan learns.
Yeah.

614
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.380
I don't know if learns is the right verb.

615
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:09.740
When Satan hears in his discussion with Ab deal that God created everything,

616
00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:15.180
including the angels themselves by means of the agency of the sun,

617
00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.090
through the sun for Satan.
This is a,

618
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.780
this is a mind blowing revelation.
Um,
and it's,

619
00:41:21.781 --> 00:41:26.781
and it's hard to miss as so surprising because we take this as just orthodoxy

620
00:41:28.471 --> 00:41:33.120
that any went right thinking Christian might accept.
Um,
look at page three,

621
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:38.120
two.
This is line eight 35 of book five.

622
00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:44.240
Um,
when Abdul Tell Satan,
well,
you know,
why are you so upset?

623
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:45.074
Satan?

624
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.100
Of course he would exalt the sonic was the son through whom we were all created.

625
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:53.420
And this notion just push us Satan,
I'm further than anything pushes them.

626
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.380
And this new revelation pushes him into making one of the greatest formulations,

627
00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.820
um,
uh,
of the,
of the modern,
an outrageous one.

628
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.490
But it's central to the modern principle of individualization.

629
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.230
So let me give you a little background.

630
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.830
Abdul has traveled with Satan and the other disloyal angels,

631
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.620
the rebel angels to the northern quarter of heaven.

632
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.750
But Abdul like Milton himself during the English revolution and deal is in some

633
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:22.400
way Milton's self portrait deal was willing to distance himself from the mob

634
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:24.800
sensibility of the,
of the rebels.

635
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.710
He stands up to Satan with the pious rage.

636
00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:32.120
Th the zeal that Milton always fancied himself capable of.

637
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.830
And so Abbeydale asks Satan,

638
00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:38.831
and this is at the top of page three 22 how he can dare to question God's

639
00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:42.890
justice in exalting the sun over the other angels.

640
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.810
It was the sun,

641
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:49.940
it was the sun by whom Abdul tells Satan it was the sun,

642
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:54.170
by whom as by his word,
the mighty father made all things,

643
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:59.200
even the and all of the spirits of heaven by him created in their bright

644
00:42:59.601 --> 00:43:03.380
degrees.
Abdul Tell Satan that if it weren't for the son of God,

645
00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:06.740
Satan would never have been created.
And it's Satan.

646
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.780
Satan is seemed,

647
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.380
certainly seems to be shocked here and it's his response to Abdul's deals claim

648
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.300
that is I think one of the most stunning,

649
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:18.050
one of the most outrageous moments in paradise.

650
00:43:18.051 --> 00:43:23.051
Lost Line eight 52 st and his aghast that we were formed then say snow now and

651
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:32.270
the work of secondary hands by task transferred from father to the son.

652
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:38.110
Strange point and new doctrine which we would know when slurred.

653
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:43.360
Who saw when this creation was remembers now by making while the maker gave the

654
00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:49.121
being we know no time when we were not as now.

655
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.380
No,
none before us.

656
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:56.740
Self big sell phrased by our own quickening power when fatal course had circled

657
00:43:58.821 --> 00:44:02.570
his full orb,
the birth mature of this,

658
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.690
our native heaven ethereal sons.

659
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.090
Now nearly everyone agrees that the old Milton critics agree that this claim for

660
00:44:11.091 --> 00:44:15.770
angelic self creation is in one way or the other crucial to our understanding of

661
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:20.771
the fall of the rebel angels and Satan's justification of the rebellion.

662
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.130
And this claim of self creation obviously prepares Satan for that pronouncement

663
00:44:25.131 --> 00:44:28.250
that he will make later in hell but which comes at the beginning of the poem

664
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:31.860
that claim for the absolute priority of the mind.

665
00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:35.940
The mind is its own place and can make a heaven of Hell,

666
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.800
a hell of heaven.
Uh,

667
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.600
now Abdul Abdul surely is right to insist that not only were the,

668
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:47.700
I mean how,
you know,
we have to give it to ab deal,
that he's,
he's,

669
00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.420
he's on to something that,

670
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.340
that the angels were created and not only that they were created,

671
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.910
but in all likelihood by the agency,
through the agency of the sun.

672
00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:59.940
But even though Ab deals,
right,
Satan's,

673
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.440
Satan's theory of angelic origin isn't easily dismissible.
Um,

674
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.810
it's not as easily dismissible as it is by cs Lewis and the,

675
00:45:07.811 --> 00:45:11.640
and the little quotation at the bottom of the handout.
Um,
and so I,

676
00:45:11.641 --> 00:45:16.110
I always tried to make a little plug for the validity of at least a little of a

677
00:45:16.111 --> 00:45:19.890
part of Satan's claim.
And I want to do this because on some level,

678
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:21.030
I think what Satan's,

679
00:45:21.031 --> 00:45:24.600
Satan's outrageous argument here is one of the greatest thing that anybody gets

680
00:45:24.601 --> 00:45:28.320
to say in paradise lost because of her going to understand that the origin of

681
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:32.970
Satan's fall,
we have to understand something about the origin of Satan himself.

682
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.300
And so you have the chronology on that,
that the handout,

683
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.420
it's right to place the exaltation of the Sun as the first event officially

684
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:43.920
described in paradise lost.

685
00:45:43.921 --> 00:45:48.180
But there's of course an event that happened before that which Milton's

686
00:45:48.181 --> 00:45:51.930
narrative very carefully never describes.
And that's the creation of the angels.

687
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:54.870
And,
and,
and,
and,
and,
and,

688
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:58.300
and so we get Satan's theory of the creation of the angels and,
and,

689
00:45:58.301 --> 00:46:03.000
and Ab deal as we would expect,
takes great offense.
Uh,
but,

690
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:06.060
but it's important and ab deals ride and Satan's wrong,

691
00:46:06.061 --> 00:46:11.061
but it's important to determine exactly what is wrong about Satan's uh,

692
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:16.260
uh,
what about say what it's wrong about Satan's theology here and how it would

693
00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.490
counter Milton's.
Satan's obviously wrong to,

694
00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.160
to ascribe the creation of the angels to something like a random occurrence of

695
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:25.290
fate.
Uh,
when,
when Satan says,

696
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:30.291
when fatal course had circled his full orb and in Milton's explained a number of

697
00:46:30.391 --> 00:46:34.050
times in the poem that there's no such thing as a power called faint.

698
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.610
So that's easily dismissible.

699
00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:41.490
But it's not absolutely clear to me that Satan has wrong to claim that the

700
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:45.660
angels are self raised by their own quickening power.

701
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.690
I think on some level this,
this has to be seen as true,

702
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:53.691
at least according to what we know of the processes of the dynamic processes.

703
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.500
In Milton's account of the Mona's Dick Creation,

704
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.560
God has impregnated matter with spirit.

705
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.650
And after this initial active impregnation,

706
00:47:04.651 --> 00:47:09.651
he seems able to allow this spiritualize matter pretty much to organize itself

707
00:47:10.231 --> 00:47:13.920
on its own,
into,
to all these beautiful and varied forms of creation.

708
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.640
And if we're not completely shocked to hear of Satan's claim for having raised

709
00:47:17.641 --> 00:47:20.070
himself by his own quickening power,
um,

710
00:47:20.071 --> 00:47:22.620
at least upon a rereading of paradise lost per that,

711
00:47:22.621 --> 00:47:27.621
that might be because it looks an awful lot like the theory of creation that we

712
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:29.410
get in a,

713
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:33.490
in book seven and also like a moment in book three that we've already

714
00:47:33.491 --> 00:47:36.280
encountered when the Angel Uriel,

715
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:41.700
the angel that Milton credits for having the best eyesight in heaven rather

716
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:46.150
remarkably.
And when Uriel gives us his eye witness account of the creation,

717
00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.730
it sounds a little bit like Satan's

718
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:55.540
Satan's argument that the angels are so phrased

719
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.510
has something like I think something like a foundation even in book five itself.

720
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:06.930
And it begins to resemble the con that that condition of absolute self

721
00:48:07.091 --> 00:48:11.110
determination that Rapheal had promised to Adam and eve if they remained

722
00:48:11.111 --> 00:48:13.810
obedient.
If Adam and eve will only remain sinless,

723
00:48:13.811 --> 00:48:18.340
there'll be able to raise themselves to that dead,
that ethereal state of,
of,

724
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.440
of angelic status.
And it's,

725
00:48:20.441 --> 00:48:25.441
this is a world in which individuals rational self determining individuals

726
00:48:25.721 --> 00:48:30.100
determine their own status rather than except one that has been arbitrarily

727
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:31.030
imposed upon them.

728
00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:35.770
This is an egalitarian world that Milton is introducing us to.
And,

729
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.440
and I think that there in moments such as these,

730
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:43.770
we see Milton laboring to arrive at a theory of matter and a theory of creation

731
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.240
that can support something like a poetics,
poetics,

732
00:48:49.241 --> 00:48:53.470
but also a philosophy of political philosophy of egalitarianism to claim that

733
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:58.300
matter can move itself to organize itself into stars and into angels,

734
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.600
which is what Uriel will will claim happens.
Um,

735
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.370
is essentially to lay the physical,

736
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:08.610
the Philosophical Foundation for a political philosophy that's not authoritarian

737
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:15.340
by any stretch.
It's not even hierarchical.
It's egalitarian.
This is a physics,

738
00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:19.840
a theological physics that can bolster the claims of a politics.

739
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:25.200
It's a philosophy that can imagine human beings as being equally capable of

740
00:49:25.631 --> 00:49:29.920
organizing themselves and creating their own sense of order without the

741
00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:34.470
meddlesome intervention of an arbitrary God.
Now,

742
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:39.650
many of my,
many of my colleagues in the,
in the Milton community,
um,

743
00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.210
dismissed the possibility that there could be anything even remotely like

744
00:49:43.211 --> 00:49:47.680
something valid in Satan's wonderful rejoinder to ab deal.

745
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.530
And they nearly always overlook the,
the,
the,

746
00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:54.850
the creation account that we get from Uriel and book three,
which I think,
uh,

747
00:49:54.851 --> 00:49:58.660
supports on some level part of Satan's claim.
And there eve,

748
00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.860
they're also eager to,

749
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.330
to dismiss Eve's feelings of injustice at her inferior status.

750
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:09.190
They dismiss it as just another one of Milton's unquestioning acts of misogyny.

751
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.580
But I don't think it's unquestioning at all.
Um,

752
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.620
all three of these examples for me demonstrate Milton's willingness to question

753
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:22.660
nearly every form of religious and social and political orthodoxy.

754
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:27.661
Milton has continually putting the official doctrines of even his own poem on,

755
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.353
on trial.

756
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.590
He's continually pitting the narrator's own celebration of hierarchy,

757
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:37.180
his own Milton Zone and celebration of hierarchy,
um,

758
00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:40.900
against a more subversive and a more questioning of philosophy.

759
00:50:40.901 --> 00:50:45.680
Vic Galatarian ism and Milton's narrator and Milton is with him onto his stomach

760
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.600
to some extent come down,

761
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:52.220
comes down most firmly on the side of a divinely established hierarchy.

762
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:56.780
But the,
the,
this,
this exquisitely textured,

763
00:50:56.781 --> 00:51:01.460
richly textured poem
can be distinguished.
And I,

764
00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:05.440
in fact,
I think it has to be distinguished from the views of the narrator.

765
00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:07.893
<v 1>Oh,</v>

766
00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:13.470
<v 0>on some incredibly important level that's not on the level of what the narrator</v>

767
00:51:13.471 --> 00:51:14.250
tells us.

768
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:19.250
The poem is itself insistently Egalitarian and I mean that in a special sense.

769
00:51:19.411 --> 00:51:23.550
It's a gala Terrian in the sense that it's a poem rather than a dumb dogmatic

770
00:51:23.551 --> 00:51:26.820
treatise or a work of political philosophy as a poem.

771
00:51:26.821 --> 00:51:31.560
Paradise lost places,
all of it's divergent theories and all of its competing,

772
00:51:31.561 --> 00:51:36.120
eating,
uh,
uh,
competing ideologies and visions of the way the world works.

773
00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.750
Places them all side by side on something like a level playing field,

774
00:51:39.751 --> 00:51:44.751
the playing field of the poetic line and the poem connects these competing ideas

775
00:51:46.351 --> 00:51:46.830
with a,

776
00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:51.830
with nothing more leading than that most liberal of all conjunctions or of this

777
00:51:53.941 --> 00:51:54.510
port.
This,

778
00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:59.510
this poem makes the reader the equal of the poet because either this is the case

779
00:52:00.001 --> 00:52:04.050
or that is the case in Milton is always telling us to decide ourselves.

780
00:52:04.051 --> 00:52:06.120
The poem lays down and I'll conclude here,

781
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:10.530
or range of ideological possibilities and it does that,
um,
from the,

782
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.450
from its opening line two,
it's too,

783
00:52:12.451 --> 00:52:16.260
it's closing line and then it permits the reader,
or maybe I should say,

784
00:52:16.261 --> 00:52:19.980
it forces the reader to choose among these possibilities.

785
00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:21.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

786
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.840
<v 0>So books us,
we're on a roll.
This is our big week.</v>

787
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.390
A book seven and eight.
Four for next time.
