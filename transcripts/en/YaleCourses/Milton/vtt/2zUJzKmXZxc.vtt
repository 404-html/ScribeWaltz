1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.820
Everyone agrees that the epics,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:07.050
Emily's and paradise lost are different from the epic similes in,

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.980
in any other epic poem.
And everyone agrees,

4
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:13.830
I'm just going to be presenting to you a sense of critical consensus here.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.710
Everyone agrees that the similes are in some way,

6
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:19.950
absolutely essential to an understanding of this remarkable poem.

7
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:24.090
And everyone agrees that what Milton is doing in the similes is educating the

8
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:28.830
reader.
The reader of this,
of this poem,

9
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:31.470
he's introducing the reader to emotive vision,

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.780
different from the vision typically permitted him from within the poems,

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.160
uh,
more or less straight forward linear narrative boundaries.

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.960
The similes enabled us to see something about the story that the rest of the

13
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:49.890
poem doesn't enable us to see everyone.

14
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:54.540
I think that's fair to say that everyone agrees on that
and that's not nothing.

15
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.010
Uh,
but that's pretty much for the agreement
where the,

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.170
the agreement ends.
Milton's similes are notoriously difficult as,

17
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:08.310
as you no doubt have already experienced the,
and the,

18
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:12.480
and the poem seems unusually self conscious about the role that it's similes

19
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:14.310
play.
So think of the,
um,

20
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.790
the article on Milton similes by Jeffrey Hartman.

21
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.620
Hartman describes Milton's tendency in paradise lost and he takes this term from

22
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.020
Coleridge,
the,

23
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.560
the tendency to stand ob extra to stand from outside,

24
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.840
uh,
Milton's looking in at his own work from it from a distance according to

25
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.080
Coleridge.
And then Hartman and Hartman associates.

26
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:41.730
This image of Milton standing of extra with the figures in so many of those

27
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.660
similes who seem also to be standing,
uh,
extra.

28
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:48.690
And I think Hartman is absolutely right to note that it's,

29
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.370
it's this aspect of Milton similes that sets them entirely apart from the

30
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:56.890
similes and any other epic poem.
Um,
this,
uh,

31
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.920
everyone should have a handout would,
does everyone have a handout?
Yes.

32
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.290
Okay.
Um,
so this is my,

33
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.350
this is my first point.
There's also,
there's always,

34
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.080
and I think this is nearly invariable,
uh,
there's,

35
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.560
there's an element in Milton similes that stands outside the framework of the

36
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:24.120
basic comparison.
And in book one alone,
there are four primary instances of this.

37
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.320
What we can think of is this a primary similarly dynamic.
Um,

38
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:31.410
and we can call these the observers,
similes,
and it,

39
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:33.150
you see that they're listed on the handout.

40
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.340
So first we have the pilot of some small night foundered skiff and the pilot

41
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:43.070
stands up extra from outside in the simile and assembly is they're extensively

42
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.230
to to compare Satan with the great CBS Leviathan.

43
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.380
And in the comparison of Satan Shield with the moon,

44
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:51.130
there's the figure of the Tuscan artist,
uh,

45
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:55.920
the Tuscan artists being Galileo and Galileo appears in the simile but actually

46
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:59.650
seems to be unnecessary for the general purposes of the comparison.

47
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.070
And then we have the family of the fallen leaves the which compares the fallen

48
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:09.220
angels to fall on leaves.
And in that,
similarly we have the image of the,

49
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:12.700
of the Israelites,
the Milton calls them,
the southerners of Goshen,

50
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.740
and they're standing outside the general parameters of the comparison.

51
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.550
And so in each of these cases,
the figure who stands up extra from,

52
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.610
from outside is an observer and an observer looking in and interpreting the

53
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.120
action,

54
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.710
the action before him and observer in a position presumably to make some kind of

55
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.730
moral judgment on the action taking place.
Okay.

56
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.440
First of all,

57
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:43.441
let's look at the simile that compares Satan Shield to the moon.

58
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:48.460
This is book one,
line two 83 a.
This should be in the Hughes page two 18.

59
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.050
<v 0>He's scarce.
Had ceased when the superior feme.
That's obviously Satan.</v>

61
00:03:56.051 --> 00:04:01.000
When the superior fiend was moving toward the shore,
his ponderous shield,

62
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:02.260
ethereal temper,

63
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.740
Massey large and round behind him cast that broad circumference hung on his

64
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:13.630
shoulders like the moon.
Who's orb?
Through optic glass.

65
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:18.500
The Tuscan artist views at evening from the top of feds,

66
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.720
la or val [inaudible] know to describe new lands,

67
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.690
rivers or mountains in her spotty globe.

68
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.050
Let's,
let's try to take this apart.
The official function as I see it,
the,

69
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:33.270
the official function of this,
Emily,

70
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.080
is to give us a sense of the size of Satan Shield and thereby to give us a sense

71
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:43.030
of the size of Satan himself.
Satan Shield is as big as the moon.

72
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.950
Uh,
and this is the most common form of civil,
similarly,
Wa epic or otherwise.

73
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.400
And it can be ski.
Matteis well,
I'll,
I'm going to write on the board.
Uh,

74
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.350
she'll equals no,

75
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.720
and you can ski.
Monetize it with a,
let's say a equals a

76
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.800
<v 1>prime.
A prime.
I prime</v>

77
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.310
<v 0>you,
you,
you,
you,
you get it.
Something slightly different from me.
Uh,</v>

78
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.123
<v 1>that</v>

79
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.190
<v 0>what kind of makes sense.
Um,</v>

80
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.050
but there's more of course here then the moon to describe Satan Shield.

81
00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:25.670
It's a much more elaborate.
Similarly than that,

82
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.600
the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon,

83
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.340
who's orb through tests,
through optic glass,
the Tuscan artist views.

84
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.140
And all of a sudden a third element has been injected into the comparison.

85
00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:43.340
It has nothing whatsoever to do with the question of simply the size of Satan

86
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.341
Shield.

87
00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:48.290
And we realized that we have to redraw the Schema into which we fit this simile.

88
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.790
Um,
so it's not merely a equals a prime,

89
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.820
it's a equals a prime x and x here would be Galileo,

90
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.330
the Tuscan artist.

91
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.120
The X of course doesn't announce its purpose within the logical context of the

92
00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:12.031
simile.

93
00:06:12.031 --> 00:06:17.031
And one of the Labors of reading paradise lost is the readers obligation to

94
00:06:19.591 --> 00:06:22.320
supply the analog for the ex.

95
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.030
And this poem is filled with,
with such x's.
So what is it?

96
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.830
What is it we ask in the action of the poem that this x could be analogous to?

97
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.500
It's a good question and I think it still stands unresolved.

98
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.450
And the general understanding of this poem,
what is this observer?

99
00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:44.340
I'm extra represent Milton's.
See,
similes always seem overstuffed.
They're,

100
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:45.750
they're,
uh,
they're over determined.

101
00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:49.620
They always mean or signify far more than they're supposed to.

102
00:06:49.621 --> 00:06:51.930
If their job is simply to make a comparison.

103
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.940
And there's never been any agreement is so far as I can tell as to who it is

104
00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.090
we're supposed to be imagining the outside observer to be.
Uh,

105
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.710
and,
and there,
and there are all sorts of conjectures.
The,
the,
this,

106
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.070
there's the reader,
there's God.
Ah,
there's Milton [inaudible].

107
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.570
There are a number of possibilities.
Now,

108
00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:16.980
this particular similarly conjures for us an image of someone trying to get a

109
00:07:16.981 --> 00:07:18.600
fix on Satan Shield.

110
00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:22.920
And there's this suggestion here of an attempt to get a proper perspective on,

111
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.790
uh,
on this huge character,
Satan.
And,

112
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.130
and by extension,

113
00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:32.880
we have our attempt as readers to arrive at an understanding of the first two

114
00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:35.460
books in,
in general.
And it's easy to say.

115
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.290
I think it's easy to see why Milton Milton would have wanted to do this.

116
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:44.670
There's no question that it's Satan who in these first two books,

117
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.850
a completely overwhelms our,
our imagination.

118
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.620
He is without question the most compelling figure,

119
00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:54.450
certainly in the first two books.
And I think arguably in the entire poem.

120
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.250
And this fact is a con continually troubling phenomenon,
uh,

121
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.860
both for Milton and of course for Milton's readers.

122
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.880
And it only stands to reason I think that Milton would want to inscribe within

123
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:10.881
this poem the problem posed by this extraordinarily compelling characterization

124
00:08:12.211 --> 00:08:14.110
of Satan.
How are we supposed to see state?

125
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.590
How are we supposed to arrive at some kind of proper moral discernment of,

126
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:20.760
of Satan's being?
And these,

127
00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:24.720
this is a type of question that these similes are continually raising.

128
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.230
But let,
let,
let's,
let's wait.
We,
we,

129
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.840
we have further to go with this simile.

130
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.010
So initially the ponderous shield is of an a theory you'll temper,

131
00:08:35.011 --> 00:08:37.020
we were told it is,
it has been tempered in,

132
00:08:37.021 --> 00:08:40.110
it's a celestial fire in ether and it,

133
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:44.250
and it was the ether of the ethereal heavens that had always been thought

134
00:08:44.251 --> 00:08:46.530
throughout the renaissance and long before,
of course,

135
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.860
to be the most perfect substance imaginable.

136
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 0>The moon too was widely believed to be a perfect sphere of fiery ether.</v>

138
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.570
I'm like the sun.
It was thought to be a perfect heavenly body.

139
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.820
And as you probably know,

140
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.420
it was Galileo though the Tuscan artist,

141
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.070
the Italian astronomer who disproved just that assumption in 16,

142
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:15.090
10 when he published this idea,
Prius nuncius this the starry messenger.

143
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.050
So with his optic glass,
uh,
his telescope,

144
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.180
Galileo was able to discern spots on the orb of the moon.

145
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:28.620
It turned out to be a spotty globe,
just like the earth.

146
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:32.970
The moon seem to contain all of the geological imperfections of,
uh,
of earth.

147
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:33.570
There were no,

148
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.070
suddenly one could see looking through the optic last one could see valleys.

149
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:42.420
It seemed to have rivers that were mountains and it can no longer be said that

150
00:09:42.421 --> 00:09:46.350
the moon was perfect.
It was no longer a fiery,
heavenly body.

151
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:51.270
It was no longer after Galileo of an ethereal temper.

152
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.840
And it's in this light that the introduction I think,

153
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:57.870
of Galileo in the simile starts to make a little more sense.

154
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:59.250
If we had been thinking,

155
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.850
and some of us may well have been thinking and we were right to think

156
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.680
provisionally,

157
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.120
that Satan was a character that we could actually identify with if we had been

158
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:12.240
thinking that Satan was in any way a perfect character with some sort of

159
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:13.380
justifiable claim.

160
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.460
These thoughts are now being corrected by means by the mechanism of the simile

161
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:22.110
like the moon,
Satan may look beautiful,
but upon a closer scrutiny,

162
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:26.760
that beauty begins to yield certain metaphysical flaws.

163
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.350
Okay,
that's one way.
That's one way to read the simile.

164
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.200
A one way to make sense of this mention of a,
of the ex,
the,
the,

165
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.890
the Galileo figure.
It's a moral,

166
00:10:37.891 --> 00:10:41.040
that's a moral reading of Paradise lost that I've just given you.
And,
and it's,

167
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.890
uh,
but of course it's only a partial one.

168
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.730
It's not simply because we haven't gone further and a half.

169
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.260
It's not simply the Galileo represents the admiring observer of Satan who is

170
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:56.410
finally able to arrive at adjust sense of,
uh,

171
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.850
of his moral spots and imperfections.
It's,
it's more complicated than that.

172
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:05.600
Galileo himself is viewing the situation from a fallen and,

173
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.990
uh,
and an unperfect uncertain perspective.

174
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.280
Galileo was only using,
of course,
his telescope in the first place,

175
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.481
a but because the,

176
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:20.250
his human capacity for vision is insufficient to see the truths of,

177
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.710
of the heavens.
Uh,
the and fallen.

178
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:27.711
Adam certainly didn't need a telescope to discern a lot about the heavenly,

179
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.710
the heavenly bodies.
And for further complicating the picture,

180
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:36.711
Milton places this scene of observation with the extraordinary care at the

181
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.980
moment of evening.
And you'll be noticing as you read and reread the poem,

182
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.960
just how many crucial moments in paradise lost occur at evening or,
or twilight,

183
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:46.921
uh,
that,

184
00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:51.921
that privileged moment between day and night in which objects in our field of

185
00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:56.820
vision are,
they may be visible,
but they're nonetheless indistinct.
And,

186
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.500
and indeterminate.
There's up there,
they're blurred.

187
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.500
So Galileo here is struggling to get the proper visionary fix on the moon at a

188
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:08.340
point in the day when they're at where there are no absolutes.
There's we're,

189
00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:12.580
we're in between absolute day,
absolute night light and dark.

190
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.290
And Milton pushes this,

191
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.950
this image even further into and distinctness with an instance of the,

192
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.270
his famous deployment of the conjunction or,
and it has been argued,

193
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:23.710
and I think this is a brilliant point,

194
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.900
that the most important word in paradise lost is,
or the conjunction,

195
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.470
and,
and we'll be talking about why.
That's why that's the case,

196
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:33.830
but you'll get a little sense of it here.

197
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:39.060
The Tuscan artist views from the top of Fezza lay or invalid Arno.

198
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.830
Well,
on some level we,
we,
we'd kind of like to know which,
which it is.

199
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.060
I'm either on the top of a mountain or in a valley.
The vel Darn,
oh,

200
00:12:49.061 --> 00:12:51.660
the valley of the Arno River in Italy.
The,
the,

201
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:55.420
the place names may seem just as superfluous here,

202
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.140
something additional that has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual purpose

203
00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:00.130
of the comparison.

204
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:05.200
But Milton's uncertainty or the narrators uncertainty as to as to whether

205
00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:09.520
Galileo has stationed his telescope at the top of a mountain or deepen a valley

206
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:12.400
raises an important question about the status.

207
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.350
Literally the status of the observer here.

208
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.420
It's not just that Satan or the moon or whatever it is that we're looking at

209
00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:23.860
seems in indeterminate until we get,
until we get a proper look at it.

210
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.160
It's so much more complicated than that.

211
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:30.940
We don't even know where it is we're supposed to be looking from.

212
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.170
And the choice between Federal Land Bell Darn No,
uh,

213
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.940
that Milton gives the reader is,
is,
is crucial here.
The,
the,

214
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.010
the fact of the proliferation of possible perspectives is,

215
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.170
is just as important.

216
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.650
And I would think it's actually even more important as any single,

217
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:52.480
seemingly a proper perspective.
Okay.

218
00:13:52.481 --> 00:13:55.430
This is only the first mention of,
of,
of Galileo in the poem.
And,

219
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:57.700
and as you will see if you're careful,

220
00:13:57.701 --> 00:13:59.380
I'm looking at your footnotes in the Hughes.

221
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.100
He appears to other times within the later similes in the poem,

222
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.740
always in a similarly.
Um,
and it's,
uh,
you'll,

223
00:14:06.741 --> 00:14:08.200
you'll have on the handout the other,

224
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.800
the other mentions in paradise lost of Galileo.
It'd be a wonderful paper topic,

225
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.080
um,
and examination of all of the,
of the Galileo similes.
And so it,
you know,

226
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.280
I think it stands to reason to assume that this figure of Galileo is of some

227
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:24.640
importance to Milton and the workings of the poem.

228
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:28.300
Galileo was the only contemporary personage,

229
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.760
the only 17th century figure.
Even so much as mentioned in paradise,

230
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:35.830
lost the rest of contemporary history,

231
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.840
including all of the stormy events leading up to Milton's own beloved Puritan

232
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.930
Revolution,
um,
in which Milton himself of course had participated.

233
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.680
All of that has been,
at least at the literal level,
at the explicit level,

234
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:52.400
has been expunged from the poem Galileo important.

235
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.110
Milton had written an area politica then that he had actually met Galileo on his

236
00:14:57.111 --> 00:15:00.830
journey when Milton was a young man in Galileo was a very old man through the

237
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:05.720
continent.
It's anyone.
Milton met him.
Galileo would have been old and blind,

238
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.980
not unimportant to the later Milton and Galileo was under house arrest.

239
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.080
I'm at his home in fee as he'd been in prison for his intellectual,

240
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:19.940
daring and affirming the Copernican view that the earth orbiting around the sun.

241
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.220
He had rebelled against the supreme authority of the,
uh,

242
00:15:23.221 --> 00:15:25.190
of the Roman Catholic Church.
And in this respect,

243
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:30.191
he provides the poem with something like an earthly version of the arch rebel.

244
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.840
Satan,
of course,
Satan who,

245
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.960
who rebels against the supreme authority of the heavenly father.

246
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.473
<v 2>Okay,</v>

247
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.530
<v 0>well that makes sense.
Kind of,
but,
but the,</v>

248
00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:45.720
the Milton had clearly admired the astronomer and,
and calling him here,

249
00:15:45.721 --> 00:15:48.210
the Tuscan artist in some,
in some respects,

250
00:15:48.211 --> 00:15:52.610
we can see him forging an identification between himself as a literary artist.

251
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.150
And,
and Galileo was a scientific artist,
the rebellious artists,

252
00:15:57.151 --> 00:16:00.110
Milton and the rebellious astronomer,
Galileo,

253
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:03.240
or continually threatening to,
to,
to,

254
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.530
to lapse into some sort of identity with Satan himself.
And,
and,

255
00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:11.880
and suddenly the distinctions that the simile works so hard to establish are

256
00:16:11.881 --> 00:16:15.870
beginning to erode.
Not just that,

257
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:21.110
but the moral certainties that may have seemed distinct when we contrasted the

258
00:16:21.661 --> 00:16:26.661
ethereal haven't with the spotty and the imperfect nature of Satan and of the

259
00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:30.060
moon up those two begin to seem fairly hazy.

260
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.800
[inaudible] sets out to establish the moral polarities between good and evil.

261
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:40.730
But it then works almost systematically to undo that,

262
00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:46.101
that understanding the perspective is an evening perspective rather than a

263
00:16:46.141 --> 00:16:50.490
perspective of total illumination that the similes are continually working to

264
00:16:50.491 --> 00:16:54.360
unleash.
Um,
and they're really quite unruly in this respect.

265
00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:58.740
The to unleash the moral and the theological confusion that's so much of the

266
00:16:58.741 --> 00:17:02.520
rest of the poem seems really quite eager to pin down and to fix.

267
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.540
That was the Galileo.
Similarly,

268
00:17:06.541 --> 00:17:10.320
let's look at the comparison of Satan spear to the,

269
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:15.480
that's how big Satan's shield was.
Well,
how big is Taten spear?
Uh,

270
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.350
Milton compares it to the mast of a ship and a,

271
00:17:19.351 --> 00:17:22.740
this is a line to 92 in book one,

272
00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.590
the bottom of page 218 in the Hughes.

273
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:30.360
And this is the simile that Stanley fish brilliantly describes as central to a

274
00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:32.220
certain temporal procedure,

275
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.240
common in Milton's verse and fishes interested in the temporal process of

276
00:17:36.241 --> 00:17:38.660
reading.
And,
and in,
in general,
we can [inaudible].

277
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.190
And it's this extraordinary insight that he gives us.

278
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.170
We can only read one word at a time.
We can only read one line at a time.

279
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:47.080
And,
and,

280
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:51.810
and fish argues that the simile has no choice but to unfold over time.

281
00:17:51.811 --> 00:17:53.760
And so in the example about Milton Spear,

282
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:58.761
we read first that this is line two 92 isn't how Stanley fishes reading goes his

283
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:05.511
spear to equal which the tallest pine hewn on Norwegian hills to be the master

284
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:10.410
of some great amaryl or flagship.
Uh,

285
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.230
an Amarillo is a,
is a big,
uh,
worship.

286
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.850
Now we may assume having read only that much of the Simile,

287
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:22.140
that Satan spear is as tall as the mast of the ship,
not a small spear.

288
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.410
And so we adjust our minds to accommodate because presumably when we weren't

289
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:27.300
imagining Satan to be that big,

290
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.620
we adjust our minds to accommodate this sense of Satan's tremendous physical

291
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:34.590
magnitude.
Sure.
Surely Satan is bigger than,

292
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.970
than anything when we had been assuming.
But the simile continues.

293
00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.890
And as soon as we read the next line,

294
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:43.890
so we're struck with the possibility and surely it's just a provisional

295
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:44.724
possibility,

296
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:50.030
but we're struck by the image that Satan's spirit is actually quite small.

297
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.420
He's spear,
we're butter wand.

298
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.310
He walked with to support uneasy steps.

299
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.950
If only for a moment,
Satan suddenly seems old and frail.
This is a,

300
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.730
this is an image of an old man with a cane and we have to adjust our

301
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:09.480
understanding of his sophistical size one more time.
And of course,

302
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.853
uh,

303
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.420
necessarily his moral magnitude would be adjusted as well in our,

304
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:19.170
in our interpretation.
Needless to say,
we're not done that.

305
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:23.120
The similarly isn't telling us that Satan Spears as small as a wand,

306
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.170
a because what we have is a syllogism here.

307
00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:30.270
Satan's Satan's sphere is to the tallest pine.

308
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.780
What the tallest pine is too.
A little,
a little bit he wand.

309
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.760
And finally we realized that same sphere is of an unimaginable proportion.

310
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.491
Uh,

311
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:45.120
just as soon as we've crowded our imagination imagination already with the image

312
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:48.600
of the spear.
The size of a Norwegian pine,
which took a certain,

313
00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:50.220
an imaginative leap on our parts.

314
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.270
We realize that Satan and his spear are a measurably larger even than that.

315
00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:00.260
And the s the similarly pushes the size of the spear clean out of our rational

316
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:01.344
comprehension.

317
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.300
And it's this process that is according to Stanley fish,

318
00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.130
that the point of this simile and the circuitous logical route that we had to

319
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:15.540
take in order to arrive at this new sense of Satan size has everything to do

320
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:20.541
with our status as temporarily bound temporally constrained readers.

321
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.100
That the and the,

322
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.140
the genius of fishes reading of Milton similes is to understand the particularly

323
00:20:27.751 --> 00:20:31.170
timebound nature of,
of Milton's bursts.

324
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.640
So first we read that that Satan spear is big.
Then we read,

325
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:37.920
or at least we think we read that Satan Spear is small.

326
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:41.910
And then we realize over the course of this reading process that Satan spear is

327
00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:42.744
unimaginable.

328
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.500
And we realized that our timebound mode of knowing is ultimately inadequate to

329
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:51.250
understand anything about the inscrutable truths of eternity.

330
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.240
This is according to fish.

331
00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:56.220
We can't know anything certain about the eternal and the immortal world of,

332
00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:59.950
of Paradise lost except through these faculties we have.
And these are,

333
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:02.230
those are uncertain,
imperfect,

334
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.410
fallen a human capacities of reading.

335
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.390
Milton wants to the reader to know that she's fallen.

336
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.880
We are all fallen at any problem that we have.

337
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:17.881
And understanding that Theology of Heaven and Hell is our problem is our problem

338
00:21:18.131 --> 00:21:20.020
has fallen readers and,
and,
and fish imagines.

339
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:23.260
Milton is always on some level slapping the reader's wrist,

340
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.150
reminding the reader of his or her phone knows that there's a constant

341
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.710
pedagogical correction going on.
That was Stanley fish,

342
00:21:32.711 --> 00:21:36.940
the other great critic of the miltonic.
Similarly for my money,
uh,
it takes,
uh,

343
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.080
a completely different tack and that's Jeffrey Hartman who makes an argument

344
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:45.850
that might even be thought to contradict fishes argument,

345
00:21:45.851 --> 00:21:50.851
although actually Jeffrey Hartman wrote his piece first and Hartmans and vintage

346
00:21:51.401 --> 00:21:56.110
of the simile isn't temporal.
The way fishes was.
It's spatial.

347
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.000
And for Hartman,
the miltonic similarly actually permits the readers.

348
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:05.770
Something like the perspective of eternity,
a divine perspective.
Of course,

349
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:08.260
this is exactly what Stanley fish had told us was impossible.

350
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.160
And the rhetorical strategy that Milton uses to give us this perspective of

351
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:17.190
eternity is what Jeffrey Hartman calls Milton's counter plot like fish.

352
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.630
Hartman is most interested in the similes of the first two books,

353
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.250
the assemblies that provide some kind of window under the world of Satan and he

354
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:31.870
focuses on the simile actually that follows the simile of Satan Shield that

355
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:36.730
we've been looking at and it follows the simile of the of the spear that fish it

356
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:40.600
analyzed.
This is the simile of the leaves,

357
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.020
so I'm going to ask you to look at line 300 of book.
One

358
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:48.460
page two 19 in the Hughes,

359
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:53.610
Satan has roused himself from off the burning marl and he stands in order to

360
00:22:54.761 --> 00:22:58.780
call up his fallen minions to rouse them to act great acts of heroism.

361
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.530
He stood and cold his legions.

362
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:07.531
Angel forms who lay and tranced thick as a tunnel leaves that strew the Brooks

363
00:23:09.311 --> 00:23:14.311
and Vellum Rosa where the Atari and shades high overarched and bower or

364
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:17.890
scattered sedge afloat.
When with fierce winds,

365
00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:22.090
Orion armed had Vic's the Red Sea coast whose waves or through abuse,

366
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:24.070
Cyrus and his Memphian chivalry.

367
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:29.140
While with proof this thing doesn't end well with perfidious hatred.

368
00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:33.430
They pursued the southerners of Goshen who be held from the safe shore.

369
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:36.550
They're floating carcasses and broken chariot wheels.

370
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:40.360
So thick PBIS strewn abject and lost lay.

371
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:45.100
These covering the flood under amazement of hideous change

372
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:51.620
for me that absolutely shocking fact of this simile is that its primary purpose

373
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:56.621
is near merely to describe the number of angels who are prostrate on the burning

374
00:23:57.381 --> 00:24:01.730
lake of hell.
They lie and tranced thick as a ta.

375
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.150
How many angels were there?
They life,
they'll,
they lie,

376
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.660
they lie thick as a tunnel leaves.
That's true.
The Brooks and [inaudible] Rosa,

377
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:14.450
but Milton Milton will pursue this similarly with such a relentless drive.

378
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.720
It's exhausting that,
that by the end of that,
we've,

379
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.610
I think we've probably forgotten its role and merely in it'll illustrating the

380
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.550
quantity of,
of,
of Angel Forms.

381
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:30.730
Now the angels lay as thick as the sedge on the Red Sea coast.
Uh,
when Pharaoh,

382
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.130
a Milton uses the Latin abuse Cyrus for Pharaoh,

383
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:38.780
when Pharaoh with all his Egyptian army chased the Israelites across the Red Sea

384
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.620
after God.
And this is a,
this is the story told an exodus 14,

385
00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.700
after God parted the Red Sea to allow the sojourners of,
of,

386
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.150
of Goshen the Israel lights to cross.

387
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.650
So Satan's that described initially here as the wind god,
Orion,

388
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.500
a classical figure who,

389
00:24:57.501 --> 00:25:02.000
who vexed or tossed the web waves of the Red Sea just to Satan is rousing and

390
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.880
inspiring his fallen host of angels.

391
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.480
But Milton continues to complicate this,
Emily,

392
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:12.500
and he quickly complicates our identification of Orion with Satan,

393
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.800
which wasn't arrived at,
um,
that easily to begin with.

394
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.680
So Satan may be like the Wind Orion,

395
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.380
but Orion here is also seen as vexing and destroying the Egyptians who's

396
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:26.480
carcasses wash up on the shores of the,

397
00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:31.481
of the Red Sea and the Israel lights having crossed the Red Sea safely look on

398
00:25:31.491 --> 00:25:35.600
at this destruction from the safety of their shore.
Think about it.

399
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:39.800
Something's gone.
Something's gone awry in this simile.
The window.

400
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:43.620
Ryan had initially represented the heroic,
uh,

401
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.630
they're heroic general of his troops.
Satan and Harmon,
uh,

402
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.280
Jeffrey Hartman would describe this as the,
as the plot of the simile,

403
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.630
but this wind or Ryan begins immediately to destroy the evil abuse.

404
00:25:57.631 --> 00:25:59.390
Cyrus the Egyptian Pharaoh,

405
00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.130
a figure that biblical history had long associated with Satan had considered to

406
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:08.060
be an earthly version or a type of Satan.

407
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.100
And so you have a wind God who's identified with sate and destroying Pharaoh who

408
00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:17.600
has also identified with Satan justice just as he attempts to destroy God's

409
00:26:17.601 --> 00:26:21.110
faithful.
And it's this final movement of the simile.

410
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.760
According to this ingenious argument by Jeffrey Hartman that Hartman calls the

411
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.160
counter plot embedded within the explicit plot of the simile is a,

412
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.070
is a secret,
a kind of buried narrative.

413
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:38.170
And it's a hidden story that illustrates Satan.
Self-Destruction.

414
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.210
Say it illustrates safe,
safe Satan self,

415
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.680
even as the main narrative of the seminal similarly portrays Satan's heroism

416
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:49.980
and,
and the,

417
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:54.960
and the plot around the simile is glorifying the heroic Satan here

418
00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.170
and Hartman and ingeniously locates throughout a number of Milton similes.

419
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.550
This same dynamic of a,
of a redemptive counter plot.

420
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.450
It's as if there's this subterranean figurative movement movement at work in the

421
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:14.470
similarly that's continually reminding us according to Hartman of the calm

422
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:18.660
efforts of divine providence on behalf of us,

423
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.080
of good Christian men and women,
um,

424
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.480
some ultimate divine control over the evil actions of Satan.

425
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.540
Now,
the genius of Hartman's argument about the counter plot was that,

426
00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:33.420
was that when it,
when,
when Hartman floated this argument in the late fifties,

427
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.920
was that it enabled us to understand not us,
we weren't,
we weren't born then,

428
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:42.000
but it enabled readers and Milton to understand for the first time something

429
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:46.520
like that theological purpose behind a lot of the most fascinating and,

430
00:27:46.521 --> 00:27:48.900
and extraordinary rhetorical effects of the poem.

431
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.760
And Hartman made sense of the seemingly chaotic and confused movement of the,

432
00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:55.500
of the narrators imagination here.

433
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.150
And this counter plot continues to reinforce according to Hartman,

434
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.100
our faith and the two most important elements of,
of the poem's theology.

435
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:08.880
And that's man's free will Milton Milton's doctrine of free will on the one
hand.

436
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.190
And,
uh,
Milton's insistence on the importance of divine providence.
On,

437
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.200
on the other hand,
God's fore knowledge

438
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.500
through the dynamics of the counter plot,

439
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:24.270
the similes reassure us of what Hartman calls the grease full coexistence of

440
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:26.790
freewill and divine providence.

441
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.110
Let's move on.
Neither of these critics,

442
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:36.140
neither fish nor Hartman discusses one of the most celebrated aspects of this

443
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:38.770
last Semele that we've,
that we've looked at,
and I,

444
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.400
and I have a little hunch that there's a reason for their neglect.

445
00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:46.470
This is the initial part of the simile that describes the leaves,
excuse me,

446
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.550
thick as a tem,

447
00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:54.551
the leaves that Stroh the Brooks and Vallum Broza where the [inaudible] shades

448
00:28:55.621 --> 00:28:59.520
high overarched empower the,

449
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:04.830
at least since the 18th century,
these lines have been singled out for their,

450
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:09.030
for their beauty and considering the Milton as describing the hideous demons

451
00:29:09.031 --> 00:29:11.220
under Satan's control.
The,

452
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.480
the pastoral elegance of this little similarly really catches us off guard and

453
00:29:17.521 --> 00:29:20.610
there's naturally a lot of pressure on Milton to make this part of the similarly

454
00:29:20.611 --> 00:29:24.840
beautiful and striking because he's echoing not just one epic poet,

455
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.780
but essentially he's echoing just about every epic poet,

456
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.780
homer and Virgil and well after them,

457
00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:33.780
Dante and innumerable others.

458
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:38.780
Have all applied the simile of the leaves or some version of it to describe the

459
00:29:38.911 --> 00:29:42.850
number lessness of the dead.
This is on your handout and,

460
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:44.770
and the Elliot as you can.
As you can see,

461
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:48.640
the warrior glock us uses the simile of the leaves to dismiss the importance of

462
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:51.850
genealogy.
Why does it matter what family I'm from?

463
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:57.300
He asks diabetes very like leaves upon this earth are the generations of men.

464
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.940
There's a kind of organic continuity that,
uh,

465
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.570
that men partake of just as the natural world does.

466
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.250
Virgil alludes to just this passage in homer when he describes the entrance of a

467
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:10.330
whole crowd of,

468
00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.130
of people into the under underworld as the falling of leaves in the early frost

469
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:19.000
of autumn.
This is where,
this is where Milton gets to the tunnel.

470
00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.120
And finally Dante alludes to this image of,

471
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:28.540
of the Virgilian underworld in the inferno when he describes the descent of

472
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:32.200
humanity,
the evil seed of Adam into the Christian hell.

473
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.230
And so it's Dante who first supplies the notion of fallenness.

474
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:40.420
The theological notion of fallen us to this idea of the fact that the leaves

475
00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.890
have fallen because of course,
Dante,
unlike homer and Virgil is,
is a,

476
00:30:44.891 --> 00:30:49.180
is a Christian and has access to the,
to the,
the,
the Christian myth of the fall.

477
00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:55.660
And so it would seem to be dawn taze use of the image that has a primary

478
00:30:55.661 --> 00:30:58.900
influence here on,
on Milton.
But as we might expect,

479
00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.000
there's a complication in the way that Milton uses this particular image.

480
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.720
Val Ambrose is a place in Italy that Milton had actually visited.

481
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:08.980
He had as a young man,

482
00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:13.330
he visited and Rosa when he was introduced to Galileo in theatrical lighting,

483
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.030
val,
Val and Rosa Literally Means Shady Valley.
And,

484
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:23.110
and I think it recalls Galileo shady place.
Val Dar,

485
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:27.490
no another valley.
Um,
as,
as you know,
in classical literature,

486
00:31:27.491 --> 00:31:30.520
the dead are referred to as,
as shades.

487
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.790
But here in Milton,
simile shades merely means shade trees.

488
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:41.460
It refers solely to,
to,
uh,
to,
to trees.
And,

489
00:31:41.461 --> 00:31:46.000
and Val Bros is the place where the attorney in shades high overarched and Bauer

490
00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:46.960
as it.

491
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.960
And if these trees are still supplying shade and Bowering the entire Valley of

492
00:31:52.451 --> 00:31:56.140
Alan Broza,
the leaves haven't all fallen.

493
00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:01.810
Of course they're,
they're only in the process of fallen of falling.

494
00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.230
And I think this is an important distinction because what you have here in the,

495
00:32:06.231 --> 00:32:08.140
in the,
in the middle of this,

496
00:32:08.141 --> 00:32:12.970
similarly in Milton's account of hell is an image of a Bauer.

497
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.090
This is a little,
this is a little paradise,

498
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:21.510
a paradise on the verge of being lost as the shades lose their tree as their

499
00:32:22.311 --> 00:32:25.090
shades Lou there leaves the leaves,
you're about to fall,

500
00:32:25.091 --> 00:32:26.260
but they haven't yet fallen.

501
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:31.630
And I think it's the imminence of their fallen us,
that Lens,

502
00:32:31.631 --> 00:32:36.610
this image,
it's a,
it's,
it's incredibly powerful emotional intensity.

503
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.990
And also I think it's,

504
00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:42.530
it's beauty that now the similarly concludes with a strong sense of the hideous

505
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:46.430
change under annual year will recognize this pattern again and again and

506
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:49.730
Knowlton the hideous changed undergone by the fallen angels.

507
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:54.620
But what we have here is an image of the beauty of that change.

508
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.490
The beauty of the fact that the leaves are falling.

509
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.030
Both Hartman and fish argued that the,

510
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:06.770
that the rhetorical strategies of Milton's similes work to reinforce the

511
00:33:06.771 --> 00:33:10.720
theological categories of good and evil.
They argued that,

512
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.320
that the similes are supposed to reassure us that there is a divine good that

513
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:17.540
ultimately overwhelms the evil,

514
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.860
the evil represented by Satan.

515
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.560
But neither of these critics was,
was able to,

516
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:30.650
to discuss directly Milton's aestheticization of the fall,
uh,

517
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.870
in the lines on Val and Rosa.

518
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:36.290
And that's because it's here where the rigid polarities between light and dark

519
00:33:36.291 --> 00:33:39.470
and good and evil,
all of these absolute opposites,

520
00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:41.480
shins be begin to collapse.

521
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:46.690
Milton opens up a shady space for something approaching a kind of moral

522
00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:49.910
relativism were,
were black and white.

523
00:33:49.911 --> 00:33:53.030
Theological theological categories simply don't apply.

524
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.080
And of course this is only provisional,
but the space,
the shady space exists.

525
00:33:57.081 --> 00:33:57.914
Nonetheless,

526
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:03.790
he returns us to the lowly perspective that Galileo had had when he set up his

527
00:34:05.211 --> 00:34:08.480
telescope and that other valley,
Val,
Val Darko,

528
00:34:08.481 --> 00:34:13.481
and it's this lowly vantage point that's beautiful in part because it's a fallen

529
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.970
perspective,
not in spite of the fact that it's a fallen perspective.
Now,
I,

530
00:34:18.971 --> 00:34:19.890
I,
I,

531
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.080
I think now we can see why these lines about the autumnal leaves are so

532
00:34:24.081 --> 00:34:29.081
difficult for us to incorporate into a moral reading or a theological reading of

533
00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:34.790
the poem there invariably cited as among the most beautiful and exquisite lines

534
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:39.500
in paradise lost.
But on some level they've proven the bane of,
uh,

535
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:43.460
of scholars because they can't be squared with any of the poems,

536
00:34:43.461 --> 00:34:44.830
theological message.
And,

537
00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:48.240
and this is the remarkable thing about so many of Milton's similes there.

538
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:52.010
They're always bursting out of whatever critical or,

539
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.280
or theological constraints that we work so hard to impose on them.

540
00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.250
So for Stanley fish meant is always reminding us of our fallenness as readers

541
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.340
and we're continually being encouraged to,
uh,

542
00:35:04.341 --> 00:35:09.341
submit all of our uncertainties and all of our doubts to two to the power of

543
00:35:09.381 --> 00:35:12.680
faith.
God is in control of the universe and if,

544
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.400
and if the poem seems not that Stanley Fish,
uh,
believes in God,

545
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.810
but nonetheless,
his Milton certainly does.
God is in control of the universe.

546
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.200
And if the poem seems momentarily to suggest otherwise,

547
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.130
that simply Milton's way of reminding us of the extent of our,

548
00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:33.131
of our fallenness and Geoffrey Hartman's theory had a similar tendency to align

549
00:35:33.831 --> 00:35:38.610
the poem with a kind of a religious orthodoxy that the assemblies are for him

550
00:35:38.611 --> 00:35:39.690
instrument in the poems,

551
00:35:39.691 --> 00:35:44.691
larger agenda to reinforce our faith in the coexistence of freewill and divine

552
00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:48.150
providence.
Difficult,

553
00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:53.360
huge concepts and Hartman's absolutely right to insist that no theological

554
00:35:56.131 --> 00:35:56.731
concept is,

555
00:35:56.731 --> 00:36:00.750
it's important to paradise lost as freewill on the one hand and divine

556
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:05.360
providence on the other.
We can say that,

557
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:10.570
but I wonder if it's possible even for these similes to convince us of the easy

558
00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:16.961
coexistence of these two incredibly important theological categories,

559
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.680
freewill and divine foreknowledge.

560
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.340
Long before Milton had begun to tackle the problem Christians had for centuries,

561
00:36:25.341 --> 00:36:26.180
for Millennia,

562
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.160
a puzzled over the logical inconsistency between these two concepts.

563
00:36:31.161 --> 00:36:35.540
If God,
uh,
and,
and,
and we all have our version of,
of trying to wrestle with this.

564
00:36:35.541 --> 00:36:37.880
If God knows what you're going to do to tomorrow,

565
00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:42.290
to what extent does it make sense to say that what you do tomorrow you do
freely.

566
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.271
And Milton,

567
00:36:44.271 --> 00:36:48.770
like a lot of Orthodox Christians will insist when he's speaking theologically

568
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:54.320
that God's fore knowledge has no causal effect whatsoever on the future.

569
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.370
And so it doesn't actually impinge on our freewill.
And,
and this is the god,

570
00:36:58.371 --> 00:37:00.590
the father will make a similar argument in book three.

571
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:06.580
The conclusion reached in book three is that God has for knowledge,

572
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.210
but he isn't that interested in actual predetermination,
um,

573
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:15.530
or some type of divine action that literally compels the behavior of,

574
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.490
of human creatures.

575
00:37:16.491 --> 00:37:21.491
And so it's possible presumably to say that Adam and eve actually had no choice,

576
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:26.630
uh,
they,
they had no choice when they decided to eat the fruit.

577
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.250
And even though God knew that,
of course,

578
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.840
no,
even though I said exactly the wrong thing,

579
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:40.950
this is how confusing the wandering mazes is lost that the problem of freewill

580
00:37:40.951 --> 00:37:42.660
and foreknowledge puts us in.
Um,

581
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.870
even though God knew exactly what Adam and eve would do,

582
00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.040
that they would eat the fruit,

583
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:51.720
we still have to be able to say that they ate the fruit freely out of their own

584
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.550
freewill.
Now,

585
00:37:53.551 --> 00:37:58.551
scholars are ingenious in their ability to skirt absolutely.

586
00:37:59.770 --> 00:37:59.970
Uh,

587
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:04.650
the central conundrum of providence that this poem raises and which it raises so

588
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:08.240
insistently and it really refuses to let go of it.
Um,

589
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:13.370
but that doesn't mean that the problem just goes away and I can't help but feel

590
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:17.730
that the winning team within the context of the actual story of the fall,

591
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.110
the fall of Adam and eve,

592
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:23.700
that the idea of divine providence isn't actually all that comforting.

593
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:28.230
The very idea of divine providence when it's injected into the story of Adam and

594
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:33.231
Eve's perfectly disastrous choice to eat the apple seems to arouse in a lot of

595
00:38:33.601 --> 00:38:37.030
us feelings of injustice.
We,
what would we call this now?
This is,

596
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.860
this is entrapment.
What,

597
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:41.350
why did God place this stupid fruit in the garden in the first place?

598
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:44.500
If he knew in advance that Adam and eve were going to eat the thing.

599
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.230
And the very idea of providence in this context can in fact assume a kind of

600
00:38:50.231 --> 00:38:54.920
menacing force that seems to compel men and women,
uh,

601
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.200
to their evil actions,
regardless of their theoretical,

602
00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:03.490
they're technical possession of this capacity that we call that we feel very

603
00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:05.380
comfortable calling freewill.

604
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:10.550
So Hartman and fish had been forwarded to perfectly ingenious theories of Milton

605
00:39:10.551 --> 00:39:14.740
similes,
and they've had a tremendous impact,
rightly on generations now,

606
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:15.730
of readers of Milton.

607
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:20.920
They've taught us how to appreciate what strangest and most remarkable about

608
00:39:20.921 --> 00:39:21.671
paradise lost.

609
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:26.671
But I simply cannot agree with their suggestion that Milton similes work in any

610
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:33.600
meaningful way to strengthen our belief in the Christian idea of the coexistence

611
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:37.900
of freewill and God's fore knowledge.
I,

612
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:42.910
I'm not convinced that that the poems radical and most subversive and most

613
00:39:44.591 --> 00:39:47.590
exquisite rhetorical effects,
these amazing similes,

614
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:52.510
presents us with anything like a simple and unambiguous religious message.

615
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:58.260
Paradise lost as a whole clearly wants us to believe that God has for knowledge.

616
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:02.250
And it also clearly wants us to believe that we have freewill,

617
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:07.260
but the similes seemed just as often to open up and to question the poems.

618
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.850
Doc trinal conclusions.

619
00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:14.020
It's the similes were not to sew everything up,

620
00:40:14.021 --> 00:40:19.021
but make it impossible for us to maintain anything like the official position on

621
00:40:19.041 --> 00:40:23.240
the,
on a moral distinction between heavenly good and satanic evil and Milton's

622
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:28.590
interest in moments of blurriness and have a visual in distinctness suggest that

623
00:40:29.141 --> 00:40:33.640
the distinction between good and evil is,
is actually never that clear.

624
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.450
Okay,
we have time for another simile.

625
00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.740
The last simile of book one,
this is page 231 in the Hughes.

626
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.770
This is the simile of the belated peasant that Hartman describes.

627
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:52.180
Um,
Satan in the fallen angels are entering the magnificent structure of

628
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:55.690
pandemonium.
And at one instance,
one instance,

629
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:59.980
all of the angel shrink in order to fit into the building,
however big it is,

630
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.910
which is,

631
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:05.080
but it's obviously too small for the angels to fit their in their proper

632
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:08.800
dimensions.
Look at line seven 79 of book one.

633
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:14.490
They a narrow room throng numberless like that pig man race beyond the Indian

634
00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:20.101
mount or fairy elves who's mountain rebels by a forest side or fountain.

635
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.230
Well,
which is it?
And this is another important,
or by a forest side or fountain,

636
00:41:26.231 --> 00:41:31.030
some belated presidencies or dreams he sees while overhead,

637
00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:35.600
the moon sits arbitrary dates and nearer to the earth.
Wheels are Pale course.

638
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:41.140
They on their mirth than dance intent with Jochin music charm his ear at once

639
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:44.390
with joy and fear his heart rebounds.

640
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.660
Now the purpose of this simile is two events,

641
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:51.830
the indistinct anise and the confusion produced by our vision of the fallen

642
00:41:51.831 --> 00:41:52.664
angels.

643
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.840
We can only imagine the fallen angels with the kind of dim uncertainty just as

644
00:41:56.841 --> 00:42:01.220
the belated peasant sees,
or perhaps the only dreams he sees,

645
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.820
the dance of fairy elves by a forest side.

646
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:09.320
Uh,
now,
so,

647
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.740
so many scholars of Milton are under some sort of pressure to wreck,

648
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:17.830
reconcile everything in Milton's universe to a single theological mesh message.

649
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.320
Uh,
but I think there's,
there's,

650
00:42:21.321 --> 00:42:26.321
there's something in this simile that resists our alignment of all the things

651
00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:31.310
that the peasants sees,
uh,
with,
with the satanic world of unmitigated evil,

652
00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:32.990
of,
of the fallen angels.

653
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.770
There's a difference between Fareol's and hideous demons.

654
00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.100
I submit and with the phrase sees or dreams,

655
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:44.330
he sees Milton's alluding to Virgil's Aeneid who descends to the underworld and

656
00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:47.720
catches a glimpse of the shade of his dead lover,
Dido,

657
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:53.180
or he thinks he catches a glimpse of the shade of his dead lover.

658
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.553
Dido.

659
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:59.030
The Virgilian echo gives this passage in Milton and an unmistakable pathos and

660
00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:03.350
an undeniable beauty.
And as with the passage on the falling of the leaves,

661
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:08.351
there's a kind of elegiac tone that works to undo or at least to challenge our

662
00:43:08.781 --> 00:43:13.340
theological certainty.
And as we noticed that this,

663
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.900
all these similes have these observer figures.
And this one does too.
Um,

664
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.310
there's a,
there's a second figure here,
standing up extra,

665
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:26.780
and that's the moon hovering overhead.
While the while overhead,

666
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:30.950
the moon sits arbitrators and we're naturally invited to question,

667
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.660
what force is it that this moon represents?

668
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:39.320
Now you remember may remember what Jeffrey Hartman had argued that the moon

669
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:41.570
represents the power of divine providence.

670
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.810
And there's a lot of ways in which this reading makes sense.

671
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.550
And Arbitrary [inaudible] is a judge and she would seem to oversee the justice

672
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:53.360
in this world.
And the question of providential justice is of course a primary,

673
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:58.460
uh,
significance to Milton's poem.
But Hartman goes on to say that the moon,

674
00:43:58.461 --> 00:44:03.461
which reminds us of a common perfect sense of providence also works to guarantee

675
00:44:03.831 --> 00:44:07.760
the principle of freewill.
So this is my question to you.

676
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:13.520
How complete and perfect is the image of providence that hovers,

677
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.510
that hovers moonlight over the pages of paradise lost.

678
00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:22.511
I think Milton is encouraging us in these similes to question really to wrestle

679
00:44:22.581 --> 00:44:27.581
with the theological certainties that the rest of the poem labors to establish.

680
00:44:28.431 --> 00:44:28.820
And the,

681
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.510
and the uncertain status of divine providence here think has made clear by it's

682
00:44:33.511 --> 00:44:35.490
by it's figuration as a moon.

683
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.450
And so I'm going to conclude here by reminding you what you already know.

684
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:42.960
We have already seen a moon in book one.

685
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:48.320
The Moon was compared to Satan Shield and Milton was preparing us then for this,

686
00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:52.560
this radically ambiguous status of this providential moon.

687
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.330
It was Galileo's job.

688
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:59.330
You'll remember with his telescoped to detect the otherwise in detectable spots

689
00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:05.130
and imperfections in this seemingly but only seemingly perfect moon.

690
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:10.380
And I'm convinced that it's the reader's job to apply the same degree of

691
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:11.460
critical scrutiny,

692
00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.110
a kind of Galilean critical scrutiny to the image of providence that will be

693
00:45:16.111 --> 00:45:16.771
elaborated,

694
00:45:16.771 --> 00:45:21.771
as you will see at extraordinary length in book three of paradise lost.

695
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:26.370
So for next time,
you'll read book three.
Um,
you will focus,
however,

696
00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:27.930
on the opening and vocation,

697
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.880
please do read all of the other selections as well.
You will have sonnets.

698
00:45:32.881 --> 00:45:35.610
Little bits of pros.
We'll be talking about Milton's blindness.
