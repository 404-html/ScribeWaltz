1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.910
We've looked at Milton's earliest poem or what Milton wants us to think of as

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:10.140
his earliest poem from,
from,
from a couple of different perspectives.

3
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.000
So were you remember our examination on Monday of the naitivity owed,

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.970
which I took to be an early,

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.740
an early poetic achievement in Milton's career in which Milton himself took to

6
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.890
be an early poetic achievement in his career.
But we also looked at that the,

7
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:31.891
the naitivity owed is a poem or a kind of statement about the very nature of a,

8
00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:37.901
of an early poetic achievement and about Milton's sense of the nature of a

9
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:42.240
poetic career in general.
Um,
and I think this,

10
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.270
this can be said,
uh,
this is true of a number of,
of,

11
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:47.370
of Milton's earliest lyrics.

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.820
The early poems are not merely a brilliant literary exercises in and of them in

13
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:55.770
and of themselves,
although of course they are.
They are,

14
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.740
that the early lyrics are also instances,

15
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:03.741
or what we can think of is moments in Milton's lifelong meditation on what it is

16
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:05.581
to be a poet.

17
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:09.180
And I think it's fair to say that Milton's reconceptualization of the role of

18
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:14.040
the poet really permanently altered the way in which later generations,

19
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.120
especially later generations of,

20
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.150
of writers and poets would imagine the work of poetry and imagine the power of

21
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:26.100
the poet.
And,
and I think in this respect,
Milton's contribution,

22
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.750
uh,
to the,
to,
to the western literary imagination is really unparalleled.

23
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.830
Milton represented himself as a poet more often and with more care and attention

24
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.960
than any English poet and he English poet before him.
And in fact,
it,

25
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.020
it often strikes us that Milton's poetry,
uh,

26
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.070
seemed so absolutely new and so original because he's really the first poet who

27
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:56.250
in a number of ways,
um,
in a number of different registers,

28
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.870
seems often to be doing little more than a describing himself,

29
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.590
justifying himself or accounting for himself.

30
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.130
And it's this procedure of self accounting that,

31
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.190
that I wanna focus on today as we look at Milton's amazing sense of his vocation

32
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.090
as a poet and Milton sense of poetry writing as an example of what,

33
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.120
what he calls in one context,
an example of credible employment.

34
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.880
Now,
Milton never writes a formal,
uh,
formal autobiography,

35
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.720
uh,

36
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.580
but the Milton's body of poetry and this enormous body of pros,

37
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.860
most of it polemical prose,
um,

38
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.910
this stuff is littered with what are clearly recognizably,

39
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.430
explicitly autobiographical passages.

40
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.660
And the degree do you find the degree to which you find yourself,
uh,

41
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.450
having some sort of affinity with this poet with Milton will probably correspond

42
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:58.650
to the degree to which you find yourself enjoying or having some kind of,

43
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.010
for Milton's propensity of,
of,
of,

44
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.520
for self representation and self accounting.
One of the most,

45
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.300
I think one of the most striking experiences of reading Milton's prose works and

46
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:14.950
they're typically a political,
political tracts in,
in,
in nature,

47
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.960
um,
is the,
is the recognition of this writer's willingness to,

48
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.190
to insert himself to insinuate his own private private meditations,

49
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.280
his self reflections and into the otherwise public and often political concerns

50
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.510
of the,
of the treatise.

51
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.340
And so Milton will continually be saying in his prose tracts,
Oh,

52
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.840
uh,
I,
I just had an idea,
dear reader,
before I go on a perhaps,

53
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.490
perhaps I should say something about myself and I need to explain something to

54
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:50.080
you about where I'm,
where I'm coming from.
You wonder who I am to tell you this.

55
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:50.241
Let,

56
00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:55.060
let me give you an account of myself and let me establish the reasons why you

57
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:58.690
need to go on listening to me and why you should believe my position on this or

58
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.180
that political or ecclesiastical topic.

59
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.690
It's this drive to constant self definition that becomes the characteristic

60
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.040
feature of,
of Milton's work for later generations.
Uh,
the,

61
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.890
the romantic poets like,
like Blake and Wordsworth and Shelley and Keats,
um,
in,

62
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:19.750
in the 19th century are continually looking back to just those moments in
Milton.

63
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.920
Milton's method of self justification and,

64
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.130
and surprising self assertion.

65
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.100
And because it was precisely in Milton's exercises,

66
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:35.920
an autobiographical writing that a crucial element of literary practice gets

67
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:36.754
established.

68
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.050
And that's the element of the poets meditation on the meaning of,

69
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.990
of his vocation as a poet.
Uh,
uh,
a mill Milton is,

70
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.700
is magnificently,

71
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.580
magnificently free of the pressures of,
of modesty and,

72
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.020
and reticence and that freedom.

73
00:04:56.021 --> 00:05:00.250
The liberation from the though that burden,
um,
also becomes a,

74
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:03.250
an enormous part of,
of his appeal,
uh,

75
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.240
for later generations of writing writers.
Um,

76
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.903
this,

77
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.550
it's just a fact that Milton is shockingly unembarrassed about making public all

78
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.670
of his highest literary ambitions.

79
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.820
There's every indication that Milton believed at an,

80
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.330
as I mentioned before at an unconscionably early age that poetry was his

81
00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:33.220
vocation.
And he's continually willing to make that,
uh,

82
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:37.090
that belief a public one.
And by vocation,

83
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:40.330
I'm not merely thinking of of a job,

84
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.790
although certainly the modern sense of vocation as a form of employment is

85
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.000
certainly one that's available to Milton and certainly president his in his

86
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:50.290
thinking about the vocation.

87
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.620
But I also mean vocation in its earlier a more etymologically pure sense,

88
00:05:55.901 --> 00:06:00.500
the literal sense of the word vocation as a calling from the Latin vote,

89
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.670
Cari,
uh,
one's vocation is that to which one has been called,

90
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.360
called presumably by God to perform.

91
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.780
So you have to rather competing a senses of the word vocation here.

92
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:18.410
Vocation has employment and vocation as a calling and they're constantly for

93
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.670
Milton bleeding into one another.

94
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:24.020
These two sentence senses of the word and often struggling with one another.

95
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:28.850
We're competing with one another.
Milton was always wrestling with,

96
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.850
with the problem of vocation and all of its meanings and the problem of what a

97
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.770
calling actually is and how one actually knows one has a calling.

98
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.020
It is a problem that pulsates somewhere beneath,
uh,

99
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.590
most of the lines of poetry that Milton,
that Milton rights,
uh,
the,

100
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.630
the most stunning of all of the anticipatory career narratives that,

101
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:52.010
that,
that I had mentioned in the last class.

102
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.540
I'm appears in the passage of the reason of church government that,
that you,
uh,

103
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.810
that you read for today.
So I'm going to ask you to turn to your hues,

104
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:04.811
additions and look at the top of the top of the left hand column of page 668.

105
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.450
So page six 68.

106
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:13.190
This is where Milton describes the outpouring of enthusiasm that he received for

107
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:17.390
his poetry from a number of learning at Italians during his recent travels

108
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.460
travels to Italy.
So this is the top of the left hand column on six 68,

109
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.900
uh,
Milton.

110
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.900
I began thus far to assent both to them and diverse and diverse of my friends

111
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:32.780
here at home and not less to an inward prompting,

112
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:37.430
which now grew daily upon me.
And think about,
think about this inward prompting.

113
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.660
Is it the self's own prompting or is this a prompting?
A,

114
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:44.990
is this a prompting experienced internally,
it prompting of God,

115
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.310
of vocation and inward prompting,
which now go daily upon me.

116
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.020
That by labor and intense study,
which I take to be my portion in this life,

117
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.810
joined with a strong propensity of nature.

118
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:02.230
I agreed with all of these voices that I might perhaps leave something so

119
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:06.830
written to after times as they should not willingly let it die.

120
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.140
Now,
it's clear here that Milton is imagining this,
this future work,

121
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:15.300
the work that after times will not willingly let die as the fulfillment

122
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.640
fulfillment of a professional career.
We certainly don't hear,
have an image of a,

123
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.850
of a poet whose poetry is being written effortlessly or,

124
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.910
or easily as,
as the young Milton seems convinced.
Uh,
the,
the,

125
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:33.260
the Shakespeare a Shakespeare's poetry had been written,
um,
in,
uh,

126
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:37.830
in the allegro and in Oh Pencil Rosso,
which you'll be reading soon.
Um,
or,

127
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.260
and especially on the leg row,

128
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:44.261
Milton is able to say that that Shakespeare simply warbled his wood notes wild.

129
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.300
He was able to produce all those magnificent place simply by instinct.
Um,

130
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:54.050
a kind of natural,
a natural urge produced,
a generated,
uh,

131
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:58.020
all of that poetry.
But Milton portrays himself as a laborer here,

132
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:02.670
a poet who by labor and intense study actually has to work,

133
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:07.230
uh,
to produce the great poem,
Milton's divine vocation.
His calling,
uh,

134
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.710
seems in this light to be something like a vocation in the modern sense.

135
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.000
It's a job,
that exact work or labor.

136
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.420
Now look at,
look at page six,
71.
Uh,

137
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.730
again on the top of the left hand column here,

138
00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:26.040
Milton is elaborating on the details of his,

139
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.510
of his anticipation of his undying fame.
And it's extraordinary.
This is a,

140
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.650
this is a polemical tracked about a new way in which the church,

141
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.840
the Anglican Church government should be organized.
And what in the hell are are,

142
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.830
is,
is all of this doing here,
um,

143
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.860
Milton's reporting to the English people,
um,

144
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.270
how he imagines,
um,
the,
his future literary fame.
It's a,

145
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:54.510
it's extraordinarily,
um,
and wonderfully inappropriate.

146
00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.900
Milton Milton's not making just any idol suggestion that he will write a poem

147
00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.060
that future generations will find themselves in capable of forgetting a,

148
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.410
this is the left hand column on six 71.

149
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.740
Neither do I think it's shame to covenant with any knowing reader that for some

150
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.950
few years yet I may go on trust with him toward the payment of that,

151
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.980
of what I am now indebted as being a work not to be raised from the heat of

152
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:27.201
youth or the vapors of wine like that which flows at waste from the pen of some

153
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:33.951
vulgar amorist or the trencher fury of a rhyming parasite out of nowhere.

154
00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:38.760
You get this sense of anger on Milton's part in this kind of contempt that he

155
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:41.270
feels and he will feel for the rest of his life.
Of the,

156
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.550
his contempt of is a poetic competitors is contemporary,
uh,

157
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.340
his contemporary poets,
all of whom are vulgarians in this characterization,

158
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.470
uh,
nor to be obtained by the invocation of Dame memory and her siren daughters.

159
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.850
Uh,
these are all forms of poetic inspiration that Milton is declaring.

160
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:02.790
He is rejecting here.
Uh,
Milton's work.

161
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.820
The great work will emerge instead from devout prayer to that eternal spirit who

162
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:13.161
can enrich with all utterance and knowledge and sends out his Sarah Finn with

163
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:18.531
the hallowed fire of his altar to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases.

164
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.110
This is a,
it's an amazing passage you have at the end of this sentence,

165
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.030
that same,
and you'll remember this,

166
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:30.750
that same image of prophetic preparation with which Milton had begun the

167
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:31.590
naitivity out,

168
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.930
that you remember that line from out his secret alter touched with hallowed
fire.

169
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.050
Like the old Hebrew Prophet Isaiah.
Milton will be inspired to,

170
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.260
to write his great work when the iniquity of his lips is purged.

171
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.250
W when they get Turnell spirit touches with hallowed fire,

172
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.650
the lips of whom he pleases.

173
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.980
And so Milton is going to be a great poet because it has pleased God to have

174
00:11:56.981 --> 00:12:01.981
chosen him because God has called Milton deserve as a human conduit for,

175
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.360
for the conveyance of divine knowledge.

176
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.180
And so according to this concluding image here of this sentence,

177
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.110
Milton Nelson's imagining himself more or less than the traditional image of the

178
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:16.111
great biblical profits that the passive vehicle through which the deity

179
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:21.190
transmits his on inspiring message,
but the but,

180
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.170
but this pot pious subservience that you,

181
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.770
that you have a ending this passage.
Um,
and certainly it's consonant with that,

182
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.680
with that image from the naitivity owed.
Um,
nonetheless,

183
00:12:32.681 --> 00:12:36.400
I think it's safe to say that it comes as quite a shock when you consider the

184
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:40.150
sentence as a whole.
Mount Milton had begun the sentence not with calm,

185
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:43.650
prophetic certainty about his divine vocation.
Um,

186
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.600
he began it with the far more secular set of images,

187
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.150
a set of images that comes from the world of business.

188
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.590
And it's a set of images that couldn't be more foreign,

189
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.810
are more alien to the prophetic mode of the,
of the Old Testament prophets.

190
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.550
Milton begins by saying that he was going to write a great work because he's

191
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:06.600
indebted because he owes the English pump,

192
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.290
the English people something after all of their patient waiting.

193
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.450
Uh,

194
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.030
nor nor do I think it's shame to covenant with any knowing reader that for some

195
00:13:16.031 --> 00:13:16.631
few years,

196
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:21.550
yet I may go on trust with him toward the payment of what I am now indebted.

197
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.040
And according to this,

198
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.720
this image of the vocation of the poet Milton isn't claiming divine inspiration

199
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:32.950
at all.
Uh,
he,
he's,
he's making a deal.

200
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.470
I mean,
Walton makes a covenant with the reader.

201
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:40.190
It's as if he's signing a contract because he's asking for credit here.
Uh,

202
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.440
please let me borrow it.
You know,
what,
what on earth would his,

203
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:47.860
with the readers of this a polemical tracked care,
uh,

204
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.960
about Milton's literary future?
Um,
he's not,
he's,

205
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:55.630
he's no one to them except a prelim political polemicists.
But nonetheless,

206
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:58.090
this is Milton's,
uh,
a remarkable logic.

207
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.890
Please give me a little more time patient readers as,
as I,

208
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.040
as I prepare to write the great English epic and like any shrewd borrower,

209
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.690
Milton promises that the credit extended will prove an excellent investment.

210
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.430
Milton believe something so written to after times as they should not willingly

211
00:14:18.431 --> 00:14:22.720
let it die.
So think about this sentence with it's combination of,

212
00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.920
of commercial,
commercial rhetoric and prophetic language,
uh,

213
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.110
making explicit the competing models really for the production of the great of

214
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:32.944
the great poem.

215
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.730
So the first model is that the poem will be the result of the poets Labor,

216
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.710
his hard work,
the expensive,
which will be assumed by the readers credit.

217
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.180
Um,
that's the,
that's the secular,
the economic image.

218
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.570
And the second model is that the poem will be the consequence of,

219
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.200
of the poets humble,
humble prayers to the eternal spirit.
His spirit who doesn't,

220
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.770
who doesn't inspire the poet,
who works the hardest,

221
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.080
but simply the poet whom it pleases the spirit to inspire.

222
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.190
And so in the sentence that we've just looked at at some length,
now we've,

223
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:09.050
we have embodied in the,

224
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:13.280
in the form of a shifting argument I really slippery argument,
uh,

225
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.680
to the two senses of the word vocation,

226
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.950
vocation as a job and vocation as a divine calling.

227
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.200
And I go so far to say that most of the really truly memorable moments in

228
00:15:24.201 --> 00:15:28.490
Milton's poetry and prose Ben generated by some version of just this conflict,

229
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.150
Milton's poetry is,
um,
is,

230
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:36.170
is always emerging from the gap between the competing meanings of a particularly

231
00:15:38.421 --> 00:15:42.760
important and weighty concept like that,
a vocation.
Now,

232
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.010
some stuff to some extent we shouldn't find ourselves surprised that we,
uh,

233
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:49.760
that we see at the heart of Milton statement and anticipating his future

234
00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:52.850
greatness.
A something of a contradiction,

235
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.070
a concerning the idea of a vocation.

236
00:15:55.071 --> 00:15:58.820
It's just this uncertain status of the whole,

237
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.740
a whole raft of ideas associated with vocation that really fissured and

238
00:16:03.741 --> 00:16:08.741
fractured the spiritual lives of countless 17th century puritans.

239
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.730
Milton is inheriting here,
uh,

240
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.850
and enormously rich tradition of thought on this subject.
Uh,

241
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.970
according to the 16th century Protestant theologian,

242
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.800
John Calvin Butts with Swiss theologian,
or actually French.
Uh,

243
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:28.040
but he lives in Geneva.
Uh,
God chooses us.

244
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.810
God elects us for salvation and damnation.

245
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:37.100
We ourselves of course,
have no choice whatsoever in the matter.
And,
and,
and this,

246
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:42.320
this belief that's called Calvinist predestination is really at the heart of

247
00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:46.000
mainstream English.
Puritanism at this point.
Um,

248
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.560
our salvation is entirely in God's hands,

249
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:54.920
but it seemed to a lot of followers of Calvin that it was a matter.

250
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.580
And you can imagine why it was a matter of some urgency in a matter of some

251
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:03.581
importance to know whether one had actually been elected by God for salvation.

252
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.500
We need some proof of our salvation and simply to get up in the morning.

253
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:11.030
Actually,
when you think about it,

254
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.070
and the only proof seem to lay for so many of Milton's contemporary seem delay,

255
00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:16.550
uh,

256
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.550
in the degree of visible success that they seem to have enjoyed.

257
00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.010
And so then,
uh,
much as now,

258
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.910
one of the most obvious signs of success was of course financial,

259
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.360
the meat material success.
The means by which we could discern whether Joe,
uh,

260
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.460
whether God had called on us to join the elect was by determining by discerning

261
00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:45.680
the profitability of our vocation,
the vocation in the secular sense of the,

262
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.890
of employment.
And so you can probably see something like the strange,

263
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:55.340
the strangely perverse logic that could begin to attach itself to the puritan

264
00:17:57.481 --> 00:18:02.130
belief in God's predestination of all human beings,

265
00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:07.010
either to salvation or damnation.
Um,
I don't think this is it.
I,

266
00:18:07.011 --> 00:18:10.860
I feel confident that this is not at all what uh,
Calvin had intended,

267
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.600
but it's what happened nonetheless to prove to others and maybe more important

268
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:20.500
to prove to oneself that one has already been predestined by God to,
uh,

269
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.950
for salvation.
One has to be successful.

270
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.910
And the only way to assure one success is to labor of course,

271
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.990
to work hard to achieve through effort that success,
which one,
uh,

272
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.930
secretly feared should already have been achieved by means of predestination.

273
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:41.670
Um,
obviously there's an irrational inversion of,
of cause and effect here.

274
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:46.470
And it's a magnificent paradox.
God chooses us based on no work of our own,

275
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.020
uh,
but we find ourselves working as pie,

276
00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:53.250
as hard as we possibly can in order to demonstrate to ourselves that we have in

277
00:18:53.251 --> 00:18:57.180
fact already been chosen
according to the,

278
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.850
according to the German,
the Mag,

279
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.020
the absolutely brilliant German sociologist,
Max Faber,

280
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.350
the founder of the discipline of sociology,
who,
who,
uh,

281
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:12.470
who pioneers the,
the study of the sociological impact of,

282
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.790
of Protestant theology at the beginning of the 20th century.
Um,

283
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.930
it is precisely this backwards and cruel logic that's responsible for what he,

284
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.250
and it's a,
it's a,
it's an enormous claim,
um,
essentially,
uh,

285
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.340
insupportable but it's this backwards crazily inverted logic that's responsible

286
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:36.070
for the economic progress of the northern Europeans.
It's responsible for what,

287
00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.840
uh,
vapor calls the emergence of the Protestant work ethic.

288
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.200
So historians and can and in fact have,
uh,

289
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.860
many times take an issue with a lot of Weber's historical claims,

290
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.850
but his,
uh,
he's invaluable,
I think for our purposes.

291
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.890
And then the understanding of Milton.

292
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.550
And for a lot of the cultural business of the 17th century in general,

293
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.520
the assumption among a lot of reformation,

294
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:07.521
Protestants and Milton's Day was that what God commands above all else is our

295
00:20:08.341 --> 00:20:10.350
labor,
our investment,

296
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.640
and God expects after our labor and investment that we have something to show

297
00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:19.360
for it.
At the end.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it makes sense that we have in some way profit.

298
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:21.060
And so it's,

299
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:26.060
it's here at this intensely awkward point at which Protestantism and capitalism

300
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.540
to seemingly utterly disparate spheres of activity and thought and being the

301
00:20:36.341 --> 00:20:38.970
strange point at which these two things converge.

302
00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.860
And it's at this intense intersection that we find,

303
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.450
we find John Milton,

304
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.230
do you understand the concerns of,
of Milton's poetry?
It,
it,
it,

305
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.180
it is important and I'm convinced it's important to understand this,

306
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:58.660
this massive conjunction of economic and spiritual thought that's really at the

307
00:20:58.661 --> 00:21:03.520
heart of the,
of,
of English Protestantism.
But that's just a part of the story.

308
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:08.240
There's also a more specific,
a more local reason for which our,

309
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.410
uh,
our John Milton was susceptible to the,

310
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.580
to this profit and loss rhetoric of,

311
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.280
of Calvinist puritan theology.

312
00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.260
Milton Milton was the son of a banker or what?

313
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.650
Actually banks didn't exist at this point in the 17th century.

314
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:31.570
It's not until the Dutch invent banks,
uh,
late in the late,
in the 17th century.

315
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.950
Um,
but Milton was the son of what is the equivalent of a modern day banker.

316
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:41.010
He's what would have been called in the 17th century,
a scrivener or a goldsmith.

317
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.760
A Goldsmith was an early money lender and it was a perfectly respectable

318
00:21:45.761 --> 00:21:50.240
profession as far as,
uh,
as Borzois a profession,
Sko and John Milton's senior,
uh,

319
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.950
has a,
has a pretty good living.
Um,

320
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.470
but it's in practice it's actually much more analogous I would think too,

321
00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:59.200
what a modern day pawnbroker does.

322
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.180
So you would leave with John Milton Sr the goldsmith,

323
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.070
a portion of gold.
And on the basis of that collateral,

324
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.390
this is all a bit the business of collateral loans.
Pawnbroking you would,

325
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.250
on the basis of that collateral,

326
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:19.150
John Milton senior would lend you a sum of money for which you would pay him

327
00:22:19.151 --> 00:22:21.430
interest and at the end of the loan,

328
00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:24.910
upon your payment of the principal and have sufficient additional interest.

329
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.760
John Milton senior,
the Goldsmith,
um,

330
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:32.260
would return to you the goal that you had entrusted to him.
Now,

331
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:37.261
Mr Milton took some risks when he separated himself from his cash and lent money

332
00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:41.980
to his clients,
let more money to his clients then the collateral,

333
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:45.640
the gold was actually worth and the motive for that risk of course,

334
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:49.120
that the motive for that investment was the expectation of a profit.

335
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.150
It's just this economic pattern of,

336
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.330
of risky investment and the expectation of a prophet that forms something like

337
00:22:57.761 --> 00:23:00.340
that.
The Matic Paradigm,
uh,

338
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:04.070
the thematic paradigm of,

339
00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:09.120
of profit and loss that really is at the heart of Milton's a representation of

340
00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:13.660
his future literary greatness.
His,
his conception of himself as a poet,

341
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:19.120
Milton seems to have inherited from his father of language of commerce.

342
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.990
Uh,
a language that he was able to so easily and effortlessly to transpose,

343
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:28.060
transpose from his father's vocation as a goldsmith to his own anticipated

344
00:23:28.061 --> 00:23:29.170
vocation.
As a poet,

345
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:36.300
Milton owes his father this whole lexical world of,

346
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.270
of,
of lending,
of borrowing and of profit.

347
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.100
But Milton owes his father more than that,
more than merely a set of metaphors,

348
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.770
images,
uh,
drawn from the world of his father's money lending.

349
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:53.210
And to understand exactly what it is,
the John Milton junior own stone,

350
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:54.044
Milton senior.

351
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:59.290
We have to look at the Latin poem that Milton writes to his father in 1637.

352
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:06.500
So let's look at that now.
Uh,
this is page 82 in the Hughes edition

353
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.670
and the poem is too my father odd pot trim.

354
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.800
And Milton expresses his debt of gratitude for his father's support.
Uh,

355
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:20.480
Milton graduated with,
with,
with an MBA from Cambridge University in July of 16,

356
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:24.760
1632.
He had studied hard obviously,
um,

357
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:29.450
and he had supposedly been preparing himself for his future career and that

358
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:31.910
would have been the career of a clergyman.

359
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.080
Milton's younger brother Christopher was,
was already,
uh,

360
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.980
entering law school at this time.
And it was clear,
it was clear,
I guess,

361
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.450
to everybody that Milton,
John,

362
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:44.030
Milton and junior was not suited to a profession in the law,

363
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.320
although I'm actually not sure why that's the case.
Court records show that,
uh,

364
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.530
our poet was exceedingly a litigious.

365
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:55.610
He brought suit against dozens and dozens of people throughout his entire life

366
00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:01.120
attempting to redress a wide range of grievances through an appeal to the use of

367
00:25:01.461 --> 00:25:02.294
the legal system.

368
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.390
But the vocation to which Milton seem to have been most suited was a life to

369
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:12.350
everyone around him was a life in the ministry.
His reading,
his learning,

370
00:25:12.351 --> 00:25:13.700
his talents as an order.

371
00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:17.420
All of these assets pointed to one potential career.

372
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.900
And in fact,
nearly everyone in the Mba class too,

373
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.650
in which Milton graduated turned to a career in the church.

374
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.540
This is what a master's degree could do for you.
Um,
in the early 17th century.

375
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:33.140
It was good for very little else.
Now we know,

376
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.950
or at least we have a retrospective inkling from our reading of poems like the

377
00:25:36.951 --> 00:25:41.951
naitivity owed and other early poems that Milton on some level was imagining his

378
00:25:42.231 --> 00:25:47.000
vocation to be that of a poet.
But then just as now,

379
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:51.560
uh,
one could obviously not be a poet by,
by profession.

380
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:55.970
You can't make a living writing poetry.
Uh,
no one's,

381
00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.340
no one's ever made a living writing poetry who hasn't been patronized or given a

382
00:26:01.341 --> 00:26:04.400
lot of money by someone who was much richer,
um,
than he or she is.

383
00:26:04.401 --> 00:26:08.150
I'm maybe rob Macewan in the 60s,
made money writing poetry.

384
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.250
This neat main name would and should mean nothing to you.
But,
uh,
this,

385
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.610
this man sold a lot of,
uh,
millions of books have really bad poems.
Um,

386
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.560
with that exception,
I think very few people have actually,
um,

387
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.890
certainly in Milton's Day profited,
uh,

388
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.250
from the selling of their poems.

389
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.920
And Hilton's father would obviously a found unsuitable.

390
00:26:30.921 --> 00:26:35.870
The idea that seven years of uni of expensive university education that he had

391
00:26:35.871 --> 00:26:39.710
invested in his son would result in nothing more than a career in,

392
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.720
in what?
In poetry.

393
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.800
And so you can maybe some of you all too easily can imagine the arguments that

394
00:26:48.811 --> 00:26:51.780
might've taken place within the,
within the Milton household.

395
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.780
Why don't you become a lawyer like your brother Christopher?

396
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:59.280
Why can't you get a job like,
like everybody else?
So you can just,

397
00:26:59.281 --> 00:27:03.330
I'm going to ask you to imagine the domestic situation in the Milton household

398
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.640
and 1632,
uh,

399
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:09.510
Milton has just returned home after seven years at the university,

400
00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:14.100
a university education so generously financed by his father,

401
00:27:14.101 --> 00:27:15.930
who is actually now 70 years old.

402
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:21.710
And he was just turning a Milton and junior was just turning 24 and the 24 is

403
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:25.950
the canonical age at which young men were received for admission into the

404
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:30.660
priesthood.
It's like joining the army at 18 at 24.
That's what you do.

405
00:27:30.661 --> 00:27:32.760
You,
if you have an MBA from Cambridge,

406
00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.910
you enter the Anglican priesthood and a 24 year old Milton after seven years of

407
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:43.980
education simply decides not to go.
Instead of joining the ministry,

408
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:48.981
Milton instead returns home and he stays at home.

409
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.970
He stays at home without any means of supporting himself for six years.

410
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.000
So with the financial support of his father,

411
00:27:57.001 --> 00:28:00.660
Milton stays at home and reads he,

412
00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.370
he studies and it's in these years after his graduation from college that Milton

413
00:28:05.371 --> 00:28:10.371
embarks on upon what is essentially a systematic study of all available

414
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:11.730
knowledge.

415
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.840
He commands a mastery of just about the entire Canon of western literary and

416
00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:16.920
historical learning.

417
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:21.510
He prepares himself for what his father is still imagining will be the

418
00:28:21.511 --> 00:28:25.110
priesthood.
Um,
uh,
but uh,
but,

419
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.700
but for what Milton is probably imagining will be his future career as a great

420
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:31.350
English poet and it,

421
00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.320
and it's little wonder that one of the subjects of his meditations during this

422
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:37.650
period is the problem of vocation.
The,

423
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:42.790
the twin problem of what it is one is actually doing on the one hand and what it

424
00:28:43.861 --> 00:28:48.861
is on the other hand that the father has called one to do it in Milton's poem to

425
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:54.810
his father and his earthly father.
And there becomes a confusion,

426
00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:57.960
uh,
throughout Milton,
um,

427
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.600
with respect to which of Milton's fathers,

428
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:04.410
the heavenly or the earthly is calling him to do what [inaudible] and Milton's

429
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.161
poem to his father.

430
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:10.161
You have the poets attempt to justify himself before the man who seems to be

431
00:29:10.351 --> 00:29:13.020
asking him to define his vocation.

432
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.400
So we have to assume that the occasion for this poem is the Co is some kind of

433
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:21.090
question posed by John Milton senior.
A question like,

434
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:26.430
to what end am I supporting you a son?
And if it's a poet that you want to be,

435
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:31.260
to what extent can the writing of poetry be considered respectable work?

436
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:37.430
Um,
Milton,
look at page.
This page is 82 and 83 in the Hughes.

437
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.340
Milton's expressing a dutiful degree of,
of filial piety,
gratitude.
And this will,

438
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.240
this,
this,
this may seem familiar to I can never repay you.

439
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:51.670
He writes,
you have an account of my means and whatever.

440
00:29:51.671 --> 00:29:54.370
And now we're on page 83 and whatever wealth I possess,

441
00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:59.371
I have reckoned up on this paper for I have nothing except what golden Clio has

442
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:00.934
given.

443
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.930
And what has been the fruit of the dreams in a remote cavern and of the Laurel

444
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:08.620
groves of the sacred would end of the shadows of Parnassus.

445
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.080
I have nothing to show for,
for,
for all of your investment,
but my learning,

446
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.870
all of that,
which Golden Cleo has promised me,

447
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:24.490
Cleo,
the Muse of history.
I have also my aspiration,
my aspirations,

448
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:29.200
my dreams of becoming a great poet because I dwell among these highly literary

449
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.950
that the sacred wood in the shady groves on Parnassus.

450
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.430
Now,
Milton explains that he has nothing now of course,

451
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:40.030
to show for his father's investment.
Uh,

452
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:44.280
but he will look at the,
look at the last stanza.
This is a,

453
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.360
at the top of page 86 in the Hughes and Milton turns to address his own poetry.

454
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:57.610
This is how he concludes that this poem,
I'd pop trim and you my juvenile versus,

455
00:30:57.611 --> 00:30:58.600
and amusements,

456
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.380
if you only dare hope for emerge immortality and a life and a glimpse of the

457
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:09.250
light beyond,
uh,
beyond your master's funeral pyre.

458
00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.840
And if Darko Bolivian does not sweep you down to the throngs of Haiti's,

459
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:16.870
perhaps you will preserve this eulogy.

460
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:22.170
And the name of the father who my song honors as an example to remote ages at

461
00:31:23.831 --> 00:31:28.210
Melton's,
essentially making a covenant.
This is a contract with his father.

462
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.980
But in this passage,

463
00:31:29.981 --> 00:31:34.330
he's engaging his father into a contractual situation just as he will,
um,

464
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:38.320
engage the entire English people as we've already seen in the reason of church

465
00:31:38.321 --> 00:31:41.290
government,
if his father continues to support him.

466
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:45.190
This is the magnificent logic here.
If the father continues to support him,

467
00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:49.360
he will repay his father with his own future fame,

468
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:53.500
a name that his fellow Englishman will not willingly let die.
Now,

469
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:58.530
Milton's fame will preserve his father's name and of course it has a throughout

470
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:02.170
the agents,
uh,
needless to say,

471
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:07.171
the satisfaction of John Milton Sr and we'll have to be postponed to the great

472
00:32:07.541 --> 00:32:08.050
hereafter.

473
00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:13.050
He will not be able to reap the profit of his investment in his son study until

474
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:17.110
not only after his own death,
but of course after his son's death as well.

475
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:20.950
That's Milton's Milton's logic here.
But then who would understand,

476
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.480
who would understand better than John Milton's Sr the importance or the value of

477
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:29.320
a longterm investment strategy?
There's a,

478
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.340
there's a tone of,
of,
of,

479
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:36.100
of self assuredness and have confidence and certainty in this poem that I have

480
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:37.540
to say isn't always matched.

481
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.720
And the other works that writing in this same period in most of the other

482
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:43.910
writings that you've looked at for today,
though,

483
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:47.590
the weird Calvinists logic surrounding the,

484
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:52.460
the idea of divine predestination makes it impossible for Milton to be that

485
00:32:52.461 --> 00:32:55.880
comfortable or are that confident about the idea of a,

486
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.770
of a true poetic vocation.

487
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:03.460
How can melt and know that he was really and truly called by God to be a great

488
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:06.830
poet until he writes something.
It's not,
it's not a bad question.

489
00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.760
And until he has something actually to show for his talent.

490
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.970
And how can Milton have anything to show for his talent until he's,

491
00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:14.840
this is the logic.

492
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:19.370
Until he has patiently waited for God to inspire him to write.

493
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.750
He can't know until he's been inspired to write.

494
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.250
And he can of course start writing until he's been inspired.
And it's a,
it's a,

495
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:32.000
it's a peculiar but familiar double bind.
Um,
it,

496
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:36.470
it's a puzzle that pre approved infinitely anxiety producing for the young

497
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:37.304
Milton and it's,

498
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.630
it's really their productive engine that keeps this extremely anxious poet going

499
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.660
in the early years.
It's,
it's just this double bind,

500
00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:49.220
a vocation that that's the subject of the sonnets.
Seven,
how soon?
Half the time.

501
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.210
That's the soldered in which Milton laments the fact that he has turned 23 years

502
00:33:53.211 --> 00:33:58.211
old and has yet produced nothing that would indicate a shining poetic future.

503
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.860
And so,
and in that poem,
and as in the other things that you read for today,

504
00:34:03.861 --> 00:34:05.090
Milton is attempting to,

505
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.030
to understand the problem of vocation through this specific lens of,

506
00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.630
of scripture.
Uh,

507
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:18.590
and that's what we're going to look at now.
Nearly every conceptual problem,
uh,

508
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.620
available,
uh,

509
00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:24.650
that was puzzled over in the 17th century could be processed and understood in

510
00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:28.160
some way.
In terms of a related problem in the Bible.
Um,

511
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:32.540
every conflict and contradiction within an individual or within the society at

512
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:36.140
large could be interpreted by means of a related conflict or related

513
00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:39.760
contradiction.
Cold somewhere,
uh,
from the writings of scripture.
And,

514
00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.630
and if you're puritans like Milton,

515
00:34:41.631 --> 00:34:46.631
there were some especially important moments in scripture that could be used to

516
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:50.270
tackle the problem of vocation.
Uh,

517
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.480
there were particular moments in the Bible that seem best suited to answer this

518
00:34:53.481 --> 00:34:54.940
question.
The question,
what did,

519
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:59.570
what is it that I'm supposed to do and what does it mean actually to do
anything?

520
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.960
But what does it mean to do anything in a world in which God seems to be so

521
00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:07.280
entirely in control of all of our doings and of our actions?

522
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:13.430
Uh,
those passages of the Bible that seemed to have been particularly useful for

523
00:35:13.431 --> 00:35:17.900
this dilemma where two parables,
uh,
from the New Testament and that those were,

524
00:35:17.901 --> 00:35:20.090
uh,
those are represented in the packet,

525
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:24.890
the parable of the talents and the parable of the workers in the vineyard.
And,

526
00:35:24.891 --> 00:35:29.870
and you will soon be seeing innumerable ways in which these parables continue to

527
00:35:29.871 --> 00:35:34.250
creep up,
uh,
in,
in Milton's verse the language.

528
00:35:34.251 --> 00:35:39.251
And we can also think of the of it as the ideology of these parables are

529
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:44.010
constantly surfacing in Milton and they provide something like a divinely

530
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:48.420
authorized focal point for what I had mentioned earlier,

531
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:52.650
this strange intersection of spirituality and economics.
And I had,

532
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.270
I know it's a little difficult to read,

533
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.130
but I included nonetheless than the packet.
Uh,
the Geneva Bible,

534
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.350
that's the great 16th century Puritan Bible,
that version of these,

535
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.530
these two parables,

536
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:09.420
a written before the King James because it provides all of those glosses,

537
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.820
those marginal annotations on the side,

538
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.940
those incredibly mean spirited and dark Calvinist interpretations of,

539
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.910
of,
of the Bible.

540
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.610
I'm convinced that those glosses those annotations.
Uh,
uh,

541
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.791
rove,

542
00:36:27.791 --> 00:36:32.791
Milton absolutely mad and so much of his own rewriting of the Bible essentially

543
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:33.700
in,

544
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.530
in paradise lost is a response to a lot of the annotations of the Bible that he

545
00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:39.364
grew up reading.

546
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.730
So the first parable that when you have to look at is the one that instilled

547
00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:47.800
without question the one that instilled the most anxiety in Milton.

548
00:36:47.801 --> 00:36:50.440
And that's the parable of the talents for Matthew 25.

549
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.390
So this is the parable of the talents.

550
00:36:52.391 --> 00:36:56.910
A master distributes his wealth to his servants,
um,

551
00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:01.030
and the,
and the wealth wealth is distributed in the,
in the form of a coin.

552
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.830
And the name of the coin is translated in English with the word talent.

553
00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.450
And it's precisely the word here.
Uh,

554
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:13.240
for this coin that gives us our modern word,
our modern word,
talent,

555
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:17.950
which means a skill of course,
or a predisposition.
Now,
think about that,

556
00:37:17.951 --> 00:37:22.951
that our word talent has its origin in this parable should give you a sense of

557
00:37:24.581 --> 00:37:28.880
the,
the extraordinary cultural weight that this parable,
um,

558
00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:33.160
has assumed.
Okay.
Um,
to one servant,

559
00:37:33.161 --> 00:37:35.980
the master gave five talents.
You remember this story to one servant.

560
00:37:35.981 --> 00:37:39.100
The master gave five talents to another.
He gave two into a third servant.

561
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:43.180
He gave one talent.
When the master returns from his journey,

562
00:37:43.181 --> 00:37:47.770
he learns that the first two servants had wisely and piously invested their

563
00:37:47.771 --> 00:37:49.960
talents and they had doubled their money.

564
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:55.090
They had profited and the master praises them.
Uh,

565
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.050
but the servant who had been given only one talent hidden the talent in the

566
00:37:59.051 --> 00:37:59.261
earth.

567
00:37:59.261 --> 00:38:04.261
So as perfectly understandably so as not to risk the only talent,

568
00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.830
the hit that he'd been given.

569
00:38:05.831 --> 00:38:10.060
And I think the genius of this parable hinges on the fact that the servant who

570
00:38:10.061 --> 00:38:14.230
was only given one talent seems to be re,
uh,
acting so perfectly reasonable,

571
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.480
reasonably with,
uh,
with a lot of,

572
00:38:16.481 --> 00:38:19.060
a form of caution and hesitation you could actually say.

573
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.130
And so he explains to the master,

574
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:26.360
I knew that Western hard man,
which repurposed where thou,

575
00:38:26.361 --> 00:38:31.180
so it's not an gathering where thou straws not.
I was therefore afraid.

576
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:35.680
And I went,
I went and hid by talent in the earth

577
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.580
because the servant had not been willing to spend the only talent that he had

578
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:43.414
been given.

579
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:48.010
The master instructs him to give his one and only talent to the man who now has

580
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:52.180
10.
And the master concludes with an imperative that is surely one of the most

581
00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:57.181
terrifying utterances in the entire Bible cast there for cast.

582
00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:00.550
Therefore,
that unprofitable servant into utter darkness,

583
00:39:00.551 --> 00:39:03.670
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

584
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.950
Don't know.
Conclusion of this parable seems so,
so violent.

585
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.520
Uh,
perhaps because the lesson to be learned from the parable is,
is,

586
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:16.930
is so uncertain.
Uh,
Milton seems to have been drawn to the parable as a way of,

587
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:21.700
of understanding the expectations placed upon him by his master.

588
00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.420
Actually his two masters or his two fathers.
There's first the,

589
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.680
the earthly father John Milton's senior who had given Milton the talent of an

590
00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:34.240
expensive education and then six years of additional,
uh,

591
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:35.590
heavily subsidized study.

592
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.940
And there's also the heavenly father who had given Melton is rhetorical gifts

593
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:44.000
and expected him to use them in some way,
uh,

594
00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:48.370
for God's benefit presumably to use them in some way beneficial to the church.

595
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:52.630
The most obvious way being naturally the vocation of the ministry and the

596
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:53.560
parable is a,

597
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:58.450
is a horrifying one because it places such an unspeakable pressure on the

598
00:39:58.451 --> 00:40:00.790
interpreter to produce something,

599
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:03.190
to show something for himself at the end of the day.

600
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.840
And for Milton whose temperament up to at this point in client him obviously the

601
00:40:06.841 --> 00:40:11.841
hesitation to postponement and to merely the anticipation of profit.

602
00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:15.840
The pressure applied by this parable of the unprofitable servant,
uh,

603
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.420
may very well have seen utterly unbearable,

604
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.860
but there was another,
there was another parable,

605
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:28.780
another of Jesus's parables that also treated the problem of vocation and like

606
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.400
the parable of the talents.
Um,
it provided what seemed to be a model for,

607
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:35.350
of kind of pattern of action,
um,

608
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:38.440
and or actually the trajectory of a career.

609
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.810
And this is the parable of the workers in the vineyard.

610
00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.080
And here a householder looks for laborers that he will pay a penny a day.

611
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:50.770
The laborers who began it to work at dawn earn a penny.

612
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.670
The Labor is hired in the third hour,
earn a penny,

613
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:58.540
and the laborers who stood idle in the marketplace until the 11th hour,

614
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:03.410
we're asked who are asked to do nothing until the last possible moment.
Um,

615
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:08.110
they also received a penny for their pains.
At the end of the day,

616
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.010
they're paying such as they were.
Now,
when asked by the hardest workers,

617
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.130
why each of the laborers received every man a penny,

618
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.050
the householder replies take that which is nine own and go.

619
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:25.051
They way I will give unto this last as much as to the so in this parable,

620
00:41:25.931 --> 00:41:29.590
which suggests something like,
which is suggested to,
uh,
generations of readers.

621
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.650
Uh,
something like a socialism reform of communism.

622
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:36.290
The amount of labor actually expended is immaterial.

623
00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.610
The late comer to the job is rewarded the same as the worker who was there from

624
00:41:40.611 --> 00:41:44.570
the very beginning and working from the very beginning and as a model for

625
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:47.450
economic activity or as a kind of vocation guide.

626
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:53.170
This parable couldn't be more opposed or to some wouldn't seem more opposed to

627
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:57.050
the parable of the unprofitable servant.

628
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.790
The men who stood around and did nothing until they were called to act or in

629
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:05.360
precisely the same amount as those who have been laboring in the vineyard all

630
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:06.193
day.

631
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.320
They're not punished for their unprofitable expectation or they're not punished

632
00:42:12.141 --> 00:42:14.180
for just waiting around to be called the work.

633
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.360
They're not bidding to be cast out into utter darkness where there's weeping and

634
00:42:17.361 --> 00:42:20.960
gnashing of teeth there.
They're rewarded for their waiting.

635
00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:22.760
This parable may seem,

636
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:27.020
I think to be a little more compatible with Milton's general temperament in the

637
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.381
years of his,

638
00:42:27.381 --> 00:42:32.381
of his studious retirement as a young man consumed with anxiety about,

639
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.660
about his failure yet to do anything,
whether to gain,

640
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:39.320
whether to gain employment as a clergyman or to produce somehow some great work

641
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:43.520
of literature.
Milton's continually seeking assurance that the late comer,

642
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.240
and this is how he's thinking of himself,
that the latecomer will be rewarded,

643
00:42:47.241 --> 00:42:47.930
that the latecomer,

644
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:52.610
we'll be actually able to produce something when he is called to produce

645
00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:56.540
something for Milton.
These,
these two parables,

646
00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:00.590
I'm locked in a powerful,

647
00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:05.080
a powerful dialectical relation to one another.
The parable of the talents,
uh,

648
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:09.160
rewards,
hard work and investment and it,

649
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:11.210
and it's satisfying because it does that,

650
00:43:11.211 --> 00:43:15.140
but it also instills an anxiety of non productivity.

651
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:20.450
Uh,
the parable of the vineyard assures us that,
that God rewards us regardless,

652
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.120
regardless of our herd,
hard work and investment,

653
00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:27.660
but only for cold only if God chooses us,
um,

654
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.050
chooses to call us.
And so the,

655
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:33.380
you can see the strange dialectic developing here.

656
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:38.000
The anxiety aroused by one parable necessitates almost the constellation that's

657
00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:40.210
offered by the other one.
Uh,

658
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:45.140
but the consoling parable sooner rouse its own anxieties,
uh,
which can only be,

659
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.670
which only can be quieted by recourse to the other parable.
Uh,

660
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:54.080
and the result,
needless to say,
as is his mind spinning.
Uh,
and we're,

661
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:56.750
we're all familiar with at least a version of this.
We,

662
00:43:56.751 --> 00:44:01.010
all of us just as human beings,
we,
all of us want to be rewarded.

663
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:05.750
We want to be loved for our hard work,
and we're all working really hard here.

664
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.180
But of course,
we also want to be loved.

665
00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:13.130
We want to be rewarded unconditionally without any contingencies whatsoever.

666
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.530
That,
that on some level,
that's just the human condition.

667
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.650
And Milton uses these to the language of these two parables to get at this,

668
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:26.570
this,
this problem that has resonances in every conceivable sphere.

669
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:31.060
Now,
shortly after Milton composed the Sonnet,
um,
how soon halftime,

670
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.480
the Sonnet number 25,
um,

671
00:44:33.481 --> 00:44:37.830
he wrote a letter to a friend in which he enclosed this poem.
The,
the,
the sonnet.

672
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.550
Now we don't know this is in the packet.
Um,
after the parables,

673
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:45.270
we don't know the intended recipient of this letter and we actually have no,

674
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.210
no idea whether Milton actually sent the letter.

675
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.290
But a couple of drafts of this letter actually exist in Milton's own hand.

676
00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.790
And the letter is clearly a document that Milton had devoted some energy and

677
00:44:56.791 --> 00:45:00.390
some time to,
and we need to look at it.

678
00:45:00.391 --> 00:45:04.380
The unnamed friend sounds quite a bit actually like Milton's disapproving
father.

679
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.640
The friend is obviously chided Milton for not doing anything with his life.

680
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.950
Milton has shown so much promise.

681
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.430
He possessed so many obvious talents that can be poured into the profession for

682
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:17.130
which he was so clearly suited the profession of the ministry.

683
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:21.600
But Milton was remaining at his father's house and what seemed like a perpetual

684
00:45:21.601 --> 00:45:25.680
state of humiliating self infantilization.
Um,

685
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:27.930
he seems to have been nothing doing nothing but reading,

686
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.420
acquiring more knowledge,

687
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:32.880
and really essentially just learning for the sake of learning.

688
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:37.260
And so Milton responds to what he takes to be this objection.

689
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:42.960
He responds in the second paragraph of the letter in the left hand column of the

690
00:45:42.961 --> 00:45:45.750
packet,
um,
to the,
to this criticism that he's done.

691
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:49.050
So Little Milton acknowledges that the course he's chosen for himself may not be

692
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:49.950
a natural one.

693
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:55.440
Nature herself pushes a young man to begin a family and to seek credible

694
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:57.480
employment.
Milton rights,

695
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:02.580
the natural desire for fame seated and then in the breast of every true scholar

696
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:08.150
usually pushes him to make haste by the radius way of publishing and divulging

697
00:46:08.851 --> 00:46:10.050
conceived merits.

698
00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.550
But it's just this making haste toward publication writing something really

699
00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:17.400
great right now that,
that Milton's resisting here,

700
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:21.900
he claims to be studying and learning rather than producing right now.

701
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:22.270
And there's,

702
00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:26.040
and there's a problem with just studying and learning and it's a problem at

703
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.200
Milton can't avoid it.

704
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.910
It's possible that in merely reading and in merely amassing more and more

705
00:46:32.911 --> 00:46:33.271
knowledge,

706
00:46:33.271 --> 00:46:38.040
Milton's doing little more the than the unprofitable servant in Matthew 25.

707
00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:43.041
It's possible that he's hiding his talent or burying his conceived merits deep

708
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:47.760
within the earth.
And it's this frightening possibility that Milton forces,
uh,

709
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:52.780
that that Melton forces himself to engage head on the implications of this,

710
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.720
of this parable.
Look at the,
uh,
in the packet near the,

711
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:03.210
uh,
this letter near the top of the right hand side of the page.

712
00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:07.200
Milton claims that his love of learning might seem to contradict the parable of

713
00:47:07.201 --> 00:47:11.550
the talents the master had commanded his servants of course,

714
00:47:11.551 --> 00:47:14.580
to do something to show a profit in a due and timely fashion.

715
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.570
But Milton wants his friend here to know that there's of course nothing to worry

716
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:23.370
about.
This is how Milton's mind is,
is,
is working overtime here.
This is,

717
00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:26.670
and this is the argument,
Milton's pursuing his learning.

718
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:31.840
He's postponing his publication because it's his job really to consider the

719
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:35.950
masters.
Great commandment all the more closely that the point of the parable,

720
00:47:35.951 --> 00:47:40.780
Milton explains this is an unbelievable misreading of the,
of the biblical text.

721
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:44.650
The point of the parable is not that the servant should have invested is one

722
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:48.400
talent just anywhere the servants problem was that he didn't take enough time.

723
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:53.830
He didn't carefully consider the command because it careful consideration of the

724
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:55.600
masters command,
and I'm quoting here,

725
00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:59.680
does not press forward as soon as maybe to undergo,

726
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.580
but keeps off with the sacred reverence and religious advisement.

727
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:08.581
How best to undergo not taking thought of being late so as to give advantage to

728
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:12.970
be more fit.
Unbelievable.

729
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.430
You look at a passage like that and complete astonishment.

730
00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:20.320
Milton has invoked of course,
to his own detriment.
What was he thinking?

731
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:24.340
That the parable of the unprofitable servant,
the parable of the talents,

732
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.060
but he invokes it to show that if one really reads it carefully enough,

733
00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.420
one can see that the lesson to be drawn has nothing whatsoever to do with the

734
00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:33.340
due and timely investment of one's talent.

735
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:38.020
What this parable really teaches us is that we do best to wait.

736
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:42.700
We do best to consider the command to consider all of the possible investment

737
00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:45.280
strategies.
Maybe we want to go into the ministry.

738
00:48:45.281 --> 00:48:48.700
Maybe we want to go into poetry.
Perhaps we want to write like Shakespeare.

739
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.010
Maybe we want to be a writer like the great.
Um,

740
00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:52.810
I'm an Old Testament Prophet Isiah,

741
00:48:52.811 --> 00:48:57.070
but the last thing we should be burdened with Milton suggesting here is the fear

742
00:48:57.071 --> 00:48:59.500
of being late.
Now,

743
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:03.670
I don't have to tell you that Milton has done a powerful violence to this

744
00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:07.450
parable in Matthew.
No,
now God only knows what this parable actually means.

745
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:10.990
I mean,
it's truly,
it's perfectly inscrutable as far as I'm concerned.

746
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.990
But I think I can say with absolute certainty,

747
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:19.650
certainty that one of its possible significances cannot be that the unprofitable

748
00:49:20.051 --> 00:49:24.550
servant should have waited to make his investment.
And now I think of it,

749
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:25.810
if Milton had been the servant,

750
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.930
he wouldn't even have made it to the stage of bearing the stupid coin in the

751
00:49:28.931 --> 00:49:32.860
earth.
You would be consumed with the consideration of whether to bury it here or

752
00:49:32.861 --> 00:49:35.440
whether it or bury it there,
or should he buried two feet under?

753
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.090
Or maybe he should vary at six feet under.
Now we haven't.

754
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:44.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

755
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.370
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
I'm going to a,</v>

756
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.930
<v 1>okay,</v>

757
00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:51.060
<v 0>I'm going to stop there.
Um,</v>

758
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:54.420
there's a lot more to say about the parable of the talents and the parable of

759
00:49:54.421 --> 00:49:58.230
the laborers or laborers in the vineyard.
Um,
but we have a,

760
00:49:58.231 --> 00:49:59.310
we have run out of time.
