1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.970
In the porn that we looked at last time.
Uh,

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.170
that was the poem Ad Pod Trim that Milton had addressed to his father.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.180
Milton was attempting to,
as you remember,

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:12.810
to justify to his father his own interest in becoming a poet.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.700
And so I'm going to ask you to turn back to ad trim.
Uh,

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.750
this is page 83 of the hues edition.

7
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:23.490
This is where Milton is accounting for himself and his choice of a poetic
career.

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.880
Now look at that.
This is page 83 and the second verse,

9
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.160
Paragraph Milton tells his father,

10
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
do not despise divine poetry.
The poets creation.

11
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.340
No,
actually it's in the Hughes.
It's do not despise divine poetry,

12
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.380
creation of the prophetic barred,

13
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.550
nothing better shows our heavenly origins are divine seed,

14
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.200
our human intellect,

15
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.540
those holy traces of Promethian fire and look a little further down in the same,

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.440
uh,
same paragraph.
Builtin continues his defensive,

17
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.180
what he calls the poet's task.

18
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.020
Poets are not only do the highest respect imaginable here on earth,

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.790
Milton's explaining to his dad a poets are rewarded as well in heaven.

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.670
And so Milton rights,
uh,
MS,

21
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:16.671
page 83 and when we returned to our native Olympus and in a classical piece in a

22
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:19.250
Latin poem like this by the nae aren't native Olympics,

23
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:21.420
he always obviously means the Christian heaven.

24
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.560
And when we returned to our native Olympics and the everlasting ages of

25
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:30.180
immutable Aternity are established,
we and he means we poets,

26
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.880
we will walk crowned with gold through the temples of the sky.

27
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.850
And with the SA Harps soft accompaniment,

28
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.440
we shall sing sweet songs to which the stars shall echo in the vault of heaven

29
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.630
from pole to pole.
Unbelievable.

30
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:49.160
Now,

31
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.000
Milton's being serious here and we were given every rhetorical queue possible

32
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.410
that Milton is being serious.

33
00:01:55.411 --> 00:02:00.411
Then he's just conjured one of the most extraordinary rewards conceivable for a

34
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:02.400
poet.
Forget,

35
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.500
forget the poultry crown of Laurel place to top the heads of great writers in

36
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.060
the classical tradition.
What good is that going to do?

37
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.050
Your Milton is actually talking about heaven here and,
and uh,

38
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:16.681
and the,

39
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:21.570
their reward for the poets sacrifice here on earth is not simply eternal fame.

40
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.950
That,
that,
that had long been a,
a privileged image.
It is a,

41
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.190
it's a priority status in the great hereafter.

42
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.850
This is Milton's argument and if heaven is going to be segregated as Milton

43
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.900
seems to believe,
that would be into hierarchies and classes,

44
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.730
then surely poets would enjoy the privileges of the highest class of all as they

45
00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:46.731
walk crowned with gold through the temples of the skies and with the harps soft

46
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.170
accompaniment,
sing sweet songs.
Now we're,

47
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.610
we have to ask where it could Milton have come by by such an idea as this,

48
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.920
this image of a special reward in heaven for certain types of behavior does of

49
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.050
course have some sort of scriptural basis,

50
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:10.000
but there's certainly nothing in the Bible to suggest that it's poets who are

51
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:14.620
issued the crowns of gold and especially a prominent place as they,

52
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:18.160
as they enter the pearly gates,
as as so often,

53
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.780
and this is something that we'll get very used to.

54
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:23.770
He used to hear Milton's incorporating it into his own text,

55
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.020
a biblical text on a subject almost entirely different from the one of his own

56
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:33.030
idiosyncratic poem.
And so often Milton has no choice but to,

57
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.180
to wrench and to violate the biblical text,
to force it,
to Wa,

58
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.960
to force it to say to what he wants to say what he wants it to say,

59
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.330
or to force it to say what he needs it to say.
Now,
this illusion here,

60
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.080
uh,

61
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.440
in this averse epistle and the versa pistol to his father is a passage from the

62
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:53.410
book of revelation,
Milton's alluding to the,

63
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.100
to what he took to be the divinely inspired prophecy of,

64
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.970
of Saint John The divine that ends the New Testament.
And so this is a,

65
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:05.470
and I put this on the handout,
this is from chapter 14 of the book of revelation.

66
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.640
I heard the voice of Harper's herping with their harps,

67
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.640
and they sung as it were,
a new song before the throne.

68
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:15.190
And no man could learn that song.
I've skipped a little bit,

69
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.930
but the hundred and 40 and 40,000 which were redeemed from the earth,

70
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.440
these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins.

71
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.140
So according to John,
the author of the,
the presumed author of revelation,

72
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:34.010
it's not poets.
Um,

73
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.330
who get to when their songs to the soft voice strings.

74
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.640
It's not poets who are crowned with gold as they,

75
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.270
as they learn the song no other men could learn.
These are honors,

76
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.840
reserved exclusively for virgin honors,

77
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:51.550
reserved only for those who do not defile themselves with the sins of the flesh

78
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.520
and S.
And so it's as if something in the,
in the figurative,

79
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.880
figurative world of Milton's poem to his father has,
has,
I don't know,

80
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:05.050
how do we put it has gone awry.
And unless we're willing to concede,

81
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:10.051
and we're probably not that all poets are necessarily male virgins,

82
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.240
uh,
you,
you can pretty much safely say that there's a,

83
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:18.040
there's a significant disjunction here between Milton's own text and the

84
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:21.500
passage,
the text in the book of revelation that he's alluding to.
It's,

85
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.060
and this is an opportunity for us as this is what we get paid.

86
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.770
This is what I get paid to do and what you're getting credit for learning to do.

87
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.940
It's just this type of signifying gap that compels us,

88
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.240
us as literary critics to dive in and to begin to explore.
So the,

89
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.540
the,

90
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.540
the first question is how do we understand the slippage here from virgin,

91
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:50.620
the biblical virgin to the miltonic poet and,
and,

92
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.150
and more generally,
what could poetry possibly have to do with virginity.

93
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.220
You remember from the,

94
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.310
I hope you remember from the sixth allergy that's sex to allege gea that we read

95
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:05.870
a few classes ago that Milton had told his friend,
Charles,

96
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:09.850
do you dotty that an aspiring epic poet should,
uh,

97
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.780
one should only drink waters to,

98
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:16.310
should refrain from eating meat and three should keep his body chaste and the

99
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:20.940
figure of the poetic rewards for chastity continues to surface,
uh,

100
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.650
throughout Milton's early Milton's early works,
Eh,
you,

101
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.380
you remember the letter to a friend that we looked at lap for the last time.

102
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.490
Milton seemed to have decided against marriage as he was wedding,

103
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:36.410
making the decision to wet himself to his poetry instead.
And,
and in a,
in,
in,

104
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:39.440
in the group of poems that were assigned for section last week,

105
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.500
even though of course you didn't have section last week.
Um,
you,
you,

106
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.320
you saw Milton eluding to justice passage,

107
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.920
although you might not have known it alluding to just this passage in revelation

108
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:53.030
14 whenever he would speak of the music of the spheres.
So in the,

109
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:58.031
in Atala Music and in the poem Arkadis Milton turns to to what he considered to

110
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:02.060
be the greatest song of all the music of the heavenly spheres.

111
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.630
And he indicated that there are only a few just men,

112
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.590
just um,

113
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.510
honorable men who can't even hear those celestial notes.

114
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.290
And it would appear that Milton suggesting that it's chastity that actually

115
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:22.670
established it something like a precondition for hearing and learning,

116
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.600
that inspired song that's actually sung before the throne,

117
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.130
the throne of God in revelation.

118
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.110
So true poetry for Milton,

119
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:37.460
true prophetic poetry that the kind of song that can actually vie with the most

120
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.330
perfect music of the spheres is only accessible and presumably only producible

121
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.410
by the virgin.
Now the first wait,

122
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:51.950
we can't neglect the first order question here,
which has at least for me,

123
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.870
did Milton really believed this?

124
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.860
Could Milton actually have believed that poetic success was in some way

125
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.130
contingent on what it is that you do or what it is you don't do with,

126
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.590
with your body.
And obviously we can't,
we don't have him here.

127
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.150
And who knows the degree of honesty that he would bring to our question if he

128
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:14.630
were here.
We can never know the answer to the question of,
uh,

129
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:17.930
of Milton's Milton's actual beliefs.

130
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.320
But we know how Milton wanted to represent those youthful beliefs,

131
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.310
which is exactly what he does in the,

132
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.360
in the pros treatise with the wonderful title and apology for smack.

133
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.510
Tim Lewis
don't be put off by the name smack.

134
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:39.950
Tim Lewis is a made up name.
Uh,
it's an a and Milton didn't make it up.
Uh,

135
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.090
it's an acronym.

136
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:46.150
He takes the initials of five Presbyterian ministers and combines them in such a

137
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:50.480
way that it forms the name.
It almost sounds obscene.

138
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.800
Smack Tim Lewis.
Um,

139
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.950
so the apology for smacked him newest is written in 42.

140
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.050
What's it about eight years after Columbus.
And we haven't,

141
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.430
I know we haven't gotten to comments yet,

142
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:03.960
but I'm trying to put this into context.
And in this pamphlet,

143
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:04.980
this pros treatise,

144
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:09.981
Milton is looking back at this exuberant affection for the very idea of chastity

145
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:15.120
that he had held in his youth.
And you'll,
and you'll note,

146
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.390
and there's no reason that you need to read more of this,
but the,

147
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:19.650
the Hughes edition only includes a portion,

148
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.190
a small portion of the actual pamphlet.
So this treatise is a whole,

149
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:27.090
is Milton's diff defense of these six Presbyterian ministers who wrote a

150
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:31.890
treatise criticizing the authoritarian structure of the,
of the English church.

151
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.370
Milton was also a,
at this time,

152
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:38.850
becoming an opponent of the Anglican Church government.

153
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:43.720
And he was writing and publishing a cha attacks on the church alongside this,
uh,

154
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.350
the smack new ones.
This smacked him newest group.
Now the,
the,

155
00:09:47.351 --> 00:09:52.290
the Church of England establishment always countered these,

156
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.830
uh,
these puritan treatises and attack of their position.

157
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.340
And in a particularly vicious critique of so-called smack Tim Lewis and

158
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:06.330
anonymous Anglican opponent attack,

159
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.100
not only these six Presbyterian ministers,
but attacked Milton as well.

160
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:16.470
And I think this might be the first time that John Milton has actually,
um,

161
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:20.460
attacked or brought to the attention of the English people,
um,
in print.

162
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.260
So we have this anonymous attacker who dismissed Milton's earlier political

163
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:27.600
treatises,
especially the apology or a pest.

164
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.920
All the reason of church government and other early works.
Um,

165
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.110
he dismisses Milton by waving that an unscrupulous ad hominem attack.

166
00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.030
He argued that,
that this,

167
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:43.830
this John Milton fellow simply couldn't be heated on matters of the church are

168
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:48.630
on matters of the state because Milton himself had absolutely more no moral

169
00:10:48.631 --> 00:10:50.820
authority.
Um,
he,

170
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:55.821
he accused Milton of frequenting play houses and also a frequenting bordellos

171
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.810
and we ask ourselves honest,
honest to Pete,
uh,
Milton hour,

172
00:11:03.811 --> 00:11:08.220
John Milton frequent a Bordello I and I hope you have no choice.

173
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:10.530
You have to agree with me here.
Um,

174
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.620
perhaps he might have bordello oriented thoughts,

175
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.830
but there is no way in hell that this unspeakably self-controlled young man

176
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:24.200
would actually find himself in a,
in,
in a whorehouse.
Um,

177
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.510
the accusation is absurd and Milton knew it was absurd,

178
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.060
but he loves the attack.
Nonetheless.

179
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:34.650
You can tell he does because it gives him this extraordinarily happy opportunity

180
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:38.190
of defending himself and justifying himself,
which is what he does with the,

181
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.630
with this special vigor.

182
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.710
This is on page 695 of the hues in the apology.

183
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:48.000
Milton explains the preposterous of the idea that he has ever visited a

184
00:11:48.001 --> 00:11:49.620
prostitute.
In fact,

185
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:54.621
he claims he was so far from such debauchery that he had that he had devoted his

186
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:57.700
in his entire early life to the ideal of virginity.

187
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.950
Now Milton knows that this might sound a little [inaudible] sound a little silly

188
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:07.951
coming from a young man and he acknowledges here finally that the ideal of

189
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.640
virginity is an ideal for which women are typically praised.

190
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:18.010
And,
uh,
of course this,
this goes without saying and patriarchal societies.
Um,

191
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.640
there tends to be an inordinate degree of interest,
uh,

192
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.990
placed on the virginity of young women.
It's,
it's as if the co and this just,

193
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:27.790
it matters more for women than for men.

194
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.530
It's as if the commodity of the bride is deemed truly valuable only if it can be

195
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:34.420
guaranteed,
pure and untouched.

196
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:40.710
Milton recognizes that way of thinking as a double standard and he isn't

197
00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:44.950
satisfied with the double standards.
So he comes up with a,
with a,

198
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:48.970
with a vulgar double standard of his own.
This is the argument,

199
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.520
since men are clear,
clearly what he calls the perfector sex,

200
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.750
the perfect or sex,

201
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.980
surely they should be held to even higher standards of bodily purity even than

202
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:04.360
women.
So given the elevated status of,
of,
of men,

203
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.040
it's all the more important that men should remain pure and chaste.

204
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:10.330
And so we have Milton arguing,

205
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.920
this is on the top of page six 95 and I'm quoting here,

206
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.540
if on chastity and a woman whom Saint Paul terms the glory of Man,

207
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.190
be such a scandal in dishonor,

208
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:26.020
then certainly in a man who was both the image and glory of God,
it must,

209
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.030
they'll commonly not so thought be much more indie,

210
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.490
flowering and dishonorable in that he sins both against his own body,

211
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:37.270
which is the perfect or sex and his own glory,
which is in the woman.

212
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.220
And that which is worse against the image and glory of God,
which is in himself.

213
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.220
Nor did I slumber over that place.

214
00:13:45.221 --> 00:13:48.640
And he's referring to that text in the Bible that we've just looked at.

215
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.040
Nor did I slumber over that place,

216
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:54.750
expressing such high rewards of ever accompanying the lamb with those celestial

217
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.700
songs to others in apprehensible,

218
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.530
but not those who were not defiled with women.
Now,

219
00:14:02.531 --> 00:14:05.770
the place in the Bible over which Milton couldn't slumber was obviously this

220
00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:07.730
revelation 14,

221
00:14:07.731 --> 00:14:12.100
and it has to be said that Milton lost all the young Milton lost a lot of sleep

222
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.530
over this,
over this passage.
Uh,
Milton we know was seriously looking,

223
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.340
are we,

224
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:23.340
we have to assume was seriously looking forward to high rewards in heaven as a

225
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:28.060
virgin.
And as a poet,
he would hear and sing those songs.
Uh,

226
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.110
two others in apprehensible,
the celestial music.

227
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.860
And we can see the Milton astutely exploits.
It's brilliant.

228
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.530
The sexist implications of Saint John's treatment of virginity for both,
uh,

229
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.270
John of the book of revelation.
And for John Milton,

230
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.420
it's the superior male of the species that's been singled out for the glorious

231
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:52.460
practice of sexual abstinence.
Now this,
uh,
this,

232
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:55.520
this passage that we're looking at the passage from the apology as it has been

233
00:14:55.521 --> 00:14:56.210
written.

234
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.360
Well after all of the poems that we're reading for today and Milton's writing

235
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:01.160
here from a,
from a slightly different,

236
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:05.030
we can think of it as a more mature perspective.
So in 1642,

237
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:09.200
you see Milton softening a bit in part because he's interested in getting

238
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:13.730
married and in fact he's married within a month of the actual publication of

239
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:17.810
this,
of this treatise.
This is why he tells us the parents,
theoretically,

240
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:21.050
marriage must not be called a defilement.
He's,
he's,
you know,

241
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.250
he's beginning to change his mind,
but at this,

242
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:28.490
but at the time period that we are examining,
uh,
the,
the,
the period of Comis,

243
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.650
the early 1630s,

244
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.060
Milton seems very much interested in remaining virginal forever,

245
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.130
avoiding even the sanctioned loss of virginity,

246
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:43.460
which is the state of marriage.
Milton's,

247
00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:48.170
Milton's college nickname as he,
as he tells us in the pro allusion six,

248
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.360
this is a,
a college exercise.

249
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.320
Milton's college nickname was the lady.

250
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.220
Now it's true that Milton skin,
and this is,
he tell,

251
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.310
he tells us this innumerable times,
and it's a,
it's vouched by others.

252
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:03.140
His skin was very fair.

253
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.950
Auntie to an unusual degree,

254
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.880
wore his hair quite long.
And he must have had,

255
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:14.960
it is conjecture to rather lady like appearance as a young man.
But I,

256
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:15.680
but I suspect,

257
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.680
I suspect that it was primarily Milton's intense interest in his college years

258
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:26.470
in his own virginity that led our young poets classmate at Christ's College,

259
00:16:26.571 --> 00:16:30.110
Cambridge,
to call him the Lady of Christ's.

260
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.420
This is,
it's,
it's too easy.
And you know,
you,
you know where I'm going with this.

261
00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:44.530
It's too easy,
but it's also,
this is why I can't help myself.
It's too delicious,

262
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.030
uh,

263
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:51.030
to take this little biographical fact of Milton's college nickname and use it in

264
00:16:51.041 --> 00:16:55.510
some way as a tool for reading a mask.
The,

265
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.350
that this is the brief theatrical piece that Milton Rights in 1634 in which he

266
00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:03.400
publishes in 1637 the heroine of the mask,

267
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.350
as you know,
it doesn't seem to have a Christian name.
Ah,
she's not Brittany or,

268
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.630
or Lindsay.
We're,
we're,
we're,
we're only,

269
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:15.700
we're only asked to think of her as the lady by her title and while it would be

270
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:20.701
ridiculous for us to read the entire mask as the poets own completely unfettered

271
00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:26.320
autobiographical fantasy,
there is clearly,
and this is undeniable,

272
00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:30.730
a miltonic set of interests and the miltonic set of anxieties,

273
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:32.920
charging and,
and fueling this work.

274
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.090
<v 1>Okay.</v>

275
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.421
<v 0>The first,</v>

276
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:39.020
we need to establish a few things about the occasion for this piece and about

277
00:17:39.021 --> 00:17:41.450
the genre.
The literary genre of the mask in general,

278
00:17:41.451 --> 00:17:46.451
Milton's mask was the product of a commission and as it's full title suggests a

279
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:49.410
mask presented at Ludlow castle.

280
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:52.260
It was commissioned to be performed at a specific locale.

281
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.680
Obviously Ludlow Castle,
which is in the west of England,
still there,
um,

282
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.450
near whales on the border of England and Wales.
And this was pre,

283
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.740
this piece was performed only once.
I'm on the religious holiday of,
of,

284
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:09.170
of Mikel Ms. Knight.
Now the theatrical form of the mask differs in a,

285
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:14.171
in a number of ways from the more familiar dramatic form of the play with which

286
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:19.630
we're all obviously much more
comfortable with it.

287
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.730
In the first place.
Uh,
a mask is nearly always occasional.

288
00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:28.500
It's nearly always commissioned by the king to be performed at court before a

289
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:33.030
private audience of select nobility or it's commissioned as in the case of this

290
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:33.983
mask,

291
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.800
it's commissioned by an aristocratic family to be performed at the aristocratic

292
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:41.610
families estate to honor or to celebrate a specific occasion.

293
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.990
And so in the case of,
of,
of,
of a mass here,
it's the,

294
00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:49.260
it's the Lord John Edgerton,
the Earl of Bridgewater,

295
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:54.180
who commissioned Milton to write a piece honoring his own inauguration as the,

296
00:18:54.181 --> 00:18:56.640
in his new role as the Lord President of oils.

297
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.890
So Milton wrote this mask with the specific cast in a specific audience in mind.

298
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.380
He wrote it to be performed by a Bridgewater's three children,
the lady Alice,

299
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:12.020
who obviously played bill lading and,
and Bridgewater's two sons there,

300
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.080
John and Thomas,

301
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:18.060
and they play the elder brother and the second brother respectively.
Alice is a,

302
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:20.070
is is 15 years old at the time.

303
00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:25.071
Not An entirely unreasonable age for an actress or an amateur actress playing

304
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:30.780
the,
the maiden Lee,
but strong headed lady of Milton's masks,

305
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.000
Milton's mask.
But her brothers were,
and this is a little silly,

306
00:19:35.001 --> 00:19:39.450
or her brothers were 11 and nine.
I'm unusually young actors.

307
00:19:39.451 --> 00:19:43.350
We might think to be engaged in such high flying philosophical debates as these

308
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:48.180
two characters find themselves in whatever awkwardness of casting,

309
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.690
uh,
we have in this original performance.
Um,

310
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.410
W W W we'll cast that aside and,
and uh,

311
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.370
we have no choice but to understand that Milton's mask is serious business,

312
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:04.170
that the music,
that their whole production is one of the utmost seriousness.

313
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:07.350
The music for the mask,
which still exists.
Um,

314
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.860
at least the melody still exists was written by Henry laws,

315
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:13.140
the most important musician,
uh,
working in England.

316
00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:16.410
He had just come from writing the music for a number of masks by the celebrated

317
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.380
playwright and mask writer Ben Johnson.

318
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.360
And it seems that laws himself actually played the role of the attendant spirit

319
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:29.361
that beneficence slightly a frightening figure who hovers over the entire

320
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:34.060
landscape of the mask.
Now,
it's been conjecture.

321
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.910
This is for a hundred or 150 years now that the actor playing comis in this

322
00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:43.911
first and only performance in the 17th century was none other than our John

323
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.450
Milton himself and I,

324
00:20:45.451 --> 00:20:48.640
and I'm quite sure that there are no historical grounds whatsoever for this

325
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:53.641
conjunction conjecture other than our perfectly perverse desire to imagine the

326
00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:59.710
young self described Virginal Milton uttering.

327
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:04.450
Though the wanton and absolutely beautifully lascivious speeches of the magician

328
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:09.451
and of course would be molester comas and who could deny the satisfaction of

329
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.420
hearing our buttoned up young Milton,

330
00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.790
I'm speaking one of comas is a magnificently sly and suggestive lines such as

331
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:26.680
with all that false innocence what half night to do with sleep.

332
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.460
He asks,
Comas asks,
uh,

333
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:35.050
the lady and as excited as a rouses we might find ourselves,
um,
by the,

334
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.810
by this imagining of Milton actually playing comas,
um,

335
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.600
of course is his performance in that role cannot be asserted in any way

336
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:46.840
definitively.
Um,
now as I mentioned,

337
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:51.841
the title of this piece was originally a mask presented at Ludlow castle and it

338
00:21:52.661 --> 00:21:56.490
seems actually to have been known by the reading public,
uh,

339
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.870
by this title for a good hundred years or so.

340
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.260
But at some point in the 18th century,

341
00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:07.261
the mask seemed informally to acquire an alternative title comas.

342
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.050
And it's as Comis that all readers since have have almost always referred to the

343
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:17.800
mask.
And this of course is a mistake.
It's a misnomer,

344
00:22:17.801 --> 00:22:21.830
but the historical transmutation of,
of Milton's title,
um,

345
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.010
and we have to take as instructive and,

346
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.680
and so I want to propose that the literary traditions,
essentially a,

347
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.720
the literary traditions renaming of this piece from a mask to comas is more than

348
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:36.161
just a slip.

349
00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:40.750
We're more than just a random shift of terms or have names on the,

350
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.130
on the face of things to call this mask.

351
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.790
Comas is absurd.
Comments is obviously the villain.

352
00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:53.350
And for those of you who've read,
for those of you who've read paradise lost,

353
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.010
you'll notice that the characterization of comas prepares Milton and a lot of

354
00:22:57.011 --> 00:23:00.640
important ways for his much later characterization of the character,
Satan,

355
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:03.430
comas and Satan,
or both seductive.

356
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.300
They're both rhetorically gifted temp doors and they actually share a lot of

357
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:11.290
rhetorical figures and moral concerns in common.

358
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.930
At times when we read paradise lost,
it seems almost as if Satan,

359
00:23:16.931 --> 00:23:19.420
we're quoting or alluding to Comis,

360
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.630
but it's of course the lady who's the heroine of this,
of this piece.

361
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:26.560
And if we were to ask,

362
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:31.890
if we were asked to refer to the mask by the name of one of its characters,

363
00:23:32.981 --> 00:23:37.981
I think we'd feel obliged to call it the lady or maybe the trials and

364
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:42.370
tribulations of the lady or the ultimate triumph of the lady,

365
00:23:42.371 --> 00:23:45.130
something like that.
And we would name the mask after the lady.

366
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:50.470
It's she who represents the moral and doctrinal message that the mask itself

367
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:52.760
espouses.
The,

368
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.860
the lady is at the dogmatic heart of this relentless,

369
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.620
relentlessly didactic work of literature.

370
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.310
What did I just say?
I actually had,
um,
my,
I have,

371
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.350
I'm having terrible back pains right now.
I,
I I slept really badly last night.

372
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:20.240
What health night to do with sleep.
I assure you I wasn't enjoying myself.

373
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.600
Um,
so I,
I'm not sure exactly what I just said.

374
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.730
Did I say,

375
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:38.180
did I say that the lady is at the dogmatic heart of this relentlessly didactic

376
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:39.014
work of literature?

377
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:44.090
Is it possible to say that the lady successfully,

378
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.500
does that make any sense?

379
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:48.910
Is it possible to say that she successfully conveys a moral program that we can

380
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.920
any way identify as the official doctrine of the mask or has my,

381
00:24:56.391 --> 00:25:00.230
uh,
my,
my state of sleeplessness and my,
and my aches and pains,

382
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.680
I'm disturbed my critical faculties that the casual renaming of the mask,

383
00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.430
which happened well after Milton's death suggest that readers have been perhaps

384
00:25:10.431 --> 00:25:15.320
less persuaded by the moral vision relayed by the lady and that they've been

385
00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:20.300
perhaps overly persuaded by the subtle temptations of,

386
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:21.260
of comas and I,
and,

387
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:26.261
and this confusion I think has everything to do with the fact that this is no

388
00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:30.620
ordinary moral that we have in this work of literature.

389
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.830
The focus of the mask is the loaded,

390
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:39.550
you'll grant me this and the always awkward subject of chastity and the,

391
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:43.850
and the actual morality of the kind of chance to do that the lady believes in,

392
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:44.983
uh,

393
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.430
I think raises a lot of questions about the clarity of the distinction being

394
00:25:49.431 --> 00:25:51.920
formed here between,
between good and evil.

395
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:54.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

396
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.470
<v 0>So I'm partially going to retract what I had said about the lady's place at the</v>

397
00:25:59.851 --> 00:26:03.960
very heart of this work.
We're,
we're,
we're,
we're retreat.
Okay.

398
00:26:03.961 --> 00:26:05.340
Look at line.
Uh,

399
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.363
<v 1>okay.</v>

400
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:13.270
<v 0>Line two oh five.
Oh actually this is,
I'm thinking of page.
Yeah.</v>

401
00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:15.820
Page 95 in the Hughes were retreated,

402
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.880
were treated to the ladies singular investment in the integrity of her body and

403
00:26:21.431 --> 00:26:25.570
her first speech.
Of course,
the ladies alone.
Why is she alone?

404
00:26:25.571 --> 00:26:27.760
Because her brothers have naturally done with any brother would do.

405
00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.940
I'm accompanying a sister and a dangerous forest at night.

406
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:35.710
They have abandoned her to pick berries or any such cooling fruit as the kind

407
00:26:35.711 --> 00:26:40.630
hospitable woods provide,
uh,
Dr. Samuel Johnson,

408
00:26:40.631 --> 00:26:41.464
the great,

409
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:46.350
the greatest of all 18th century critics is absolutely flabbergasted that Milton

410
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:48.690
would have these brothers do something so stupid.

411
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:54.300
It's so dark in the woods and the woods all alone that the lady can see nothing.

412
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.720
But nonetheless she can hear the riot and ill managed merriment of coma.

413
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:03.390
Stan is riot as Clu crew.

414
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:08.760
And I'm going to ask you to think of all of the images here.
The figurations of,

415
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.660
of listening and hearing in the mask.
The,
the,

416
00:27:12.661 --> 00:27:17.220
the lady is overwhelmed
not by what she can't see,

417
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:18.770
but by what she can hear.

418
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.460
This is a page 95 this is line two oh five this,

419
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.530
this strange experience of hearing,

420
00:27:25.531 --> 00:27:30.531
but not seeing a thousand fantasies begin to throng into my memory of calling

421
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:34.200
shapes and beckoning shadows,

422
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:36.780
Dyer and Arie tongues,

423
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:42.140
that syllable men's names on sams and shores and desert wildernesses.

424
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:51.260
Now I submit that the lady would appear to be less in control of her fantasies.

425
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.000
Then she is of her rigorously disciplined behavior,

426
00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.380
however,
unyielding her dedication to her virginity and we have to say that it's

427
00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.160
unyielding.

428
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.160
The lady is incapable of disciplining utterly her imagination and the rudeness

429
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:12.240
and Swill insolence of Comas,
his band of evil pranksters are,

430
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.830
are almost matched.

431
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:18.480
Perhaps they're even bested by the uncontrollable shapes that throng into the,

432
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.100
into the ladies' memory.
It's almost as if the labor,
the lady is,

433
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.630
is in some way harboring her own demons and it's,

434
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.870
it's as if we have an instance here of what this is.

435
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:33.450
This is an idea that I got from the Milton lecture when I,

436
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.840
that that I took when I was a sophomore here I'm the professors suggested this,

437
00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:42.330
is that this is an instance of what Freud would call the return of the repressed

438
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.950
as the lady labors to preserve her virginity.

439
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.710
She conjures a a menacing,
but nonetheless,

440
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:53.280
it's a sensual image of Arie tongues,

441
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:58.710
that syllable men's names.
Now being the lady,

442
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.760
she,
she pulls her socks up.
She quickly recovers from this brief lapse,

443
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.610
a momentary lapse and essential reverie,

444
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:10.611
and she addresses all of those virtues that she cherishes so highly look at line

445
00:29:10.621 --> 00:29:13.440
two and 13 oh,
welcome pure.

446
00:29:13.441 --> 00:29:18.441
I'd faith white handed hope they'll hovering angel girt with old golden wings

447
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:21.690
and thou unblemished form of chastity.

448
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:26.810
I see visibly and now believe that he the supreme good to whom all things ill

449
00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:28.621
are,

450
00:29:28.621 --> 00:29:33.570
but as slavish officer's a vengeance would send a glistering guardian if need

451
00:29:33.571 --> 00:29:37.840
were to keep my life and honor on a sale.

452
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.160
This lady doesn't need the WHO,
where her brothers are.

453
00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:44.080
She doesn't need their protection because the god,

454
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:49.240
because God prizes chastity above all things and would gladly send a glistering

455
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:54.160
guardian to keep her on her,
on her,
on a sailed.
Now this,

456
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.170
I think we w we,
we might agree that this is a,

457
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.460
a reasonable enough fantasy of a female in vulnerability,

458
00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.390
but of course there is nothing.
There is nothing in our sad experience with,

459
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.990
with sexual menace that actually bears this,

460
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.730
the theory behind this fantasy out,
but,

461
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.700
but think of how the lady has expressed this sentiment.
Oh,
welcome.
Pure ride,

462
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.120
faith,
white handed,
hope and vow,

463
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:26.260
unblemished form of chastity,
faith,
hope and chastity,

464
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.900
faith,
hope and chastity.
Do we do we read this right?

465
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.940
You,
you,
you may,
you may recognize the illusion.

466
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.560
The illusion here is obviously to the,

467
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:42.220
to the passage in First Corinthians that you can find on your handout.

468
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.570
This is one of the most famous verses in the,
in the Christian Bible,

469
00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:48.100
Saint Paul Enumerates,
what he,

470
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.720
what we now call the cardinal virtues and now abideth faith,

471
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.600
hope charity,
these three.

472
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.180
But the greatest of these is charity.

473
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.870
Now we're not of course surprised by polls list of the virtues,

474
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:05.650
charity or,

475
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.700
or what he seems to have been thinking of is the selflessness of Christian Love

476
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:14.620
is a virtue,
generous and capacious enough to encompass all of the others.

477
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.110
But faith,
hope and chastity.
And the greatest of these is chastity.

478
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.890
It.

479
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:26.650
It's as if it's as if in some way we're being invited to measure the lady's

480
00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:31.420
speech against the scriptural texts that supplies it's rhetorical foundation.

481
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:36.160
And I think it's impossible not to see that when Milton substitutes the virtue

482
00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:39.490
charity with the far more circumscribed,

483
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.560
however virtuous it is,
it's a,

484
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.340
the much more circumscribed ideal of chastity.

485
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:49.960
There's something at least a little peculiar going on.
The lady,
it could be said,

486
00:31:49.961 --> 00:31:54.961
appears to overvalue her chastity and it's in the general overvaluation of

487
00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:59.380
chastity that we can best see the ways in which this,

488
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.470
this text comas begins to burst loose of the Orthodox Christian morality that we

489
00:32:06.251 --> 00:32:10.870
tend to associate with pious Christian literature like this,
especially,

490
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.050
um,
the,
the literature of the mask.

491
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:19.090
Now it's the elder brother in the mask who offers us.
And even more,

492
00:32:19.091 --> 00:32:22.420
if you can imagine it even more magnified view of the virtue of virginity.

493
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.111
They'll,

494
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:27.550
the lady herself had argued that heaven would send a glistering guardian down to

495
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:30.970
defend her physical,
her bodily integrity or physical innocence.

496
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.360
But the elder brother goes further even than that.

497
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.290
And it's his theory of the rewards do virginity that really just slings this

498
00:32:42.351 --> 00:32:47.351
mask far from the reach is even a of anything even resembling mainstream

499
00:32:48.021 --> 00:32:52.220
Protestant orthodoxy or for that matter orthodoxy of any kind.
Uh,
this is the,

500
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:54.490
this is the elder brother,
uh,

501
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.430
line for 53 page 100 in the Hughes.

502
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

503
00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:05.620
<v 0>Chatting with is his younger brother.
So dear to heaven is saintly chastity,</v>

504
00:33:05.621 --> 00:33:07.480
that when his soul is found sincerely,

505
00:33:07.481 --> 00:33:10.630
so a thousand livery the angels lackey,

506
00:33:10.631 --> 00:33:15.631
her driving far off each thing of sin and guilt and in clear dream and solemn

507
00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:17.441
vision,

508
00:33:17.441 --> 00:33:22.441
tell her of things that no gross ear can hear till off to converse with heavenly

509
00:33:23.111 --> 00:33:25.000
habitants and,
and,
and,

510
00:33:25.001 --> 00:33:28.990
and Milton or the elder brother here is clearly thinking of revelation 14 which

511
00:33:28.991 --> 00:33:33.100
is the w in which it's only the pure air of the virgin that can even begin to

512
00:33:33.101 --> 00:33:37.210
hear the new song being sung before the throne of the God of God.

513
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:43.090
The elder brother is explaining that these angels will begin to cast to beam on

514
00:33:43.091 --> 00:33:46.390
the outward shape,
the unpolluted temple of the mind,

515
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.930
and turns it by degrees to the soul's essence till all be made immortal.

516
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:55.753
<v 1>Okay?</v>

517
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.200
<v 0>It was,
it was one thing for the lady to imagine,
you know,</v>

518
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.800
a crazy as it was for the lady to imagine a rescue squad of angels to,

519
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.430
to zip two or eight at the first hint of a physical assault.

520
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.710
And it was okay for Saint John de suggested.

521
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.570
Virgins are granted the best perquisites in the,
in the,
in eternity.

522
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.220
But think of what the elder brother has just given us.

523
00:34:18.221 --> 00:34:23.221
He staged a scenario far beyond the wildest theological conjectures.

524
00:34:24.281 --> 00:34:26.740
So dear to heaven is saintly chastity,

525
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.740
<v 1>okay?</v>

526
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.800
<v 0>That heaven doesn't even permit vergence to die.</v>

527
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.210
The thousand delivery to angels begin to cast their special beam on the,

528
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.080
on the Virgin's outward shape.
That's her body,
the unpolluted temple,

529
00:34:40.081 --> 00:34:42.150
but that houses her virginal mind.

530
00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:47.780
And this angelic laser begin slowly the gradual process in some kind of

531
00:34:49.171 --> 00:34:53.970
extraordinary science fiction sort of way of transforming the virgin human body

532
00:34:53.971 --> 00:34:55.500
to the essence of the soul itself.

533
00:34:55.501 --> 00:35:00.501
It's as if this celestial laser beam were designed so as to actually shift the

534
00:35:02.881 --> 00:35:06.210
atomic structure of the pure corporeal frame of the virgin his body.

535
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.370
Until that body is so rarefied,
so pure,
and ethereal,

536
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.500
that it's nothing but soul.

537
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:16.363
<v 1>Okay?</v>

538
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.190
<v 0>She's been,
she's been,</v>

539
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:23.470
she's been transmogrified from body to soul.
She's safe,

540
00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:26.070
<v 1>okay?</v>

541
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:27.670
<v 0>Mountain.
I'll never mind that.
That,</v>

542
00:35:27.671 --> 00:35:31.650
that our own experience with virgins has failed to afford us.

543
00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.710
Such a spectacle of bodily transformation.

544
00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.540
The elder brother is this theory without any consideration,
obviously,

545
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:44.370
whatsoever of earthly reality.
Uh,
and,
and we're shocked by,

546
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.540
I don't know how else to put it.

547
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.570
It's there because this is a theological conjecture,

548
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.580
I think were shocked by what is almost the heretical daring of what this brother

549
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:56.190
has just said.
Um,
uh,

550
00:35:56.191 --> 00:35:59.700
unfortunately your editor merit cues and in this respect,

551
00:35:59.701 --> 00:36:02.620
he's like all editors of Milton,
um,

552
00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:08.280
does his very best to tame the outrageousness of the elder brothers speech.

553
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.120
And he follows the old editorial wisdom that holds that Milton can't possibly,

554
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.180
uh,
mean what he's actually saying here.

555
00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:19.560
Hughes tells us that Milton's thinking of Plato and that the elder brother is

556
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:21.420
referring to the platonic theory that the,

557
00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.230
that the noble spirit is released from the body after death.

558
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.960
But,
and this will be our mantra,
I hope for the rest of the semester,

559
00:36:30.961 --> 00:36:35.961
we must not permit merit cues or any Milton editor to prevail in their efforts

560
00:36:38.311 --> 00:36:42.000
at papering over the implications of a passage such as this.
Uh,

561
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.960
there's of course no mention whatsoever here of a soul being released from a

562
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:46.890
body after death,

563
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:51.240
that that would be an entirely orthodox image and we wouldn't be startled by its

564
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:52.074
presence.

565
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.160
But with the older brother is saying is that the virginal body is actually

566
00:36:56.161 --> 00:36:57.960
transmogrified into soul.

567
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.130
The dirty business of physical death never has to take place at all.

568
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:07.260
That true virginity can provide the body with the release even from that

569
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:12.040
seemingly inexorable fact of death.
Well,
I mean,
we,

570
00:37:12.041 --> 00:37:15.620
we have no,
we have no,
we were,
were,
were,

571
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:20.540
were prepared and no way to respond meaningfully to a speech such as that.
And,

572
00:37:20.541 --> 00:37:25.360
and,
and clearly the second brother joins us in his bafflement.
Now look it,

573
00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.720
the magnificent,
uh,

574
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:31.650
nonsequitor that he gives in response to the speech of his brothers.

575
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.710
The,
the,
the second brother says at line four 75,

576
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:39.100
how charming is divine philosophy?
Um,

577
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.470
the elder brother has obviously up the ante in the,

578
00:37:43.471 --> 00:37:47.040
in the masks overvaluation of virginity.
And it's,

579
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:51.360
and it's possible that in this general drama of overvaluation that Milton's

580
00:37:51.361 --> 00:37:56.361
working just because this whole thing is so extreme to distance himself from his

581
00:37:57.871 --> 00:38:02.010
own youthful interest in the virtues of virginity.
That's one conjecture.

582
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:02.844
At least.

583
00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:07.140
There seems to be something like a gentle parody,

584
00:38:07.141 --> 00:38:11.280
maybe even a mocking tone that that fills the lines of the older brothers

585
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.920
ecstatic speech.
In any case,

586
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.490
the question of value and valuation,

587
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.570
it is an important one in comas and it's important in part because the rhetoric

588
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:26.220
of the mask is saturated in the economic,

589
00:38:26.221 --> 00:38:28.590
the commercial,
the financial imagery that we were,

590
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.130
that we were looking at in the last lecture.
Milton,
we know,

591
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:37.250
we know this already gives pride of place to the images of money and trade that

592
00:38:38.741 --> 00:38:41.620
he inherited from his father and so,

593
00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.660
so we're not surprised that the central conflict in comas is,

594
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.420
is loaded with the rhetorical tokens of,

595
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:53.490
of commerce and exchange a look at line six 79 of the poem.

596
00:38:55.060 --> 00:39:00.060
This is page 106 in the Hughes Comas is marshaling a serious,

597
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.640
a series of serious and perfectly and genius.

598
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.980
Our arguments in his attempt to seduce the lady,
uh,

599
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:12.070
which is really simply an attempt ostensibly to get her to drink from the glass

600
00:39:12.071 --> 00:39:13.150
of cordial Julep,

601
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:18.040
which she has steadfastly refused drink up though he tells her,

602
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:19.690
and this is line six 79,

603
00:39:19.691 --> 00:39:24.691
why should you be so cruel to yourself and to those dainty limbs,

604
00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:28.840
which nature lent for gentle usage and soft delicacy,

605
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.420
but you invert the covenants of her trust and harshly to nature's trust and

606
00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:39.421
harshly deal like an ill borrower with that which you received on other terms.

607
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.860
So nature nature has lent you your dainty limbs for a purpose.

608
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:49.130
Comas tells her,
but you're inverting the covenant of Nature's trust,

609
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:53.980
refusing to use and to spend those gifts that nature has given you.
Um,

610
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:57.080
according to comas,
the lady is an ill borrower.
She,

611
00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.400
she doesn't spend her bodily wealth and fulfill the terms of nature's loan.

612
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.970
And so for Comas,
the nature,
the,
uh,

613
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.990
the lady is hoarding the natural asset of her,

614
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:14.920
of her physical beauty.
Look,
look,
look down.

615
00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:16.540
Further line seven 39.

616
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:19.990
Beauty is he combs continues.

617
00:40:19.991 --> 00:40:24.991
Beauty is nature's coin must not be hoarded but must be current in currency and

618
00:40:26.501 --> 00:40:29.710
the good,
there've consistent,
mutual and partake in bliss,

619
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.670
unsavory in the enjoyment of itself.

620
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.900
Um,
with this,
with this phrase mutual and partake in bliss,

621
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.790
we develop an overwhelming sense that always seems to be trying to get the lady

622
00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:48.430
to do something more simply than drink.

623
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.790
A sip of the cordial Julep from his charm had cup.

624
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:57.200
The discussion is obviously on some way really about sex and it's the ladies

625
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.070
virginity of course that's at stake here.

626
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.090
And with his accusation of the misuse of borrowed funds,

627
00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:09.450
we recognize the strange and I think in this context rather ill fitting subtext

628
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:11.830
behind commas is seduction.

629
00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:16.831
Comas is adopting the language from that parable in Matthew Matthew 25 that had

630
00:41:17.831 --> 00:41:22.831
proven so significant and I think so painful for the young Milton for comas.

631
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:28.160
Nature is just like the harsh master who had given each of his servants,
uh,

632
00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:31.270
a portion of money.
And who expects those coins?

633
00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:34.130
Who expects those talents to be put,

634
00:41:34.131 --> 00:41:37.940
to use the ladies' talent has to be spent.

635
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.710
It has to be invested in order to fulfill the covenant of the trust between the

636
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:44.540
master and the servant.

637
00:41:44.541 --> 00:41:49.541
But the lady is hoarding that natural gift just as that unprofitable servant had

638
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.250
had buried his talent and the earth.
Now the Levy,
um,
it's been,

639
00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.080
it's been noted before.
It's never really able to respond to combs.

640
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:01.970
His accusation of her hoarding,

641
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:06.290
she discussions what she would like to say in response to comments,

642
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:09.140
but she doesn't then go on significantly to say it.

643
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:14.260
She says nothing after this encounter remaining silent or speechless for the

644
00:42:15.471 --> 00:42:19.610
rest of the mask.
But Milton clearly finds,

645
00:42:19.611 --> 00:42:22.700
I think something,
something threatening here.

646
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:27.170
And if comas can be seen to pose a genuine threat to the lady,

647
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:32.030
it could very well be the threat posed by the power of comas.

648
00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:35.000
This particular particular kind of poetry.

649
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

650
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:45.070
<v 0>Um,
I should have put on the handout and I failed to do that.
Uh,</v>

651
00:42:45.071 --> 00:42:47.740
the name of a couple of works of,

652
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.530
of Milton criticism that are especially,
uh,

653
00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.700
especially valuable with respect to what I'm about to argue and to which I'm

654
00:42:54.701 --> 00:42:55.300
indebted.

655
00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:00.010
One is the chapter on Comis in a book by John Guillory called Poetic Authority.

656
00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:03.930
And the other is,
uh,
the entire book,
uh,

657
00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.740
by Angus Fletcher
on Milton's Comus.

658
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:12.640
What is that book called?
Thank you,
David.

659
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.760
The transcendental mask is,
uh,
and,

660
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.330
and both Guillory and Angus Fletcher or examining the,

661
00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.170
the relation of Milton to one of his,

662
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:28.060
the troubled relation to melt into one of his favorite poets.
Um,
it's,

663
00:43:28.061 --> 00:43:33.061
it's surely not insignificant that Milton's comas contains more echos of

664
00:43:33.341 --> 00:43:36.700
Shakespeare than anything else that Milton wrote.
And it's,

665
00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.920
and it's surely not insignificant that the,
the,

666
00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:43.940
the ladies first song is actually addressed to the Nymph Echo that the mask is

667
00:43:45.431 --> 00:43:49.960
all about the act of hearing song and the,
and the ethics of proper listening.

668
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:55.840
Th th the ladies first line in the mask is in fact about the music that comas is

669
00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:58.960
producing that sh that she hears this way.

670
00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:04.090
The noise was if mine ear be true,
my best guide now,

671
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.410
if mine ear be true,

672
00:44:05.411 --> 00:44:10.411
my best guide now comas and the lady are continually listening do each other's

673
00:44:12.061 --> 00:44:12.894
songs and the,

674
00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:16.930
and the lady's goal is in some way to develop a way of listening that isn't at

675
00:44:16.931 --> 00:44:19.210
the same time overwhelming or,

676
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:24.300
or perhaps deafening now what the lady listens to a might well be overwhelming.

677
00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:26.890
Indeed.
It's the,

678
00:44:26.891 --> 00:44:31.000
it's the speeches of comas far more than those of any other character that are

679
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.030
with echos in illusion,

680
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:37.770
echos in illusions to the great plays of Shakespeare.

681
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:43.440
Shakespeare presents himself as something like a powerful temptation in,

682
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.491
in this mask.

683
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:49.491
We remember that Milton's anonymous attacker in 1642 had not only claimed that

684
00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:54.530
Milton could be found skulking around the back alleys of London's brothels.
Uh,

685
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.350
Milton was also a denizen.
It was alleged in this attack.

686
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.870
He was a Dennison of London's playhouses and,

687
00:45:01.871 --> 00:45:05.370
and you can't help but notice that Milton and the apology for smack Timnah was,

688
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.250
it doesn't even begin to respond to that accusation.

689
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:12.330
It's like the lady with the accusation of Hoarding Shakespeare in the theater

690
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:17.630
seem to represent a temptation greater even than promiscuous sex or perhaps akin

691
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:22.100
to sex.

692
00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.710
It's as if Milton places the beautiful poetry of Shakespeare into the mouth of

693
00:45:25.711 --> 00:45:26.940
this evil magician.

694
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:32.510
So as to dismiss all the more easily that the easy leg grow mode of poetry that

695
00:45:33.331 --> 00:45:38.100
Shakespeare scenes from Milton to embody.
Now we've,
we've,

696
00:45:38.101 --> 00:45:40.770
we've been churning for a couple of,
a couple of weeks now,

697
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.800
Milton's long standing project to purge his lips of secular interests and to

698
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:50.490
cleanse his literary consciousness of the tempting influence of secular literary

699
00:45:50.491 --> 00:45:51.324
voices.

700
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.710
And one of those voices is obviously Shakespeare's.

701
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.160
And so it's an understandable ploy on Milton's part that,
that,

702
00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:03.630
that he needs to vilify Shakespeare by identifying that great poet,

703
00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:08.910
his older contemporary,
um,
with comas.

704
00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.330
But the standoff between Milton and Shakespeare,

705
00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:15.870
much like the standoff between comas and the lady,
uh,

706
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:20.140
is not as easily resolved as it might seem to be.
The,

707
00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.780
the logic,
the beauty of,
of comas.

708
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:27.880
His rhetoric seems often to overpower the ladies own,
which is itself,

709
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.550
admittedly beautiful and powerful.
And,

710
00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.620
and we see in the poem itself an anticipation of the struggle that results

711
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:40.080
eventually in the 18th century and the new title of the Mask Comas has

712
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:41.940
successfully eventually,

713
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:47.090
he truly edges the lady out as this center of the entire work.

714
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.890
And,
and in the play itself,
in the fiction of the play,
the comas,

715
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:57.480
his argument simply leaves the lady in silence.
And,
and more than just silence,

716
00:46:57.481 --> 00:47:01.560
she's actually incapable of speak.
She's capable of it.

717
00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.630
We'll only see partially capable of speaking,

718
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:08.750
but she's actually physically incapable of moving most awkwardly.

719
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:14.700
The lady is physically stuck to her seat.

720
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:21.240
She stuck to Amar.
It's,
it's,
it's,

721
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:22.200
this is remarkable.

722
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:27.950
She stuck to a marvel venom deceit smeared with gums of gluten as heat.

723
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:34.120
Think about that.
Or is Columbus explains,

724
00:47:34.121 --> 00:47:37.420
this is line six 58 ne ladies sit.

725
00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.150
If I bet wave this wand,

726
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:45.151
your nerves are all chained up in alabaster and you a statue or as Daphne was

727
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:51.670
root bound that flood Apollo.
Now this isn't the first time that we have,
um,

728
00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:56.800
in,
in,
in Milton the representation of the,
of the turning of a person to marble.

729
00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:00.370
It's,
this is actually a recurrent figure in the early poems,

730
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:04.000
a figure of frozenness or of there.

731
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.120
Isn't it wonderful that there's a term for being turned to marble

732
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:12.100
memorialization?
Um,
and this memorialization appears in a lot of the,

733
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:15.600
of the early poems I'm thinking of on Shakespeare,
the poem,

734
00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.700
the passion as well as Lola grow and Heal Pencil Rosso.

735
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.840
And there's a moment in a lot of these poems in which the speaker finds himself

736
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:28.230
in a motionless in mobile or to actually turn to stone and on Shakespeare,

737
00:48:30.821 --> 00:48:32.990
it seemed to be the set,
this sector of

738
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.850
the specter,
how,

739
00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:41.230
what a great slip though the Spector with the Septor,
this,

740
00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:45.010
the specter of Shakespeare that elicited this set of terms and images,

741
00:48:45.011 --> 00:48:48.880
the idea of being frozen or Amar memorialized,

742
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:53.290
thou does make us marble with too much conceiving.

743
00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.750
Milton had told Shakespeare in that poem,

744
00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.340
the lady in Milton's mask is placed in a similar predicament,

745
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:05.080
but by the Shakespearian power of coma,
she's rendered,
she's mentored motionless,

746
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:07.990
and she's finally unable to speak.

747
00:49:07.991 --> 00:49:12.580
She's unable to speak except to hint at a doctrine of virginity that finally

748
00:49:12.581 --> 00:49:15.940
she's in incapable of articulating.
But,

749
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.740
and this is where we have to end this,
uh,

750
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:24.810
this session the lady does by the end of the poem get up from her seat.

751
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.500
She's released from her paralysis and she proceeds happily with her brothers by

752
00:49:29.501 --> 00:49:33.040
the end of the poem to honor their father in Wales.

753
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:36.640
And if we wish to continue this analogist and I analogy and I certainly do

754
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.640
between the poet Milton and the Virgin Lady,

755
00:49:39.641 --> 00:49:42.940
we can see that this is a release that John Milton,

756
00:49:42.941 --> 00:49:45.520
the poet has been waiting some time for.

757
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.420
And so it only stands to reason that we pay some attention and it will have to

758
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:54.200
do this next week to how this release actually works.
Um,

759
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:59.310
just briefly,
a supernatural figure.
The nymph,
it looks like Sabrina,
but it seems,

760
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.080
I think it's pronounced Sabrina the Nymph.

761
00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:05.080
Sabrina rises from a stream and unglued,

762
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:09.090
unglued the lady from her seat.
Now the,
the,

763
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:14.190
the mysterious mechanics of Sabrina's magic are profoundly mysterious.

764
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.370
And so I'm going to ask you to look especially closely for the next class,

765
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:23.350
and I want you to reread comas for the next class to look especially closely at

766
00:50:23.351 --> 00:50:26.200
the Sabrina episode.
And I also want you to look closely at the,

767
00:50:26.201 --> 00:50:29.060
not at the lines that are noted on the syllabus.

768
00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:34.660
These are lines that were added a couple of years after the performance of

769
00:50:34.791 --> 00:50:35.151
comas.

770
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:38.930
These are lines added when Milton actually gets around to publishing the mask in

771
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:42.890
1637.
So this is,
this is my final thought here.

772
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:47.891
If Milton as a poet who had never really published anything significant,

773
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.920
thinks of himself as a virginal rider,

774
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:57.950
then there's an important way in which Milton loses his virginity with his

775
00:50:57.951 --> 00:51:02.420
published version of coma since 1637.

776
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:06.650
So for next week,
uh,
no for Wednesday,

777
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.330
reread comas.
