1
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.553
It's,

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.940
it's not until book three of Paradise lost that the poet explicitly reveals to

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.530
us,
to his readers,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.690
the fact of the physical handicap that might reasonably be thought to render

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.660
impossible.
His,
his composition of the poem.

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.230
It's not until book three until after Milton presents his heroic is heroic

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.460
portrait of Satan.

8
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.090
It's Aurora portrait of the fallen angels as he establishes the,

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.050
when he establishes the fact of his blindness.
And so I'm dividing,
um,

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.160
I'm going to be devoting this lecture to Milton's representation of his

11
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.470
blindness and especially to that,

12
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:46.140
to the invocation of light with which book three begins.

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.540
Because I'm absolutely convinced that a feeling for the phenomenon of,

14
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:55.541
of Milton's blindness is crucial to any real understanding of,

15
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.290
of,
of this poem,
certainly,
but also of this poet.

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.520
And so one of the questions that I want here to pursue is the question why

17
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.710
Milton,
with the exception of a,
an oblique.

18
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:10.740
And it's really a very old bleak reference in the opening and vocation,

19
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:13.560
why Milton waits until now,

20
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.070
until the third book of his epic to divulge his blindness to his reader.

21
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.160
So Milton began,
uh,

22
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.810
Milton began to lose his eyesight around 1646.

23
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.110
This is when he's in his,
uh,
his late thirties,

24
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.580
and he was entirely blind by February of 1652.

25
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.710
And that was at the age of 44,

26
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.030
according to one of the earliest biographers and really usefully and wonderfully

27
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:45.540
merit cues includes in the back of the hues edition.
Um,

28
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.840
most of the earliest biographies of Milton.

29
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.750
And they make first Scott found fascinating reading.

30
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.320
These are sketches of the poet written very shortly after Milton's death.

31
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.570
According to one of these biographers,

32
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.090
Milton subjected himself to a range of medical procedures in order to,
to cure,

33
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:07.480
or at least to forestall the young con,
the,
the,
the,
the,

34
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.880
the darkness that was about to,
to,
to set over him.

35
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.200
He imbibed a lot of,
a lot of potent medicines.
Um,

36
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:20.370
obviously they were ineffective and he endured the indignity of that procedure

37
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.360
that was most commonly deployed in the 17th century for the treatment of any

38
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:28.020
serious disease.
And that was the process of bloodletting.

39
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.720
And so we have to imagine that Milton,
as did other,
uh,

40
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:38.250
other men and women who underwent,
uh,
some,
uh,

41
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.940
some onset of blindness,
um,

42
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.310
small incisions would be made in the skin around Milton's eyes and a quantity of

43
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:51.771
blood would be drained at regular intervals in order to empty the body of the

44
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:57.330
harmful toxins.
Or it's a ill humors that were believed to produce,

45
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.170
uh,
this,
this terrible malady.
The medical community,
of course,

46
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.240
was not able to forestall the failure of Milton's eyes.
And so as I said,

47
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.150
Milton was blind by 1652.

48
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.360
Milton would never see his fourth child,

49
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.580
a daughter born three months after the onset of total blindness he would never

50
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.750
see the face of is never again see the face of his wife,
Mary Powell,

51
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.500
when she died three days after the child's birth.

52
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.550
Nor could he witnessed the death of his only son,
John Jr,

53
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.720
which occurred six weeks after that.
And finally,

54
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:37.810
Milton would never see the face of Catherine Woodcock,

55
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.210
the woman he married four years later and who soon herself died in childbirth.

56
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.480
Nor would he ever see the face of Elizabeth Mitchell who we married nine years

57
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:53.320
after that.
Um,
why,
why did,

58
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.420
why did Milton go blind?

59
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.410
Reasonable conjecture leads us to think that it was either glaucoma or

60
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:03.070
cataracts,

61
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.820
but of course our business here has nothing to do with the real represent,

62
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.340
with a real causes of,
of Milton's blindness.

63
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:11.410
But with Milton's literary figuration,

64
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.210
his representation of the causes of his blindness.
And I,

65
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:19.090
and I'm convinced that one of the most powerful determinants in Milton's late

66
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:24.091
writings is the drive Milton's drive to ascertain and then also to justify the

67
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:29.530
cause of his life,
loss of sight.
And I think you have throughout,

68
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.270
throughout the late writings,

69
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.260
a really a proliferation of explanations and justifications,
um,

70
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.440
of his blindness.

71
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.580
And they really feel Milton's Milton's writing throughout the entire period from

72
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:45.550
1652 his death in 1674.

73
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.920
First let us consider how Milton's contemporaries interpreted his blindness.

74
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.920
Ah,
Milton's Milton's world fell into total darkness a little,

75
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:01.480
little less than a year after he finished his great and really quite daring

76
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:04.870
political treatise.
The first defense of the English people,
which was,

77
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.020
which was published in 1651 this was the last of Milton's regicide treatises.

78
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:15.100
It was written in Latin because the new Commonwealth government had had

79
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:20.101
commissioned Milton commissioned John Milton to justify the unprecedented act of

80
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:23.230
regicide to the entire European community,

81
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:25.360
which is why Milton didn't write it in English.

82
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.700
Milton was responsible for explaining to all of Europe why the English people

83
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:35.230
had beheaded their king and why they had set up a new government on what Milton

84
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:39.930
considered to be idealistic non monarchic principles.
Now Mountain,

85
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.790
most of Milton's readers on the continent were appalled,

86
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.000
appalled by England's action and appalled,

87
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.970
especially by Milton's defense of England.

88
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.230
And it was widely thought that not only on the continent,
but also by Milton's,

89
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:57.040
a lot of Milton's fellow Englishman,
it was widely thought that God

90
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.290
had blinded Milton specifically for his writing against the king.

91
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.510
Milton was the subject of a number of sermons,

92
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.340
sermons that were delivered from the pulpits by,

93
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.330
by conservative Anglican Churches,
uh,
and the,

94
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:15.920
and the sermons pointed to Milton as an example.
Milton was an example.

95
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.540
Look what happens to those who lift their hand against God's anointed king.

96
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.820
Look,
look what happened to Milton.

97
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.140
He was punished with blindness for riding his defense of the regicide.

98
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.990
And it's in response to just this type of common accusation that Milton writes,

99
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:39.470
that a lovely sonnet to his friend.
Uh,
Mr Syriac Skinner,
uh,

100
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:41.840
this is on page 170 in the Hughes.

101
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.890
This is the Sonnet in which Milton insists justice.

102
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.490
He will in a second defense of the English people that is blind.

103
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.520
It has nothing whatsoever to do with an act of God.
So in the,

104
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:54.770
in the poet to to Tuh Syriac Skinner,

105
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.620
Milton's been totally blind for about three years now.

106
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.860
And he begins this sonnet to his friend like this Syriac this three years day,

107
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:05.990
these eyes though,

108
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:10.991
clear to outward view of blemish or of spot bereft of light.

109
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.040
They're seeing have forgot

110
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.230
and Milton rights repeatedly that,

111
00:07:17.231 --> 00:07:21.530
that through throughout this period that despite his blindness,
his eyes appear,

112
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:23.420
and this is incredibly important to him.

113
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.960
They appear to outward view to be perfectly healthy.

114
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.030
And he continually clears himself of any wrong doing by insisting that his eyes

115
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:35.760
are clear of blemish or spot or any sign that is,
I,

116
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.710
I have to assume of sin or,
or of corruption or blame.

117
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.660
And so far from being robbed of light by God,
his eyes of simply,

118
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.160
and isn't this a lovely metaphor?

119
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.010
His lies of his eyes had simply forgotten how to see.
And,

120
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.350
and you'll remember how important,

121
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:56.300
how redemptive actually the idea of forgetting had become a to Milton in

122
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:57.200
paradise lost.

123
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.670
Now Milton goes even further in the sonnet an exculpating himself.

124
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:03.640
Look at line 10.
This is when he,

125
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.670
this is where he claims that he has supported by his conscience,
his knowledge,

126
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.490
that he willingly sacrificed his eyes for the patriotic goal of,

127
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.250
of political liberty.
And so Milton is,

128
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.120
is talking of his eyes here.
I lost them over,

129
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:22.760
applied in Liberty's defense,

130
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:27.761
my noble task of which all Europe talks from side to side.

131
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.320
Uh,
he,
he,
he ruined his eyesight with the,

132
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:37.190
with the tireless Labor that he had devoted to the two writing that first

133
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:38.510
defense of the English people.

134
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.840
Milton sacrificed his eyes for the freedom of his countrymen,
the,

135
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.680
the noble task for which he was compensated.

136
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.100
He was compensated with the talk of all of Europe.
He was a celebrity.

137
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.380
And according to this formulation,

138
00:08:51.381 --> 00:08:56.381
Milton has knowingly and willingly bought fame as a political liberator with

139
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:01.440
the,
with the noble sacrificial payment of his eyes.

140
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.120
Now this is the claim at Milton is making publicly in these poems,
um,
in,

141
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.140
in this period.
And,
and,
and in the pros treatise is,

142
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:13.950
and it's a claim for the nobility of the tragic condition that he finds himself

143
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.190
in.
And so when all of Milton's public poetry and prose,

144
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.740
Milton asserts his blindness as a point of pride.

145
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.790
He and he even go so far in the second defense of the English people to claim

146
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:28.540
that is blindness is actually a sign of God's election.
Uh,

147
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.980
God has,
God has chosen him.
And it's an incredibly beautiful image.

148
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.820
The image of Milton's eyes being covered by heavenly wings,

149
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:39.540
by angel wings almost as a favor.
Um,

150
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:43.200
he's continually asserting publicly.
That is blindness is a sign of strength,

151
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.930
but we have a more,

152
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.010
we have a more private and a more personal consideration of his blindness and a

153
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:54.700
letter that Milton wrote to his friend,
a Dr. Leonard for Loris.
Um,

154
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.010
the Athenian.
Uh,

155
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.750
and this was in the packet in the more in the more private venue of the personal

156
00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:01.584
letter.

157
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:07.190
Milton seems in some ways to lower his guard and he makes a powerful and moving

158
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:11.280
plea for a cure because he's writing to a doctor.

159
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.170
And so look at the look in the packet.
Um,
this is around page 60 in the packet.

160
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.350
The,
the,
the original page number is seven 22,

161
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.040
I believe Milton's articulating here for the doctor,

162
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.790
the history of his loss of sight and the nature of his condition.
It is 10 years,

163
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:31.791
I think more or less since I noticed my site becoming weak and growing dem.

164
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:38.700
And at the same time my spleen and all my viscera are burdened and shaken with

165
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:43.440
flatulence.
And so after this account of,
of intestinal discomfort,

166
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:48.390
Milton then describes the mist that began to appear in his left eye,

167
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.010
which is Milton's left.
I was the first one to fail.
And then a few,

168
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.940
a few sentences down.
He describes the failure of the right eye,

169
00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.490
the other eye,

170
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:04.491
also failing slowly and gradually over a period of almost three years,

171
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.890
some months before my site was completely destroyed,

172
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.760
everything which I distinguished when I myself was still seem to swim now to the

173
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:17.610
right now to the left,

174
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.170
certain permanent vapers seem to have settled upon my entire forehead and

175
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:26.820
temples,
which press and Oh,
press my eyes with this sort of sleepy heaviness,

176
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.360
especially for mealtime to evening

177
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.910
and mill.
In this letter to the doctor,
uh,
Milton associates,

178
00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:37.200
the onsite of his blonde,

179
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.270
the onset of his blindness with the onset of a gastrointestinal complaint.
And,

180
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.620
uh,
and in doing this,

181
00:11:43.621 --> 00:11:46.830
he's following the common wisdom about the causes of blindness,

182
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.440
which was usually attributed in the scientific community of the 17th century,
uh,

183
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:57.040
to,
to,
to a digestive problem.
And so for Milton is most depressive pain,

184
00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:01.150
burdened his forehead and his eyes in the hours following the noontime meal.

185
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.820
And this pain corresponded.

186
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.680
The pain in his head corresponded to a pain in his gut,
uh,
which,

187
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.890
which occurred presumably in the same hours following the noontime male a meal

188
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.360
as his,
as his entire frame was shaken with a violent flatulence.

189
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:17.960
And,
and,

190
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.960
and this is how the theory of this kind of digestive ailment caused blindness.

191
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.730
Um,
the,
the,
the,
the digestive vapors that Milton or,

192
00:12:26.731 --> 00:12:31.690
or anyone who was going blind was not able to expel successfully for through,
uh,

193
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.250
through normal digestion.

194
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:37.070
And the normal process of the passing of wind of these vapors were trapped in

195
00:12:37.071 --> 00:12:38.530
the,
in our poets body.

196
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:43.531
They began gradually to rise up to his head over a period of many months or even

197
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:48.991
years where they settled into the sockets of his eyes and eventually they

198
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:54.241
clouded over his eyes and cut off all access to light from the outside.

199
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.670
Uh,
another way of putting this,
the,
the affliction that would alter forever,

200
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:05.570
the last quarter of Milton's life had its ultimate cause in the process of,

201
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:06.460
of digestion.

202
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.360
And Milton's greatest misery was quite simply the consequence.

203
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:16.030
And he may have believed this,
the consequence of something he ate.

204
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.250
Now you are,
you've probably,
if you've no doubt gas,

205
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:25.510
why I'm emphasizing this particular figuration of Milton's blindness as an

206
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:29.970
irrevocable change,
uh,
that that follows the ingestion of food.
The,

207
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.100
the story of Milton's blindness as he represents.

208
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:37.810
It's brings us so perilously close to the story of the fall,

209
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:42.070
which is of course another narrative that imagines the in alterable and terrible

210
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:47.071
effects of something eaten at one critic William Kerrigan has called,

211
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:51.580
uh,
you know,
in a,
in a,
in his brilliant analysis in the book,

212
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:56.320
the Sacred Complex has called paradise lost the story of an evil meal.

213
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.990
And it's important in the poem that Adam and Eve fall at noon.

214
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.450
The forbidden fruit is there noontime meal.

215
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:10.960
And it's possible that Kerrigan has right into aligning the dynamics of the loss

216
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:12.260
of paradise with,

217
00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:15.950
with the logic that Milton employees and describing the loss of his site.

218
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.050
And when Adam falls in book nine of Paradise lost.
Um,

219
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.600
and these are the lines that are behind me on the board here.
Um,

220
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.960
we have a description of the almost physiological response of the earth to the

221
00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:30.820
sinful transgression of Adam and eve.

222
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:37.050
Adam Earth trembled from her end trails as again in pangs and nature gave his

223
00:14:39.261 --> 00:14:40.094
second grown.

224
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.360
It's as if Milton has transposed onto the entire earth the,

225
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.820
the digestive pains that were the consequences of his own noontime meal as if

226
00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:53.780
the flatulent earth were responding sympathetically to the violent shaking of

227
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:57.620
Milton's own end trails.
No.
Now we now,

228
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.830
now we're left at the point that we're so often left.
What's the,

229
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:02.210
what's the point of all of this?

230
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.310
What's at stake or what might be at stake in this connection between Milton's

231
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:11.840
own,
a postprandial groaning and moaning and the,
and the,

232
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:14.060
and the even more poignant posts,

233
00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.150
lapse area and groaning of Adam and eve,

234
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.460
Adam and eve and the entire earth.

235
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.030
Now the connection between these two phenomena,

236
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.930
I believe if there is one in involves transgression,

237
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.850
the physical deterioration that visits human beings after the fall comes as a

238
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:36.170
direct consequence of course as their transgression of divine law.

239
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.560
And it's possible that we have buried in this narrative of Milton's own physical

240
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:42.170
deterioration and related narrative of,

241
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:46.840
of kind of transgression and,
and punishment.
And,

242
00:15:46.841 --> 00:15:47.301
and I,

243
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:52.280
I assume that it has already become clear to you that this will be one of those

244
00:15:52.281 --> 00:15:56.510
lectures that I'm giving over entirely to perfectly shameless,

245
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.940
uh,
biographical speculation.

246
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.090
And it's one of the great joys and I take it to be one of the great privileges

247
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:04.720
of being able to lecture on Milton,
um,

248
00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.850
and in this format rather than it is in a seminar format.
Because of course,

249
00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:12.410
if this were a seminar,
you could and you would be right to ask me for my proof.

250
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.700
How do I know,
uh,
what Milton was thinking?
And of course I have,

251
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.260
I have no proof.

252
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.430
But I know what I believe and I'm going,

253
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:26.780
I'm willing here at now to share with you these things that I believe actually

254
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:31.610
quite,
quite,
quite passionately and my own belief is that on some level,

255
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.480
Milton may not have convinced himself when he wrote in the second defense or

256
00:16:38.571 --> 00:16:41.990
Milton may not have convinced himself when he wrote in that Sonnet to Mr Syriac

257
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:45.800
Skinner,
that he had willingly sacrificed his eyes for the good,

258
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.090
for the good of his country,

259
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:51.650
or that God had permitted his blindness as a sign of his special election

260
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.530
covering his eyes with with Angel Wings.

261
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.980
It's possible that what you were having a letter like the letter to Leonard

262
00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.570
Floris is,
is something like a submerged expression of,
of guilt.

263
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.140
Maybe Milton's enemies were right.
Maybe Milton was,

264
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.320
maybe Milton was to blame with his transgressive challenges to every conceivable

265
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.470
form of authority.
Maybe Milton was to blame for his blindness,

266
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:19.730
the affliction that God visited upon him for his,

267
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:23.510
for his crimes.
Now this is of course just one.

268
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.720
This is just one way to understand the extraordinary attention that Milton gives

269
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:34.940
to his blindness in the invocation to book three of his epic,

270
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.730
uh,
turned to page 257 in the Hughes,

271
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.180
Milt Milton continues in paradise lost.

272
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:46.810
This is written well after well over a decade after the onset of blindness,

273
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:51.210
Milton continues to defend himself from the imputation of blame.

274
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.740
The,
the,
the Muse Milton invokes here is,
is,

275
00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:59.280
is not the traditional muse of the classic epic or even the Heavenly Muse that

276
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.000
Milton seems to have fashioned in the first in vocation.

277
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:04.320
It's now that power.

278
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:10.010
It's exactly that power from which Milton has been excluded by virtue of his

279
00:18:10.141 --> 00:18:13.950
blindness,
light,
hail,
holy light,

280
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:19.930
offspring of heaven,
firstborn,
or of the eternal coeternal beam.

281
00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:22.410
May I express the unblend blamed?

282
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.170
Let me just stop right there.

283
00:18:25.171 --> 00:18:29.700
May I express the unblend Milton Milton's exposing a few at the very beginning

284
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:33.360
here of some imputation of blame or,
or,
or,
or guilt.

285
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.620
He and he's not even sure how to address this inspiring light.
The first,

286
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.670
the first seven lines of this invocation aren't,
are not just to the most,

287
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.290
and they are,
they are,

288
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:46.620
but they are not simply the most impenetrable lines and the entire poem.

289
00:18:46.621 --> 00:18:50.420
They are among the most difficult lines of poetry ever written.
And,

290
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.750
and it's always worth asking why a passage of poetry is so impossible to wrap

291
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:58.440
your brain around.
What's at stake here in this difficulty?

292
00:18:58.441 --> 00:19:00.360
Why this struggle and why,

293
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:03.930
why was Milton struggle with such awkward minute metaphysical categories in

294
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:08.430
order simply to address properly the power,
the power of light?

295
00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.380
I think it's understandable that Milton would call the power of light offspring

296
00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:16.710
of heaven,
firstborn.
Uh,
according to Genesis,

297
00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:20.000
light is the first thing that is created at the,
at the,
at,

298
00:19:20.001 --> 00:19:21.990
at the moment of God's Fiat Lux.
Let,

299
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:25.410
let there be light that command that great commandment.

300
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.590
But the problem really arises in line too,

301
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:34.190
when Milton conjectures that the beam of light he's addressing wasn't born or

302
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:35.340
wasn't but gotten at all,

303
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:40.341
it wasn't created that it might actually be co eternal with the eternal father

304
00:19:40.921 --> 00:19:45.270
himself.
And,
and this I think is a much more dangerous possibility.

305
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:50.010
Milton asks to be enlightened by a light that might be as old as the father.

306
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.490
This runs an utterly counter to the creation account in genesis.
Uh,

307
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.930
could this light be one of the fathers rivals?

308
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.060
And there's a fear here that the ambition of this bid for paternal light is

309
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:07.590
presumptuous.
Perhaps it's even satanic.
Satan,

310
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:11.910
of course,
in the next book book four,
we'll have his invocation to light.

311
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.450
Now the light Milton addresses has been around forever.

312
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.950
Look at line eight of this opening in vocation.
This,
this is on the next page.

313
00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:22.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

314
00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:27.070
<v 0>Before the Sun,
before the heavens,
thou worked.
And at the voice of God,</v>

315
00:20:27.071 --> 00:20:31.810
as with the Mantel did invest the rising world of waters,
dark and deep.

316
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.830
One from the form one from the void and formless infinite

317
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.120
Viv revisit now with boulder wing,

318
00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:49.110
escaped this Digi and pool the long detained in that sojourn well in my flight

319
00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:53.320
through other and through middle darkness,
born with other notes.

320
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:57.850
Then to the your Feehan liar.
I Sung of chaos and eternal night,

321
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.420
taught by the heavenly muse to venture down the dark descent and up to reascend

322
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.120
though hard and rare,

323
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.850
Milton's giving us a picture of himself as,
as as proud clean.
He clearly,

324
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:17.020
he's proud that he's returned from the descent into hell that he seems to have

325
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:20.470
made during the composition of the first two books of his epic's.

326
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.620
He himself has escaped this Daejeon pool and such a reassessment is hard and

327
00:21:25.691 --> 00:21:26.980
rare,
but,

328
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.420
but we've just had represented before this at the very end of the book to just

329
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:36.421
Lonnie was before this Satan's own escape from this Daejeon pool and Satan's own

330
00:21:36.711 --> 00:21:41.530
detainment in his obscure sojourn through chaos.
And there's a,

331
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:44.980
there's a remarkable identification that Milton is bringing himself very close,

332
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:50.050
close to an identification between Milton and Satan,
and there lingers in this,

333
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.650
in this relation to the idea that Milton has brought upon himself some,

334
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:58.030
some guilt,
some blame perhaps for having Sung of Heaven,

335
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.690
no for having Sung of hell and having sung of chaos at all.

336
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:09.220
Now,
Milton of course doesn't,
he can't make this connection explicit,

337
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:10.540
but their alerts the possibility,

338
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:13.560
and I grant you that it's an irrational possibility that,

339
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.610
that Milton has done something wrong.

340
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.990
I don't know how else to read these lines as if he were,

341
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.750
had done something wrong by flying through UTR and through middle darkness

342
00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.510
during his composition of the first two books of paradise lost.
It's,
it's,

343
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:32.620
it's almost as if,
and I know this doesn't make sense,

344
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:38.370
it's almost as if Milton's flight through darkness had been responsible for the

345
00:22:39.311 --> 00:22:42.670
literal visual darkness.
That is the condition of his blindness,

346
00:22:42.671 --> 00:22:46.750
which he is describing now to us for the first time.
It's,
it's this possibility.

347
00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.590
I think that the,
the idea that Milton has brought his blindness on,

348
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.910
on himself over the course of the composition of the poem,

349
00:22:54.911 --> 00:22:56.350
which of course this isn't the case,

350
00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.800
it's this possibility that I think accounts for the delay in Milton's Milton's

351
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:06.700
mention of his loss of sight,
the delay until this moment in the poem.
It is,

352
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:11.710
it the guilt for his blindness in some impossible way lay in the composition of

353
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:13.420
this very poem as if the transgression,

354
00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.320
transgression that called down the wrath of the heavenly father had been

355
00:23:17.321 --> 00:23:21.800
Milton's glorious and heroic treatment of,

356
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:26.290
of Satan as if it were Milton's ambitious attempt to supply the angelic

357
00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.360
prehistory to the,
to the,
to the,

358
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:31.510
to the book of Genesis to the creation account that we get in the book of

359
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:34.780
Genesis that had brought this wrath upon him.

360
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.620
Milton preempt and he prevented genesis.

361
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.230
<v 1>Okay.</v>

362
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.030
<v 0>He continues his address to the light,</v>

363
00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:53.000
the eye,
the eye revisit safe and feel by sovereign vital lamp.

364
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.360
But thou revisit snob these eyes,

365
00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:01.630
that role in vain to find by piercing ray and find no dawn.

366
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:03.690
<v 1>Okay,</v>

367
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:05.790
<v 0>so thick,
a drop,
serene,</v>

368
00:24:05.791 --> 00:24:09.450
have quenched their orbs or dims a fusion veiled

369
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.780
like so many of the lines in this vocation.
These lines are,

370
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:21.000
are violently crammed with an almost unbearable pathos.

371
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:26.250
Um,
it's,
it's impossible to read these lines.
The,

372
00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:30.600
I revisit safe,
but thou revisits not these eyes.

373
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.280
It's impossible to read these lines and not feel that Milton is in some way

374
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:40.110
accusing the deity of,
of injustice.
It's as if Milton,

375
00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:45.111
we're challenging the holy light to revisit Milton just as Milton is revisiting

376
00:24:45.211 --> 00:24:48.810
the holy light and any,
any structures,
this challenge,
it's,
it's,

377
00:24:48.811 --> 00:24:50.820
it's the logic of a quid pro quo here.

378
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.090
He's seeking compensation for his loss,

379
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:59.460
but the compensation that he's looking for isn't forthcoming.

380
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.940
At least it's not forthcoming yet.
Line 32

381
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.423
nor sometimes,

382
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.900
nor sometimes do I forget those other two equaled with me and fate.
So we're,

383
00:25:10.901 --> 00:25:13.840
I equal with them in renown.

384
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:17.500
And here he lists the famous blind bards,

385
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.600
the blind profits of the western tradition,

386
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.160
asking the Muse of light to repay him for his fate.

387
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.850
The fate of blindness with fame renown,
uh,
the,

388
00:25:27.851 --> 00:25:31.570
the renowned or fame enjoyed by buying blind Tom Morris and blind.

389
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:35.370
My on it is my honor.
These is homer and tiger ECS and,

390
00:25:35.371 --> 00:25:37.990
and Phineas Milton knows perfectly well,
perfectly well the,

391
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
each of these figures had been blinded as some sort of punishment for a crime,

392
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.610
at least according to most of the legends surrounding them.

393
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:50.200
Each of these years was thought to have been blinded for aspiring to an intimate

394
00:25:50.201 --> 00:25:53.950
knowledge of the godhead.
And even as,
as as,

395
00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:57.910
as Milton is asking God to elevate him to the status of their equal and equal to

396
00:25:57.911 --> 00:26:02.650
homer,
sharing an equal renown on an equal fame,

397
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.810
he's implicitly acknowledging that terrifying possibility.

398
00:26:05.811 --> 00:26:09.600
And it really is terrifying that that his blind is like theirs is,

399
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.880
is the result of,
of his own trans a transgression,

400
00:26:12.881 --> 00:26:16.480
his punishment for trespassing on,
on divinity.

401
00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.100
But this acknowledgement if,
if,
if it is,
and I think it is,

402
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.910
this acknowledgment of guilt only takes place between the lines below the

403
00:26:24.911 --> 00:26:29.080
surface of the,
in vocation.
And for the most part,

404
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.980
Milton is struggling to clear himself from any imputation of sin or crime and so

405
00:26:35.711 --> 00:26:36.544
from,

406
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:41.850
so from lines 40 to 50 that the strategy of this invocation shifts again and

407
00:26:42.281 --> 00:26:47.220
Milton catalogs the losses that he has endured through the,

408
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:48.510
the,
the loss of his sight

409
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.750
when before had a poet

410
00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.400
represented himself in such,

411
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.990
in such heartbreaking lines.

412
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.590
Thus with the year seasons return,

413
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:12.300
but not to me returns day or the suite approach of even or mourn or side of

414
00:27:14.291 --> 00:27:19.291
vernal bloom or summers rose or Fox or herds or human face divine.

415
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:28.290
But cloud instead and ever during dark surrounds me from the cheerful ways of

416
00:27:29.501 --> 00:27:30.730
men cut off

417
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:37.140
a few poets have been willing even well after Milton had been willing to subject

418
00:27:37.141 --> 00:27:42.141
themselves to this kind of absolutely pathos filled self representation and for

419
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.560
and for exposing himself in all of his vulnerability.
Milton is taking,

420
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.320
he has everything to lose here and for exposing himself in all of his

421
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:54.870
vulnerability.
Milton asks for something in return,

422
00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.600
he asks to be recompensed for these extraordinary losses.

423
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.610
And there I am.

424
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:05.970
I'm absolutely convinced that there's a way in which this request is not

425
00:28:05.971 --> 00:28:06.690
irrational.

426
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:11.040
It's completely reasonable because he is bathed himself in a pathos.

427
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:14.970
I think that's almost too,
uh,
too painful even to read.
We as readers are willing,

428
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.030
we're willing to grant him anything,
anything he wants.

429
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:19.890
There's a kind of naked emotional logic.

430
00:28:19.891 --> 00:28:22.440
It's a governing our experience of these lines.

431
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.790
Let's look at the moment at which Milton asks for the payback.

432
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.560
This is line 51

433
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.540
I have lost all these things so much.

434
00:28:33.541 --> 00:28:38.541
The rather thou so much the rather val celestial light shine inward and the mind

435
00:28:40.651 --> 00:28:44.430
through all her powers,
your radiate,
their plant eyes.

436
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.940
Milton is demanding for his pains,
the inspiration of the heavenly muse.

437
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.380
God,
God owes him this.
And so Milton is,
is,

438
00:28:54.381 --> 00:28:59.381
is remarkably undoing the logic of sin and punishment that he had inherited in

439
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:02.880
his understanding of his blindness.
And he's,

440
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:05.340
and he's restructuring it as something entirely different.

441
00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:09.030
He's turning it into a logic of loss and compensation.

442
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.270
Milton has sacrificed his site.

443
00:29:12.271 --> 00:29:17.271
He has lost almost everything and so much the rather that's God repay him for

444
00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:19.260
that.
Lost his noble.

445
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:23.850
But is once again his noble self sacrifice and you have Milton reworking,

446
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:27.870
hear the rhetoric of guilt,
um,
his and in his blind is becomes important.

447
00:29:27.871 --> 00:29:32.070
Not because it's a sign of punishment or a blame or a spot or blemish,

448
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:36.000
but it's a bit,
it's a guarantee of this,
uh,
of the,
uh,

449
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.620
inspirational success of the poem.

450
00:29:37.621 --> 00:29:41.980
And this is like a promissory note is blindness,
is for his poetic reward.

451
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.400
The fact that this poem we'll have been inspired by the heavenly muse.

452
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:54.400
A look,
oh,
this is wonderful.

453
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:58.960
Turn to the very last page of hues of,
of the merit cubes edition.

454
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.940
This is page 1044.

455
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.510
This is one of the earliest biographies of Milton,
uh,

456
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.250
written in the 17th century and it's an anonymous one and it gives us some

457
00:30:09.251 --> 00:30:14.080
remarkable details about this man's life.
Some of them are so,
uh,
so astonishing.

458
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:17.270
There's no way they could have been made up.
The writer at the,
uh,

459
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:22.240
the anonymous writer at the top of page 1044 is describing Milton's daily habits

460
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.100
as he was composing Paradise Lost Paradise lost in the later poems.

461
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.150
And Milton,
it seems would dictate the most recent.

462
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.360
Every man would dictate the most recent installment of paradise lost in the

463
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:37.750
morning.
So this is the,
what we learn.

464
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:42.340
He waking early and you'll see this wonderful admiration of the deer,

465
00:30:42.341 --> 00:30:43.270
Puritan Melton,

466
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:48.390
waking early as is the use of temperate men had commonly a good stock of versus

467
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:53.380
ready against his Emmanuel insists came and the manual,
this is the secretary,

468
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.960
the,
the,
the,
the young man who had come to Milton's house.

469
00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:58.660
And there were a number of them who would take down dictation.

470
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.760
And Milton seems to have,

471
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.520
Nelson seems to have composed the poem at night in his sleep,

472
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.000
which,
and but the,
the biographer continues,

473
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.100
which if it happened to be later than ordinary,

474
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:17.470
Milton would complain if the manual sisters,
it's secretary got there too late,

475
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.000
Milton would complain saying he wanted to be milked.

476
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.050
This absolutely stunning biographical detail is italicized here,

477
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:30.110
presumably because it's a,

478
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.030
it's a quotation and that's a form of noting a quotation.
Uh,
but,

479
00:31:34.031 --> 00:31:37.540
but the metallic seem to me at least to indicate as well that this is an

480
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:41.860
extraordinary privilege moment in this biographical text.
It's,

481
00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:45.570
it's a scandalous little tidbit.
Um,
if,
uh,

482
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:50.050
if it's true and we have in here and extraordinary image of Milton's

483
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:54.490
understanding of his own poetic output,
um,
and if,
if this isn't true,

484
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.660
what we do have here at the very least is an incredibly close and intimate

485
00:31:58.661 --> 00:32:02.830
reading of this very and vocation that we're focusing on having filled himself

486
00:32:02.831 --> 00:32:07.831
up with a stock of versus the night before Milton could imagine himself as a

487
00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:11.950
source of spiritual and,
and poetic nourishment.

488
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.720
Milton could imagine himself the distinctly feminine source of,

489
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.320
of this nourishing poem as if by a process of identification.

490
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.800
So complete Milton could imagine himself in the role of the maternal muse who

491
00:32:26.801 --> 00:32:31.600
feeds the poet as she inspires the thoughts that move harmonious numbers.

492
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.430
That's not the poet.
It's not the muse only,

493
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:39.890
but the poet to who can be milked.
Now,

494
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:41.960
God the God the father tells the Sun,
uh,

495
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:45.140
this is in the dialogue between the father and the son later in book three,

496
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.460
that at the end of time there won't be a father and a son because God shall be

497
00:32:49.461 --> 00:32:50.450
all in all.

498
00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:55.010
And it related form of a kind of absolute internalization.

499
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:56.900
And absolute identification is at work.

500
00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.130
I think in this incredibly moving cry to be milked,

501
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:04.550
the Muse has so completely inspired the poet,

502
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.700
so completely transferred her power to him that it's be that it's almost

503
00:33:10.011 --> 00:33:13.640
impossible to tell who was who or who is feeding whom.

504
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.450
And when Milton and the invocation requests that the muse,

505
00:33:17.451 --> 00:33:20.450
the holy light feed on thoughts,

506
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.100
we have a moment of a confused confusion that would only seem to guarantee that

507
00:33:25.101 --> 00:33:27.920
the transference of Power Ha has actually taken place.

508
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.670
It doesn't matter whether these thoughts belonged to the muse or to the poet.

509
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.160
These thoughts are all in all.
And,

510
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:38.360
and you have other guarantees as well.

511
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.670
In book three of Milton's having filled up at the fountain heavenly inspiration,

512
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:48.920
uh,
and these moments of guarantee come in and extraordinarily,

513
00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:51.890
um,
unexpected places.
Um,

514
00:33:55.310 --> 00:34:00.080
look at book three,
Line Five,
76 in the Hughes edition.

515
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:04.520
This is page two 72 on his way from hell.
The Earth,
Satan stops at the sun,

516
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.370
which of course is of course the sign,
the source of earthly light.

517
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.710
And Satan watches this as the sun dispenses light to all of the little stars of

518
00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:17.210
having,
this is how Milton's astronomy works,
where the great luminary aloof,

519
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:19.920
the vulgar constellations thick that the,

520
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:24.500
of course the great luminary is the son that from his lordly I keeps distance,

521
00:34:24.501 --> 00:34:27.200
do dispenses light from bar.

522
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.820
Now this great luminary that sun dispenses light to the surrounding stars.

523
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:35.740
And with this image you have a clearly demarcated model of a,

524
00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:40.010
of a particular kind of power relation.
The,
and this is the sun's unilateral,

525
00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:43.760
the powerful sons,
unilateral inspiration of the stars.

526
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:49.340
But look what happens next.
This is a,
this is the stars.
The,

527
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.160
they,
as they move their story,

528
00:34:52.161 --> 00:34:54.830
dance in numbers that compute days,

529
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.700
months and years toward his old cheering lamp,

530
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:04.330
turn their various motions that the stars are filling up here with the light of

531
00:35:05.721 --> 00:35:06.510
the sun.
And they,
they're,

532
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:10.100
they're behaving just as Milton's thoughts do when he's been inspired,

533
00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:13.790
when they have been inspired by holy light,
they're field with the capacity of,

534
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:18.770
of a kind of freewill.
And they turned themselves in story,
dance.

535
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.280
And Milton is very carefully reworking in this passage,
this,

536
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.320
this astronomical passage of the keywords of the invocation that we've been

537
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:29.780
looking at move and numbers.

538
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:34.130
And he projects his image of the inspired composition of the poem onto the

539
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:38.110
enormous screen of the entire,
of the entire cosmos.
And,

540
00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.470
and just as in the invocation,
the actual mover,

541
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:45.800
the agent behind the action of inspiration is uncertain that they turned swift

542
00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:48.510
their various motions

543
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.520
or are turned by his magnetic beam.
We don't know who's,

544
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.970
we don't know who's turning what.
It's all in all.

545
00:35:56.971 --> 00:36:00.240
And it's as if it's at this moment of uncertain agency that Milton really

546
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:03.540
consist something truly amazing.
And,
um,

547
00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:06.490
I ask your indulgence here,

548
00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:08.180
<v 1>okay.</v>

549
00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.920
<v 0>You,
you,
you,
you,
you,
you will know that it's indisputable.</v>

550
00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.270
But the point that I'm about to make,
but it's,
um,
it's,
I think it's shocking.

551
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:20.390
The Sun warms the universe just as the holy light will warm the poet that much I

552
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:23.940
think is clear.
But Milton's figuration of this process,

553
00:36:23.941 --> 00:36:28.230
this process of is of infusion is truly one of the most surprising moments in

554
00:36:28.231 --> 00:36:29.760
the poem for my money.

555
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.500
This is process of infusion replicates on the grand scale.

556
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.860
Okay,
well,
let,
let,
let,
let,
let,
let me read it first.

557
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:40.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

558
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:45.270
<v 0>That beam that gently warms the universe and to each inward part with gentle</v>

559
00:36:46.031 --> 00:36:50.500
penetration though unseen shoots,
invisible virtue,

560
00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.330
even to the deep
this,

561
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.500
this process of infusion replicates on the grand scale of the,

562
00:36:57.501 --> 00:36:59.640
of the entire cosmos,
the,

563
00:36:59.641 --> 00:37:03.410
the rhythms of the intimate human act of,

564
00:37:03.411 --> 00:37:05.180
of Coelho ejaculation.

565
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.510
You simply can't deny that that's what's happening here.
And Milton may give us,

566
00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:14.670
uh,
a cosmic image of the process of,
of inspiration.

567
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.820
But this is a process by which the universe and by association,

568
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:25.710
the poet himself has been feminized and transformed,
transformed mysteriously,

569
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:28.230
and it's something like the maternal muse,
her herself.

570
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.210
Milton tells us that the beginning of the end of vocation,

571
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:35.100
that the light to which he prays was present at the creation and maybe that

572
00:37:35.101 --> 00:37:40.101
light was the same as that identifiable with the heavenly spirit in book one who

573
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:44.940
dove like sets,
rooting on the vast abyss and made,
did pregnant.

574
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:51.180
And maybe Milton here in book three is imagining himself the glorious recipient

575
00:37:51.181 --> 00:37:55.350
of this remarkable act of divine impregnation.

576
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:59.880
He's no longer,
he's no longer the vulnerable male poet who's poetic potency,

577
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:05.420
just like his site can be cut off at whim from the cheerful ways of men cut off.

578
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.740
He,
he's a body impregnated by God.

579
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:15.180
The universe is a body impregnated by God and perhaps even indistinguishable at

580
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:18.510
some point from God.
It's a,
he's a figure impervious

581
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.820
to punishment or pain.
The,
the,

582
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.670
the psyche processes and strategies that I've been describing here are clearly

583
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.930
operating at the level of,
of,
of fantasy.
This is wish fulfillment.

584
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:35.040
Um,
it's certainly not logic and there's no moment in paradise lost at which the

585
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.320
poet will actually present a logical statement concerning this,

586
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.970
uh,
concerning this wish to be absolutely infused with divinity,

587
00:38:45.971 --> 00:38:50.020
to be so divine that he would be in vulnerable to punishment or to be so divine

588
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:54.790
that he would be invulnerable to the physical humiliation of blindness.

589
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.740
You don't have anything like an explicit statement to that effect and paradise

590
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:03.370
lost,
but there is elsewhere.

591
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:05.200
And Milton and I want to draw you to this.

592
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.310
Now there is such an articulation and another poem,
uh,

593
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:12.160
this is what many scholars believe was the last poem that Milton Road,

594
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.580
Samson agonists,
ds.
And so I'm going to ask you to turn

595
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:22.230
to page 553 in the Hughes to this passage in Samsung agonists,

596
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:23.800
ds.

597
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.040
And so even though we don't read the Samsung agonists stays until the end of the

598
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.200
semester,
I want to look at this small section of it now,

599
00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:32.460
since it engages the problem of,
in,
of,
of,

600
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:37.540
of blindness with as much pathos and as with as much force as anything that

601
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:40.900
Milton ever wrote.
So Samsung,
you know,

602
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:46.290
Samson is the biblical hero who strength was bound up in his hair and Samson was

603
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:50.620
blinded by the Philistines after his hair had been shorn by his treacherous
wife,

604
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.660
Delilah.
Milton calls her Dolly Lock.
Look at,

605
00:39:55.990 --> 00:40:00.940
um,
so look at the Hughes.
This is line a line 80 of Samson.
Milton has,

606
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.950
Milton has his hero,
Samson bill wailing the fact of his blindness.
Oh,

607
00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:09.430
dark,
dark,
dark amid the blaze of noon.

608
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:14.460
Irrecoverably dark total eclipse without all hope of day.

609
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.560
And,
and,
and at this point it's wonderful.

610
00:40:17.561 --> 00:40:21.850
Milton begins to Echo Sampson begins to echo Milton.

611
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.180
I'm from the invocation that we've been looking at the invocation to book three

612
00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:29.890
of paradise.
Lost A,
here's Sampson.
Oh,
first created beam and vow.

613
00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:32.650
Great word.
Let there be light and light was overall.

614
00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.550
Why am I thus bereaved thy Prime Decree?

615
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.440
The Sun to me is dark and silent as the moon.

616
00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:46.900
When she desserts the night hid in her vacant inter lunar cave.

617
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:49.300
Since light,

618
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:54.330
try to follow this logic since lights so necessary is to life and almost life

619
00:40:54.581 --> 00:40:58.690
itself.
If it be true,
that light is in the soul.

620
00:40:58.691 --> 00:41:00.340
She the sole in all,

621
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:05.230
she all in every part in Samson's feeling his way here toward Milton's theory of

622
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:05.651
Mona's them,

623
00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:09.310
the idea that the soul is diffused throughout every part of the human body.

624
00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.300
Since the light of the soul is diffused throughout every part of the body.

625
00:41:13.301 --> 00:41:15.130
Why Sampson asks,

626
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.720
why was the site to such a tender ball as the eye can find so obvious and so

627
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:28.650
easy to be quenched and not as feeling through all parts diffused that she might

628
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:33.320
look at,
we'll through every poor.

629
00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:37.010
These are extraordinary lines.

630
00:41:37.011 --> 00:41:39.900
These are among my most favorite lines in all of and all of Milton Cep.

631
00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:45.020
Samson is questioning the wisdom and the justice of God's admittedly who can

632
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:49.970
deny it.
God's extremely peculiar fig configuration of the human body.

633
00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:54.260
Um,
and,
and you read this and you realize that Samson has abs.

634
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.190
He's really on to something here.
Why didn't we ask with Samson,

635
00:41:58.191 --> 00:42:02.150
why didn't God implant the sense of sight and human beings just as he implanted

636
00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:05.430
the sense of touch or feeling what?

637
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:10.440
Why isn't site like touch diffused through all parts of the body that she might

638
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:15.130
look at?
We'll through every pore Milton Milton's pushing here toward a,

639
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.010
toward of fantasy of physical invulnerability imagining an alternative.

640
00:42:19.011 --> 00:42:21.080
But this is,
this is science fiction,
I don't know,

641
00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.950
alternative model of bodily configuration that would render impossible.

642
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.490
The all to easy quenching of the Tinder eyeballs

643
00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:33.770
in the context of Samson agonists does this particular speech of Samson's,

644
00:42:33.771 --> 00:42:38.510
we have to write it off as a kind of morally suspect complaint and this is a

645
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:42.740
faithful just questioning of the,
of the justice of God's creation.
And so,

646
00:42:42.741 --> 00:42:44.810
and Milton doesn't permit himself in paradise lost,

647
00:42:44.811 --> 00:42:49.811
at least not explicitly to impugn the wisdom behind God created by Gods of God's

648
00:42:50.451 --> 00:42:52.820
creation of the all too vulnerable human body.

649
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.640
But he does fashion for us.

650
00:42:55.641 --> 00:43:00.641
They're a fantasy and it's a lot in paradise lost and it's a lot like Samson's

651
00:43:00.861 --> 00:43:05.861
fantasy of a body exempt from harm free from disability.

652
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:10.130
And that is of course the body of the angels.

653
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:15.190
And so the last passage that I'm going to ask you to look at is on page 331 of

654
00:43:15.741 --> 00:43:19.880
the hues edition.
This is book six,
line three 44.

655
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:22.940
Um,
and uh,
the,

656
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:26.780
the narrator here is the Archangel Raphael and Rafiea was explaining to Adam why

657
00:43:26.781 --> 00:43:31.520
the angels and in the war in heaven can't be permanently wounded or harmed.

658
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.670
Now we already know that angels,
we've already learned this,
that angels,

659
00:43:34.671 --> 00:43:37.220
when they please can either sex,
assume or both.

660
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.930
But Raefiel gives us even more information about these perfectly fantastical

661
00:43:41.931 --> 00:43:42.650
creatures.

662
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:47.330
Their bodies have been constructed along pro precisely those lines that Samson

663
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:48.620
was proposing.

664
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:53.120
They're vital functions are diffused through every part.

665
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.690
So look at the bottom of the page.
This is a line three 44,

666
00:43:56.691 --> 00:44:00.560
four spirits that live throughout vital in every part,

667
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:05.300
not as frail man in end trails,
heart or head,

668
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:09.950
liver or rains.
These angels cannot,
but by annihilating die,

669
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.110
nor in their liquid texture,

670
00:44:12.111 --> 00:44:17.111
mortal wound receive nor mar can then the fluid air all heart,

671
00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:21.470
they live all head,
all I,

672
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.330
all ear,
all intellect,
all sense

673
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.710
the body of the Ame,
the body of each and every angel has been created.

674
00:44:31.711 --> 00:44:32.700
All in all,

675
00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:38.190
the no sensory power or important function has been confined to a tender ball or

676
00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:41.070
a delicate orb or a particular Oregon.
These,

677
00:44:41.071 --> 00:44:45.870
these angels are all why they have the power of sight diffused throughout their

678
00:44:45.871 --> 00:44:48.890
entire bodies.
And we can only imagine that they can just to,

679
00:44:48.891 --> 00:44:52.710
Samson had fantasize that they can see through every poor.

680
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:58.650
And so the miltonic angel enjoys the State of absolute site,

681
00:44:58.651 --> 00:45:03.240
an absolute inspiration and absolute oneness with God that Milton has bidding

682
00:45:03.241 --> 00:45:06.510
for.
It's on some level in his complex and ambitious in vocation,

683
00:45:06.511 --> 00:45:10.850
delight in book three and now Milton isn't finished,
uh,

684
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:15.980
articulating for us the impossible process of his poetic inspiration.

685
00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:21.210
Th th the miracle by which the blind poet is compensated for his blindness with

686
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:25.340
the vision of things invisible to mortal site and,

687
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:30.990
and the poem as especially as we will see it in the vocation or the quasi and

688
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:33.060
vocation to book seven of Paradise lost.

689
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.560
That poem will continue to voice doubts that this process of,
of,
of,
of,

690
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.570
of inspiration has actually occurred.

691
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:45.150
But you have in the figure of the miltonic angel,
uh,

692
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:50.130
literalized image,
an embodiment of Milton's most,

693
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.640
most ambitious fantasy for his poem.

694
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:57.990
Maybe it's not if it's an unrealistic fantasy for himself of course,

695
00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:02.040
but it is an ambitious fantasy in a genuine,
when I think for his poem,

696
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:06.600
we know that the body of the poet of course would never undergo.

697
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:11.790
It's much desired,
much fantasize metamorphosis into the body of an angel.

698
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.700
Milton's would never become a body perfected,

699
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.570
rendered impervious to humiliation and darkness,

700
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.120
but the,

701
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:26.120
but the body of the angel may in the end be an entirely appropriate image for

702
00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:31.380
Milton's,
a fantasy of the body of the poem.

703
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:36.510
And so it's,
it's this,
it's this perhaps peculiar idea that I'll,

704
00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:40.950
that I'll leave you with today.
If,
if Milton is right,

705
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.410
let's say Milton will grant that Milton is right,

706
00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:48.360
that he was inspired by God to write this poem.
If he is right,

707
00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:52.680
then the body of this epic really is very much like the angelic body.

708
00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:57.060
It is infused and we have to believe that it's infused in every part with the

709
00:46:57.061 --> 00:47:00.660
spirit of God.
And it's nothing less than all heart,

710
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.510
all intellect.
And,
and this is a,

711
00:47:04.511 --> 00:47:08.820
an extraordinarily resonant word from Milton and all sense.

712
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.570
Okay?
That's the,
that's the end of this lecture.

713
00:47:12.571 --> 00:47:16.440
Let me remind you that when you read book three,
four next time,

714
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.300
you will also,
uh,

715
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:22.200
look at the passages from the Christian doctrine that are assigned on the

716
00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:22.710
syllabus.
