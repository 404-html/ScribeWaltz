00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.340
It's been sad that if Samsung agonists these didn't exist,

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:09.750
then we could say with ax something like perfect confidence that John Milton

3
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:13.050
could never have chosen.
Uh,

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.980
Samsung for a hero.
Uh,
there's,
there's very little,

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.490
there's very little in the Samsung story that makes sense in terms of the larger

6
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.720
thematic patterns of Milton's major poems as,

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.490
as we have come to know them and think about paradise lost in paradise lost.

8
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.940
Milton struggled to justify the ways of God to men.

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.700
He attempted to make kids religion.

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.240
His faith has justifiable and as rational in a lot of ways as he possibly could

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.650
in paradise regained Milton Rewrote Christian history.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.530
He wouldn't even further rewriting Christian history to scrub it.

13
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:54.420
Clean of the primitive and violent notion of sacrifice in the form of the

14
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:58.860
crucifixion.
Fallen man was redeemed.
We remember not because Christ was,

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.180
was sacrificed on the cross,

16
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:05.181
but because of a much more rational and arguably a justifiable cause,

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.050
man was redeemed quite simply because the son of God was able to resist the

18
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:15.000
temptations of Satan.
Man was redeemed because the sun was able to behave

19
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.360
rationally and,
and obedient lane.

20
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.780
And an unstated,

21
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.310
an unstated corollary here is that for paradise regained is that we can all,

22
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.550
we're all in a position to try to redeem ourselves.

23
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:33.240
And I think this is why Milton so scrupulously and carefully,
um,

24
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.720
refers to Jesus either as Jesus or the son,

25
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:41.070
the son of God and never and in paradise regained as,

26
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.840
as Christ.
Um,

27
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.400
of course we can't aspire to the status of Christ.
Uh,

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.250
which is this the,
the,
the,
the Greek word for Messiah,

29
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:54.450
which merely means the anointed one.
That's something that we can't be,

30
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.580
but all of us as Satan knows,
all of us are sons of God.
Um,
we,

31
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.280
we all have the capacity to do pretty much,
uh,

32
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.700
what the son of God had accomplished in paradise regained.

33
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.750
Now when we approach Samsung agonists,
Ds,

34
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:14.580
we realized pretty quickly that we have to toss aside immediately any

35
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.020
expectation that Milton,

36
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:20.800
we'll be writing a theodicy and attempt to justify the ways of God.
I,
it's,

37
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.450
it's,

38
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.450
it's impossible to imagine the justice or the rationality behind the primary

39
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.900
actions of this poem.

40
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.730
And the first question that I think we have to ask ourselves is,

41
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.890
is what could possibly have possessed Milton to have chosen Samson this,

42
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:43.650
that,
that famous biblical hero for the subject of his final work.

43
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.950
I'm just going to ask you for a moment to think about Samson as he appears in

44
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:54.750
the Old Testament.
The book of judges,
I think all,
all,
uh,

45
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.960
biblical scholars agree that the story of Samson had its origins in a,

46
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:05.311
in a primitive and savage set as Samsung was a giant who slayed Philistines with

47
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.050
the jaw bone and who attached firebrands to the tales of foxes.

48
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.620
Um,
in order to set whole city's on fire and the,

49
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.800
and the writer of the judge's version of this tale,
which comes much later.

50
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:21.310
Of course then the original tail itself,
it's a folk tale.

51
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.080
The judges,

52
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.080
the judges version has done very little to cleanse the tale of what we can think

53
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:32.890
of as its savagery to transform the tail into anything that we might think

54
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.170
appropriate for holy scripture.

55
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.470
And if the Old Testament Samsung can be said to possess,

56
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:42.370
possess any virtues that we would feel comfortable recognizing as virtues,

57
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.170
it would have to be Samson's complete abstinence from wine.

58
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.660
And a while it goes without saying that we all applaud,
um,

59
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.690
Samson's abstemious snus surely this abstinence from wine isn't enough in and of

60
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:00.280
itself sufficient,

61
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.790
a sufficient cause for Milton to turn what is essentially a terrorist ogre into

62
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:10.180
the,
into an orthodox hero fit for a Christian poem.

63
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.090
Now look at the front of the handout.
Um,

64
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.640
this is where I've reproduced the end of the judge's version of the Samson
story.

65
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.510
And this is so,
this is,
uh,
according to the Hebrew Bible,

66
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:27.190
this is the Samson's climactic actions at the Philistine Festival of day gone.

67
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.740
Uh,
you'll remember the Samson has been blinded.

68
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.741
He's been humiliated and he's being forced to make sport for the Philistines.

69
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.260
It's a side show or the main show and Samson Colden to the Lord and said,

70
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.520
oh Lord God,
remember me,
I pray thee and strengthen me.

71
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.480
I pray thee only this once.
Oh God,

72
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.970
that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines.
For my two eyes.

73
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.980
And Samson took hold of them to middle pillars upon which the house stood and

74
00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:01.390
upon which it was born,

75
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.100
of the one with his right hand and if the other with his left.
And Samson said,

76
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.800
let me die with the Philistines.

77
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.020
And he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the Lords and

78
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:18.750
upon all the people that were there in
Samson,

79
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.900
praise to God.
No,
it's true.

80
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.250
He prays to God.
But what?
Look what he prays for us.

81
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.560
He's praying for vengeance only.
This once,

82
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.180
let me Yvette be avenged upon the Philistine Samsung praise and and enact that

83
00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:36.920
can only be called a suicide.

84
00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:39.460
And it has been called a suicide for thousands of years.
Now,

85
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.430
Samson brings the house down.

86
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.330
The dominant impulses here are suicide and revenge,

87
00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:49.030
and by any ethical standard available to Milton,

88
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.100
this story has to be seen as as morally and ethically repugnant.

89
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.540
Now it's true that Milton does make some efforts to to clean the story up,

90
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.950
to purge the story of some of its most morally offensive elements.

91
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:08.240
And I think that's perhaps one of the reasons why you have all of that violent

92
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:10.250
rhetoric,
that language of purgation that I,

93
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.700
that I talked about in the last lecture,
but nonetheless,

94
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.810
we simply can't deny the fact that Samson does commit suicide and that the

95
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:22.811
suicide has this singularly satisfying effect of avenging the loss of Samson's

96
00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:25.034
eyes.

97
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.580
And what is so amazing about this poem is the Samson's final action and action

98
00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:35.220
that any right thinking Christian,

99
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.120
any right thinking anyone would would have to find ethically repellent.

100
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.100
This final action is it's approved of,
it's sanctioned,

101
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.790
it's sanctioned by God,
Samson's murderer,
his feelings,

102
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.880
his unseemly desire to get even all of these questionable motives are given a,

103
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.820
a vast divine blessing.

104
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.391
It's,
it's,
it's,

105
00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:04.740
it's shocking expression of what for what Freud would call wish fulfillment.

106
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.710
This final work of Milton seems from,
from a theological point of view,
from the,

107
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.980
from the religious perspective to counter just about everything of Milton's that

108
00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:17.730
we've read up to up to this point.
And that's because here every wish,

109
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.110
every desire,
all of those passionate and instincts that the,
the other works.

110
00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:25.080
We're laboring so hard to suppress.
Um,

111
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.300
all of these wishes just get fulfilled in this,
in this poem.

112
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.930
Now I'm not at all suggesting that Samson agonists,

113
00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:37.680
ds is wholly unrelated to Milton's other works and the,

114
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.740
that would be the last thing I would want to suggest.
Milton's,

115
00:07:40.741 --> 00:07:45.741
obviously I'm imagining the final action of this poem in relation to the

116
00:07:46.441 --> 00:07:49.830
climactic actions of his other two major works.

117
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.790
And he draws all three of his final works together by placing their central

118
00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:56.280
actions at high noon.

119
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.820
At mid day in paradise lost,
um,

120
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.740
eve falls at noon and Milton told us simply,
this is on the handout,

121
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:05.820
but it's also on the board.

122
00:08:05.821 --> 00:08:10.821
Milton tells us with exquisite economy she plucked she at

123
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.050
and with this extraordinary concision,

124
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:22.051
Milton narrated that act on earth that initiates the history of fallen man in

125
00:08:23.021 --> 00:08:27.130
paradise regained Milton describes the action that works really to undo the

126
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:32.110
effects of Eve's fall.
And that's the Sun's resistance,
his,

127
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.530
uh,
his resistance to Satan's temptation as opposed to his,

128
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.010
his giving into it as you've had.
And in narrating this event,

129
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.940
Milton alludes to the grammatical structure of that narrative.

130
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:47.941
Crux from paradise lost and he employs another sentence of four monosyllabic

131
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:53.050
words,
two of them,
two of them active verbs he said,
and stood

132
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.370
what the,
what was the transgressive action in paradise?
Lost is,

133
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.490
is redeemed through what could be seen as the sun's motionless inaction.

134
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.280
His resistance to action,
or at least is resistance to any,
uh,

135
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.410
any form of heroic action as it is typically conceived.

136
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:15.930
Now in Samson agonist,

137
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:20.580
these Milton simply can't resist the opportunity to complete this triad of

138
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:22.530
momentous actions and he can't resist the,

139
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.990
this opportunity to remind his readers,

140
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.440
us of his other two great major poems.

141
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.230
So when Samson pulls down the pillars of the temple,

142
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:34.620
Milton describes that action with just with a closely related grant,

143
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:38.880
grammatical construction forwards,
two of them verbs.
He tugged,

144
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.403
he shook.

145
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.560
And I want you to pause just for a moment and to think about how shocking

146
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.040
when we consider this sequence,

147
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:54.270
how shocking that sentences with this final catastrophic action.

148
00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.020
Milton seems to take back everything that the son of the son of God had

149
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:03.390
accomplished in paradise regained.

150
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:08.420
This has to be one of the most regressive conclusions in,

151
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.520
in all of,
in all of English literature,
the son of God,

152
00:10:11.521 --> 00:10:16.380
a devoted all four books of paradise,
regained to resisting action,

153
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.280
resisting vulgar,
militaristic,
violent action.

154
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:21.960
He simply did nothing.

155
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:24.750
And he was so adamant in his resistance that that Satan was led.

156
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.780
You'll remember to cry out with complete exasperations what does now in this

157
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:30.834
world?

158
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.130
And the answer to that question was that the sun does absolutely nothing in this

159
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.310
world,
or he does absolutely nothing except obey the will of God.

160
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.770
But his climactic high noon action,

161
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:46.710
Samson seems it's amazing.

162
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:49.500
Sampson seems also to be obeying the will of God,

163
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:54.501
but his action has a much stronger resemblance to that transgressive act of,

164
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.890
of the willful.
Eve Eve had followed her own desire.

165
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:03.720
She had followed her own instinct when she made the fatal decision to eat the

166
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:08.250
fruit.
And here at the end of Milton's career,
it says,
if Milton,
we're allowing,

167
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:10.830
allowing himself to,

168
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.160
to rethink perhaps the theological implications of Eve's,

169
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.583
uh,
action.

170
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:22.610
It's as if Eve's act were being reimagined this time as as a heroic one.

171
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:27.720
Eh,
in this remarkable exercise,
him in wish fulfillment,

172
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:31.830
Sampson gets to perform his eve like transgression,

173
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.850
but,
but with the big difference,
with the magical blessing of,
of,

174
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:39.900
of divine sanction,
he tugged,
he shook,

175
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.860
he performs an action at least as transgressive as the leaves,

176
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:47.730
but it's not followed by any of the hideous consequences of Eve's plucking and

177
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:51.000
eating it.
It's as if Milton were saying to God,

178
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:55.210
only this,
only this once,

179
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.680
let an action as bold as eaves meet with your approval.

180
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:01.933
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

181
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.240
<v 0>look at Milton's.</v>

182
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.360
Milton's description of the destruction of the temple.

183
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.580
This is line 1,643 of Samson agonists,

184
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:17.380
ds.
And it's that the bottom of page 590 of the Hughes,

185
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.810
according to the,
according to the Messenger who reports the event,
uh,

186
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.060
Samson tells the assembled the assembled Philistines in the,

187
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:32.500
in the huge theater now of my own accord,

188
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.240
such other trial,

189
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:39.241
I mean to show you of my strength yet greater as with a maze sheller strike

190
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.450
shall strike all who behold this uttered straining all his nerves.

191
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:51.540
He bowed as with the force of winds and waters pent when mountains tremble,

192
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.070
those two Massey pillars with horrible conversion to and fro.

193
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.730
He tugged,
he shook till down.

194
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:04.810
They came and drew the whole roof after them with burst of thunder

195
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.950
and,
and Milton's language here of this thunderous trembling,

196
00:13:09.951 --> 00:13:13.850
this horrible convulsion is the,
is essentially the language of uh,
of apocalypse.

197
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.690
He's imagining the scene of destruction as if it were something like something

198
00:13:17.691 --> 00:13:22.691
akin to the end of the world and the destruction of the temple functions here.

199
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:28.010
It's as if it were a type or a forerunner of God's final destruction of the

200
00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:30.140
world at the end of time.

201
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.300
Then now the Samsung story from the Old Testament is an event that clearly a co

202
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:40.080
that occurred before the son of God's redemption of man,
that,

203
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.270
that from the New Testament that Milton Milton depicts in paradise regained.

204
00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:49.450
But there's some and some remarkable sense in which this text describes an event

205
00:13:50.331 --> 00:13:55.331
in Christian history that happens after the events of paradise regained in a,

206
00:13:57.021 --> 00:13:59.440
in a strange and inverted kind of way.
Samson agonist,

207
00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:00.860
he's describes the fulfillment,

208
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:06.620
the culmination of the events that were,
uh,
that were laid out in paradise,

209
00:14:06.621 --> 00:14:09.170
regained.
And,
and you can see that these last,

210
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.430
they'll the last three work seem to sketch in something like chronological
order.

211
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.760
Even though the stories they tell themselves they're not in chronological order,

212
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.450
they sketch in chronological order,
the outlines of Christian history,

213
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:25.580
she plucked,
she ate,
we have a representation of the fall,
he said,

214
00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:29.630
and stood.
We have a representation of the redemption.
He tugged,
he shook.

215
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.780
We have something like a representation of the apocalypse and Samsung are going

216
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:40.130
to cities in some ways is imagining itself in terms of of the closure of a

217
00:14:40.131 --> 00:14:45.120
larger thematic pattern in Milton's literary career and,
and the,

218
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.590
and the amazing thing is the,
the,

219
00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:50.360
the astonishing thing about this final action is that it's so completely

220
00:14:50.361 --> 00:14:54.020
transgressive from any ethical or theological perspective.

221
00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:00.650
Look at line 1643 they're the first line.
I just read it the,

222
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:04.190
at the scene of the temple.
This is Samson now of my own accord.

223
00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:05.150
Such other strength.

224
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:10.151
I mean to show you what my strength yet greater such other trial,

225
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:11.780
I mean to show you of my strength,

226
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:16.781
yet greater Samson is in no way here attributing as we think,

227
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.180
as we think he should.

228
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.040
He's not attributing any of his strength or any of his actions to God.

229
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:25.440
This is the,

230
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.700
you remember the son of God was always hungering to do the father's will.

231
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:32.810
He was attributing everything and rightly so to the father.

232
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.130
But Samson doesn't Credit Jehovah with anything here.

233
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:42.260
He's not even claiming to perform this action for the greater glory of God.
And,

234
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.430
and I think it's impossible.

235
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.770
It is possible to read this as a,

236
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:52.670
as an entirely personal act of revenge.
And,
and,

237
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:56.150
and I'm personally convinced that Milton is alluding and these lines to that

238
00:15:56.151 --> 00:15:59.410
magnificent speech that Satan had made,
um,

239
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:01.190
just before the war in heaven.

240
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.720
This is the speech right after Satan had claimed to ab deal that he was self

241
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:09.590
[inaudible] self made by our own quickening power.
Um,

242
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.210
Satan had said to ab deal our presence,

243
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.580
our power,
our presence is our own.

244
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Our own right hand shall teach us highest deeds and in claiming to make a show

245
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:25.790
of strength solely of his own accord.

246
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.100
And Milt Milton Samson and a lot of ways seems to be echoing Milton Satan and

247
00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:34.070
he's,
he's reasserting Satan sublime.

248
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:38.240
But of course completely disastrous bid for something like an absolute self

249
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:39.150
sufficiency,
the D,

250
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.940
but there's a difference in the differences that Samson's claim to be entirely

251
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:44.960
self sufficient.

252
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.390
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

253
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.290
<v 0>just meets with all of God's approval.
It's the,
it's the damnedest thing.</v>

254
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.740
It's certain moments.
It almost seems as if the character of Samsung,

255
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:55.403
<v 1>okay,</v>

256
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.750
<v 0>is the character of Satan simply rewritten as the good guy</v>

257
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.200
now and reading Samsung agonists.
D's were,
we're witnessing something like an,
uh,

258
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:10.230
an incredible release from all of the laws and all of the constraints and all of

259
00:17:10.231 --> 00:17:14.430
the divine ordinances that Milton had been representing for us throughout the

260
00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:17.400
earlier works.
The,
the other poems from,

261
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:22.430
from comas on are all about the importance of the obedience to,

262
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.910
to law,
the obedience to divine law.
But Samson,
Samson agonists,

263
00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:31.500
these is all about God's special dispensation to break the law.

264
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.280
Um,
I think about it.
Samson is permitted to break the divine law,

265
00:17:35.281 --> 00:17:36.840
forbidding the marriage to a Philistine.

266
00:17:36.841 --> 00:17:40.890
He does this twice and he's permitted to break the law that forbids the presence

267
00:17:40.891 --> 00:17:44.370
of Hebrews at the festival,
at the Philistine Festival of day gone.

268
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.270
I'm Samson action.

269
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:51.440
Samson's action simply break through every conceivable legal and moral

270
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.240
constraints and,
and all of,
I mean,
why,
why does he get to do that?

271
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.230
All of Sampson's behavior,

272
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:02.220
I think has to ultimately to be laid at the door of God.
And in this case,

273
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:07.250
it's an unjustifiable or an irrational or inscrutable God.

274
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.880
Look at Samson's explanation of his first marriage.

275
00:18:11.881 --> 00:18:16.881
He was married before the marriage to Dolly law and this was his marriage to the

276
00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:21.330
woman of Timnah.
Look at line two 19 of Samson.

277
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:25.930
This is page five 57
and the Hebrews,

278
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.620
the Hebrews had a law against marrying outside of the tribe.

279
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:32.610
I'm still a big deal.
A lot many people would say,

280
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.680
and the chorus asks Samson why it is he doesn't marry a Hebrew wife.

281
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.300
I love this question.
Um,
the course asks,

282
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.570
why should style wed Philistia and women and Samsung responds?

283
00:18:47.571 --> 00:18:52.571
This is line two 19 the first I saw at Timnah and she pleased me,

284
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.100
not my parents,
that I sought to wed the daughter of an infidel.

285
00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:02.880
They knew not that what I motioned was of God I knew from intimate impulse and

286
00:19:05.471 --> 00:19:09.100
therefore urge the marriage on that bio occasion.
Hence,

287
00:19:09.101 --> 00:19:13.740
I might begin Israel's deliverance
and,
and,
and,

288
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:15.870
and I think we're being invited to ask,
well,

289
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:20.430
how did Samson know that he was motioned of God to marry the woman of Tim?

290
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.230
By what sign did God make this approval?

291
00:19:23.231 --> 00:19:28.231
Gnome and Samson Samson answers our question and his response is an important

292
00:19:28.271 --> 00:19:31.810
one.
I knew from intimate impulse,

293
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.650
wouldn't it be wonderful if we could answer questions like that with such an

294
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:40.870
answer?
Questions like that with such an answer.
Um,

295
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.230
I knew from intimate impulse,

296
00:19:43.231 --> 00:19:48.231
it's important because this phrase intimate impulse surely implies a sexual it

297
00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:50.581
passion,

298
00:19:50.581 --> 00:19:55.581
a sexual impulse as readily as it does anything like a mysterious impulsion from

299
00:19:55.891 --> 00:19:59.580
God.
And,
and,
and,
and,
and the big question still remains.

300
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:02.760
How can you tell the difference?
Sampson agonists,

301
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:07.761
Ds is the only one of Milton's last works to imagine a world in which God is

302
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:12.210
neither visible or audible.
On some level.

303
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:15.300
He had been visible in paradise lost and he was no longer visible.

304
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.050
He was audible and paradise regained.
And now he's,
now he's none of those things.

305
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.630
The deity simply doesn't assert himself anywhere,
um,

306
00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:26.730
authoritatively in this text.
And of course,

307
00:20:26.731 --> 00:20:29.280
that's one of the reasons why Milton chose to wrote this,
right?

308
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.490
This piece in the,
in a theatrical form,

309
00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:35.790
a dramatic form in which God couldn't possibly be seen as a character.

310
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.400
And the only evidence we have for the presence of the divine will at all is the

311
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:45.840
extremely equivocal evidence of Samson's intimate impulse.

312
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.600
Milton won't let us know absolutely whether Samsung is really inspired by God.

313
00:20:51.601 --> 00:20:55.420
You destroyed the Philistines or whether he just or whether he's crazy.

314
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:58.420
He just thinks he's inspired by God to kill the Philistines.

315
00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.610
And Milton knows that there's nothing like in controvertible evidence to prove

316
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:08.611
that Samson is a divinely inspired freedom fighter and a freedom fighter rather

317
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:15.520
than a terrorist or what seems at the end of the poem to be something,

318
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.040
I dunno,
we would have to call them something like a suicide bomber.

319
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.650
And this is why.

320
00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:24.530
This is why the critical controversies surrounding Samson agonists,
Geez,

321
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.710
a set of controversies that have been surrounding the poems for about 20 years

322
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:34.240
now.
Why they really came to a head almost immediately after,

323
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:35.500
after nine 11,

324
00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.890
the Milton can be seen to sanction a single man's destruction of thousands of

325
00:21:42.371 --> 00:21:47.270
people,
an act that might only be imagined to be divinely authorized.
Um,

326
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.690
when there is no evidence in the text that it's absolutely,

327
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:54.040
definitively divinely authorized head comed to see more troubling than ever.

328
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.200
Um,
after nine 11 and it,

329
00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.900
and of course Milton is not anywhere sanctioning mass slaughter,

330
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:05.890
but he is insisting that there's never anything in the world like definitive

331
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.610
proof of God's authorization of,
of anything.

332
00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:12.790
We just have to believe in our authorization.

333
00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:15.071
And it's,

334
00:22:15.071 --> 00:22:20.071
this is Milton's amazing resume reticence in this regard that has set off that

335
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.340
set off after nine 11,

336
00:22:21.341 --> 00:22:24.970
I kind of panic among certain Milton [inaudible] and John Kerry,

337
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:29.890
the distinguished Milton hissed at,
at Oxford,
uh,
the Milton hissed at Oxford.

338
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.630
Um,
and,
and you know this from the piece that was included in the packet.
Um,

339
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:38.150
even John Kerry had been pushed to,
uh,
I dunno,
I think a,

340
00:22:38.151 --> 00:22:42.760
a reasonable,
maybe even a hysterical critical stance toward this text,

341
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.093
uh,

342
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:49.650
by Milton's unwillingness to proclaim on the question of Samson's,

343
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.530
uh,
authority to,
to kill so many people

344
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.730
in Milton's other poems.

345
00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.760
And it goes without saying in the real world of all of our everyday lives,

346
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:09.420
one is simply not permitted to act upon all of one's in most impulses and

347
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:12.430
desires.
We're,

348
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.030
we're constantly being called upon to be rational and to resist those

349
00:23:16.031 --> 00:23:18.820
temptations for the greater goal of the obedience to the law.

350
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.580
The Sun in paradise regained what was able to begin his work of Israel's

351
00:23:24.581 --> 00:23:28.510
deliverance by,
by suppressing his hunger,
by suppressing his passion.

352
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.590
It was by suppressing even his interest in the beauty of classical civilization.

353
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:36.280
But,
but Samson who certainly in this text,

354
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:38.800
something like a type of Christ,

355
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.700
begins Israel's deliverance by acting on his hungers by,

356
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.780
by acting on his passions and desires that the intimate stirring of his loins

357
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.580
might be one of those things energizing his actions.
Uh,

358
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.080
Milton gives us in this poem up a powerful alternative,

359
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.610
a scandalous alternative to the traditional obligation to subordinate one's

360
00:24:01.611 --> 00:24:04.100
desire to the will of God.

361
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.670
And in this place and in this play and this text,

362
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.330
one's deepest ones,
darkest desire,

363
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:16.220
turns out in fact,
to be the will of God.

364
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.660
That's as shocking as anything else.
It seems to me.

365
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.610
Think of paradise lost.
Milton's great achievement in paradise lost.

366
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:27.290
And it really was a magnificent achievement,

367
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.950
was to structure the poem as a theodicy.
He took the,

368
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.910
what he took to be the irrational god of the Judeo Christian tradition,

369
00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:39.911
and he remade him into a reasonable and justifiable embodiment of law to a large

370
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:45.110
extent.
By the time we get to Samsung,
agonists sees it's,

371
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:50.150
it's almost as if you could feel Milton's relief,
a sigh of relief.

372
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:55.550
Uh,
now that he's been released from the pressure to write a theodicy,

373
00:24:55.551 --> 00:24:57.320
thank God you can hear Milton and saying,

374
00:24:57.321 --> 00:24:59.060
I don't have to ride it theodicy anymore.

375
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:02.420
I don't have to justify God anymore.

376
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:05.210
And at the here at the end of Milton's career,
you,
you,
you,

377
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:10.390
you have something like an extraordinary release from all of the strictures of

378
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.780
justice and all of the strictures of reason that Milton had set for himself and

379
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:16.640
that Milton had submitted himself to

380
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:22.820
according to the Aristotelian theory of,
of tragedy.

381
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.120
The climax of a tragedy is supposed to be the Cathar.

382
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.410
It's supposed to be Cathartic for the viewer.
Um,

383
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.860
or perhaps for the reader originally for the viewer,

384
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:39.370
it's supposed to purge or to release all of those pent up passions in the

385
00:25:39.561 --> 00:25:43.840
audience.
But I think there's a way in which the climax of Samson agonists,

386
00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:48.841
ds functions as much as a catharsis for the poet as it as it does for the

387
00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:55.260
reader.
Look,
look again,
look again at page five 91.
Uh,

388
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.780
this is line 1647.
I think we have an image here of the,

389
00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.530
of this cathartic release.
Um,

390
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.550
as it has been inscribed by Milton into the Po,
into the poem itself.

391
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.540
And within that passage that we just looked at at the very moment that Samson

392
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:16.541
acts of his own accord and brings the Massey pillars down here at line 1647,

393
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:23.110
as with the force of winds and waters pent when mountains tremble.

394
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:28.940
And then he tugged,
he shook,
uh,
w w when Samson,

395
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:33.840
when Samson Po pulls the pillars down,
it says,
if a damn we're breaking the,

396
00:26:33.841 --> 00:26:38.841
the force of winds and waters that have been pent or penned up have suddenly

397
00:26:39.381 --> 00:26:40.730
been released.
And you can see an emblem,

398
00:26:40.731 --> 00:26:44.400
I think for the powerful release that is allowing his own,

399
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:48.540
his own religious imagination.
Milton's water has broken.

400
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.550
And it's as if you were giving,

401
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.660
it's as if he were giving birth to yet another fantasy theology.

402
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:58.470
This theology just being that much more fantastic than anything he had come up

403
00:26:58.471 --> 00:26:59.304
with before.

404
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.270
And this is essentially a theology that Milton's contemporaries would have

405
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:06.180
called Antinomian.
Um,
he's,

406
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:11.330
he's generated a text in which divine will is an ever opposed to a human desire.

407
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.620
God's will and man's will or simply the same thing.

408
00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.590
A Nice,
nice,
nice work if you can get it.
Now there's there,
there,

409
00:27:22.591 --> 00:27:27.570
there has been another release in the miltonic imagination as well in uh,

410
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.990
in Samson show of strength at the festival of day gone.

411
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:35.310
You have an act of sacrifice that saves the Hebrews from their Philistine

412
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:40.410
oppressors and a,
and Samson's sacrifice at the temple has,

413
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.440
has to readers for a long time now.
And I think this seems unmistakable,
um,

414
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:48.480
has a resemblance to Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

415
00:27:48.481 --> 00:27:52.080
And a lot of biblical commentators in fact in Milton's time agreed that Samson's

416
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:55.720
action because his arms are outstretched,
um,
was something like a,
a,

417
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.470
a pre figuration of Christ's crucifixion.
And,

418
00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:03.660
and there's something like a sense in which Milton in this poem is allowing

419
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:08.250
himself and he's really allowing himself for the first time here near the end of

420
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:13.251
his life to represent this pivotal moment and Christian and Chris and Christian

421
00:28:13.531 --> 00:28:17.010
history,
the crucifixion,
um,
Milton,

422
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:22.200
like the Bible has Samson's arms outstretched on the Massey pillars as if

423
00:28:22.261 --> 00:28:26.670
indirect imitation of Christ posture on the cross.

424
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.260
Let look at the very beginning of the poem.

425
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.670
Actually look at the little place before the very beginning of the poem.

426
00:28:35.671 --> 00:28:37.860
This is Milton's note on the form of tragedy.

427
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.710
It's on page five 49 of the Hughes.

428
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.880
And this no starts to explain why Milton is writing has chosen this genre,

429
00:28:47.161 --> 00:28:52.050
the genre of tragedy,
dramatic tragedy for his final work.
Um,

430
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.590
and so was a Milton is,
is,

431
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.640
is laboring here to justify his decision to write a tragedy.

432
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.100
And he cites others who have written tragedies themselves.
Um,

433
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.650
this is a little over halfway down.
Um,
no,
no,
no.

434
00:29:05.651 --> 00:29:07.830
This is near the bottom of page five.
More 49.

435
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.950
Milton Invokes Augustus Caesar Augustus Caesar also had begun his Ajax,

436
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.330
his tragedy,
Ajax,

437
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:20.280
but I'm unable to please his own judgment with what he had begun.

438
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.930
Left it unfinished
look,
a couple of sentences down.

439
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:28.490
Milton invokes,
but true Gd and Greg Gregory Nausea Hanson,

440
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.270
Gregory nausea on Zinn who was able to finish a tragedy.
Gregory nausea hands.

441
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:37.830
And a father of the church thought it not unbuzz seeming the sanctity of his

442
00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:42.831
person to write a tragedy which he called entitled Christ suffering.

443
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.920
And I think it's clear that Milton is thinking of the genre of tragedy here is

444
00:29:47.921 --> 00:29:51.460
the literary form best suited to the subject of Christ's passion,

445
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.310
Christ's suffering on the cross.

446
00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:00.900
Milton of course we know had tried to represent Christ's suffering on the cross,

447
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.350
uh,
once before,

448
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:06.580
but just like Augustus Caesar who wasn't able to finish his tragedy,

449
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.500
Ajax,
the young Milton had left his initial attempt at the story of the passion

450
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.760
unfinished.

451
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:18.120
And perhaps you'll remember the little note that Milton had appended to that

452
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.180
early poem.
The Passion that we read at the beginning of the semester.

453
00:30:22.181 --> 00:30:24.100
The poem just ends abruptly.
You'll remember,

454
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:28.150
and Milton writes this subject of the crucifixion,

455
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.080
the author finding to be of the above the years he had when he wrote it and

456
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:34.150
nothing satisfied with what was begun.

457
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:40.290
Left it unfinished well here at the end of his life.

458
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.490
Finally,
Milton's finally able to finish the unfinished poem,

459
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.310
the Passion Samson Samson agonists.

460
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:52.720
These ends with that magnificent line and calm of mind.

461
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:55.480
All passion spent.

462
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.380
And that line speaks on one level to the fact it speaks on many levels,

463
00:30:59.381 --> 00:31:04.381
but on one level it speaks to the fact that Milton has finished the passion that

464
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:08.890
Milton has finally acquitted himself of the debt that he incurred when he left

465
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:12.100
that earlier poem,
the passion on finished.

466
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.660
Now we're left to wonder why Milton,

467
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.920
why is he able finally to represent an act of sacrifice,

468
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:24.040
not unlike Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

469
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:27.820
Why suddenly is this here to for unrepresented bell event?

470
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:29.910
Representable and,

471
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.220
and I think Milton is able to complete this representation of the crucifixion

472
00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:33.761
because he was at,

473
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:38.230
he's been able entirely to reimagine the dynamics of sacrifice.

474
00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.850
Now in the New Testament,
in the gospel of John,

475
00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:46.270
we're told that God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son to

476
00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:47.200
save that world.

477
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:52.030
The father willingly sacrificed the sun,

478
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.890
but in Samsung agonist,
he's the hero sacrifices himself.

479
00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:02.350
Samson sacrifices himself of his own accord as he tells us in fulfillment of his

480
00:32:02.351 --> 00:32:04.770
own private motives.
In fact.
And,

481
00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.280
and it's only once Milton can supply the act of sacrifice with something like a

482
00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:13.150
complete sense of self determination,
then he can finally,

483
00:32:13.151 --> 00:32:18.060
he can admit it into his poetic cannon.
I think this problem is,

484
00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:20.860
is completely overwhelmed by events that,
uh,

485
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:25.890
that had previously been left unfinished or suppressed in,

486
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.160
in Milton's earlier works.
And,
and,
and if I'm right about that,

487
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:35.161
we shouldn't be surprised to see that the resurfacing of another desire that had

488
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:39.890
so consumed Milton at earlier stages in his career.

489
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.190
And that is the desire for fame.

490
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.450
You remember what Milton had written to his friend,
Dia,

491
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.180
Dottie and 1637 Milton had written,
you asked me what I think,

492
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.950
what I'm thinking of,
so help me God.

493
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.850
So help me God and immortality of fame.
Uh,

494
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.400
th th the young 29 year old Milton had written,

495
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.380
but he soon corrected himself and enlisted us.

496
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:10.540
Fame was denigrated as that last infirmity of the noble mind and in paradise

497
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:14.600
regained its denigrated even further.
Fame was a temptation offered by,

498
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:16.850
by Satan to the son of God,

499
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:21.380
that of course the son of God was able to reject without wincing.
But here,

500
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.270
here at the end of Samson,

501
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:28.271
the prospect of earthly fame I'm talking about good old fashioned secular fame

502
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.740
is granted the dead Samson and it's granted to him without the slightest apology

503
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.151
and it's,

504
00:33:35.151 --> 00:33:40.151
and it Samson's earthly father Manoa who labors to ensure his son's fame.

505
00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:44.510
Look at the last page of the poem.
This is page five 93.

506
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:46.563
<v 1>Okay.</v>

507
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.540
<v 0>Uh,
Manoa,
says at the top of the page,</v>

508
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.830
I will send for all my kindred,
all my friends to fetch him.

509
00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.380
Him is the dead body of Samsung.

510
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:03.540
All my friends to fetch him hints and solemnly attend with silent obstacle and

511
00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:07.710
funeral train home to his father's house.

512
00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.770
And,
and I'll,
I'll,

513
00:34:10.771 --> 00:34:13.440
I'll interrupt myself here just for a moment because I'm going to ask you to

514
00:34:13.441 --> 00:34:18.060
think of the possible counterpoint that that line that I've just read has,
uh,

515
00:34:18.061 --> 00:34:22.170
with the,
with the end of paradise,
regained home to his mother house private.

516
00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:26.850
He returned.
Um Manoa,
continues there,

517
00:34:26.851 --> 00:34:31.851
will I build him a monument and plant it round with shade of Laurel Evergreen

518
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.760
and branching poem with all his trophies,

519
00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:40.290
hung and acts enrolled in copious legend or sweet lyrics song.

520
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.150
Now,
the shade of Laurel Evergreen is not,
uh,
is not an honor,

521
00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:48.730
typically bestowed upon the great biblical heroes,

522
00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:52.150
but it is an honor bestowed upon great poets,

523
00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:56.560
at least in the classical tradition.
That's why we have the phrase poet laureate.

524
00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.390
And you having this incredibly moving tribute that monster that Manoa has given

525
00:35:01.391 --> 00:35:04.510
Samson the promise of eternal fame.

526
00:35:04.511 --> 00:35:06.520
That has been the desire of great poets.

527
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:11.521
As long as there have been great poets that the monument built for Samson here

528
00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:15.700
is something like a displaced version of Milton's own monument.

529
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.920
Maybe this is a monument that can compete with the live long monument that

530
00:35:20.921 --> 00:35:25.330
shakes that Milton had imagined.
Uh,
that was the monument of Shakespeare,

531
00:35:25.331 --> 00:35:30.331
Shakespeare's tomb of which the young Milton had written in his first published

532
00:35:30.401 --> 00:35:33.330
poem.
Now,
as you can see,

533
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.490
as you can see from the bottom of the handout,

534
00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.540
from the passage from one of the earliest biographies of Milton,

535
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:43.830
and this is also included in the Hughes.
Milton at his death was,
was,

536
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.320
was buried at the churchyard at cripple gate.

537
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.280
We're about 30 years before he had by chance also in turn his father

538
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.080
like,
like,
like Samson's body.
At the time of his death,

539
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:02.250
the body of John Milton was returned as it were,

540
00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.380
home to his father's house.
Now we're told here very,

541
00:36:07.381 --> 00:36:09.750
very carefully that this happened by chance,

542
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.030
but it's surely not a leap to assume that Milton was himself responsible for the

543
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:17.250
instructions,
uh,
of,
uh,

544
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:21.330
for his place of burial and that he was thinking on some level of the burial of

545
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:22.980
Samsung when,

546
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.660
when he arranged him to have himself buried next to his father or near his

547
00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:30.570
father.
It's as if by returning to the father's house,

548
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:35.571
Milton could guarantee for himself the promise of fame that had been bestowed

549
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:41.900
upon Samson.
Look at the middle quotation on the handout as a,

550
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.120
as John Aubrey wrote in his life of Milton,

551
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.290
Milton had during his lifetime achieved a considerable measure of fame.

552
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:53.860
He didn't have to wait.
Uh,
he didn't have to wait for after his death.

553
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.370
And according to Aubrey for several forerunners,
and I love this detail,

554
00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:01.750
it's wild to imagine for a lot of foreigners coming over it into England in the

555
00:37:01.751 --> 00:37:02.800
17th century,

556
00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:08.680
the only inducement to make the trip was to see John Milton.

557
00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:12.850
And more specifically the inducement for foreigners to come to England was to

558
00:37:12.851 --> 00:37:17.710
see the house and chamber where he was born.
It's like a tourist attraction,

559
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:23.020
uh,
this as of course,
the father's house and in his life,
Milton,

560
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.700
Milton's,
the,
the,
the Milton home had become this,

561
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:29.740
this,
uh,
this,
this Mecca,

562
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.300
just like the one that Manawa is planning the planning for,
for,
for Samson.

563
00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:41.050
Now,
one of the reasons I think,
uh,

564
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:45.670
one of the reasons for which we love or for which we hate the Po,

565
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.010
the poetry or there any,

566
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.080
anything about John Milton involves the degree to which he wrote about himself.

567
00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.420
And Milton,
I think more than any other poet,

568
00:37:55.450 --> 00:38:00.010
certainly any other poet before him has invited,
uh,

569
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:05.410
I think a unique fascination with the intimate habits of his mind.

570
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:07.900
And,
and,
and for some of us even,
uh,

571
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.010
as a unique fascination in his daily life at home.

572
00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.650
And,
and I think the desire of Milton's readers are a lot of Milton's readers to

573
00:38:17.651 --> 00:38:22.020
imagine the poet at home,
um,
is,
is,
is,
is a,

574
00:38:22.021 --> 00:38:23.140
is an interesting one.

575
00:38:23.141 --> 00:38:27.100
And at least that's one way to explain the strange and for me the wonderful

576
00:38:27.101 --> 00:38:29.770
artifact that I photocopied for you.
And it's on the other side of the,

577
00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.020
it's on the other side of the handout.
This is a document that I used to,

578
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.030
it's a version of a document that I used to receive every couple of years,
um,

579
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.790
from the friends of Milton's cottage,
a group in America.

580
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.550
And this is the form letter representing the,

581
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:51.570
the now longstanding movement to raise funds in order to restore what is the

582
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:55.570
only surviving house,
uh,
that,
that Milton actually lived in.

583
00:38:55.571 --> 00:38:59.800
And it's something like,
you know,
uh,
Milton's cottage.com you can,
you can,

584
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:04.630
you can find information about how to get there and so on and so forth if you're

585
00:39:04.631 --> 00:39:05.464
interested.

586
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:10.180
This is the cottage at childfund St Giles that Milton had moved to in the 1660s

587
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:14.340
when the,
when the plague was sweeping through London and,

588
00:39:14.341 --> 00:39:18.400
and the organization dedicated to restoring this house is known as the friends

589
00:39:18.401 --> 00:39:22.740
of Milton's cottage.
And the president of this group,
as you can see,
was,
um,

590
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:27.130
I don't believe he's the president anymore,
was one,
uh,
Dr. Ronald G.
Shaffer.

591
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.820
And He,
and he's,
he used to send Milton lists,
just this,

592
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.770
this fundraising letter every few years.
And I,
I mentioned this,

593
00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:39.940
this curious artifact,
not at all because I'm asking you to give to the,

594
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.400
to the cause.
I think the cottage is probably in good shape at this point.
Um,

595
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.130
but I,
I get,

596
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:50.130
I offer it to you to give you a sense of the peculiar impact that John Milton

597
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:51.430
has had on his readers.

598
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:57.550
And I think that impact can be measured by something like the almost pagan

599
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:02.551
desire to memorialize the physical presence of this heroic poet that has seized

600
00:40:04.121 --> 00:40:06.610
so many have his readers.
Now of course,

601
00:40:06.611 --> 00:40:10.660
the ostensible project here as you can see from the handout is simply to restore

602
00:40:10.661 --> 00:40:14.800
Milton's home.
But I'm convinced that there's something there.

603
00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.620
There's something profound or going on and it's a,
it's,
it's,

604
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:20.320
it's the deeper project,
um,

605
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.890
informing the Labor of Labor,
a labor of love,

606
00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:25.960
like a restoration projects such as this one.

607
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:30.520
And I think that the underlying desire really behind such a project is,

608
00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.660
and of course this would only be unconscious or it's a kind of fantasy project,

609
00:40:34.661 --> 00:40:39.661
but it's the desire to return Milton to his home that the friends of Milton's

610
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:46.261
cottage or just like the friends that Manawa mentions in that final speech at

611
00:40:46.301 --> 00:40:49.330
line 1730,
I will send for all my kindred,

612
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.670
all my friends to fetch him,

613
00:40:51.671 --> 00:40:55.240
hence home to his father's house.

614
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:59.530
And I think it was just,
I,
I,
it,
it chokes me up.
There's something.

615
00:40:59.531 --> 00:41:04.531
So moving about Mona was plea and there's something for me moving about doctor

616
00:41:04.841 --> 00:41:08.140
Ronald g Schaefer's a plea.
And that's,

617
00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.130
and the relation for me at least is,
is that there's,

618
00:41:11.131 --> 00:41:16.131
there's something about Milton just as there's something about Samson that

619
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:22.600
resists ascension.
Resist transcendence despite all of the talk of heaven.

620
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.390
The actual corporeal body seems so stubbornly to,

621
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.200
to remain,
uh,

622
00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:33.070
that you remember that that was the case enlisted us to a large extent and it's

623
00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.700
this case in the,
in the final poem as well written,
written 30 years later.

624
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:43.310
And I think there's something profoundly miltonic about our own materialist

625
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.720
interests in,
in Milton and interest that keeps coming back,

626
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:51.410
keeps coming back to the bodily facts of his life and his home and his everyday,

627
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.960
everyday surroundings,
but more generally than that.

628
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:58.610
And more importantly than that,
um,
an interest in the material facts,

629
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:00.080
the fact of materiality,

630
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:04.040
of everyone's life and of life itself,

631
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.200
the importance,
the value and the beauty of the physical is one of the things,
uh,

632
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.710
that we,
that we learned that we get from a reading of,
of John Milton.

633
00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:19.340
Now,
if I have been,
if I have been unorthodox and some of these lectures and IB,

634
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.310
uh,
deeply ashamed to think that I haven't been at least a little over the top,

635
00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:26.450
um,
it's been in my sharing with you,
uh,

636
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.850
my fascination with Milton's life.
Then Milton's biography or,
um,

637
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:34.310
with,
uh,

638
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:39.640
well actually I think it's my interest in Milton's own extraordinary tendency to

639
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:43.070
write autobiographically.
Um,

640
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:48.190
there's an unparalleled self absorption at the heart of Milton's writing and

641
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.920
this sublime self absorption.
I think,
um,

642
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.700
of of so many of these texts demand some sing,

643
00:42:55.701 --> 00:43:00.701
like an equally passionate absorption in the life of the person who authored

644
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:02.600
those texts,

645
00:43:02.601 --> 00:43:06.800
like the foreigners who traveled to England during Milton's own lifetime.

646
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:10.220
I have found myself pursuing Milton with a kind of,
and maybe it's creepy,

647
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:14.150
maybe it's not.
You can,
you can decide,
but with a certain voyeurism,
um,

648
00:43:14.151 --> 00:43:15.840
it's something in me has always wanted to,

649
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.920
to peer into Milton's house and chamber or at least to think of these poems in

650
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:25.280
some way as Milton's house and chamber.
And if I've managed to,

651
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:30.340
to arouse in you even the slightest tendency to this sort of critical voyeurism,

652
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:33.980
then on some level I feel that I will have a,

653
00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.330
that I will have accomplished something.
And so I want to end this semester by,

654
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.760
by thanking you for the enormous efforts that you put into this class for

655
00:43:41.761 --> 00:43:44.300
electric class.
I know that this requires,
um,

656
00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:49.380
a lot of work and I want to thank you more generally for the work that you have

657
00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:51.710
performed.
Um,
and I,

658
00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:56.570
I take this work to be the intellectual equivalent of the restoration project

659
00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.300
undertaken by Doctor Ronald g Schaefer.
Um,

660
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:03.530
the work that you've performed in restoring the greatest,

661
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:08.300
if not the home,
then the greatest of all English poets,
um,
himself.

662
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.470
So I will see you all.
I will see you all at the exam.
But before,

663
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.760
before I sign off,

664
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:18.890
we have to think our two perfectly magnificent teaching fellows who I am going

665
00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:22.220
to embarrass by asking them to stand up just so we can applaud them and

666
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:24.620
acknowledge them.
David Chlorella and Matt build ideas.
