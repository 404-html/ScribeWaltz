1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.370
We've been looking for the,
for the,

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.350
for the last few lectures at the ethics and the theology that have throughout

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:09.570
paradise lost been produced.

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.230
At least this has been my argument been produced and sanctioned by Milton's

5
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.180
narrator.
And so we learned for example,

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.390
both from the narrator and also from Raefiel that eve is inferior to Adam and on

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:24.570
the authority of the narrator and of Raefiel,

8
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:27.870
the social hierarchy of Eden is established as what we can think of as the,

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.300
this is what also I've been arguing,
um,

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.620
it's been established as the dominant discourse of the poem.

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.970
And we can think of this as the poems official doctrine if a poem can be said to

12
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.140
have an official doctrine,

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.590
but there's obviously so much more to paradise lost then the official discourses

14
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.380
of Raphael and the narrator.
The poem seems continually,

15
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.850
and this is also what I've been arguing,

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.060
continually opening up spaces for ideas other than the official sanctioned

17
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.530
language of the narrator that the angel wrap you'll,
you'll remember was,

18
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.700
was eager to assert the hierarchical or hierarchical worldview when the,

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.440
when the narrator was speaking

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.050
about Adam [inaudible] when the narrator was speaking about Adam and eve.

21
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.450
But as we saw last time,
uh,

22
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.480
Raffia was willing to loosen the constraints of the notion of hierarchy when he

23
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:24.740
was pondering the subject of astronomy.
Rafiel is,

24
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.750
astronomy was marked really wonderfully by a lot of doubt and uncertainty.

25
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:35.130
And he refused to determine whether a Ptolemy was right or whether Copernicus

26
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:35.551
was right.

27
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:39.690
And there's a way in which the poems doubt about one kind of hierarchy,
uh,

28
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:43.590
seem to bleed over into the other forms of hierarchy with which the poem was

29
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:46.920
also concerned that that was essentially the phenomena.

30
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:51.921
That's a little recap of the last lecture now so far in paradise lost,

31
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.520
uh,

32
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.520
that the tension between the poems official line and what we can think of is

33
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.810
it's more subversive strains.

34
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.640
This tension has surfaced in paradise lost in a kind of contrapuntal fashion.

35
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.290
One position is simply juxtaposed without comment,

36
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.980
uh,
juxtaposed with another.
Um,
but the poem itself never,

37
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.240
never seems explicitly in any way to acknowledge the presence of the conflict or

38
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:21.990
the presence of the contradiction.
That is,

39
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:24.870
the poem doesn't seem to acknowledge the presence of the conflict or

40
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.010
contradiction until now until book nine.
Book Nine,

41
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:33.780
which is the book of the fall is structured by I think a far more explicit

42
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.670
opposition of that official,
the,

43
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:41.130
the dominant discourse on the one hand and a much more open ended critique of

44
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:42.570
that discourse on the other.

45
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.400
And the stark opposition between these two competing positions is manifest

46
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:50.490
explicitly for me,

47
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.030
is manifest explicitly in the argument between Adam and Eve,

48
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.750
the morning of the fall,
uh,
before their separation.

49
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.603
But

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.270
before we actually look at the content of that absolutely remarkable argument,

51
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.721
it's,
it's,

52
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.721
it's worth musing on the fact that Adam and eve are having an argument at all.

53
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.010
It's,
it's amazing for the,

54
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.080
for that matter that they're actually conversing in the conversation between

55
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.360
Adam and eve before Eve's departure to work alone.

56
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.630
We have what I think has to be the first conversation on earth,

57
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.690
the first genuine dialogue,
a conversation that,
well there,

58
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.250
there may be a very brief exception in book five,
but we're,
we'll set that aside.

59
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.430
A conversation that involves two individuals who do not already have in mind the

60
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:44.620
content of the other speech,
a conversation.

61
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.390
And of course I'm thinking of all of the conversations that we have or that you

62
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:50.410
have with one another,

63
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.370
is a conversation that possesses at least some element of epistemological

64
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:56.470
uncertainty,
an element of surprise,

65
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.560
the inability to know exactly what the other person is going to say before he

66
00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:03.580
says it.
Now,
Milton,
up to this point,

67
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.040
has it been able to represent anything like this genuine dialogue?

68
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.910
Um,
there,
there are some exceptions,

69
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.970
maybe the dialogue between Satan and ab deal during the war in heaven,

70
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.540
but on earth it's not so clear,
uh,
before this moment,

71
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:21.541
all language is more or less ceremonial or ritualistic utterance.

72
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.350
Uh,
so I'm,

73
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.280
let's think of the father and the son in the dialogue and heaven in book three,

74
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:30.730
the father's Omniscience,
the fact that he knows everything,

75
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.950
it makes dialogue absolutely impossible.

76
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:35.260
He always knows in advance with the sun is going to say,

77
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.150
and even with Adam and eve,
um,
but before book nine,
um,

78
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.373
<v 1>yeah,</v>

79
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.560
<v 0>Adam and eve seem to know in advance in some way the content of the other
speech.</v>

80
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.800
And so Adam will be getting a speech and this happens all the time with some

81
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.230
variation of this little formula.
Uh,

82
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.730
well thou knowest eve that blah,
blah,
blah.
Of course,
you know this eat,

83
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.940
but I'm going to say it,
I'm going to say it anyway and,

84
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.340
and an evil tell Adam that day.
I often remember.

85
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.090
And then she will proceed to tell him something that presumably that she's

86
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:10.620
already told them a number of times before conversation before this point has

87
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:15.540
been ritualistic.
It's been ceremonial and it is essentially unnecessary,

88
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.570
uh,
in the,
in these early parts of the poem.

89
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.390
But the dialogue between Adam and eve at the scene of their separation is,

90
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.290
is really different from the ceremonial utterances.

91
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:31.740
They're there for the first time.
They're speaking speak speeches from uh,

92
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.770
alien perspectives with purposes and intentions that are foreign to one another.

93
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.100
They sound,
they seem to us,
uh,
familiar.

94
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:44.700
We recognize we recognize these people and in this conversation,

95
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.060
and it's actually an argument as much as it is a conversation,

96
00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:51.780
Milton is giving us an emblem.
Finally,

97
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.000
I think an emblem of what this poem has been doing all along this poem has been

98
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.170
arguing with itself.
The,

99
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.170
the dominant and official language of hierarchy has been pitting itself against

100
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.670
the questioning of subversive language of equality.
And,

101
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:10.070
and here in this conversation,

102
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.700
Milton gives a dramatic shape to what has been here too,

103
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:18.560
for the abstract,
the intellectual conflict that had so textured,

104
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.530
uh,
so many of the earlier books.
And so here in book nine,

105
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.950
at the moment of the separation between Adam and eve,

106
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:28.340
we can see these two worldviews,
these two enormous,

107
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.260
uh,
the ways in which paradise lost thinks,
um,

108
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.910
separate almost to the point of,
of absolute in compatibility.

109
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.420
And whether this,
uh,

110
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.230
whether this divergence will be merely a separation or whether it will be an

111
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:48.200
actual divorce.
Um,
I think is an open question.

112
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.790
Now you can think of Milton assigning faces here in book nine,
uh,

113
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.310
two to a lot of these positions that have fear to for Ben Abstract.
Um,

114
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:02.660
Adam represents in this dialogue the nervous voice of the poems,

115
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.950
Orthodoxy and Eve represents the questioning voice,

116
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:11.410
the voice that questions or critiques that Orthodoxy.
And,
and,

117
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:15.080
and to his credit,
and Milton's not often given credit for this,

118
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.520
he goes out of his way to lend a certain authority to eaves critique.

119
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:22.400
And he does so by structuring her argument as a retrospective,

120
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.810
something like a retrospective of his own career as a radical polemicist.

121
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.250
So eve takes up the role of the radical Milton in this,

122
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.500
in this scene.

123
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.660
She's put in the strange and utterly fascinating position of quoting Milton,

124
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.410
quoting the younger Milton.

125
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:44.410
And you have something like a recap in this speeches of eve here in this

126
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:49.280
discussion with Adam,
a recap of the great moments in this writer's work.

127
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.420
Now,
the first subject of their discussion involves the topic that has been

128
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:57.920
absolutely central and we know this,
uh,
to Milton throughout his career.

129
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:00.710
And this is the subject of work or labor,

130
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.340
the essentially the value of human activity.
Um,

131
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:08.930
and so the ostensible premise for the separation of Adam and eve on the morning

132
00:08:08.931 --> 00:08:13.190
of the fall is Eve's desire to work separately from Adam.

133
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:15.140
Eve is arguing that they will be more productive,

134
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.830
there'll be more productive if they divide their labors.
And,
and,

135
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.950
and so think of the ways in which this resonates for us.

136
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.990
Milton has been juxtaposing for years.

137
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:28.160
The two accounts of the value of labor that he had found in the New Testament,

138
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.970
the parable of the workers in the vineyard and the parable of the talents.

139
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:37.210
And as early as Sonnet a sonnet seven written when Milton was 23 or 24,

140
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.980
he was depicting scenarios in which those two parables could be seen to argue

141
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:47.810
with one another on justice question on the value and the importance of labor.

142
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.680
And so while the parable of the talents seemed to be chiding Milton for,

143
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.050
for not working hard enough and not working fast enough,

144
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:57.720
the parable of the workers in the vineyard seemed to assure him in some way that

145
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:02.721
he didn't need to work quite so hard that God didn't require his incessant and

146
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:07.320
laborious efforts.
Um,
it's a,
it's a,

147
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:12.321
it's a measure of just how difficult Milton wants it to be for us to adjudicate

148
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.150
between Adam and eve in this,

149
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.650
in this book that he casts their argument in the injustice language,

150
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.200
the language of political economy about work.

151
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.030
It's an argument that involves all of the implications.
I think of those two,

152
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.830
what are from Milton,
those two highly charged parables now,

153
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.170
I think it's almost impossible for us to come to this scene without some

154
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:41.070
assumption that that eve is wrong.
We assume this and we're,
you know,

155
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:45.170
it's understandable.
We assume that because eve we'll as we know,
we will,

156
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:48.570
we'll go on to disobey the prohibition of the fruit that she must,

157
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:52.350
therefore at this point on some level be wrong.

158
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.740
There's something some way mistaken,
uh,
during this conversation.

159
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.440
But Milton Milton,

160
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.620
Milton takes some amazingly interesting steps,

161
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:05.670
I think to counter what he knows will be our immediate assumptions.

162
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:10.020
And he attempts to count or counter our assumptions by allowing eve to voice

163
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:15.021
that position in the dialogue that most look most closely resembles the parable

164
00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.260
of the talents.
So,
uh,

165
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.300
look at page three 83 in the Hughes.

166
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.420
This is booked nine line 201

167
00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:32.373
<v 2>yeah.</v>

168
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.490
<v 0>So a book line in book nine,
line 201.
First of all,
it's the narrator.</v>

169
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.130
It's the narrator here who's opening the subject of work.

170
00:10:40.131 --> 00:10:41.270
This is line two oh one.
He's,

171
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.840
he's discussing the topic of conversation between Adam and Eve at the beginning

172
00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:49.320
of their day.
They commune,
they converse,
they calm you,

173
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:53.030
and how that day they may best,
they best may apply.

174
00:10:53.031 --> 00:10:55.310
They're growing work for much.

175
00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:58.040
Their workout grew the hands dispatch of,

176
00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:00.350
to gardening so wide.

177
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.870
So we learned from the s the official perspective of the narrator here that eve,

178
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:10.060
we'll have children.
This is incredibly consequential information,
uh,
that,

179
00:11:10.061 --> 00:11:13.850
that she was to have children even before the fall.
And we learned,

180
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.970
we learned that even before they have children.

181
00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:21.971
This garden demands an extraordinary amount of work from Adam and eve that the,

182
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.340
that the garden seems in some way to be actually spinning out of control.

183
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.440
This is,
this is a,
this is a nightmare landscape from,
from,
uh,

184
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.410
from the perspective of a,
of a house owner.
Um,
I,

185
00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:38.000
I think this passage is important because it's the narrator here who validates

186
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.140
eaves initial position in this first speech.

187
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:45.320
So eve suggests that when Adam and eve worked together,

188
00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:48.740
they're affectionate looks.
They're absolutely adorable.

189
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.400
Smiles distract each other from their labor.
Uh,

190
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:57.340
this is line 23 of book nine.
So all of those intervening looks and smiles.

191
00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:02.341
She argues intermit intermit our day's work brought to little,

192
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.930
there'll be gone early and the hour of supper comes on,

193
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.520
earned
our intermit,
our day's work,

194
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:16.480
brought to little,
there'll be gun early and the hour of supper comes unearned.

195
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.350
Eve as clearly embraced the Protestant work ethic.
And,

196
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:23.620
and she displays an intuitive grasp of the importance of the parable of the

197
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:24.370
talents.

198
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:29.020
God only rewards those who exert themselves or who invest their talent in an

199
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:31.400
activity.
And it's,
it's,

200
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.140
it's impossible not to ascribe to eve at least some of the authority that's

201
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:37.900
attached to the parable of the talents here.
Now,

202
00:12:37.901 --> 00:12:40.960
Adam counters eve with some,

203
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.290
some version of the parable of the workers in the vineyard,
uh,

204
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:49.000
claiming that there's more to work than simple productivity.
This is line two 42.

205
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.930
Adam's talking for not to Erc some toil,
but to delight.

206
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.140
He made us and delight to reason joined for Adam.

207
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:02.830
One is still serving God.
When one takes pleasure in one's in one's work.

208
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.920
The important lies more in the willingness to serve and not in the actual amount

209
00:13:08.561 --> 00:13:13.510
of of work that's been accomplished or in the amount of stuff that's been

210
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:14.051
produced.

211
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:18.280
And Milton himself was obviously always wanting to take Adam's side in this

212
00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:22.450
debate,
but he seems to have been continually fearful,

213
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:24.970
at least this is my assumption that eve was right,

214
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.210
that God requires our continual labor.

215
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.880
You can also hear Milton making a distinction between eve zeal for labor and his

216
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:38.020
own efforts in,
in writing this very writing,
this very poem,

217
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:43.021
Milton's poem we remember had been long in choosing but beginning,

218
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:48.670
late,
long and choosing,
but beginning late like the workers in the vineyard,

219
00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.740
Milton doesn't get around to writing the poem until late in his literary career.

220
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.400
And Eve's Labor is,
is uh,
is begun early.

221
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.350
And there's even the sense here that beginning early isn't good enough for,

222
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.950
for eve,
she seems to be pushing to get up even earlier and to work even harder.

223
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.000
Eaves is the modern voice of,
of workplace efficiency.

224
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.320
She supplies the voice of conscience.
That child's not only Adam,

225
00:14:14.321 --> 00:14:18.010
but the voice of conscience.
That seems always to be chiding the poet,

226
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.940
the poet himself.
Now Adam,
surely Adam is right.

227
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.350
We have to hand it to him.

228
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.680
He's right in arguing that they are not in a position to earn their suppers as

229
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:31.260
if they were merely wage laborers.
That's not how it were.

230
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.100
Milton's Milton's even works.

231
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.340
None of their labor actually goes into the harvesting or the production of food.

232
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.920
They're flat,
they're fed plenty.
But that's because the fruits,

233
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.960
I'm simply land in their hands.
Um,

234
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.240
the work that they perform is all entirely ornamental.
It's ornamental gardening,

235
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.310
pruning,
cutting back,
propping up.
It's,

236
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:56.870
it's never productive in any kind of economic sense or quads.
Economic Sense.

237
00:14:56.871 --> 00:15:01.871
Their gardening is merely a virtuous activity that is entirely divorced from the

238
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:05.150
demands of productivity or the demands of,
of nourishment.

239
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.200
So Adam is right and,
but,
but while Adam is right in a certain sense,

240
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:13.730
he doesn't address directly the problem that the narrator himself has already

241
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:14.564
acknowledged.

242
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.690
And that's the problem that the garden seems to be growing at a faster rate than

243
00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:23.930
Adam and eve are able to manage.
It's a,
this is amazing.
Look at line.

244
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:29.230
Look at line 205 this is where eve notes how excessive the growth patterns seem

245
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:36.680
to be in,
in in paradise.
So Adam Eve to Adam,

246
00:15:36.681 --> 00:15:41.450
Adam,
well maybe w well may we labor still to dress.

247
00:15:41.451 --> 00:15:46.451
This garden's still to tend plant herbs and flower are pleasant task and joined

248
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.380
but till more hands eight us to work under our labors grows luxurious by

249
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:58.520
restraint.
What we buy day Lop,

250
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.550
overgrown or prune or prop or bind one night or two with wanton growth.

251
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:07.550
Derides tending to wild.

252
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.800
And I think eve here makes an absolutely central argument and it's not an

253
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:13.530
argument that a,

254
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.400
that Adam counters and I think it's not an argument that Adam would even be

255
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:17.660
capable of countering.

256
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.430
And that's the idea that the garden is on some level growing out of control,

257
00:16:22.431 --> 00:16:27.431
that the vegetation is literally here tending to wild and it's tending to wild

258
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:32.870
because Adam and eve are continually cutting it back.

259
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.870
That's their pleasant task and joined the work under our labors grows luxurious

260
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.100
by restraint.

261
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:45.380
So eve isn't simply describing natural growth patterns in the garden.

262
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.810
She's examining the effects on nature of the imposition of culture.

263
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:52.340
And we're reminded here of the,

264
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:57.020
of the etymological a origin of our notion of culture,

265
00:16:57.021 --> 00:17:01.830
which involves the cultivation of the land.
Uh,
it's an agricultural metaphor.
And,

266
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.870
and in this respect,

267
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:08.770
eve can be seen to articulate something like a theory of culture.

268
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.860
Enter theory has everything to do with the,
our understanding of the fall,

269
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.480
not as a theological problem,

270
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:19.280
but our understanding of the fall as a cultural problem.
According to Eve,

271
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:23.420
the garden is,
is wilding,
it's growing disobedience,

272
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.780
but it's not growing disobedient out of any natural necessity.

273
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.790
But because of Adam and Eve's cultural imposition of restraining,

274
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:36.530
its that pruning and propping and lopping and binding,
and if left to itself,

275
00:17:36.531 --> 00:17:40.640
for all we know,
who knows,
I think this is a perfectly reasonable scenario.

276
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.240
If left to itself the grow,
the garden might actually grow at a reasonable,

277
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.910
moderate,
orderly pace.

278
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.830
But this new disorderliness in the garden,

279
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:54.831
this wildness seems to be the result of the unnatural cultural attempt to

280
00:17:56.941 --> 00:18:01.380
restrain that natural order.
So think,

281
00:18:01.381 --> 00:18:03.060
think of what the sink,
think of what this is.

282
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:08.061
God's God's command to Adam and Eve to restrain the garden is on some level a

283
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:13.980
miniature version of is much more consequential commandment to refrain from

284
00:18:13.981 --> 00:18:16.080
eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge.

285
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:21.081
And I think that even this speech presents us with a reading of the significance

286
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.370
of the more important commandment.

287
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:28.710
But of course this is a reading that is incredibly subversive and that's why we

288
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:32.400
rely so much on eve when we read this poem.
She's the,

289
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.700
she is so magnificently the voice of the subversive,

290
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:41.040
the imposition of law,
if I'm reading eve correctly here,

291
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.160
the imposition of law doesn't control disorder.

292
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.590
It produces disorder that there's a sense in which the arbitrary interdiction of

293
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:54.591
the fruit sets in motion and inexorable process whereby the interdiction has to

294
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:57.470
be broken and they're there.

295
00:18:57.471 --> 00:19:01.050
This is obviously a sense of the fall that Milton cannot permit,
uh,

296
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:05.310
within the official parameters of the,
uh,
of the poems dominant doctor.

297
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:08.130
And even though it,
this theory,

298
00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:12.990
even subversive theory does come actually rather close to a number of Paul's

299
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:15.460
statements in the epistle to the Romans.
Um,

300
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.770
but officially in the poem that the fall is an act of free will.

301
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.220
It's a Freeling undertaken choice.

302
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.510
But according to Eve's embedded prophecy of the fall,
there's,

303
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.100
which is what I take this to be,

304
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.630
there's no such thing really as free will.

305
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.960
The father's prohibition seems to necessitate in some way their disobedience in

306
00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:42.660
the same way that pruning a tree and we know this to be a fact pruning a tree

307
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:45.540
forces or necessitates new growth.

308
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.270
It's almost as if eve we're suggesting that there was something like a,

309
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:53.190
an organic natural necessity to the fall.

310
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.380
Now I think that's,

311
00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.380
that's one way in which Milton looks back at his former interest in work at the,

312
00:20:00.811 --> 00:20:02.220
at his former interest in those,

313
00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:06.660
the interaction of those two parables and he's bending their implications in

314
00:20:06.661 --> 00:20:09.750
their meanings,
um,
in an entirely new way here.

315
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.420
But there's another way in which the separation dialogue looks back at and

316
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:19.770
essentially uses the essential material from Milton's earlier career.

317
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.980
And this is Eve's staggeringly brilliant deployment of the central argument from

318
00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:32.190
area epigenetics,
the 1644 anti licensing tract.

319
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.630
Look at line 320 of book nine.

320
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.310
This is page three 86 in the Hughes.
Now,

321
00:20:41.311 --> 00:20:45.150
Adam has claimed that they can best pass the trial of Satan's temptation if

322
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:49.260
they're together,
perfectly reasonable.
Um,

323
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.340
if Adam is there to guide eve and to protector,
um,

324
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.880
the fall is the less likely to happen.
But to eve,
and this is Edes argument,

325
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:03.060
this sounds as if Adam were attempting to sensor to sensor her environment as if

326
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:06.730
he were trying to protect her from a potentially dangerous,

327
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.460
potentially dangerous speech of the temperature.

328
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:11.890
And of course that is what he's trying to do.
And so she,

329
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.670
she responds to what she hears,
uh,

330
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.170
to be Adam's paternal solicitude.
And this is eve at line three 22

331
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.220
if this VR condition

332
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.410
thus to dwell in narrow circuits,
straightened by a foe,

333
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.020
subtle or violent,

334
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.610
we not endued single with like defense were ever met.

335
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:40.240
How are we happy?
Still in fear of harm?

336
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.130
And this is a,
this is a,
this is a devastating question.
Um,
eve issues,

337
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:49.960
a powerful critique of Adams,
what she takes to be Adam's act of censorship.

338
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:54.430
And when she suggests that she is living in an in an increasingly narrow

339
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:57.610
circuits straightened or constrained by,
by a foe,

340
00:21:57.611 --> 00:22:00.400
it's almost as if she's alluding to Milton's declaration,

341
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.720
his declaration and [inaudible].

342
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.290
I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue.
You remember these lines.

343
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.190
I cannot praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue unexercised and,

344
00:22:12.191 --> 00:22:15.790
and breathed that never Sally's out and sees her adversary.

345
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.100
What is virtue?

346
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.820
Milton had asked an area politica what is it if it's never tested,

347
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:26.821
what is virtuous resistance if there's nothing there actually to resist.

348
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.510
If the information one is being given as continually being licensed and censored

349
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:32.470
and controlled,

350
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.760
Eve refuses to accept the idea that Eden might be structured like an

351
00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:42.880
authoritarian state like,
like,

352
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:47.080
like the Stuart monarchy and at line three 37,
she lets loose a,

353
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.320
this is a searing criticism of a paradise in which an individual cannot be

354
00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:56.440
relied upon to choose freely her own actions.

355
00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.600
Um,

356
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.600
three 37 let us not then suspect our happy state left so imperfect by the maker

357
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:10.081
wise as not secure to single or a combined now.

358
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.730
And the syntax is a little difficult there.
She's saying,

359
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:15.910
let's not imagine that we're unsafe here.
Um,

360
00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:20.260
let's not doubt that the main maker created us secure by which he means safe,

361
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:22.750
whether we're on our own safe,

362
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:27.100
whether we were on our own or whether we're together and then she continues.

363
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:30.550
Frail is our happiness.

364
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.520
If this be so and Eden,

365
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.490
we're know Eden thus exposed

366
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.490
eve here is ex.

367
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:45.720
She's exposing the an ideological contradiction at the heart of,

368
00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:50.730
of Milton's Eden and at the center of her argument is a powerful alternative to

369
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:56.390
the official poet.
The the official line of Milton's poem eve is pronouncing.

370
00:23:56.391 --> 00:24:00.500
This is we.
This is the structure of a theological argument.

371
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:05.390
This is a theodicy.
She's justifying the ways of God to men as she sees them,

372
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.600
and this is the logic I take it of what she's just said.

373
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:11.390
If I am not free to resist temptation alone,

374
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.680
then this is not a justifiable world.
If not,
if I am not free to,

375
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.850
to resist temptation alone,
God is not a justifiable God.
Eden,

376
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:24.440
we're know Eden thus exposed and therefore she concludes,

377
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.610
I must be free to resist temptation alone.

378
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:30.290
That's her logical conclusion.

379
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:36.670
Now eves claim for the true state of Eden is a lot like Milton's claim some 20

380
00:24:36.711 --> 00:24:41.270
years earlier in area politica for the true state of,
of England,

381
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.230
there is at base,
uh,
and equality,

382
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.300
a state of equality among human human individuals and the individual himself

383
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.370
singly and not combined the individual should be empowered to resist temptation

384
00:24:55.371 --> 00:25:00.260
alone that the poem has gone to great lengths to make the official case for

385
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:03.820
gods.
How can it not?
It's a,

386
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:08.030
this is a version of genesis at the official case for God's imposition of an

387
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.090
arbitrary set of hierarchical distinctions,

388
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.090
excuse me.
And,
and,
and for his,
uh,
and,

389
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.870
and for Milton's ability to impose or for God's ability to impose arbitrary law,

390
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.980
Milton is supporting that,
uh,
throughout the poem.

391
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.640
But paradise lost is also willing to identify just those arbitrary hierarchies

392
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:36.230
as something like the source for Eden's imperfection.

393
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.760
And he does that even though even as he celebrates God's ability to impose these

394
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:45.530
arbitrary distinctions,
it's,

395
00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.580
it's this exposure of Eden structural flaws.

396
00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:54.581
I think the belts that best helps us understand the internal dynamics of the

397
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:58.730
temptation scene.
When Satan tempts eve,

398
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:04.150
he invariably tempt Sir with some version of all of those desires and all of

399
00:26:05.151 --> 00:26:10.151
those aspirations that Eden's hierarchical culture has struggled and struggled

400
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:14.600
mightily to,
to suppress.
So our,
um,

401
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.750
look at the top of page 391.

402
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:20.300
This is line five 38 of book nine.

403
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.600
Our first encounter with eve involved,

404
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.670
you'll remember this suppression of her admiration of that beautiful image that

405
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:33.671
she saw in the pool or the suppression of what came later to be interpreted as

406
00:26:34.341 --> 00:26:39.110
something like her narcissism eve was created with what seemed to be a natural,

407
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:39.391
uh,

408
00:26:39.391 --> 00:26:43.410
beautiful and instinctive admiration for the image that she found in the pool.

409
00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:43.920
That,

410
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.490
that that admiration was of course entirely innocent because eve had no way of

411
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:49.050
knowing that that was her own image.

412
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.620
But with the onset of that mysterious warning voice,

413
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:58.200
Eve was turned away from that image of herself and her behavior became branded

414
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.630
as narcissism thereafter.
It wasn't of course true narcissism,

415
00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.111
but,

416
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:09.111
but the imposition of that new restraint upon her seems to have produced in eve,

417
00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:15.390
created in her something like a true narcissism and it's this culturally

418
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:16.224
produced.

419
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.520
This is a character flaw that we can identify as a culturally produced one and

420
00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:25.230
it's one that Satan is able to exploit with utter ingenuity at the temptation

421
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:25.710
scene.

422
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.710
So this is Satan at line five 38 to eve fairest resemblance of dye maker faire,

423
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.450
the all things living gaze on all things line by gift and by celestial beauty,

424
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:46.010
adore with ravish meant be held their best beheld where universally admired.

425
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:53.130
So eaves affection for a responsive image for a sympathetic gays.

426
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:58.131
That's all she was getting out of the pool was denied her at the pool.

427
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.950
And this restraint seems to have produced in her something like a self love,

428
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:10.370
self love that has grown luxurious by restraint and Satan knows that.

429
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.210
And the tendency to narcissism was only one component of,

430
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:21.060
of her character that's exposed,
that was exposed in the scene at the pool side.

431
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.150
The pleasure that eve was deriving from the answering smiles,

432
00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:28.650
those beautiful sympathetic looks in the pool.
Um,
that,

433
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.770
that pleasure is akin in many ways to the pleasure that a lot of infants derive

434
00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.620
from the first moments of there from the first moments of their existence.

435
00:28:37.621 --> 00:28:38.790
The infant's pleasure.

436
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:44.210
And I'm thinking of the incidents pleasure in its initial interaction with the

437
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:48.480
mother.
This,
this,
uh,
this,
this shouldn't be surprising.

438
00:28:48.481 --> 00:28:51.440
One of the things that Milton tries to accomplish,
um,

439
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.910
in the narrative of,

440
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.970
of Eve's development is something like a larger theory of human development in

441
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:03.030
general.
But of course,
unlike all the rest of us,

442
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.660
eve doesn't have a mother and it's the,

443
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:11.820
it's the role of the mother both in culture and in nature that has been

444
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.900
systematically excluded necessarily,
but nonetheless,

445
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:20.901
systematically excluded from paradise lost and whatever experience of a kind of

446
00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:25.200
maternal affection that Eve may have felt in the answering looks in the

447
00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:27.130
sympathetic smiles,
uh,

448
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.570
is summarily cutoff with the warning voice.

449
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.120
So just as he did with her narcissism,

450
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:38.390
Satan tempts eve with precisely that natural phenomenon,

451
00:29:38.971 --> 00:29:43.070
that natural instinct that's been denied her.
Look at,

452
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.920
look at Satan mine five 78.

453
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.720
He describes his first glance at the goodly tree,
far distant to behold.

454
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.360
And we of course know what that goodly tree is.
So the serpent says,

455
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.770
I nearer drew to gaze when from the bowels,

456
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:04.780
a savory odor blown,
grateful to appetite,
more pleased.

457
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:09.430
My sense then smelled sweetest fennel or the teats of you,

458
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.640
or goat dropping with milk at even unsuccess of lamb or kid that tend their

459
00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:16.534
play.

460
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:23.940
Surely we all agree that this is a surprising in it and a strange simile here in

461
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:29.160
comparing this,
the smell of the forbidden fruit,
uh,

462
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:33.790
to mother's milk.
Satan is offering even embedded image of the mother.

463
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:39.310
And by placing the scene in the,
in the evening or what he calls even,

464
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:45.190
Satan is able to insert Eve's actual name into the expression of the natural

465
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:49.970
desire to suckle,
uh,
at the,
at the mother's breast.
But what,

466
00:30:49.971 --> 00:30:52.370
but what's at stake here isn't simply,
um,

467
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.590
isn't simply Eve's longing for the mother that she never had.

468
00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.410
This situation is a lot more radical than that because at the scene,

469
00:30:59.411 --> 00:31:01.540
at the pool in so many ways,

470
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:05.340
eve was actually mothering herself,
um,

471
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.700
on at least on an experiential level.
Um,
eve seem to have been,

472
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.330
this is the way she must have felt it.
Subjectively.

473
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.310
She was the source of her own creation a lot,

474
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.530
much as Satan claim that he had raised himself by his own quickening power.

475
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.800
Eve had represented the possibility for the poem of something like an absolute

476
00:31:25.871 --> 00:31:28.960
self possession and an absolute self containment.

477
00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.290
And you remember that Adam had informed Raphael and book eight,

478
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:36.820
this was the line five 47 of book aid that he had been struck by this incredible

479
00:31:36.821 --> 00:31:39.450
era of self contained sadness that eve had a,

480
00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.750
when I approached her he tells or Raefiel when I approached her loveliness.

481
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:48.160
So absolute,
she seems and in herself complete.

482
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.880
And Raphael of course hasten to warm Adam against the attraction to females self

483
00:31:53.881 --> 00:31:54.714
sufficiency,

484
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:59.170
that there's a sense in which eve is absolutely independent.

485
00:31:59.171 --> 00:32:04.171
She's mother and daughter United in one self determining being and it is just

486
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:10.681
this maternal self sufficiency that the law of the garden has denied eve and so

487
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:19.030
like clockwork,
it returns here in Satan's temptation.

488
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.940
The third element of Satan's temptation involves the taboo that was established

489
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:29.920
by Raphael.
This is the taboo of,
of speculation.
Raefiel had told Adam,

490
00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.600
don't concern yourself,

491
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:36.070
don't worry so much about speculating about the cosmos because the structure of

492
00:32:36.071 --> 00:32:39.130
the cosmos simply doesn't concern you.
Be Lowly wise,

493
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.410
Raefiel told Adam no to know no more.

494
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.510
How on Earth could Milton the author of Aereo Politica put those words in the

495
00:32:47.511 --> 00:32:52.040
mouth of the Archangel.
Uh,
it's too troubling even to speculate about,

496
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.270
but look,
look,
look down at line 602 of book nine.

497
00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.340
This is page three 92 the serpent argues that one of the effects of the fruit

498
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:03.410
was the awakening.
And of course he's lying.

499
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.130
Was it the awakening in him of the power of reason,

500
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.640
wakening and him his capacity for speculation thins fourth to speculations,

501
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:13.850
high or deep.

502
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.120
I turned my thoughts and with capacious mind considered all things visible.

503
00:33:19.221 --> 00:33:22.640
And Heaven or earth or middle,

504
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.980
all things fair and good.

505
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.410
No form of speculation has been licensed or censored for the serpent.

506
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:35.210
According to Satan,
he gets to think whatever he wants.
His is a vision.

507
00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:39.620
This is exactly the vision of the liberal miltonic universe represented.

508
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:42.950
So majestically and so compellingly and [inaudible] Politica and again,

509
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:48.430
the temptation to speculate is intimately linked with this cultural law,

510
00:33:48.531 --> 00:33:51.980
this risk against speculation,
the restraint

511
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:58.820
of speculation.
And finally,
and most importantly,

512
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:02.720
eve is tempted with just that aspect of her status,

513
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.800
that this poem has most vigorously denied her.

514
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.930
And that's the possibility.
And I think it's,
I take this very seriously,

515
00:34:11.931 --> 00:34:15.680
that there is a possibility that she's actually,

516
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:20.600
at least on a natural and ontological level,
she is Adams equal.

517
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.890
The possibility of the,
uh,

518
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:27.530
of the fundamental or natural egalitarianism of eve,

519
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:33.040
of Eden rather is one of the principal objects of cultural suppression in

520
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:36.980
Raffles,
long discourse with Adam,
a Rah Rah fields,

521
00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:41.970
denial of their equality really feels,
uh,
the,
the,

522
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.280
the pages of book eight.

523
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:48.340
And so naturally the desire for equality surface is one of the principle motives

524
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.290
for Eve's transgression by eating the fruit eve.

525
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.320
Perhaps this is unspeakably heartbreaking by eating the fruit eve perhaps can

526
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:03.710
produce in herself and equality with Adam.

527
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:07.880
That's the fantasy and the speaking serpent provides the best evidence.

528
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:12.320
Imagine imaginable of the alleged ability of the fruit to function as a kind of

529
00:35:12.321 --> 00:35:15.950
chemical equalizer attempt.
T uh,
this is like a,

530
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:20.951
it's like a testosterone laced cocktail that offers the false hope of equality.

531
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.600
Look at line six 87 Satan to eve.
Look on me,

532
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:32.300
me who have touched and tasted yet both live and life more perfect have attained

533
00:35:32.301 --> 00:35:36.710
than fate meant me by venturing higher than my lot.

534
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.850
Eat this fruit and you will become greater than you have up to this point.

535
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:46.140
Been allowed to be eat this fruit and you will become greater than your lot in

536
00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:49.200
life permits.
Now,

537
00:35:49.201 --> 00:35:54.201
this has to be one of the most powerful inducements as a,

538
00:35:55.081 --> 00:35:56.610
as a political philosopher,

539
00:35:56.611 --> 00:36:01.611
Milton knows better than anyone the power of the desire for equality.

540
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.650
And it's just this promise of equality that is the most in that that's the most,

541
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.700
that is most important to eve after she has eaten the fruit.

542
00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:19.380
This is after the fall.
This is line eight 16 of book nine.

543
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:24.150
This is the middle of page three 97 and Eve as musing to herself,

544
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:29.610
but to Adam in what sort shall I appear,

545
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.010
shall I to him make known as yet might change and give him to partake full

546
00:36:35.011 --> 00:36:38.010
happiness with me or rather not,

547
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.880
but keep the odds of knowledge in my power without copartner.

548
00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:46.020
So to add what wants in female sex,

549
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:51.200
the more to draw his love and I love this and render me more equal and perhaps a

550
00:36:54.121 --> 00:36:55.440
thing not undesirable,

551
00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:00.710
sometime superior for inferior who is free.

552
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.300
There is an unspeakable pathos charging these lines because it becomes clear

553
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.690
that one of the primary reasons that Yves has fallen in the first place involves

554
00:37:12.691 --> 00:37:16.390
a structural problem inherent in the miltonic paradise.
The,

555
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.170
and that's the official insistence on a social hierarchy.
Uh,

556
00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.600
of course the poem has continually arguing that social end for inferiority does

557
00:37:24.601 --> 00:37:27.210
not impinge upon human freedom.

558
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:32.390
Just because eve is inferior to Adam doesn't mean that she isn't free but Milton

559
00:37:32.391 --> 00:37:34.410
and perfect.
That's the,
that's the official line.

560
00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:37.560
But Milton knows perfectly well that the radical type of freedom for which he

561
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:42.561
had argued in his early career as a polemicist had been founded upon an

562
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:48.330
assumption of equality and an area of pathetic and Milton had implied that we

563
00:37:48.331 --> 00:37:49.170
are all free.

564
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.510
We're all free to read whatever we want because we are all equally endowed with

565
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.353
reason.

566
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.360
That's at least implicitly as argument paradise lost had instituted at the heart

567
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:04.530
of its body politic,
a distinctly hierarchical society.

568
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.390
There,
there may be a natural instinct for equality.

569
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:13.110
There's a natural instinct for a quality that we feel both without Adam and with

570
00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:13.944
eve,

571
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:19.070
but the official culture of Eden has labored to suppress that instinct.

572
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.790
And at the moment of the temptation,

573
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:25.560
the tremendous cost of that suppression is measured.

574
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.800
Now from the,
from the dock trial point of view,

575
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:33.801
eve is clearly wrong here to question her divinely sanctioned place in the order

576
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:36.130
of things we have to see her as wrong,

577
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:41.760
but there is a voice that counters the poems doctrine and it argues that the

578
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:47.761
imposition of such an arbitrary law of hierarchy can only produce a

579
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:51.250
corresponding desire to subvert that hierarchy.

580
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:55.870
And you'll note here that if the further point that the denial of equality

581
00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.960
doesn't merely precipitate a desire for equality,

582
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:04.780
I think it pushes us even further to a desire.

583
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:06.910
It's really wild.

584
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.940
It per the denial of equality actually pushes us even further to it to a desire

585
00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:17.260
for superiority.
Even entertainment's the the,
the lovely thought of being,

586
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.060
and isn't this a wonderful phrase,

587
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:23.570
the lovely thought of being sometime superior as,

588
00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:28.300
as if Adam and eve could assume different positions on the hierarchical ladder

589
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.750
at will as if Adam and Eve could either rung,

590
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:36.440
assume or both.
Just as a Milton's angels can either sex,

591
00:39:36.441 --> 00:39:41.290
assume this is the suppression of equality even pushes eve to that.

592
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:45.250
Perfectly illogical but completely understandable formulation.

593
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.400
She'd like to be more equal as if you quality could be quantified in some way.

594
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:56.260
Um,
as if he quality weren't a relational phenomenon,
a structural phenomenon,

595
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:57.094
but one

596
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.510
that could be assumed entirely by oneself,

597
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:07.500
that one that could be hoarded and kept within the self in quantity.

598
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.810
No,
according to the official doctrine of the poem,
uh,
the,

599
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.790
the moment of Eve's eating of the fruit is the origin of the human condition.

600
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:20.230
The original human condition of fallen us man lived until this time in a state

601
00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:23.440
of Paradise Hill perfection and it's out of an APP.

602
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.420
It's out of an absolutely freewill that man chooses to disobey the divine

603
00:40:28.421 --> 00:40:28.931
command.

604
00:40:28.931 --> 00:40:33.100
But the narrative that Milton employees to illustrate this official doctrine

605
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:36.880
seems continually to be questioning just that assumption.

606
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.410
Milton's poetry seems to counter this,

607
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.360
this belief and even Edenic perfection and counter this belief and even an

608
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.210
Edenic freedom.
But before the fall,

609
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:52.450
there's a sense in paradise lost that Adam and eve were neck.

610
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.340
And I know this as heretical,

611
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.990
that Adam and eve were never completely free in Eden.

612
00:40:58.991 --> 00:41:00.430
They were always burdened.

613
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:04.540
They were always burdened by a set of cultural constraints of which the

614
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:07.240
prohibition of the fruit was simply the most outrageous,

615
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:08.830
but certainly not the only one.

616
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:14.250
Look at page 402 this isn't an another important moment after the fall line,

617
00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:15.880
1051

618
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.220
this is the moment in which Adam and eve wake up after their first,

619
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:25.210
their first act of sexual intercourse after the fall.

620
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:27.340
This is their first attempt to fall asleep,

621
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:30.550
which of course doesn't turn out to be that pleasant.

622
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.760
So up they rose as from up they rose is from unrest and each the other viewing

623
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.240
soon found their eyes how opened and their minds how darkened innocence that as

624
00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:50.180
a veil had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone.

625
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.440
Just confidence and native righteousness and honor from about them.

626
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.560
Naked left to guilty.
Shame.

627
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:02.180
So this is Milton's version of the genesis text.
This is what genesis tells us.

628
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.510
The eyes of both were opened and they knew that they were naked.

629
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:10.160
They've awakened to a new,
uh,
to a new form of consciousness.

630
00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.930
But Milton wants us to know that this new form of knowledge,

631
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:18.500
this new self consciousness isn't an enlightenment.

632
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:23.210
It's a darkening their minds.
How darkened Milton exclaims.

633
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.440
But it's so much more complicated than that.

634
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:30.230
No sooner has Milton depicted the fall as a darkening.

635
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:32.390
Then he does something incredibly strange.

636
00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:37.040
He describes the fall from innocence as if the fall we're in itself,

637
00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:42.041
something like an enlightenment innocence that as a veil had shadowed them from

638
00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:43.700
knowing ill was gone on.

639
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:48.620
And there's an incredibly complicated but wonderfully contradictory interplay of

640
00:42:48.621 --> 00:42:50.960
lightening and darkening and the,

641
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:53.840
and the imagery here begins to deconstruct itself.
On the one hand,

642
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:58.841
the fall darkens their minds and on the other hand they're enlightened as the

643
00:42:58.881 --> 00:43:01.520
shadow we vale is,
is lifted.

644
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.740
And it's at this moment that the poem seems to expose the fictional status of

645
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:10.940
its representation of something like a perfect [inaudible] innocence.

646
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:14.030
Surely we expect it's Milton to say something completely different.

647
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:19.031
Surely we expected Milton to say that innocence was the natural naked Adam and

648
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:24.071
eve and that this innocent nakedness is now being covered with a veil,

649
00:43:24.161 --> 00:43:27.980
a veil of guilt or avail of shame.
But Milton's doing of course,

650
00:43:27.981 --> 00:43:30.920
exactly the opposite.
What does he say?

651
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.590
Innocence was itself the veil.

652
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:38.480
The very idea of their perfect and fallen state was the veil.

653
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:40.910
The very notion that Adam and eve ever lived in a fair pair,

654
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.360
a free paradise was a veil.
It was a fiction.

655
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.350
It was a false covering,
avail thrown over the Edenic society.

656
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:53.590
That was always an already a product of fallen cultural constraints.

657
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.230
Now,
I don't need to remind you this because I,

658
00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.580
I know this is what you're thinking.
We have of course,

659
00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.410
run into the image of the veil.

660
00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:07.820
Before in paradise lost an image of the veil appeared in the description and the

661
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:09.020
length of Eve's hair.

662
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:14.750
Remember that was a fact of culture that was being mistaken by the narrator as a

663
00:44:14.751 --> 00:44:19.250
fact of nature.
I'm in book four line 304 the narrator,

664
00:44:19.251 --> 00:44:21.410
and you don't need to move there because you remember these lines.

665
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:26.410
The narrator tells us that eve as a veil down to the slender waisted or

666
00:44:26.901 --> 00:44:29.600
unadorned,
golden tresses war disheveled,

667
00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:34.020
but in wanton ringlets waived as the vine curls her tendrils,

668
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.420
which implied subjection.

669
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:40.980
And our first understanding of Eve's subjection to Adam was derived from the

670
00:44:40.981 --> 00:44:45.540
length of Eve's hair,
which she wore as a veil.
A veil,
of course,

671
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:47.280
is only worn to hide something.

672
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.200
It's a covering of a source of shame that in this case meet may have seem to be

673
00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:56.370
eads nakedness,
but that equation of Eve's hair with avail took place.

674
00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:01.410
Think of it,
it took place before the fall,
before nakedness,
which shameful.

675
00:45:01.411 --> 00:45:02.880
And the poem never seen the,

676
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:05.610
and the poem seem to raise the possibility that there was,

677
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.710
that there was actually never a moment at which Adam and eve were entirely free

678
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.760
from the kinds of constraints and the kinds of prohibitions that we associate

679
00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:18.870
with fallen culture,
with culture after,
uh,
the,
the,

680
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.200
the breaking of the prohibition.
And it's of course,

681
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:25.650
no accident that the image of the veil occurs in book four in the,

682
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:31.520
in the context of our introduction to identic hierarchy to the fact of Eve's

683
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.350
subordinate status.

684
00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:39.180
Because the fall itself seems in so many ways I think to to be one of the

685
00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:44.181
natural consequences of this or cultural consequences of this fact of sexual,

686
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.640
uh,
subordination.

687
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.920
Milton's strange image of the veil of innocence in book nine.
What is this?

688
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:53.870
This is a paradox,

689
00:45:53.871 --> 00:45:58.871
a rhetorical paradox and this paradox announces what is essentially that paradox

690
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:02.790
circle construction of Eden,

691
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.560
of Milton's Eden on the official,
on the dock trynna level of the poem.

692
00:46:07.561 --> 00:46:12.561
The falling of this veil of innocence exposes Adams and Eve's nakedness.

693
00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:16.140
It's a sign of their new fallen consciousness of their shame.

694
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:19.170
That's how we're supposed to be reading,
presumably this image.

695
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.300
But this paradoxical image also works on that other level on the much more

696
00:46:24.301 --> 00:46:25.890
subversive level of the poem.

697
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.690
And it exposes a structural flaw at the heart of Milton's paradise.

698
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.093
Milton,

699
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:37.550
let's the duck trinal veil fall from the poem and he exposes his own alliance

700
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.840
and I really believe this,

701
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:44.841
he's exposing here is own alliance with eaves critique of Eden's arbitrary

702
00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:49.950
hierarchy.
And it's as if Milton had torn the veil of Dogma from his poem,

703
00:46:49.951 --> 00:46:54.951
and he's begun to realize what Yves has known all along Eden.

704
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.230
We're know Eden thus exposed.
Okay.

705
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.010
That's it.
