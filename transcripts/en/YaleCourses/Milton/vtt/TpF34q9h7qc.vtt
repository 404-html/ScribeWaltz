00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.633
Readers,

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.200
readers typically finish the last books of paradise lost with,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.460
I dunno,

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
I certainly had this experience the first time I read it and I think actually

5
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.150
many times since then,
um,

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.690
readers tend to finish the last books of paradise lost with something like a

7
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:19.620
sense of,
of,

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.540
of disappointment and the disappointment that is traditionally accompanied these

9
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:29.250
last books is usually associated with the question of their style.

10
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.920
Uh,
Michael's prophetic vision of future history is laid out before Adam with and

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.950
you and you get this sense of with kind of labored and painstaking didacticism

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.590
that we so Miss Raphael,

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.150
I think that the athlete will Raefiel had charmed us with that endearing

14
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:51.480
uncertainty that he had about the structure of the cosmos.
For example,

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.660
was Ptolemy,
right?
Was Copernicus right?
Who Cares?

16
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.630
Rafio made an art out of,

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.780
out of his uncertainty and he seemed to place his blessing thereby on all of the

18
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:08.370
ambiguities and all of the ambivalences and uncertainties that field nearly

19
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.260
every line of the poem.
But,

20
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.950
but everything or nearly everything,

21
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
nearly everything changes with the appearance of the Archangel Michael.

22
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.980
Michael speech is much less open.
There's,
this is,
there's no question to this,

23
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.850
to the prolife,
to a proliferation of signifying possibilities.

24
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.530
He speaks in labored declarative sentences and his purpose seems above all the,

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.520
to provide Adam with a,
a powerful,
powerful sense of his culpability.

26
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.570
Adam's culpability for the hell that is future history.

27
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:43.440
And I mean actually held quite quite literally because there's an important way

28
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:47.580
in which the last two books of paradise lost provides us with a kind of mirror

29
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.620
of the,
of the first two books,

30
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:53.190
the catalog of fallen history that we have at the poems.

31
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:56.910
Conclusion reproduces and rehearses a lot of the patterns of behavior that were

32
00:01:56.911 --> 00:02:00.090
established in,
uh,
in the,
in the first two books.

33
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:03.090
And David's lecture on Friday has,

34
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.150
has made me think of the ways in which the sometimes what seems to be the

35
00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:14.220
futility of human action and human behavior in the last two books also hearkens

36
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.440
back to an earlier time,

37
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:19.980
even before the events are accounted in,
books one and two.

38
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.350
And that's of course the,
the,
the war in heaven.

39
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:27.351
The pointlessness of the war in heaven on some level gets reproduced in the

40
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:32.610
sense that we have some times of the pointlessness of life after the fall in the

41
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:37.020
last couple of books of the,
of the poem,
but like the war in heaven.

42
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.510
Uh,
there is,
uh,
there is a kind of heroism that's possible,

43
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.140
uh,
in,
in the last two books of Paradise lost,

44
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.650
and I won't be talking about this in any length,

45
00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:49.350
but it's an important part of Milton's conception of history.

46
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.030
And it's often referred to as Milton's one just man theory of history.

47
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.631
There's always,

48
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:59.631
every generation seems to have one man who is willing to stand alone and stand

49
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.070
apart from the corruption of the crowd.

50
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.540
And that man will do everything he possibly can on some level.

51
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.860
It's still going to be futile,
uh,
but to advance,
uh,

52
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.900
the civilization and the level of spiritual excellence of the people that much

53
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:16.960
further.

54
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.580
And that the one just man in the war in heaven was of course the angel ab deal

55
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:25.960
with whom Milton himself,
um,
was felt himself so identified.

56
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.270
Well in any case book,
think of book 10,
both 10 had been filled with the,

57
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:35.200
with the catalog of the punishments that Adam and Eve had to endure as a

58
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:39.100
consequence of their behavior.
But it seems at times as if the,

59
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.950
the harshest punishment of all,
um,

60
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.820
that comes as a consequence of the fall,

61
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:50.821
we'll be Adams subjection to the catechism of Michael in books 11 and 12,

62
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:55.810
Adam is subjected to an instructor and instructor who's,

63
00:03:55.811 --> 00:04:00.130
who's grim sense of humor,
who's a brace of sarcasm,
who's unfeeling,

64
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:04.480
didacticism all contribute,
at least to my mind,
to a sensibility,

65
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.110
utterly foreign to that of the first 10 books.
And,

66
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.960
and if we,
as the sons of daughters of Adam and eve are to be punished,
um,

67
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.870
it,
it's,
it seems as if we too are to be punished,
uh,
for,

68
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.030
for that original sin.
And how are we punished?

69
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:26.290
Were punished because we have an obligation if we want to finish this stupid

70
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:29.210
poem,
we have an obligation to read,
um,

71
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.320
and experience Adam's uncompromising,

72
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.420
the Michaels uncompromising pedagogy,
his teaching of Adam.

73
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.050
Now the literary literary style of the last books.

74
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.750
Maybe that aspect of them,

75
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:46.480
that first first insights our disappointment,

76
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:49.930
but it's certainly not the only disappointing element of those.

77
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.690
Those books were also disappointed with the actual content.

78
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.160
I'm disappointed with the content of Michael's history.
You remember rent I and,

79
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:01.590
and,
and uh,
I will continually be hearkening back to,

80
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.340
to Raphael who seems so much more affable in retrospect than it may maybe he did

81
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:07.630
at the time.
Um,

82
00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:12.520
we remember at raffles teasing account of a future history in,
in book five,

83
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.850
you'll remember this if Adam and Eve could only remain sinless,

84
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:17.230
if they could only remain obedient,

85
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.110
then their future might consist of that grand but slow transmutation,

86
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.650
um,
into the theory will matter of of angels.
It was really quite beautiful,

87
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.870
but Adam and eve of course did not remain sinless and their future history

88
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:36.871
necessarily has to look disappointingly different from that natural history

89
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.190
that,
that Rafio had,
had been able to anticipate.

90
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.770
Now,
most critics,

91
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.360
most Milton scholars writing about the last two books of Milton's poem have

92
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.850
invested their time and you can understand why this is necessary.

93
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:56.320
I have invested their time in defending books 11 and 12 and there's a certain

94
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:01.321
kind of nervousness about the unpleasantness of the conclusion of,

95
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.230
of,
of this poem.
And,
and critics are continually,
and I think this is misguided,

96
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:06.991
but I understand it.

97
00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:11.180
And then the less they're continually attempting to shelter the poem from the

98
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.240
accusation that it's ending represents something like a disappointing falling

99
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:18.800
off.
Now I think these critics are right.

100
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.060
They're absolutely right to insist that the last books are supremely artful

101
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:24.500
creations that's undeniable.

102
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.560
And that Milton displays in them his sophisticated gay engagement of,

103
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.650
of Biblical history and end of theology.
Um,

104
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.220
it's an he,

105
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.570
Milton takes extraordinary care in crafting the process of the education too,

106
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:45.590
which Adam is subjected in the last books that said,

107
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:46.670
I think it's a mistake.

108
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.380
I'm convinced it's a mistake to deny the fact that these books are in addition

109
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:53.600
to all of that,
that they are disappointing and I,

110
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.900
and so I think we can profitably examine why it is that Milton ends his poem

111
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.540
with these last books.

112
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:06.110
Michael's severe treatise on scriptural history.

113
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.600
Now these last books,

114
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:13.601
Mark Milton's only attempt in paradise lost to represent what we would think of

115
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:17.180
as actual human history.
And in order to,

116
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.980
in order to understand why this section of the poem is so is so troubled and so

117
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:25.610
worrisome,
we have to understand Milton's own brush with history,

118
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:29.780
his own participation and the disappointing history of the failed puritan

119
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.300
revolution.
Now,
Milton has,
has,

120
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.360
has taken great pains to keep from his poem anything like a direct illusion to

121
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:41.600
the political turmoil of his own day.
But what I'm,

122
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:44.900
what I'm hoping I'll be able to do at least for a few minutes here is to show

123
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:49.901
how one of the ways in which Michael's treatment of script scriptural history is

124
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:55.901
still intimately connected to the contemporary political history that Milton was

125
00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:59.990
himself and meshed in.
Now,

126
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:04.991
you may have noticed that the work of Milton's political pros that I have by far

127
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.210
that I have most consistently sided,
um,

128
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:12.740
over the course of these lectures is written little things on the board for

129
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.570
quotation of it is areopagite Jica that this speech against licensing that

130
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:21.230
Milton had printed in 1644 and there's a way in which the,

131
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.470
that exuberant liberalism of Area Reo Politica was continually reef surfacing in

132
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:30.470
the most interesting and a lot of,
in a lot of cases,

133
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:34.690
the most daring passages of the entire poem.
And W we,
we were,

134
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:36.820
we remember instances in which,
um,

135
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.890
Bilio entered another point eve seem to be actually alluding to area political

136
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:44.810
or certainly reproducing arguments that Milton had made there.

137
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.130
And so I devoted a lot of attention to Aereo politica but in doing so,

138
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:54.131
I think I've also distorted maybe kind of drastically the truth about Milton's

139
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.230
sensibility in the very years that he was,
he was writing paradise lost.
Um,

140
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.590
Milton's epic poem appeared over 20 Years,

141
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.620
23 years after the treatise on licensing in the mid 1640s.

142
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.950
Milton as an I,
and I've,

143
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:15.570
and I've given you a sketch of this history before,
but it's,
uh,
it's,

144
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:20.350
it's worth looking at a another time,
um,
in,
in the mid 1640s,

145
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.660
Milton was really at the height of what we can think of as his liberalism,
even,

146
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.170
uh,
even though that word wasn't yet an existence,
I'm,

147
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:32.730
Milton was wildly optimistic about the success of what he felt to be the puritan

148
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:33.564
revolution.

149
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.280
And he seemed genuinely confident that something like a rational spiritual

150
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:42.990
puritan utopia could actually be established on English soil.

151
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.600
And at the center of his political optimism was,

152
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.510
was his faith in the Political Pac,

153
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.470
the political category that Milton called the people.

154
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.850
And when he was writing in Latin,
he would use the Latin for people populace.

155
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.130
And throughout the 1640s,
um,
up to 1650,

156
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.750
Milton was confident,

157
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.660
really exuberantly confident that God had infused the power of reason and virtue

158
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.670
into every single human individual.

159
00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:15.600
And that this God given capacity for a reason and virtue would enable the

160
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:19.830
English people,
the populace to govern themselves,

161
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.380
to govern themselves in an entirely [inaudible],
thorugh,

162
00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:28.230
Terrian almost completely egalitarian political structure.

163
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.310
And you can see the,
I think you can see most dramatically,

164
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.310
and this is a treatise that we haven't,
that we haven't read in this course,

165
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:37.830
but it's included in the Hughes.
Um,

166
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.950
you can see this faith in the self rule of the people in Milton 1649 treatise

167
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.650
really the greatest of all of the what we call the regicide treatises,

168
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.910
the tenure of kings and magistrates in which Milton and actually actively

169
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:54.930
advocates they're regicide.
There's almost a sense in,

170
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.570
in the tenure of kings and magistrates,
um,

171
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.160
that you don't even really need any kind of form formal governmental structure

172
00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:02.760
at all.

173
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.560
The people are actually going to be able to govern themselves without,

174
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:10.830
without any,
without any other edifice.

175
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.810
There turned out to be a problem.
However,
uh,

176
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.050
with Milton's political idealism and that problem,
no doubt involved.

177
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:23.700
The fact that Milton's political idealism seemed to have had no basis whatsoever

178
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:28.600
in reality.
And Milton may have been,
may have been,
uh,

179
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.650
convinced that God had infused every single human individual with this power of

180
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.650
rational self rule.
But the actual people,

181
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:40.590
the actual populous of,
of England,
um,

182
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:44.910
turned out not to be so easily convinced the real English people themselves were

183
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:49.911
considerably more conservative than the small puritan elite who had pushed for

184
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:54.760
the execution of Charles the first and 1649 and who had placed themselves at the

185
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.630
head of,
of the new,
uh,
non monarchic Republican government.

186
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.640
And if anything,
that the majority of the English people themselves were,

187
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.800
they were in favor of monarchy.

188
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:11.040
And so Milton found himself as so often compelled to modify his own political

189
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.380
idealism by 1650.

190
00:12:14.381 --> 00:12:18.720
Milton wasn't able to say that the English should be governed by,
by,

191
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.900
by the people,
by 1651,
I should say.

192
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.580
He was no longer able to say that,

193
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.210
that the people obviously on some level that people obviously couldn't be

194
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:31.150
trusted any longer to get it right.

195
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:36.330
And so we had to weaken his claim that the people we're all rational and self

196
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:40.900
governing and he began to form or it a much less idealistic principle of

197
00:12:40.901 --> 00:12:45.380
government.
And that was the government of England by a small elected body.
Um,

198
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.080
a small elected body of people called parliament and parliament had existed well

199
00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:58.450
before,
uh,
this new turn in Milton's a political philosophy.

200
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.800
But Milton was placing an entirely new importance on this,
on this,
on this body.

201
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.980
So maybe the people themselves aren't all that rational and virtuous and self

202
00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:12.850
determining capable of self government.
Uh,
but surely parliament,

203
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.470
this is the new turn in Milton's thinking and elite group of the people can be

204
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:20.580
counted on to uphold Milton's own value of,

205
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.910
of rational self determination and rational,
rational self rule.

206
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:29.790
Well,
there,
there were Republican decade wears on the 1650s,

207
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.470
and by the time we get to the,
the end of the decade,

208
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.360
the king lists government of England under the rule of Oliver Cromwell and later

209
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:38.920
under the rule of Cromwells son,

210
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.390
this Republican government is getting closer and closer to a complete collapse.

211
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.240
And there's a widespread popular movement.

212
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:50.860
It's a movement fomented by the people seeking the return of the Stuart
Monarchy.

213
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.740
And this time it's not only the common people,
um,

214
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.080
who were calling for the return of their king.
It's also parliament who has,
uh,

215
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.380
you know,
from Milton's perspective,
parliament has entirely sold out.

216
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.750
And so by late 16,
59,

217
00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:09.751
there's a majority now even in parliament desiring this is again Milton's,

218
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.980
Milton's construction of it,

219
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.220
desiring to re subject the English people to the tyranny of monarchy.

220
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.730
And so in 1659,
when Milton is writing his final political treatise,
um,

221
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.260
he's compelled to alter his views once again,

222
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:31.261
and he finds very little evidence of the rational virtuous ethical principles

223
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:34.960
that he had been so confident about an area of Politica.
Um,
this,
this,

224
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.390
this idea that all human individuals possess a,

225
00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.930
the virtue and the reason and the spirit that he had previously attributed to

226
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:44.530
them.

227
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:49.530
And it starts to seem as if all men are actually not created equal.

228
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:56.240
And the very few of them have anything like divine virtue or divine reason

229
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.710
infused into them by God.
And so now the,
the,

230
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.510
the people that Milton had once so wonderfully and movingly idealized,
um,

231
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.330
he's able to refer to and it's really kind of jarring and just frankly,

232
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:12.170
it's depressing.
Milton's now able to refer to the people as the,

233
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:16.130
and I'm quoting here,
the rude and inconsiderate multitude,

234
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.660
the unruly mob.

235
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.870
You have a whole elaborate lexicon of invective concerning the people in the

236
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:27.320
latest,
the last political treatises of,
of,
of Milton's,

237
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:29.853
um,

238
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.780
the governing body that Milton Oh,
so,

239
00:15:34.781 --> 00:15:38.810
so Milton imagines,
because he can't even count on Parliament,

240
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.820
um,
he comes to insist that the unruly and irrational English,

241
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.850
these masses are ungovernable even by parliament.
And so that this,

242
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.160
the governing body is going to have to be an even smaller group,

243
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.350
a collection of England's most rational,
most spiritual men.

244
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.970
Men,
of course,
you look exactly like John John Melton himself.
So a group,

245
00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.260
a group of men,

246
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:09.340
more excellent than the much far too large mass of people that constitute

247
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:14.000
parliament.
And you have something like,
uh,
what's essentially a spiritual elite.

248
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.450
This spiritual elite,
um,
would have to govern England.

249
00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:19.880
And Milton thinks of them as a council of saints.

250
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.830
He refers to them as a council of saints.
So in a little more than a decade,

251
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:26.930
this political idealist has,

252
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:31.370
has shifted from his celebration of the power and the liberty due to the people,

253
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.050
uh,
to a depressingly shriveled sense.
And it is,
it is pretty shrunk and it's a,

254
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:37.280
and it's a pretty pitiful thing,

255
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:42.700
a shriveled sense of the power and liberty due to only do to a very small group

256
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.170
of likeminded puritan revolutionaries.
So,

257
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:53.410
so a lot of the liberal confidence of a work like area politica just disappears

258
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.830
by the time we get to Milton's late political pros.
Um,

259
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.570
just how depressing this shift is,
um,

260
00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:03.650
will become clear to you.

261
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:08.680
When have I have I assigned the ready and easy way to establish a true

262
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:12.260
Commonwealth on the,
on the syllabus.

263
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.280
I may have taken it off this year because I did not want to depress you,
um,

264
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:22.040
that you should not let my attempt to protect you from what might seem the

265
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:27.030
ugliest parts of Milton from taking advantage of fuses,
inclusion of that,
uh,

266
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.520
of that important and interesting text in the,
in your addition.
Um,

267
00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.950
Milton will argue in their ready and easy way that he wrote in 1659 that this

268
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:39.440
new spiritual counsel,
the counsel of saints,

269
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.310
they should actually be employed.
Uh,
two,

270
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:48.410
they should actually be permitted to deploy military force,

271
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:53.680
deploy force if necessary to subject the unruly masses to their will.

272
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.510
This is how the argument goes and it's a disconcerting one.

273
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.890
The people are now so little to be trusted that they have to be forced to

274
00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:03.160
recognize,
uh,

275
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.890
they have to be forced to recognize at gunpoint if necessary,
um,

276
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.753
that they,

277
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.930
that they must now be forced to recognize their God given liberty and their God

278
00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:17.190
given capacity for,
for a self rule.
And of course it goes without question.

279
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:20.180
There's a,
there's a horrible paradox there.

280
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.180
Milton seems to be arguing that the people will,
will govern themselves.

281
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:26.640
God dammit,
even if there have to be forced,

282
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.930
even if they have to be forced to do it.
So this final plan,

283
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:35.670
this is Miele Milton's final political scheme is something like a polit,

284
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.720
a hunter of,
of Puritan Saints.
Of course,

285
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.380
the scheme was never enacted and shortly after Milton proposed it,

286
00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:47.940
the Republican government,
I'm completely collapsed in early 16,
60.

287
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:53.150
And Charles the second the dead King Sun was returned to the throne and monarchy

288
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:58.080
was restored and Milton was.
And think about the position that he's in.

289
00:18:58.081 --> 00:18:59.600
Melton was actually placed in,
in,

290
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.530
in prison for a while for his writings against the king and he was generally

291
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:08.670
living in,
uh,
in,
in some degree of poverty and certainly in disgrace.

292
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.220
All of this is a very long winded way of saying we have come a long way.
Um,

293
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.550
by the time we get actually to the composition of paradise lost,

294
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:22.530
we've come a very long way from the moving idealism of [inaudible].

295
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.300
Milton has endured an entire decade of,

296
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.510
of political disappointment.
And I think it's possible to see the real,
the,
the,

297
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:35.511
the relation between the fall of Milton's own political idealism over the course

298
00:19:36.421 --> 00:19:38.460
of a decade and a half or so.

299
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.980
And the fall of man as it's represented in paradise lost,
Milton's able to,

300
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:49.270
to use the narrative of the fall of paradise to in some way I think to map his

301
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:53.850
own experience with the loss of the English Commonwealth,

302
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.080
the English Commonwealth that Milton had really seen as something like a

303
00:19:58.081 --> 00:20:00.840
paradise of,
of Puritan Saints.

304
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.090
So Adam,
you could think of,

305
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.530
you can think of Adam and eve after the fall,
um,

306
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.900
as in a lot of ways,

307
00:20:12.901 --> 00:20:17.901
at least as a version of the English people for Milton in the late 1650s,

308
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:23.241
they show surprisingly few signs of internalized divine reason and internalized

309
00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.510
virtue.
And so this is why,

310
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:32.630
at least I think this is why Milton has stirred to introduce into his narrative

311
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:36.680
this irritable arch Angel Michael.
And,

312
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:41.010
and this is why Milton stages this scene of angelics instruction so differently

313
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:45.250
from the way he staged the scene with Raffia oil.
Um,
and just,

314
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.280
I only need to mention eves role in all of this.

315
00:20:48.281 --> 00:20:50.350
You'll even will remember decided on her own.

316
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.180
She decided on her own not to stick around for RAF lessons in astronomy.

317
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.750
She just as soon learn it,
she told us,
oh,

318
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.980
she just as soon learn it later from Adam,

319
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.360
who's pedagogy was a little more interesting than ELLs because Adam interspersed

320
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.010
his lessons with kisses.

321
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.900
That was Eve's choice and Milton goes out of his way to represent that as Eve's

322
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:15.250
choice.
But,
but after the fall,
eve is not given that choice.

323
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.800
She's forced to UB sent herself here and Adam who,

324
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.600
who gets to stay.
It's not clear that that's

325
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.630
what kind of privilege that is.

326
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.200
It Adam is subjected to the severity of Michael's teaching on some level because

327
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:36.751
he can't be trusted to behave as a rational self governing individual after the

328
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.021
fall.

329
00:21:38.021 --> 00:21:43.021
Someone is going to have to teach him and in fact teach him quite forcefully how

330
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:49.210
to understand life in the fallen world.
And so Michael enters the,

331
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.880
enters onto the scene and he instills in Adam,

332
00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:57.580
I think this is his goal,
at least to instill an atom,

333
00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:02.320
the powers of reason and virtue.
And he does this by means of a history lesson,

334
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:05.860
something that before the fall,

335
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.370
Adam seems to have possessed instinctively or at least a kind of reason and

336
00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:13.210
virtue that he possessed instinctively.
But now it needs to be instilled.

337
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.200
So Michael Presents Adam with the sweep of Christian history and with the

338
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:21.490
promise of Man's eventual redemption from,
from the fall.

339
00:22:21.491 --> 00:22:26.491
And it's this entire lesson that Adam is going to have to internalize,

340
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:32.290
literally take into himself.
And the last two,

341
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.270
the last two books,
a paradise like Allston,

342
00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.970
I think in a lot of ways represent something like a drama of internalization.
Uh,

343
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.270
one of the important aspects of these books is what they have to tell us.

344
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:47.290
I think about the complicated psychological process of,

345
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.890
of the internalization,
of any kind of authoritative wisdom.

346
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.510
So we're finally now in a position to actually look at the poem.
Um,

347
00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.770
look at page four 42 in the Hughes.

348
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.940
This is a book 11 line four 11.

349
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.270
Michael history 11 a history lesson is,
uh,
is really quite extraordinarily,

350
00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:12.580
carefully organized and it's,
it's,

351
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:17.440
it's broken up into d into two discrete sections,
books 11 and 12.

352
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:21.500
And these two discrete sections proceed along,
uh,

353
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.380
along entirely distinct line.

354
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.740
So the first half of the lesson which takes us up to the moment of God's

355
00:23:26.741 --> 00:23:31.120
destruction of the world with Noah's flood,
um,
is presented to Adam as a,

356
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:36.380
as a vision.
And Adam sees this,
uh,

357
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.800
early history unfold itself.

358
00:23:38.801 --> 00:23:43.000
This is something that comes to him through the,
through the access of his eyes.

359
00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.190
Now,
the second half of the lesson lesson,

360
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.620
which is the entirety of the lesson as it exists in book 12,

361
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.100
is not presented to Adam visually at all.
Mike Lee,

362
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:55.160
since Michael simply describes it to Adam,

363
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:59.510
he relates it in the form of a narrative.
And this,
this shift from,

364
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.770
from vision to narrative has everything I think to do with the psychological

365
00:24:03.771 --> 00:24:08.771
process of internalization that Milton is exploring in the last books in it.

366
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:13.220
I think it has everything to do as well with the shift in literary style too,

367
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:15.110
which Milton subjects,

368
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:20.380
the ending of his great epic that turn to the new style of books 11 and 12 is in

369
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:25.940
a lot of ways analogous to Michael's turn to d too,

370
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:27.890
didactic narrative in book 12,

371
00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:32.891
after the Grand Tableau's after the all the visual splendor that he has

372
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:37.610
conjured,
um,
in,
in the,
in the visions,
the masks,

373
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:39.770
the,
uh,
the Tablo Vivo,

374
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:43.130
essentially that Michael presents to Adam and book 11.

375
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.110
And this new style is geared even more intensely toward the project of

376
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:48.950
internalization.

377
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:53.951
It places a greater and greater burden on Adam and certainly on the reader to

378
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:57.640
ascertain its significance.
Um,

379
00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.000
so traditionally the truths of history could actually be seen,

380
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:05.720
but eventually by the time we get to book 12,
they can only be heard.

381
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.800
Adam has to become increasingly active in,
in his own education.

382
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.470
So,
um,

383
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.300
so let's look at the first.
Uh,
let's look first at the visionary aspect of,

384
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.440
of book 11.
I don't know what to do with this passage.
This is line for 11.

385
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:28.580
Michael Leads Adam them to the top of the highest hill paradise a hill.

386
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.210
So Hi,
um,

387
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.780
explained this to me that Adam can see the location of every great western city

388
00:25:35.781 --> 00:25:39.620
that will come to establish itself in,
in,
in future years.
Um,

389
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.550
but simply seeing all of these locations isn't sufficient.

390
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.940
Michael's pedagogy has to be more thoroughgoing even than that.

391
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.530
And so we inspires Adam to see the actual scenes of history unfold themselves

392
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:56.030
before his eyes.
So this is what,
this is what we're told at line four 11,

393
00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.370
but to nobler sites,
Michael From Adam's eyes,
the film removed,

394
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.670
which that false fruit that promised clearer site had bread then purged.

395
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:13.750
Michael having purged Adam's eyes with you for and rue the visual nerve for he

396
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:19.670
had much to see.
And from the well of life three drops instilled so deep,

397
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:24.671
the power of these ingredients pierced even to the inmost seat of mental site

398
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:30.220
that Adam now in forced to close his eyes sunk down and all his spirits became

399
00:26:31.521 --> 00:26:33.890
entranced.
There's,

400
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.690
there's something about the ophthalmological specificity about this passage that

401
00:26:38.691 --> 00:26:39.720
really gets me,
um,

402
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.760
of this account of what Milton is telling us was actually done to Adams eyes in

403
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:49.590
order to allow him to see the unfolding of Christian history.

404
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:54.060
The ingestion of the forbidden fruit seems to have weakened his eyesight.

405
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.073
And so the new,

406
00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:00.170
the new film that has come to cover over Adam's eyes has to be purged with these

407
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.490
herbs.
You frizzy and room and Michael goes even further than that than that.

408
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:10.170
And ads for good measure three drops from the well of life in order to permit

409
00:27:10.171 --> 00:27:14.370
Adam to see in his mind's eye sights impossible even before the fall,

410
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.950
that this scene of inspiration,
I think it's strange,

411
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.920
but it of course it has a powerful charge for us,

412
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:25.980
not not least because for so much of the poem,

413
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.340
the poet himself has claimed to be inspired and his composition of the poem,

414
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.100
and we know this,
Milton Milton was blind and he was convinced at something,

415
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.900
or at least this is the,

416
00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:44.901
this is the William Kerrigan argument that I exfoliated for you all.

417
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.620
He was convinced that something that he had eaten,
had,
had,

418
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.850
had on some level been responsible,
um,

419
00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.160
for the vapper Russ film that seemed to have covered his eyes and the invocation

420
00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:01.080
to book three.
You'll remember Milton bids,

421
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:05.790
the Muse Urania to purge him of that film,

422
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:11.450
all missed from thence purge and disperse that I may see and tell of things

423
00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:13.110
invisible to mortals site.

424
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.420
And Nelson's clearly drawing a connection here between his own inspiration to

425
00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:22.950
write paradise lost in Adam's preparation to witness the vision that is future

426
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:27.420
Christian history.
That much I think is that much is clear.
But what,

427
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.020
what exactly does this,
does this connection mean?

428
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:35.460
What is the relation between Michael's vision and book 11 and the inspired epic

429
00:28:35.461 --> 00:28:39.480
poem that Urania the Heavenly Muse,
the heavenly spirit,

430
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:42.400
whatever we're supposed to call that entity that,

431
00:28:42.401 --> 00:28:45.870
that this entity helps Milton to right there.
The relation,

432
00:28:45.871 --> 00:28:49.650
I think I welcome other possibilities,

433
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:54.360
but I think the relations seems to be something like an ironic one and that

434
00:28:54.361 --> 00:28:58.550
irony is suggested,
I think by the weird chemical exactitude of,

435
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.010
of Milton's description of,
of Adam's inspiration.

436
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.040
We have an actual scene of medically induced inspiration at the very moment that

437
00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:13.851
the inspiration of the poem itself seems to have been lost.

438
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.780
That comes to a stop.
The,
the loss of innocence that has brought with it,

439
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.440
the loss of Milton's or what I think we were associating with and identifying as

440
00:29:26.011 --> 00:29:30.300
Milton's inspired poetry and Milton carefully crafts his account.

441
00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:33.840
I think of this,
this vision of poetry in a,
in a,

442
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:38.490
in a poetic style that can only with great difficulty be described as,

443
00:29:38.491 --> 00:29:42.850
as inspired.
Um,
it's,
this is these,

444
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:46.370
these last two books are amazing works of art.
Um,

445
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:50.590
but we don't have anything like that extravagant and dramatic rhetorical

446
00:29:50.591 --> 00:29:54.490
lushness that had so characterized the previous 10 bucks.

447
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.740
What you haven't book 11 is Milton's

448
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:04.380
enact meant in some way of the birth of what we can think of as modern modern

449
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:05.530
poetry,

450
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:10.530
a Po poetry that's been purged of excess and purged of all of that open ended

451
00:30:11.381 --> 00:30:15.390
figuration.
Um,
think of the renaissance,
the,

452
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.040
the literature of Spencer and Shakespeare,

453
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:22.900
the renaissance called the amplitude of it's great writers.
Uh,

454
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.200
copia.
Um,
we,
we,

455
00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.340
we no longer have that Copia here in,
uh,
in the last two books,

456
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:31.270
we have a,

457
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:36.300
a poetics that is given to puritan austerity and simple declarations of moral

458
00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:41.230
facts.
And,
and you will see that the poetic motive paradise regained.

459
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.070
And in fact the poetic mode of a lot of later poets.

460
00:30:45.071 --> 00:30:49.000
I'm thinking of the discursive,
um,
the discursive poetry of a,

461
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:53.560
of a romantic poet like Wordsworth has been heavily influenced by the,

462
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.660
the last two books of paradise lost.

463
00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.830
So Adam has to be chemically induced to see future Christian history because all

464
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:06.700
other inspiration in the poem is no longer is no longer operative.

465
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.640
Um,
Adam has to be compelled,

466
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.740
literally compelled to see how this history unfolds itself in the,
in the,

467
00:31:14.741 --> 00:31:18.880
in the,
in the manner of little pageants and,
and,
and little skits.

468
00:31:18.881 --> 00:31:21.340
He has to see it of course,
because he's,

469
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:26.341
he's not able at this stage in his development to understand it's important

470
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:31.540
through the non visual faculty of,
of,
of imagination.

471
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.340
And I think Milton,
the inspired profit has an incredibly,
uh,

472
00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:40.210
and troublingly complicated relation to Adam at this point.
Adam,

473
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.380
Adam,
who is so uninspired,
um,

474
00:31:45.381 --> 00:31:50.080
in this poem that Milton has claimed to be so overly inspired to write in the

475
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:50.914
first place.

476
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.090
My guess is that the bond buying poet Milton is actually scornful on some level

477
00:31:55.091 --> 00:32:00.091
of the fact that Adam has to be inspired merely to see the events a future of

478
00:32:01.081 --> 00:32:03.670
future years.
Milton zone,
prophetic powers,

479
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.440
presumably entirely transcended the entire category of the visual.

480
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.120
Okay,
let's,
let's move on.
Look at the top of page four 46 and the Hughes.

481
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.970
This is book 11 line five 56.

482
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.210
This is Milton's description of the,

483
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.420
of the cities of the planes that the cities of the plain that Adam sees and the

484
00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:28.150
emphasis is,
is everywhere in this account on,

485
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:32.350
on those things that can be discerned through acts of visual perception.

486
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.270
So line five 56,

487
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:39.320
he looked and saw a spacious plane.
We're on,

488
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:43.700
we're tensive various you buy.
Some were herds of cattle grazing,

489
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:49.010
others whence the sound of instruments that made melodious chime was heard of

490
00:32:49.011 --> 00:32:50.660
harp and Oregon.

491
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.340
And here Milton goes onto describe the player of that organ.

492
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:59.320
This is the first human musician.
Presumably this is the first human artist,
um,

493
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:04.220
uh,
of any kind.
Um,
he hears the Chime,
but also,

494
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.180
uh,

495
00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:10.180
who moved their stops and chords was seen his volunteer touch instinct through

496
00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:11.180
all proportions,

497
00:33:11.181 --> 00:33:15.980
low and high fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.

498
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.910
Now we might reasonably expect that Milton's one and only representation of a

499
00:33:21.921 --> 00:33:24.410
human musician in,
in the poem,

500
00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:28.580
I figure who's artistic touch is a lot like,
like,

501
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.090
like Milton's instinct through all proportions,
low and high.

502
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.230
We might expect that this would appear in a favorable context.
How,

503
00:33:36.231 --> 00:33:37.064
why would we not?

504
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.870
But as in so many other instances throughout these final books,

505
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.950
Milton who has so absolutely become our stereotype of him as the,

506
00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.360
he's the humorless Puritan,
um,
he's,
Milton is turning on,

507
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:55.361
he's really betraying the very art of sound that that constitutes one of his

508
00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:59.000
poems,
greatest achievements.
Um,
there,
there,

509
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:03.650
there has to be something self wounding here in this derogation of,

510
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.400
of,
of music.
And I don't care that it's fallen music.
Nonetheless.

511
00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:10.790
This is beautiful music that Milton knows that he's representing here.

512
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.393
Uh,

513
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.210
but the beautiful music of the organism nonetheless inextricably linked to the

514
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:17.601
fall,

515
00:34:17.601 --> 00:34:22.601
the organists fingers flee and pursue the resonant few just as Adam and Eve will

516
00:34:23.391 --> 00:34:28.391
soon be fleeing paradise pursued of course by a band of armed Cherubim.

517
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.540
Like the beautiful sounds that are heard.

518
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:36.930
Beautiful sites that are seen are necessarily,
um,

519
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.820
unvarying Lee suspect in these books.

520
00:34:40.821 --> 00:34:44.030
It's really not until books 11 and 12 that we get the full sense of just how

521
00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:48.170
much of a,
uh,
of a,
of a surly Puritan Milton has,
has,

522
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.540
has become just how much of the suspiciousness,
the,

523
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:57.110
the general suspiciousness that the puritans had of the whole aesthetic
category,

524
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.970
how much of that he has adopted for himself.
Um,
look,
look down at line five 80,

525
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:08.050
these men on the cities of the plain long had not walked when from the tents.

526
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:14.021
Behold a bevy of fair women richly gay and gems and wanton dress to the harp.

527
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:19.901
They Sung soft amorous ditties and in dance love this phrase.

528
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:25.640
And I don't really know if it meant then what it means.
Now I'm to the harp.

529
00:35:25.641 --> 00:35:30.641
They Sung Soft Amaris ditties and in dance came on and that wonderful,

530
00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:31.670
uh,

531
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:36.670
the men though grave I them and let their eyes Rove rain till in their amorous

532
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:44.871
net fast caught they liked and each his liking chose.

533
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.680
So the faculty is a perception here are nothing more than the vehicles of,

534
00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.000
of deception.

535
00:35:51.001 --> 00:35:55.890
They're implicated in this endless replaying of the sexual seduction that is now

536
00:35:55.891 --> 00:36:00.170
viewed mistakenly of course as the cause of the fall.
Um,

537
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.880
well,
uh,
dopey Adam here is still at an early stage in,

538
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.570
uh,

539
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:11.570
Michael's achingly long lesson in history and of course Adam thinks that things

540
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:16.160
with his descendants are starting to look pretty good.
Um,

541
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:20.460
and so that's what he tells Michael that the uh,
the top of page four 47,

542
00:36:20.461 --> 00:36:24.990
this is line five 98
true opener of mine,

543
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:29.991
eyes prime angel blessed much better seems this vision and more hope of peaceful

544
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:34.440
days,
poor ten's.
Then those two passed.

545
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.140
And as so often,
and this is a,

546
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.890
is a pattern that will repeat itself until the book is done.

547
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:46.110
Adam has completely missed the point of Michael's lesson.

548
00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:50.580
He mistakes the,
the pleasant appearance of this scene with,

549
00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:53.580
with moral rectitude itself.
And so when Adam tells Michael Much better,

550
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.030
much better scenes,
this vision,
he's,

551
00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:00.250
he's really no better than the men who live on the plane,
um,

552
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:05.460
who are eyeing the bevy of fair women and letting their eyes Rove without rain.

553
00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.200
And it's the fact that this beauty is apprehended solely through the eyes,

554
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:12.240
solely through the,
the,
the senses.

555
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:15.960
That of course is that the lies at the heart of the danger here.

556
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:21.110
Adam has to learn to exercise his reason and this is one of the things that

557
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:24.330
Michael gets him to perform eventually.

558
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:30.120
So all things beautiful are by definition here suspect and this is one of the

559
00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:35.121
lessons derived from I think the most elaborate of all of the classes that

560
00:37:35.731 --> 00:37:39.510
Michael Offers Adam.
And that's the,
the history of the great flood.

561
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:45.300
Look at page four 52.
This is line eight 26.
This,

562
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:48.720
this story is so important that it's one that's actually narrated twice.

563
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.320
We have first the narrator's description,
um,

564
00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:57.960
of the prophetic reenactment of the flood or it's like a,

565
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.770
not a reenactment of pre enactment because it actually hasn't happened yet.

566
00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.360
This is the version that Adam actually sees and,
and then second,

567
00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:11.361
we have Michael's long play by play accounting to Adam of what it,

568
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:14.280
what it is exactly that he has just seen

569
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:18.360
a line eight 26 of book 11.
This is the,

570
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:21.570
this is the narrated section of the story of the flood.

571
00:38:21.571 --> 00:38:26.571
Michael Ism is describing for Adam the terrible rain that will undo all of the

572
00:38:26.851 --> 00:38:28.350
work of the earth's creation.

573
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:35.150
All fountains of the deep broke up shell heave the ocean to USERP beyond all

574
00:38:35.471 --> 00:38:37.570
bounds till inundation.

575
00:38:37.571 --> 00:38:42.571
Rise above the highest hills then shall vis mount of paradise by might've waves

576
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:47.210
be moved out of his place,
pushed by the Horn,

577
00:38:47.211 --> 00:38:52.211
had flood with all his verger spoiled and trees a drift down the great river to

578
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:59.071
the opening Gulf and there take root and island salt and bear

579
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:04.923
this line,

580
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:11.040
the haunt of seals and orcs and see muse clang,

581
00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:15.600
the haunt of seals and orcs and see muse clang.

582
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.190
Michael's describing the effect of of the flood on Eden [inaudible].

583
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:24.140
This is the amount of paradise which like all other things will be moved out of

584
00:39:24.141 --> 00:39:28.430
its place by the flood and washed into the open and Gulf of,

585
00:39:28.431 --> 00:39:30.470
of the open of the ocean.

586
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:36.670
Now this particular image teaches us a lot more than the simple then simply the

587
00:39:36.801 --> 00:39:40.910
extent of this mighty flood that the point here is the ultimate insignificance

588
00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:44.090
of all,
all tangible things,
anythings,

589
00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:49.040
anything whose beauty we had been appreciating by,
by,
by the,
by the,

590
00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:52.810
by our senses,
Adam has been permitted by,

591
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.210
by an extraordinary administration of magic eye drops.

592
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:01.040
He's been permitted to see a scene of future history.
Whose point is the vanity,

593
00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:05.720
the emptiness of all those things that that can be seen.

594
00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.580
And the,
the,
the lesson is the lesson is absolutely devastating.

595
00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:14.870
The Garden of Paradise,
who's lush vegetation,

596
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:16.400
who's wandering rivers.

597
00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:21.640
We have had described for us in such powerfully visual terms and in such

598
00:40:23.031 --> 00:40:25.040
powerfully seductive verse,

599
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.720
this garden will one day be pulled into the sea where it will take root and

600
00:40:29.721 --> 00:40:34.721
island salt and bear the haunt of seals and orcs and see muse clang and,

601
00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.520
and,
and the effect.

602
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:42.530
The effect here is not simply on our visual memory of the vegetative splendor of

603
00:40:42.531 --> 00:40:45.500
Milton's paradise.
Nielsen's assaulting as well.

604
00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:50.150
Our oral memory of,
of the sounds of paradise,

605
00:40:50.151 --> 00:40:55.151
our memory of the beauty of the poetic verse that had produced in us,

606
00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:57.620
our visual sense of the,

607
00:40:57.621 --> 00:41:01.550
of the gorgeousness of the garden of Eden in the repressive puritan regime of

608
00:41:01.551 --> 00:41:02.450
the last two books,

609
00:41:02.451 --> 00:41:07.451
the Resonant Oregon tones of the poems earlier books also has to be,

610
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:12.320
they also have to be washed away.
And so in that amazing line,

611
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:16.010
the haunt of seals and orcs and see muse clang.

612
00:41:16.011 --> 00:41:18.320
Milton creates an anemone,
anemone,

613
00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.590
Amo poetic line on a Mo.

614
00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

615
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:29.990
<v 0>It's automotive
and automotive poetic line.</v>

616
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:31.850
Um,
what does it do?

617
00:41:31.851 --> 00:41:36.230
It actually that with a kind of strident horror.
The,
the,

618
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:41.000
the squawking horrible sounds of of these sea creatures.

619
00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:41.973
The,
the,
it,
it,

620
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:47.070
it offers us a sonic emblem of the general stridency I think of the concluding

621
00:41:47.331 --> 00:41:52.331
books that the uncompromising tone of severity that instructs us not to over

622
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:58.610
value the lush beauty of the,
of the previous books,

623
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:00.830
not to overvalue the beauty of paradise,

624
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.360
but also not to overvalue the beauty of the poetry of,

625
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:09.110
of paradise lost.
So Adam question,
uh,

626
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:17.140
well,
a question,
uh,
presents itself at this point and it's one that we have to,

627
00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.700
when that I think is,
is inescapable,

628
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.780
why does even have to be destroyed at all?

629
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:30.190
Why is it washed away in Noah's flood?
We ask,
um,

630
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:37.720
the paradise that was lost,
it turns out,
wasn't the significant one.

631
00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:42.800
This is an incredibly important part of mill Michael's lesson.
Look,
um,

632
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.630
look at how Michael explains this.
Atlanta eight 36.

633
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.940
<v 0>Paradise is destroyed.
He's talking to Adam.</v>

635
00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:55.790
Paradise is destroyed to teach the,

636
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.410
that God attributes to place snow sanctity.
If none,
if none,

637
00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:04.190
be that they're brought by men who their frequent or they're in dwell.

638
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.000
Now think of what Michael has just said.

639
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:12.590
The Garden of Eden will become an island salt and bear at least a thousand years

640
00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.230
after the moment that Michael is currently relating.

641
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:20.231
This prophecy to Adam Eden will be destroyed in order to teach Adam in order to

642
00:43:23.511 --> 00:43:27.710
teach Adam at this very moment in the present time that places aren't divine,

643
00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:29.480
only the people that live in them.

644
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:35.230
This is an extraordinarily bizarre temporal disjunction that we have here at

645
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.600
Paradise.
Isn't going to be destroyed for another millennium or so,
um,

646
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.680
and in the time of Noah,
but it will be,

647
00:43:42.681 --> 00:43:47.681
it will be destroyed in order to make good on Michael's prophecy

648
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.140
of its destruction,

649
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:55.640
paradise has to be destroyed so that Michael's prophecy of that event can have

650
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:59.180
its proper pedagogical effect on Adam.

651
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:02.750
Now in the present moment of the narration,
Michael Attempts,

652
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:08.140
it's an amazing way to compel the internalization of paradise by forcing Adam to

653
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:12.410
confront it's real life destruction.

654
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.680
Now at the conclusion of these lessons in history,

655
00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.600
this is near the end of book 12.
This is page four,
67,
line five 85.

656
00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.330
Michael States in a much more formal terms,

657
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:28.370
just this lesson of internalization.
Um,
so having listened to,

658
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:32.910
uh,
having listened to my history,
Michael Tells Adam then we'll,

659
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:35.550
they'll not be loath to leave this paradise,

660
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.510
but shall possess a paradise within the happier farm.

661
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.980
Once Adam pictures the terrible destruction of,
of paradise,

662
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:48.510
he'll come to understand that an internalized paradise is superior and it's a

663
00:44:48.511 --> 00:44:52.470
happy compensation for the last place of,

664
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.580
of Eden and,
and,
and readers.
And Milton then certainly,
uh,

665
00:44:56.581 --> 00:45:00.210
scholars of Milton have taken Michael at his word when he tells Adam that the

666
00:45:00.211 --> 00:45:03.510
paradise that dwells within,
we'll be happy,
happier,

667
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:05.240
far than the,

668
00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:08.820
than the paradise in which he himself is currently dwelling.

669
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.100
And we'll soon of course before still eve.

670
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:16.670
And there's an important sense in which we have to see the inward paradise as,

671
00:45:17.071 --> 00:45:20.520
as the greater and more consequential miltonic phenomenon as a radical

672
00:45:20.521 --> 00:45:23.990
Protestant,
Milton had always insisted on the superiority of,

673
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.070
of inward human reason.
And,
uh,

674
00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:30.960
of the inward spirit over anything like the visual splendor of churches or the

675
00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:34.920
sanctity of so called holy places or the written codes for that matter of the

676
00:45:34.921 --> 00:45:39.030
written codes of church doctrine from a doctrinal point of view.

677
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.360
There's no question Michael is beyond reproach here,

678
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:47.130
but I still want to apply because this is what I do.

679
00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.450
I still want to apply a little bit of a,
of skepticism to this,

680
00:45:51.451 --> 00:45:53.570
to this little bit of dogma.
Um,

681
00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.000
how convincing is Michael here?

682
00:45:57.001 --> 00:46:00.700
Does our learning in one line that the paradise within us is actually happier

683
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.200
far?
Does it really undo our investment,

684
00:46:04.201 --> 00:46:08.580
the reader's investment in this place,
this,
this paradise,

685
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.900
which has been so lovingly and so beautifully described and that thousands of

686
00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:17.580
lines that that proceeded it when Michael describes the seals and orcs and see

687
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:20.670
muse clang that will literally take over the place of paradise.

688
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.530
Can we help it look back
with regret at the,

689
00:46:25.531 --> 00:46:30.360
at the liberal beauties of this poem before this strident,
Archangel,

690
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:32.160
um,
had taken it over,

691
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:37.010
essentially taken the poem into receivership with his unyielding dogmatism,

692
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:42.420
a fee from the aesthetic point of view.
I think Milton's,
no,

693
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.820
Michael's discourse is,

694
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:49.050
is it complete disaster and we experience it as a form of loss.

695
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:53.640
And Milton compels us as readers,
I think to experience along with Adam and eve,

696
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.220
something like the loss of paradise.

697
00:46:56.370 --> 00:47:01.370
We're compelled to undergo the loss of what we loved about paradise lost.

698
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:06.480
We are compelled to undergo the aesthetic fall that is taken by this very poem.

699
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:07.261
This is,

700
00:47:07.261 --> 00:47:11.790
this is I think Milton's way of precipitating our internalization of his poem.

701
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:15.030
So as I mentioned earlier in the late 1650s,

702
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:19.440
Milton was no longer able to justify the extension of Polish political liberties

703
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:24.120
to the people the English people had.
To his mind they had,

704
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.950
they had fallen and Milton could no longer imagine.

705
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:31.930
Imagine granting the kind of the freedom of self determination that he had

706
00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:32.441
described.

707
00:47:32.441 --> 00:47:37.441
So rhapsodically in a treatise like [inaudible] and you can see a related

708
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:40.180
sensibility of,

709
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.600
of a hardening of sensibility really in the last books of paradise lost the

710
00:47:46.061 --> 00:47:49.360
fallen reader,
the fallen poet.
Um,

711
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:55.050
we can no longer afford the moral and theological uncertainty that had been

712
00:47:55.271 --> 00:48:00.271
fostered and really celebrated by the sublime poetic style that we can now call

713
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.420
now that it's gone,
we can now call miltonic.

714
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.380
It's as if we can no longer afford the indulgence and all of those stylistic

715
00:48:08.381 --> 00:48:13.381
elements of the earlier books that have been so carefully purged from Michael's

716
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:17.680
lessons in history.
It's as if we can't afford to indulge in the,
those,
uh,
those,

717
00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.500
those ethically ambiguous similes,

718
00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:23.590
the delectable illusions to the full range of,

719
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:28.210
of pagan classics though those extraordinary flights of the poems of the poets

720
00:48:28.211 --> 00:48:29.530
own original myth making,

721
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:32.840
all of those elements that have made this poem so grand.
Um,

722
00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.070
but that have continually,
as we've charted,

723
00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:40.960
continually threatened to unhinge the story from anything like its basis in,

724
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:45.961
in moral doctrine or scriptural certainty that the poetic effect that we have

725
00:48:47.681 --> 00:48:50.350
here is primarily one of,
of loss.

726
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:53.460
And it's a type of loss that we've encountered before in Milton.
And I'm,

727
00:48:53.461 --> 00:48:56.500
I'm just about,
I'm just about at my conclusion,

728
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.580
but I want to remind you of Milton's first,
first poem.

729
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.630
His first great poem,
the Naitivity out of 1629 Milton,

730
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:09.550
you'll remember had described the triumphant entry of Christ and his and his

731
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.320
destruction of all of the evil pagan gods and the onset of the Christian era

732
00:49:14.321 --> 00:49:16.810
was,
was,
was celebrated as a joyous one.

733
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:21.460
But of course it brought with it a loss that Milton at that time was willing to

734
00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:23.350
measure the pagan nymphs.

735
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:28.351
You'll remember they felt the pain of their banishment from the beautiful

736
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:34.081
forests of classical literature with flour in woven tresses torn the nymphs in

737
00:49:36.011 --> 00:49:38.290
twilight shade of tangled thickets.

738
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:43.650
Mourn that that poem of religious celebration made a brief,

739
00:49:43.811 --> 00:49:46.480
but it was a potent detour into log.

740
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.980
And Milton seemed almost to recognize the painfulness of the loss of classical

741
00:49:50.981 --> 00:49:55.840
literature and lots of the poetic beauty with which we associate a classical

742
00:49:55.841 --> 00:49:56.674
literature.

743
00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:01.720
And I think there's a related sense of loss that attends the otherwise

744
00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:04.870
triumphant conclusion of Milton's,
uh,

745
00:50:04.871 --> 00:50:08.830
of the theological doctrine that Michael presents.
It that at the end of book 12,

746
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:14.170
uh,
on the,
on the,
um,
on the dock trinal level,
Michael does end on a,

747
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:17.830
on a painfully optimistic note.
I know that's an oxymoron,

748
00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.610
but it's still brings me pain,
uh,

749
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:24.100
this the way in which he represents the promise of Man's eventual redemption.

750
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:28.400
But on an aesthetic level,
you have almost the plan.
GNC,

751
00:50:28.401 --> 00:50:29.600
I think of LG,

752
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:34.990
a sad consciousness of all of those pleasures and all of those liberties that

753
00:50:35.481 --> 00:50:39.690
now have to be forsaken.
Okay.
I'm ending the lecture there.
Um,

754
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.390
but I just want to to,

755
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.260
to remind you that that of course is not the end of the story.

756
00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:48.350
That poem will change a final time,
uh,

757
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:51.800
once again in its last hundred lines or so.
Um,

758
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:55.910
you will have the reemergence of a lot of things that we associate with Milton.

759
00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.630
Um,
and certainly we'll have the reemergence of the epic Simile,

760
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.420
which will pay attention to closely on Wednesday.

761
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:07.340
So focus for the next class.
On the poem's ending.
